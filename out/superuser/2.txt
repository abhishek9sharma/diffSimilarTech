sudo isn t going to understand an ssh passwd

164080

164800
move	drag
i have all the apps jiggling and drag one game app on top of another game app - they move to be side by side and the title automatically reads games - is this ok to do - you can have nine apps in each of the 16 spaces available on each screen

disk	ram
to me ram and disk space are cheap and realistically even when i accidentally hit all those stupid commands that flood the screen a year s worth of my work on the terminal is still mere megabytes and the benefits of logging it all are many compared to how trivial it would be

164917
folder	directory
most 3rd party bundled amp stack apps especially unix-based os builds mac linux in order to have the stack components within the same directory structure as the app root directory they have to compile each component with specific directives and arguments which ultimately kind of hard-wires some of the folder references and binary signatures into each of the component builds themselves....specifically the mysql and php components because they have library objects that are both shared and required to be specifically referenced and included during the source compile.

it doesn t seem to be any different using opera or firefox google-chrome just crashes the moment she tries to run it

166051
disk	ram
below 512mb the os will be using swap space but in a vm environment reading back from swap may be an operation that reads the data from the hosts cache rather then the physical disk and if you have the optimise for speed rather than optimise for safety option on writing to swap will be buffered too so you can get away with giving the vm less ram such as the 256mb you quote as long as you are fine with it possible being slow for a short while when you go to use it for the first time after some hours away as any info from the vm will in that case most likely have been replaced in the cache by more recently used bits of your filesystems

167083
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu kubuntu lubuntu are all based on debian the distribution i favor for my servers

167083

for development machines i also would recommend ubuntu because i like debian and you get early updates through the shorter release cycle

167084
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux for human beings is the best distribution to start

167085

167138
folder	directory
put the color-theme directory in the emacs_site_lisp folder

167140
udp	tcp
it does so by mapping each internal private ip address to the public ip address and a specific port as usually defined in the tcp or udp protocols

167140
udp	tcp
the computers at each end are talking only to the router with the public ip which then keeps track of where to forward the traffic on the private network based on the incoming port from a higher level protocol tcp or udp

167142
cpu	processors
first most multi-core processors have some resources shared between the cores cpu cache

167185
instances	transient
for instances it could be set to consume 57 of available cpu time to slow down some other application sufficiently but not too much in order to acquire a screenshot of a transient phenomenon

167231
folder	directory
alternatively if you don t want to refer to the folder somewhere by its real name you could create a hidden directory that contains a symbolic link to user something somefolders somewhere with the name you want to use

ubuntu	debian
how can i make debian encrypt and decrypt my home folder when i log in out like ubuntu does

167406
tunnel	vpn
the biggest problem is that the vpn server must have been configured to allow split tunnel

167406
tunnel	vpn
second you can attempt to configure according to the cisco article configuring cisco vpn client 3.5 and the cisco integrated client to secure nonencrypted traffic while using split tunnel

167406
tunnel	vpn
the cisco vpn client creates a tunnel which can be voluntary or compulsory

167406
tunnel	vpn
the type of the tunnel is dictated by the administrator of the vpn server to which you connect

167406
tunnel	lan
the compulsory tunnel will cut off all access to any external computer including the lan and is what i called the sandbox

167406
tunnel	vpn
vpn tunnel - safe passage for data

167701

167718
fink	macports

167720
vpn	lan
you almost certainly must use a vpn to connect to your work lan

167720
vpn	lan
once you establish a vpn connection if you do an ipconfig all does one of the lines contain an ip address similar to that of your work lan

167720
vpn	lan
in otherwords if you home lan is 192.168.0.x and your work lan is 172.18.1.x if you run ipconfig after running the vpn do you have a 172.18.1.x address on your computer

167737

ubuntu	linux
i m looking for windows 7 macos and ubuntu linux equivalents of express archiver for windows xp that archived outlook express emails to individual files

168215
disk	ram
if the write speed of the dest dirs are very different one is on a ram disk and the other on nfs then you may see that the parts of srcdir read while copying srcdir to dest1 is no longer in the disk cache when writing dest2

168235
hfs+	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+
it was said that nowadays common filesystems such as ntfs and hfs+ use a journaling mechanism so that when power is cut out or if there is a power outage the hard drive is still in good shape and no scan disk is needed to restore integrity of the hard disk

168253
google-chrome	firefox
i know i can use c-c c-l but how suited is it really for taking notes on stuff i am browsing in google-chrome firefox

hfs+ zfs and btrfs are examples for real journaling filesystems

168281
filesystems	fat
so they are usually formatted as fat as this filesystems is readable on all major operating systems

168281
filesystems	ntfs
if you specifically want to use a journaling filesystems on a removable drive i am not counting ntfs see point 1 you can easily reformat it as daniel bingham pointed out

168311
mouse	keyboard
i know there s probably more detail differences that i m not seeing like hardware expandability additional features look and feel mouse track pad and keyboard and screen types

168491
disk	ram
aside from cpu cores and ram also be sure to buy as many disk as you can four vms spread across four small disk perform dramatically better than the same four vms residing on a single big one

168492
debian	linux	xen	openvz
however i m not a fan of pre-packaged solutions so i found proxmox which sits right on top of a stock debian linux install and has openvz as well as xen support via a custom kernel pretty slick actually

168493

168751
ubuntu	linux
and it seemed to install all the files just like using unzip did on my linux ubuntu machine

168813
processors	hyperthreading
note that some intel processors the i5 included use hyperthreading a system where a single processors has for example 2 physical cores but will provide 4 logical cores - allowing the operating system to treat the processors as having more cores than it really does

debian	linux
my router a debian linux box is connected to a he.net 6in4 and can ping and access ipv6 sites ipv6.google.com fine

btw i am running on linux ubuntu 10.0.4

169991
bash	zsh
i set my terminal to open using zsh instead of bash and it works for a week or so and then it switches back to bash

169998
kate	gedit
for gui gedit and kate are two good choices though i doubt they fit the lightweight category

170033
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
most shells tcsh bash zsh but not csh increment the shlvl environment variable when they start so that indicates the level of nesting of your current shell

170044
mouse	trackpad
the trackpad uses bluetooth and will pair with windows 7 without specific drivers appears as an hid-compliant mouse but all it will do is point and left click physical click no touch tap

170050
hfs+	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+
the hfs+ filesystems is journaled which helps prevent file corruption does not need to be defragmented like ntfs

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
images displayed in google-chrome for mac 5.0.375.99 appear washed out in comparison with images displayed in mozilla firefox 3.6 or apple safari 5

170087
google-chrome	safari
there is a script i use that sets up virtual hosts for me and then opens up the url using safari however i m trying to change the script so it opens up in google-chrome instead

170105
put	get
also the old laptop has ubuntu on it but i could never get itâ s internet sharing to work with windows and since xppros worked i put that research off

170105
ethernet	wireless
needs internet sharing compatible with wan input on a typical wireless router wifi - ethernet

170121
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
google-chrome doesn t currently support embedded icc colour profiles unlike safari or firefox so it s possible there s something going on there

170122
rar	zip
i m running on a windows 7 computer and there is a directory that contains more than 10 000 compressed files rar zip with more added on a daily basis

170168
mouse	keyboard
once i ve logged in sometimes the keyboard doesn t work and the mouse moves but does not let me click on anything

170171
rar	zip
i want to package my application for linux i use zip tar.gz 7z rar to do the compress in windows

170171
rar	zip
the problem is only the tar.gz can let me extract runable files other format zip 7z rar not the file permission is reset to 644

170171
rar	zip
so my question is how to compress my files using zip 7z rar while reset the permission to 755

170198
ubuntu	centos
edit pcs at home use various oses ranging from ubuntu centos fedora to windows xp vista 7

170212
rar	zip
as far as i know zip and rar do not store permissions i guess 7z also doesn t do it on windows

170212
rar	zip
if you absolutely need zip or rar consider using a script that calls chmod after unpacking

170224
versioning	upgrade
due to the way debian based systems manage patches you don t always get a versioning upgrade

170267
freebsd	linux
works at least in freebsd 8.0 and linux but on the other hand one might have to install the acl utilities

170321
debian	linux
i have downloaded linux x86 libc6 for debian but since kubuntu as far as i know is derived from debian from here

170353
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to use my computer using the keyboard exclusively without touching the mouse

170378
ethernet	wireless
the way to establish your own lan environment is to grab a wireless router like the linksys wrt54gl i like that one because it supports 3rd party firmware and configure it as a private wired wireless ethernet network just as you would if you were plugging it into a cable modem

170390
folder	dir
sometimes it just won t let you change permissions because some process is using the file or if you are trying to edit a folder s properties then a process has a file that is within that dir or subdir open

170393
x86	64bit
programs written without explicit 64bit support should work on 64bit windows since programs in the program files x86 directory are emulated

170413
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome won t give you this problem

170460
dpkg	apt
dpkg error processing var cache apt archives mon_0.99.2-13_i386.deb --unpack

170504
google-chrome	firefox
i installed flash debug version 10.1 and it works fine with firefox but it seems that in google-chrome i have only the regular flash version and not the debug version

170529
installation	upgrade
you will either need to use a windows anytime upgrade key or perform a fresh installation

170530
gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux	ubuntu	linux
is it possible to install ubuntu nbr on a harddisk that is currently installed in another linux system gentoo in my case

170530
gentoo	ubuntu
i want to reinstall my media center and home router running ubuntu nbr 9.10 on a harddisk that is currently installed in my desktop pc running gentoo

170571
switching	screens
now when i switching on get his screens which will hang there until i power off

170594
gentoo	ubuntu
you can use either gentoo s partition editor or wait for ubuntu to launch its version during the install

170594
ethernet	wireless
probably best to run live at least once to make sure you can use the stuff you need to use - wireless ethernet usb drives etc

170594
gentoo	ubuntu
if everything goes well grub should allow you to pick either ubuntu or gentoo on bootup

170626
rpm	yum
presto is a plugin which enables delta rpm support in yum

170651
uninstall	upgrade
upgrade you would simply uninstall

170653
x86	64bit
to be sure of x64 64bit or x86 32-bit press windows flag + pause break and take a look at the system type section

170684
mp3	wav
something i can t just hand the mp3 or wav file to click a button twidle my thumbs a bit and voila it s done

170714
put	get
should i just go for a 19 20 inch 4 3 or get a big 24 26 inch widescreen for the same money which can run at 1920x1200 and put it on its side

170714
width	height
i m getting two monitors anyway so as long as i don t lose out on the width the portrait mode height is a plus

170717
mouse	trackpad
i have a magic mouse that i d like to use on windows and mac os x scrolling will not be necessary on windows at least for now since i have this shiny trackpad too

170726
mp3	wav
the short answer to your quest for a one-click remake of a song via mp3 wav no

170735
ubuntu	linux
for example i have my mighty mouse paired with both my macbook running os x and my thinkpad running ubuntu linux

170759
put	get
these are fundamental limitations of the gui windowing infrastructure of mac os x and i doubt anyone will ever put in the effort to get around it

170820
xfce	gnome
in general there is about 40-50mb difference in linuxmint xfce vs gnome edition 120 vs 170

170820
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
linux mint is direct derivative of ubuntu

170820
xfce	gnome
however there was one funny thing which i observed - after enabling compiz visual effects theme - there was a rise in ram consumption around 30-40mb in xfce edition - however there was hardly any increase in gnome edition

170823
versioning	upgrade
i d like to get windows 7 in the mix need to upgrade my versioning of ubuntu anyway and adjust the partitions quite a bit so my current plan is to wipe out the ubuntu partition and shrink xp split what i have in 2 install 7 so bcd will boot windows xp then install ubuntu so that grub will chainload bcd

170866
jobs	cron
the cron jobs will be running on a server running on ubuntu 10.0.4

170875
mouse	keyboard
i can t do anything even mouse and keyboard is not working everything stops

170896
kde	gnome
gnome and kde both seem way too big and unnecessarily fancy for what i want to do with my basic netbook

170900
xfce	gnome
if you are used with gnome xfce will look like a lighter less fancy gnome to you

170903
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
i have tried all of them from lxde through knoppix to kde netbook remix to xfce and gnome through the respective ubuntu remixes

170903
xfce	gnome
the gnome 2.3x environment really is a refined experience and though some of those refinements come with an overhead cost not found in xfce or lxde they are certainly worth it

170956
gedit	nano
so for example i save a file in home user directory filename.txt in gedit and it can be opened in nano

170960
disk	ram
ram disk are usually available automatically on linux as and can be mounted and formatted just like a regular hard-disk

171022
width	height
when i add an image into a microsoft word 2007 document the image takes up 3-times higher width and height than the original

171049
zsh	tcsh
other shells load .profile as well zsh tcsh

vmware	virtualbox
to use in vmware virtualbox and on a

171136
ubuntu	linux
i have an ubuntu 10.04.1 lts linux server which is experiencing some weird issues.

171136
ethernet	wireless
2 ethernet cards connected to two different networks in our office the wired and the wireless network

171137
filesystems	hfs+
to boot mac os from an sd card it needs to have a guid partition table and the os must be installed on a hfs+ filesystems

171151
mouse	keyboard
i have tried all the obvious things like making sure my keyboard and mouse are plugged in i ve tried both ps2 and usb peripherals

171167
disk	ram
i d want to test the ram the cpu and the hard disk

171167
disk	ram
memtest for the ram manufacturer s tool for the hard disk etc

171171
daemons	systemd
these scripts start up the various daemons programs that might be running in the background during normal systemd operation

171171
disk	ram
some distributions start init out of an initial ram disk

171178
ubuntu	linux
try bruning a linux cd of some sort ubuntu perhaps

171189
screens	tablet
usually my wacom bamboo tablet screens area area which cursor can go using tablet is as set - one 1280x1024 monitor

171200
pop-up	dialog
the monitor changes resolution after which a standard dialog box pop-up saying

171200
ethernet	wireless	mouse	keyboard
i ve tried disconnecting the wireless card and disabling the built-in ethernet and firewire via the bios and replacing the wireless keyboard and mouse with wired usb ones

171231
mouse	keyboard
disconnect any hardware you don t need during the install process if you have on board video remove any add in video card disconnect extra hard drives or optical drives card readers usb devices besides keyboard and mouse use wired ones if you have wireless ones ect see if w7 will complete install now

171235
toolbar	tabs
can i open a browser window in internet explorer for a specific website without having any tabs toolbar bookmarks etc

171237
arp	dhcp
some may ask but wouldn t the dhcp transaction have caused an arp mapping to have been created on the router

171237
arp	dhcp
but i ve seen dhcp servers that inject packets at a low level bypassing the usual ip stack thus bypassing the arp code

171275
udp	tcp
enter port range as 5900 in from to boxes for tcp udp protocols in edit application menu and then click add definition

171278
width	height
uncheck term size win size and then you can set the width and height manually

171342
put	get
sell the broken hardware and put the money towards getting something that isn t hp so you get something with better ventilation and actually decent reliability

171349
vmware	virtualbox
however if it is not supported you can try sun virtualbox if you don t want to pay - it offers basic directx and works - but for anything better take a look at either vmware workstation or the free vmware which offers much improved graphics performance

171364
ubuntu	linux
what is the maximum amount of ddr that can be installed in a 64 bit ubuntu linux system computer

171387
subnet	packets
what i would like to do is block outgoing packets to the subnet of the head-office temporarily so that i can safely run my tests without the risk of mistakenly apply changes on production servers

171404
fink	macports
you can also install gedit using macports which builds everything from source or using fink with pre-built binaries

171411
lan	intranet
my windows 7 computer is on lan in an intranet with a windows domain but it is not a member of that domain

171411
put	get
and put in a correct password afterwards i get this kind of error

171448
ubuntu	linux
try the lindows linux distro or ubuntu ultimate gamers edition

171463
ubuntu	linux
boot from a linux live cd like knoppix ubuntu and check if the machine boots fine and is able to locate your drives

171534
folder	directory
i want a list of the folder from the current directory or one that i specify with their size

171537
ethernet	wireless
just to be clear you never try to use wired ethernet and wireless at the same time correct

171537
ethernet	wireless
the situation i was actually thinking of was connecting to two different networks via ethernet wireless

171537
ethernet	wireless
i would still recommend you try turning off the airport and using your macbook via a wired connection for at least long enough to decide if your problem only occurs when using wireless or if it also manifests while using wired ethernet

171558
filesystems	hfs+
if you re up for a little experiment i noticed that the apple boot camp drivers for windows allow reading writing of hfs+ filesystems thus allowing access to your mac s data when booted into windows

171575
folder	directory
will list all directory and files under the current folder with size

171621
pop-up	dialog
1 minute and then a warning dialog pop-up that says

171650
ubuntu	linux
most of the packages available for the linux on router implementations should available for ubuntu

171655
bluetooth	usb
i have a usb bluetooth radio and have used it over xp to connect my jawbone headset to my computer

171666
mouse	keyboard
the mac os x is a sweet thing but---from what i ve gathered so far--- it is intended to be used with the mouse with very little keyboard support as another post mentions above

171666
fink	macports
package management is also simpler than in os x fink macports and all

171685
kde	gnome
basically you are asking about gnome vs kde which is a basically a religious war

171687
kde	gnome
ubuntu is gnome and kubutu is kde

171689
kubuntu	gnome	kde	gnome	kde	kubuntu
i ve always used gnome ubuntu but kde kubuntu looks really tempting right now

171689
kde	gnome
after you do that right before you log in the bar at the bottom of your screen will have the option of going into gnome or kde and you can change every time you log in

171695
versioning	upgrade
also the bios upgrade utility will most likely show you the versioning before giving you the option to upgrade

171704
rss	feed
it sometimes wont pick it up but a router restart usually fixes that you can also add rss feed + your youtube favourites etc

171714
disk	ram
when you activate hybrid sleep they save ram to disk like hibernation but then they enter standby rather than turning off

171714
disk	ram
it s the best of both worlds turning the pc back on is instant but if power is lost then next time the computer is awakened it will restore its ram from disk

171748
xfce	gnome
my personal preference is gnome or xfce

171766
move	drag
whenever i drag a file out of the nautilus window to move it somewhere else as soon as the mouse cursor goes out of the window nautilus closes and the file i was dragging also disappears

171777
vmware	virtualbox
the easier way is the new windows xp installation in the virtualbox but if you need to use your existing installation - use vmware

171819
versioning	upgrade
often when you install new software a dll file that is used by lots of other software packages need to be upgrade to a new versioning

171833
folder	directory
inside this folder i ve made ntfs symlink from one directory to another

171853
disk	ram
if there s less than 10 free space then windows may have trouble because it tries to swap memory to disk since the machine only has 1gb ram

171938
debian	linux
for linux systems please ideally something available through aur or a debian package or both

171952
rar	zip	rar	gzip
the unarchiver can t be beat with zip gzip bzip2 and other archive formats but rar is something it doesn t do as splendidly

171956
button	checkbox
information on things such as hwnd s windows button text edit boxes checkbox radio button you name it are stored here - if you exhaust this you can t create any more windows and thus things stop running

171968
switching	screens
i force rebooted it and now i get a black screens and when i switching to ctr + alt + f2 terminal it prompts me to log in

172016
passwd	visudo	sudoers	visudo	sudoers	passwd
you can use visudo to edit your etc sudoers file and create an entry that allows your username to run shutdown without a passwd

172050
portrait	landscape
i d like to rotate my right hand monitor to portrait mode for coding 1052x2048 while leaving my lefthand monitor landscape

172053
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu ship it as w3m-el

172055
ubuntu	linux
a way to cheat this security is to boot into a live linux ubuntu 10.04

172076
ubuntu	linux
now i want to install ubuntu linux as a second operating system in a different partition

172147
jobs	cron
however this is not necessarily a good idea for example you won t be able to easily test your cron jobs manually

172170
folder	directory
i d like to be able to write to the xampp directory so that i can run php scripts from there rather than my sites user folder

172189
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
if you have homebrew macports or fink they have a package called smartmontools which includes smartctl

172201
post	put
i want to put in the a1400ams3c google it serverfault won t let me post 2 hyperlinks which is supposedly the fastest with the same socket

172209
switching	screens
the desktop works great and i can see that the remote switching between the two views however i don t see my laptop monitor on the main screens

172262
vmware	esx
around vmware esx 3 they redesigned the client using .net

172262
freebsd	linux
vmware s forums are also full of complaints from linux freebsd sysadmins

172266
vim	textmate
i m picking up vim and found 2 plugins that work great - snipmate that mimics the textmate s snippet behavior and supertab that toggles and completes words using the tab key based on exiting words in current other buffers

172270
docx	xlsx	docx	.doc	xlsx	.doc
we re planning to end distribution of office 2003 .doc .xls files and even though a considerable number of users have office 2003 or earlier installed they wil still be able to view and edit not everything docx and xlsx files with the compatibility pack

172279
put	get
just compile the kernel with oss enabled put oss in use flags and programs will get compiled with the oss support enabled

172301
switching	screens
using microsoft remote desktop client in windows 7 in full screens is there another way to switching from the remote machine which captures all input from the keyboard to the local machine aside from using the keyboard combination for toggling full screens of the remote desktop session

172326
debian	linux
i am using tomcat6 in linux debian machine

172328
docx	xlsx
open office can open and edit docx xlsx etc

172376
folder	directory
the files and folder will be hidden from directory listings but are still accessible if you know the name

172393
mouse	keyboard
my only real idea is to somehow use the eee pc as a wireless mouse and keyboard for my pc connecting wirelessly or via bluetooth

172431
mouse	keyboard
it would let you use the keyboard and mouse-pad on your asus as keyb mouse on your media pc

172431
mouse	keyboard
synergy lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard between multiple computers with different operating systems each with its own display without special hardware

172431
mouse	keyboard
redirecting the mouse and keyboard is as simple as moving the mouse off the edge of your screen

172439
industrial	cnc
additionally modern industrial automation equipment such as plcs vfds servo drives and cnc equipment are programmable via rs-232

172443
google-chrome	firefox
as i open firefox google-chrome eclipse zend studio 7.2 etc

172451
google-chrome	firefox
well firefox is huge and has a well-known memory leak i m assuming eclipse is huge as well google-chrome just eats ram etc

172451
google-chrome	firefox
you can solve this by not leaving at least firefox and google-chrome up and using their saved tabs feature instead

172452
put	get
why not get an fast external hard disk that has a esata and a usb connection then put the data on the hard disk

172459
sudo	passwd
if it runs in a terminal even a graphical one i d like it to ask for the passwd using sudo

172462
sudo	passwd
however if you insist on using sudo for only certain parts you can place sudo in your actual bash script and it will prompt for the passwd and wait for entry until it continues executing the script

172462
sudo	passwd
after getting at least one sudo passwd entry all subsequent sudos will retain the elevated privileges and not prompt for the passwd again

172471
bmp	png
the reason this is an issue primarily is because the user is then unable to click save as and has to actually copy and paste it into some other program which means the file is converted from jpg or png to the bmp format

172485
installation	upgrade
additionally when a hard drive fails it takes your data and program installation with it making them in my opinion the riskiest piece of hardware to carry over from build to build as you upgrade your system

172488
rss	feed
rss feed content

172497
wan	lan
my home sever pc win7 home premium connects directly to the internet i shared it s internet connection to one of its ethernet lan cards which is then plugged directly into the wan port on my wifi router using a cross-over network cable

172503

i would like to reduce its height while its width and all its four wooden borders top bottom left right should stay unchanged

172503
photoshop	fireworks
could anyone kindly suggest how this can be done in photoshop fireworks

172508
rss	feed
i have added an rss feed to apple s mail.app

172524
parallels	bootcamp
please tell me if you know how much faster is windows linux on bootcamp than on parallels fusion virtualization software

172524
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu 10.04 for testing and debugging software i develop

172545
put	get
the solution would be to get an dhcp reservation put in place for your computer so that you do not need to use dhcp and then you can use the two ip addresses at the same time

172559
textmate	notepad++
for software development i wouldn t see a big difference though there are many mac varients that are fully native textmate notepad++ eclipse is multiplatform git is multiplatform

vmware	virtualbox	vmware	bootcamp	parallels	bootcamp	virtualbox	parallels	virtualbox	bootcamp
in my experience with both bootcamp and vmware fusion or parallels virtualbox for me it was a convenience issue more than anything so i use vmware fusion on a regular basis

172576
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu 10.04 for testing and

172576
vmware	bootcamp
if you create a bootcamp partition install windows and boot into osx vmware fusion has an option to treat the bootcamp partition as a vm so you could in fact run either native dual boot or virtual machine instance

172630
mouse	keyboard
you can record mouse keyboard actions with xmacro

disk	ram
i want to setup a ram disk for various purposes and among them i would want to set the temp variable to point to a folder in the ram disk

172703
disk	ram
i haven t done this yet but the ram disk will be initialized before logging on and i have a certain problem

172703
disk	ram
if for some reason the ram disk fails to start what will the result be

172711
macports	homebrew
i d recommend using either macports or homebrew at first

172711
macports	homebrew
you create a portfile macports or a formula homebrew allowing for the package management to fetch build install and manage your project

172763
google-chrome	firefox
you could also stop using ie and switch to google-chrome or firefox

172776
google-chrome	firefox
is there any possibility to achieve this in browsers firefox ie google-chrome etc.

172790
temp	tmp
temp and tmp for the current user plus temp and tmp for the system

172813
folder	directory
i would recommend uncompressing all your files since it could be a shared .dll in the windows folder that is causing the issue or otherwise a file not in the directory tree structure for that program

is there a way in windows to prevent an opening application from taking control of the keyboard mouse and displaying on top of other windows

172881

so just to reiterate i would like to be able to open applications behind open windows and not have the application take over keyboard mouse control

172963
cpu	processors
alright well i backed off the multiplier to slow the cpu to 2.8ghz but i m still experience the same problems and the same cpu temps...i hover around 40c for the mobo and the processors

172986
x86	64bit
i m assuming you are asking about the x86 architecture running on 64bit mode

vmware	virtualbox
my macbook pro is generally a fast machine 3.06 ghz core 2 duo 8gb of ram 7200rpm hard drive but virtualbox 3.2.6 running ubuntu 10.04 is just too slow compared to vmware

empty directory folder are annoying but not often a cause for great concern

windows nt includes a ntvdm nt virtual dos machine that emulates a 16-bit dos mode for 32-bit but not 64bit versions

173097
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
you have homebrew macports and fink otherwise there is no default thing like advanced packaging tool apt it is completely up to you it is easier to install programs and things via apt

173125
centos	linux
i have dual boot and additionally i want to be able to run windows 7 that installed directly on hard disk over linux centos 5.5 but my processor doesn t support intel vt hardware virtualization

173133

a good example of this is springtools suite which puts the main application folder in the user s home directory and a working directory in the user s documents directory

173153
cpu	processors
processors was consuming 20w and cpu time graphs from task manager were flat at 100

disk	ram
to get firefox to not stutter i had to move all caching into ram and disable history even just writing the history log to disk froze the system with every webpage

173323
post	get
if you re looking at a page that you ve previously requested using get and post then only the get version is cached

173323
post	get
using the view source command won t re-request the page but will show the cached get version not the currently visible post version if any

173323
post	get
if you re looking at a page that you ve only requested using the post method then using the view source command will cause chrome to look in its cache find nothing request the page using get cache it and show the source of that

unfortunately google-chrome omnibar is not as efficient as firefox awesomebar

173336
google-chrome	firefox
note that there is an issue opened to make google-chrome omnibar as intelligent as firefox awesomebar making it remember the most used keys with associated selected websites example if you constantly type b in firefox awesomebar and selects facebook from it it would make facebook be the first shown website when you press b

filesystems	hfs+
in general you don t need to run any defragmentation tools on a hfs+ filesystems

173464
filesystems	hfs+
hfs+ filesystems - used by mac os - avoids reusing space from deleted files as much as possible to avoid prematurely filling small areas of recently-freed space that causes fragmentation

connection settings ike over tcp force udp encapsulation

173823
vmware	esx
and versions of vmware esx support intel vt and amd-v but some older versions seem to have host guest restrictions regarding 32 vs 64bits - if you re using esx 4 you should be ok otherwise there s a version list of what version support what on the vmware communities site have a look at that and see if the version you intend to run matches up with what guest host systems you intend to run given a 64bit processor

173882
udp	tcp
i m looking for an open source free network emulator tool that i could use on mac os x to simulate a slow network connection limited bandwidth and other network characteristics such as dropped packets etc for both udp tcp connections or even on the physical layer

173885
google-chrome	firefox
i understand that browsers such as google-chrome do not support protocols such as ntlm authentication and there are firefox extensions for it but the whole protocol on it s own is reasonably insecure as it is.

i don t like this for two reasons it prompts for the sudo passwd and i can t use my laptop shutdown button

174367
udp	tcp
if the guest is running on a private network with the host use nfs with tcp udp is bad here -- udp is a lossy protocol that doesn t care if it drops packets and you don t want that when transferring files

174367
ftp	smb
you might also want to look into other options like s ftp or smb to transfer files

174379

gmail	hotmail
sounds like a long way around but if you get gmail to pop in your emails from your hotmail mailbox set up a gmail account go to settings accounts and import... then you can synchronize gmail with thunderbird using imap

174705
ethernet	wireless
most linksys and d-link routers will tell you both who is connected via ethernet and who is connected via wireless ethernet

174707
mouse	keyboard
furthermore you could use keyboard accelerators to trigger the yes instead of using the mouse

ubuntu	debian
added with current stable versions debian lenny ubuntu 10.04 of debhelper the default debian rules file has been simplified to two lines and things mostly work automatically

174865
google-chrome	safari
i know that google-chrome which also uses the webkit engine does not yet have a print preview option according to google this is planned for version 6 - perhaps the possible absence of the option in safari 5.0 is related to a hurdle in the latest webkit involving print previews

174897
kde	gnome
this problem only appears when i use gnome but not when i use kde

174938
mouse	keyboard
had the same issue with my acer aspire notebook of all things it turned out the battery was shot once i removed it from the laptop the internal mouse and keyboard again worked normally

175074

however firefox and google-chrome require browser extensions

175124
vmware	virtualbox
all virtual technologies whether ms s offering s or other such as virtualbox or vmware will be considered

175125
folder	directory
but if you don t buy that or you want to be particularly paranoid grabbing the contents of the entire folder should work as long as you catch the .git directory

175171
filesystems	hfs+
hfs+ mac os x s filesystems allows a file to have different forks

175175
sudo	passwd
if i do sudo -i -u myuser on the root shell i can do passwd myuser and then when it asks me my previous passwd is the only time i ve found where my pass gets recognized i can set a new passwd then but like before i never get a login to recognize it

175175

still i cannot run anything that requires me to do sudo because i get passwd incorrect

175298
vmware	virtualbox
the most popular choices are sun virtualbox and vmware server

175304
post	get
if you use a strong master password for that password manager you can then post the file somewhere you can get it later

175312
mouse	keyboard
the reason vnc is so slow is because it does little more than stream a screencast of your desktop and forward mouse and keyboard commands

175314
versioning	upgrade
to do so will require me to reinstall windows so that i can upgrade to the 64-bit versioning

175322
filesystems	hfs+

if i connect both of these drives to a usb hub will they struggle with bandwidth copying files to each other or should i connect them direct to the laptop or one to a hub with the mouse and keyboard and the other to a direct connection

175422
mouse	keyboard
since your mouse and keyboard are low-bandwidth devices their presence on the hub should not significantly affect transfer speeds

175490
hash	md5
this will redirect the lspci command into md5sum which will return an md5 hash that looks something like this

175609
pop-up	dialog
that should reset your import settings so that the dialog box pop-up

175617
filesystems	fat
the fat filesystems is pretty well documented on-line see wikipedia for instance and you can see that their choice of integer sizes for some disk structure fields ends up limiting the overall size of the file that you can store with this disk format

175635
udp	tcp
due to a bug in the firmware it would only remember the tcp port setting even when changed to udp tcp or just udp

175652

i m using os x 10.6.4 and am trying to set a folder to automatically enable execute permissions on new script files copied or created in a directory

175882
disk	ram
in fact you already have a few ram disk which you shouldn t use they re reserved for the system which you can see by doing

175882
disk	ram
to set up a 2gb ram disk mounted on ramdisk add the following line to etc fstab

175882
disk	ram
you can change tmp to be a ram disk

175882
disk	ram
the first time you reboot after changing tmp to be a ram disk the files that were in tmp will be hidden

175882
disk	ram
you can clean them up after you ve rebooted with tmp on the ram disk by doing

175882
disk	ram
but while the ram disk now obscures tmp on the root view nothing is obscuring mnt tmp

175882
disk	ram
added you can switch tmp to a ram disk without rebooting it s just a little more complicated

175980
vim	emacs
my developing is generally done in vim although i d like to become at least proficient in emacs one day

176003
kde	gnome
the highlighted blue button is not a selection like you ve seen from windows kde and gnome

176045
mouse	keyboard

176052
x86	64bit
people with a 64bit kernel can skip this paragraph. due to complexities in the x86 architecture there are several ways for the kernel to access the ram

176052
disk	ram
having a lot of ram used for the disk cache is important to keep a system responsive

176057
umask	mount
to enable everyone rw access the key is umask 0 option to mount command

176057
umask	sudo
tom s answer writing etc fstab entry will allow you to skip sudo and if you write umask 0 as additional option there you ll get best of both worlds

176057
umask	mount
as man mount says umask 0 will ensure that no additional rules apply to files access mode

176057
filesystems	fat
for fat filesystems which are most widely used on usb disks there s no access mode stored

176057
umask	mount
mount uses that as default and removes access mode of your umask value from all files on mounted disk

176072
google-chrome	firefox

gnome is a stable alternative heavyweight window manager but it installs with lots of baggage you may not need just like kde does

176126
xfs	btrfs
i ve also tried reiser3 xfs jfs btrfs and even vfat

176127
filesystems	fat
its free space map the size of which is fixed at filesystems create the infamous fat table stores much of the data an inode would and the directory entry which is dynamically allocated stores the rest

176153
kde	gnome
u is a kde menu placeholder maybe gnome too i m not sure it s not a launchy command line parameter

176232
debian	linux
well you could start with debian linux and their netinst cd and then just add the pieces you need

176232
kde	gnome
most folks would want a gui and if so you ll need x-11 but you can choose a lightweight window manager instead of kde or gnome

176259
switching	screens
use the screens saver to lock the computer allowing user switching from the lock screens

176289
ubuntu	linux
this would be quite easy to do in linux you could grab a live cd of ubuntu or something if you don t want to actually set up a linux installation

176674
toolbar	tabs
firefox 4 has a tabs on top feature but it doesn t really work if you have customized toolbar

176879
redhat	fedora
did redhat forget to include usb drivers in their rescue image for fedora core

176879
redhat	fedora
i begin to guess that redhat forgot some usb drivers in fedora core 13 because the system can t see the harddisk when booting the dvd and entering rescue mode

176887
awt	swing
if you are using awt swing applications then you re better with sun oracle s java

176893
width	height

i just want my rss feed to act like regular mailboxes so they can be sync d between macs and with my iphone as far as i can tell rss feed are local and don t sync at all

177128
disk	ram
well the best way is trial and error unhide your taskbar and see if the problem persists if not then it s because of that also check your paging file you can try not having one at all if you have sufficient ram that is and see if the start menu loads faster when there s not cache on the disk

177320
ubuntu	linux
i have found the ubuntu wubi installer for windows to be the fastest way to try out linux

177321
range	min	range	max	min	max
you need to add a new series column called range or minmax or whatever you like for the min and max and that needs onyl two values - the min and the max for all the other values not separately calculate some value for each series

177350
umask	chmod
roughly you put on umask the opposite of what you would put on chmod

it happens even when i switch usb ports of mouse or keyboard

177506
mouse	keyboard
obviously when both kbd mouse are in different ports i cannot click ok - earlier i was kinda fixing this by attaching ps 2 keyboard but right now i don t have one

177533
ubuntu	linux
there is ubuntu server edition which you should be fine with if you have linux experience and don t mind using the console otherwise use ubuntu desktop edition which is just as capable as ubuntu server edition but with a gui

177535
google-chrome	firefox
recently i noticed that my web browsers google-chrome firefox are using a strange font for all the sans-serif helvetica arial etc

177562

couple others but basically most that i found were not able to use multiple images with one image on each desktop and independently modify each image to fit work on that screens and also unable to switching between single image stretched cross all screens or multiple images

177565
ubuntu	linux
i recently switched to ubuntu linux and in this version of firefox some keyboard shortcuts are different then in windows including the shortcut for opening organize bookmarks

177572

177674
aptana	radrails

ubuntu	linux
on linux there s pitivi the one that now comes with ubuntu openshot which some dub the only usable free video editor kdenlive which is as of now the most stable and feature-full of them all but seems to be hated a little kino which is quite unusual and lives

177692
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
you can run linux from an emulator like portable ubuntu but then that s not too bright an idea when editing video so to recommend a good starter linux distro try linux mint

177694
vmware	virtualbox
i ve successfully moved a virtualbox and a vmware image with no problems at all simply by copying the files from one computer to the other

177720
folder	directory
disk usage analyzer does not show files as i would expect - if the below a certain directory don t show up then open the folder and look at the files individually

177751
throttling	throttle
ssh is encrypted and should be exempted from throttling although they may throttle it for large packets

177760
rss	feed
google s google reader service will watch a website for changes for you if it doesn t have an rss feed simply add a subscription and provide the site page url

177765
rss	feed
there s more data on the web than just rss and atom feed

177765
rss	feed
this data can then be converted into an rss feed or merged with other data in your pipe using the regex module

177780
google-chrome	firefox
i set firefox s browser.urlbar.autofill to true so it autocompletes the text sometimes but not as often as google-chrome s omnibar

177806
daemons	launchd
...then reload the launchd daemons per doug s instructions

177807
put	get
in sheet 2 column c bill - apologies for leaving off the column numbers but hopefully you get my drift you put the following formula

177857
mouse	keyboard
i remember reading an article some months years ago about a hardware device or set of devices which did this for windows basically a connection splitter for the keyboard mouse and monitor so that two people could share the same desktop

177858
folder	directory
you need to copy this text to an applescript then copy that script file to your folder action scripts directory library scripts folder action scripts or library scripts folder action scripts

177874
folder	directory
for example if it simply needs access to write in it s own directory give the everyone group or just the user full access over the folder etc

177882
folder	directory
so something is trying to create and use that folder and failing with the directory name is invalid

177902
vmware	virtualbox
vmware virtualbox and other emulators

177922
versioning	upgrade
it would be wise to upgrade these tools to win7-targeted versioning anyway

177953
norton	mcafee	antivirus	mcafee	antivirus	norton
as for the antivirus tools - i ve left the norton and mcafee stuff behind when i migrated to win7 and just installed microsoft s free security essentials which seems to be doing a fine job

177961
vmware	esx
i had this problem on vmware esx with a windows 2000 machine who s machine idle timer system idle process wasn t properly going to sleep - thus eating all my virtual cycles doing nothing

177988
versioning	upgrade
the microsoft determined windows 7 upgrade paths indicate that starter can only do a repair-in-place upgrade to windows 7 to starter no other versioning

177997
filesystems	hfs+
and does it work with the hfs+ filesystems

177998
google-chrome	firefox

178041
ati	nvidia
in apple s early marketing of the mac mini g4 it touted the superiority of the use of a discrete ati radeon 9200 32 mib graphics card over the integrated graphics included in many budget pcs. 27 the intel gma that was built into the mac mini was criticized for producing stuttering video despite supporting hardware accelerated h.264 video playback and disappointing frame rates in graphics-intensive 3d games. 28 however the nvidia geforce 320m in the current model is considered the fastest integrated graphics processor on the market today and touted by apple to be twice as fast as the nvidia geforce 9400m used in previous models

178091
vmware	virtualbox
no reason at all virtualbox is the way to go for vms if i would buy a license for software it would be vmware

178139
dpkg	aptitude
is there a way to install dependencies automatically without having to use apt-get aptitude the latest version of this dpkg wasnt available

i have a spare wireless router zyxel p-660hw-t1 v2 so i was hoping it could connect to the wireless network and then connect the pc to it through an ethernet cable

178144
rss	feed
rss feed don t sync because they aren t really local mdash

178144
rss	feed
you may find other things like ios apps that have an existing sync framework and there are a bunch of other rss aggregators for mac out there that might work for this but mail.app and especially syncing rss feed through imap is definitely not the right tool for the job

178146
versioning	upgrade
i did buy it though when it was at about versioning 6 or 7 when i ve had newer projects that required similar -- i bought an upgrade to the then current versioning

178203

178218
arp	icmp
using wireshark on win can see the icmp packets and there s no arp packets

178242
x86	64bit
the difference between the two progfiles folders allows you to have two different versions of software installed for example internet explorer comes in both 32 and 64bit flavors installed together because windows silently redirects requests from software in the x86 folders

178248
hide	show
i d like to put a list of keyboard shortcuts i want to learn on my desktop wallpaper so i can show and hide it quickly by pressing win+d

178259

i know that there is pwgen but as far as i know it does not support mouse keyboard entropy and it does not have any kind of front end gui-s

178305
min	max
i m creating a lot of graphs so i m making a common scale to be able to compare them using max min values that i m hiding in the graph as a separate series

178305

how do i amend my max min values series so it rounds to the next higher unit of 5

178308
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome

178327
switching	screens
or try switching to another magnifier mode ctrl+alt+f for full screens ctrl+alt+l for lens

178340
google-chrome	firefox
you should probably just switch to a better browser like firefox or google-chrome

178342
google-chrome	firefox
if all of these fail you could use another browser like mozilla firefox or google-chrome as a workaround

178390
processors	hyperthreading
if you ve got money to spend and are doing some really serious video editing i might even go dual-xeon 6 cores 2 cpus 2 for hyperthreading 24 logical processors

stdout	stderr
pollutes the originating terminal via stdout stderr

178592
stdout	stderr
it s now a job and its stdout stderr stdin are still connected to your terminal

178592
stdout	stderr
nohup is a program you can use to run your application with such that its stdout stderr can be sent to a file instead and such that closing the parent script won t sighup the child

178592
stdout	stderr
what you can t do is change the stdout stderr stdin of a process after having launched it

178592
stdout	stderr
the process itself can decide whether to close its stdout stderr stdin or not but you can t use your shell to force it to do so

178664
ubuntu	linux
i am running ubuntu linux on my laptop and i need to get new hard drive for it

178666
vmware	virtualbox
but have you considered using virtualbox or virtualpc or vmware to create a virtual machine instead of dual booting

178676
tunnel	vpn
the checkpoint vpn client should be doing split tunnel by default that is there will be a route you can run print route to see what i mean that directs all traffic destined to the 10.0 subnet to your vpn interface gateway

178694
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu and linux in general uses gnu versions

178758
ubuntu	linux
eye of gnome and gthumb are among the most popular picture viewers for linux partly because they have been included with popular distributions like ubuntu

178774

i suppose most linux distros have packages for this debian ubuntu certainly do and maybe it exists for other os that have a fuse implementation too

178777
x86	64bit
x86 or 64bit x64 processor

178783
disk	ram
don t expect to put xp on a system with a 1.5 gb disk and 64 mb ram and be able to run programs with anything like reasonable speed

178783
disk	ram
with win7 you can actually run interesting things in 1 gb ram as long as you can get it loaded on the disk ok

178787
vmware	virtualbox
alternatively you can look at running windows xp in a virtual machine using software like virtual pc vmware or virtualbox

178803
daemon	cron	jobs	cron
i run cron jobs on my mac laptop and so i want the mail daemon to be able to send the output mail to my regular mail account

ethernet	wireless
connecting them both to the router does not guarantee the laptop is now using the ethernet link the wireless may still have had priority

178866
mouse	keyboard
i m using an old hp keyboard and a logitech mx518 mouse

178866
mouse	keyboard
i d like to be able to assign one of the dpi buttons on the mx518 to the key command that opens dejamenu so if i m fiddling around on the other screen i don t have to move the mouse to the other screen or touch the keyboard

178894

i ve installed dropbox before on mac and windows and in those installations it asked me where i wanted my dropbox folder but when i installed it on ubuntu 64 linux it didn t seem to ask that and i can t find a dropbox folder anywhere in the filesystem

178902
move	drag
in windows there s a crop tool where you can just drag to move the edges in to crop the image how do i do that on the mac

178924
udp	tcp
if you are talking about a port this is already above the ip level it s either tcp udp

178924
udp	tcp
iptables rules that contain a port number and no explicit tcp or udp argument will fail afaik

178924
udp	tcp
investigate more the service that runs on that port to find out if it uses tcp or udp

178924
udp	tcp
if you need both tcp and udp you will need to have duplicate rules for both tcp and udp

178955
ubuntu	linux
before linux proper loads you should see a menu shown by the bootloader which is called grub where you can select whether to boot into ubuntu or windows

178997
antivirus	mcafee
one of the other issues i have with vlc is that avg and other on demand antivirus programs tested with mcafee and kaperskey make the boot up time horrible +5 minutes

179006
ubuntu	linux
you could do it with some kind of linux flavor that comes with a preinsalled partitioning manager ubuntu for example .

179017
bazaar	git
the right tool is a distributed version control system bazaar darcs git mercurial ...

179048
jobs	cron

179149
filesystems	ntfs
i have tried other options like and the same thing with different filesystems types ntfs smbfs cifs

179210
mouse	keyboard
i would like to use my keyboard for as many things as possible and leave the mouse alone

179215
mouse	keyboard
whereas technologies like rdp or xdmcp send draw instructions to the remote computer vnc and i presume ikvm but i m not 100 sure would do little more than stream a screencast of your computer and then fake the mouse and keyboard

179216
mouse	keyboard
there should be options for you to use your keyboard as a mouse as well have a look at the options there

179217
ubuntu	linux
in terms of distro ubuntu is a good place to start especially if you re not run linux before

179217
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
i ve also heard good things about suse linux and debian is another solid distro that suits people who wish to tinker a little more than the average ubuntu user

179221
burn	uninstaller
if you feel like you want to go full-on with linux which shouldn t be too quickâ take your time to look around create a backup as well as a backup plan in case of screwups and you don t have any data on it just burn a cd and select use entire disk choosing the partitioningâ there s no real uninstaller of windows just wiping it off the drive

179221
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
ask questions on the ubuntu or linux mint forums

put	get
as a final note it would be interesting to put a custom firmware like tomato on the wrt54g but i ll be happy if i get the network up and running without any hacking

179509
openbsd	linux
openssh is primarily written for openbsd but they also maintain a portable version that is widely used with linux

179512
ubuntu	debian
i don t know which fusefat you tried but debian ubuntu do have fusefat packages available in their repositories so it is buildable somehow maybe they have some useful patches

179514
ubuntu	linux
do you plan on making this a linux only system or a dual boot system with both windows 7 and ubuntu linux on it

179514
ubuntu	linux
when installing ubuntu linux it has an import tool so it can import settings and saved items from windows so your saved items will be there ready to go in ubuntu

179533
switching	screens
sleep works fine when manually commanded - the screens fans and disks shut down and the lights on usb devices such as my hub switching off but getting the computer to sleep automatically with the energy saver preferences is problematic

179557
ati	nvidia

179649
debian	linux
the initial install this way requires more linux experience as you will be using the debian text-based installer and not the more automatic and friendly graphical one but there is no rocket surgery or brain science required

x86	64bit	16-bit	64bit
x86 started out as a 16-bit instruction set for 16-bit processors the 8086 and 8088 processors then was extended to a 32-bit instruction set for 32-bit processors 80386 and 80486 and now has been extended to a 64bit instruction set for 64bit processors

179921

180045
mouse	keyboard
pressing shift-ins or selecting â pasteâ from the ctrl+right-click context menu have the same effect. when you click the right mouse button putty will read whatever is in the windows clipboard and paste it into your session exactly as if it had been typed at the keyboard

this microsoft support article might help resolve bluetooth mouse or keyboard failure to function

180457
vmware	virtualbox
if you have a x86-64 em64t cpu then you can use virtualbox or recent vmware products otherwise you can use qemu

180495
debian	linux
be specific say debian gnu linux 4.0 instead of linux please

180496

if it isn t ram it may be a particular program is doing lots of reading and writing - either intentionally photoshop used to use a scratch disk - i don t know if it still does or unintentionally trying to read and re-read a corrupt settings file

180668

how can i make sure to wait for all processes to exit just like others configurations gnome kde windows ...

180713
vmware	virtualbox
if you want it to be free and vmware is not free then you should probably go with the free solution virtualbox

180719
vmware	virtualbox
vmware fusion is probably the best virtualization software i have used on a mac i would use it mainly if i want to use it s unity mode to integrate the guest os with the host since it does it much better than virtualbox

180732
filesystems	fat
if you naively write all changes as they happen this can kill the sectors that contain the file allocation table on a v fat filesystems the most common case for removable drives or the journal on a typical modern filesystems

180818
emacs	aquamacs
on the emacs wiki aquamacs faq i found this snippet

180830
folder	directory
a very easy workaround for this kinda ties into the first answer say if you have around 1000 files that are all blocked just take all the files and put them in a new folder on your desktop or whatever folder directory you re working in them right click said folder and then click send to and then out of the options click compressed zipped folder then after that delete your original files and extract the .zip folder and viola

180853
google-chrome	firefox
edit i see you are on a mac so imacros for firefox and imacros for google-chrome is the best choice ahk is windows only

180901
disk	ram
after some investigating i see that windows disk cache is using only 100 mb or so of ram although i have 8 gib available

so i noticed that oracle is still selling sun type 7 keyboard and mouse packages

181130
dropbox	skydrive
i know of dropbox and skydrive but what i really want is to make my desktop computer accessible from outside

it is connected by an ethernet cable not wireless

181243
google-chrome	firefox
i know there s an add-on to do that on firefox but i need to run google-chrome

181351
ubuntu	linux
in linux ubuntu 10.04 i tried adding the following entry to etc fstab to no avail

181356
postgresql	mysql
personally as f l oss user i would use mysql postgresql or firebird but if you need small sql server and use it as solely user maybe you should try sqlite - not real sql server but very nice db engine

181357
put	get
what i mean is if i use xsel to put rtf data on the clipboard when i paste i get ascii rtf codeâ not formatted text

181367
vmware	esx
this is precisely what high-performance bare metal vm systems like vmware esx esxi do

181573
spyware	antivirus
if it s a spyware trojan there are chances that one of the antivirus will return a positive

181575
ubuntu	debian
for example on debian or ubuntu that means etc network interfaces declares the risky network interfaces but has no auto statement for them

181594
cpu	affinity
soft or hard affinity can increase processing speed because the cpu s cache can still have remnants of the process in it when a process was previously interrupted and then resumed at a later time

181605
subnet	packets
when it comes to same subnet communications where router tables aren t a concern each packets requires less raw computation

181605
udp	tcp
there is one less checksum to validate ethernet checksum no ip checksum for v6 but tcp udp checksum is still required which saves small amounts of time

181611
google-chrome	firefox
it may not support firefox or google-chrome

181652

181717
kde	gnome
if you use ubuntu you ll probably have gnome or kde

181722

is there maybe a registry entry that i could set to get the same width on the side of the screen as the height i am getting at the bottom or top

181738
ubuntu	linux
also you can use unetbootin to put the ubuntu live cd on an usb stick this can be done from almost any linux or windows system

181911
mouse	keyboard
will i be able to use keyboard mouse and headset without interference

181933
freebsd	linux
freebsd is not linux

181947
cpu	affinity
setting the cpu affinity forces windows to only use the cpu or cores s selected

181947
cpu	affinity
if you set the affinity to a single cpu windows will only run that application on that cpu never on any others

181947
cpu	processors
windows automatically puts run applications on the least busy processors so limiting it to a single cpu doesn t let windows do it s job

181947
cpu	affinity
even if cpu core 1 is busy running other applications windows won t be able to run an application with affinity set on cpu core 2

181948

people who use computers for any kind of data entry inevitably toss the mouse aside once they learn how to do everything with the keyboard

181976
ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu and other linux distributions windows stick to the edge of the screen instead of going directly beyond it is it possible to make them do the same in windows 7

181995
opera	firefox
i m trying to go from firefox to opera

182005
google-chrome	firefox
there is no good way to export passwords between most browsers except between firefox and google-chrome it seems

182005
opera	firefox
that way not only do your passwords remain free from browser data liberation problems but your passwords are infinitely more secure too there is no encryption on any browser s password manager except maybe opera s and firefox s password manager has no encryption even with a master password so it s interesting that they even have that option

182028
ubuntu	linux
at this point i would burn and boot up a linux live cd ubuntu s is nice and try to connect over the wired connection

182030
onenote	ms-office

my macbook s harddrive is corrupt and osx no longer boots but windows does through bootcamp

182094
disk	ram
amount of ram is in a very indirect way related to hard disk space

182094
disk	ram
your hard disk needs to be large enough to be able to store enough data to actually fill ram

182094
disk	ram
processors hard disk drives optical disk drives and similar components use cache memory to store data they need in order to decrease number of accesses to ram

182096
mouse	keyboard
especially keyboard mouse and similar parts where dead skin cells and other waste products may accumulate

182108
disk	ram
tip if you are running linux it always seems your ram is full because linux uses free unused ram as buffer for disk

clicking the kvm switching a few times usually gets it right but sometimes it s stubborn and i have to right-click on the desktop click screens resolution then click the detect button

182199
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome for example uses the same plugin architecture as firefox so you could try it there

182241
ubuntu	debian
in the spirit of teaching a man to fish i ll mention a little-known feature of the debian ubuntu package system

182250
ethernet	wireless
some models can send the packet over wireless others like my mac mini that does this requires a ethernet connection

182269
rss	feed
for the linux option you can use conky to grab and display weather news rss feed etc.

182274
filesystems	ntfs
nowadays modern linux distros can read write to ntfs but it can lead to a bit of a headache if the ntfs filesystems gets corrupted as the last time i tried it 6ish months ago you could only fix by doing a chkdisk in windows

182275
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome have adblock

182283
put	get
i once used mercurial for version control and tortoisehg to get mercurial integrated with the windows shell and put those repos online using one of these hosting services

182288
ubuntu	debian
tor project - debian ubuntu

182293
disk	ram
adding ram does speed up your computer by providing more high-speed memory for it to stuff programs and data into before having to resort to the much-slower virtual memory which is stored on the much-slower hard disk but in addition to all the advice given thus far you have to consider whether or not a lack of ram is the cause for a slow system

182305
move	drag
even tho i untick drag lock in settings still when i double tap move the window and release the finger from trackpad window is still locked to trackpad i have to tap again to unlock it

182378
vim	emacs
i would like to know emacs equivalent of vim s n which opens several files according to a glob

182421
min	max
it sound like it s either recorded at way too high level so that it distorts from being cut at the max level or recorded at too low level through a device that filters out near-silence so that it s cut at the min level

182442
filesystems	ntfs
the only limit is 2.3 tb beyond which the ntfs filesystems is exceeded on a 32-bits operating system windows 7 64-bits is then recommended

182476
norton	mcafee
i m not using norton mcafee or windows firewall

182478
ftp	telnet
i downloaded strawberry perl and also downloaded a standalone net telnet module as ftp is blocked by a firewall

182506
versioning	upgrade
using anytime upgrade or reinstall windows 7 using an english versioning

182555
octal	binary
representing those binary numbers as octal gets you 6 5 4

182566
uninstall	upgrade
what i did to fix the problem was to uninstall vim install vim 7.3 from vim.sf.net then upgrade to 7.3.3 from the cream site

182581
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard is nice and compact and both the mouse and keyboard have great range

182597

182720
mouse	keyboard
is there a keyboard short cut or extension that lets you rip a tab into a new window in google chrome instead of using the mouse

182731
disk	ram
while loading up a program costs some energy for the disk and ram to find it read it load it in memory and start it up i think there s some energy going to waste with keeping that many programs up

182731
disk	ram
what it does do is cost more processing power ram fan-cooling and possibly disk to keep those 40+ programs running than starting what few for when and how long you need them in your general case

182742
ubuntu	linux
for me the only real fix is to avoid getting windows viruses all together by using ubuntu gnu linux 10.04 from ubuntu.com

182796
tunnel	vpn
there are network restrictions on the clients end that do not allow any tunnel anything other than http traffic on http ports ssl vpn s etc

182815
tunnel	vpn
there are network restrictions on the clients end that do not allow any tunnel anything other than http traffic on http ports ssl vpn s etc

182823
mouse	keyboard
a quick search indicates that brcm2046 is related to bluetooth and that makes sense because i use a bluetooth mouse and sometimes when i wake by pressing a key on the keyboard the mouse has disconnected and i have to wiggle it a bit to reconnect

182827
google-chrome	firefox
if you do a lot of web browsing a macro recorder like imacros for firefox or imacros for google-chrome will also help to reduce the # of clicks

182897
disk	ram
may prevent hibernation if there is insufficent space to save ram to disk

182898
post	get
first let me thank you for this post because it actually helped me get some instructions on how to encode to a dnxhd quicktime in ffmpeg

182918
disk	ram
if you switch hibernation off you ll free as much disk space as you have ram

182950
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
use a virtualisation vm ware application running in windows xp the encrypted system drive partition host ubuntu such as virtualbox vmware or parallels

182955
mouse	trackpad
my solution then was to use an external mouse and disable the trackpad

182973
disk	ram
if you are not adverse to making you own little box you could get a mini-itx case and motherboard plus a pair of 2.5 drives spinning disk or ssd some ram and bob s your uncle

183017
google-chrome	firefox
in any browser firefox ie google-chrome i cannot connect to any web page externally

183022
spyware	antivirus
no antivirus spyware scanner

183022
spyware	antivirus
if you re running a computer with microsoft windows it s highly recommended you have some form of antivirus and spyware protection on that computer to help clean it from any infections currently on the computer and to help prevent any future infections

183027
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome actually has a very powerful form recognition and filling out feature built in but i m sure there is a firefox addon that does the same thing

183041
mouse	trackpad
i just tried to reproduce this and found that there is a small delay before the window stops moving with the mouse after you remove your finger from the trackpad even when drag lock is disabled

183088
icmp	udp
neither udp packets nor the icmp errors are guaranteed to arrive so udp scanners of this sort must also implement retransmission of packets that appear to be lost or you will get a bunch of false positives

183093
ati	nvidia
look for either sli nvidia cards or crossfire ati amd cards

183095
textmate	textwrangler
textmate textwrangler etc. accept the keyboard command command - to indent by one tab stop

183126
gmail	hotmail
gmail and a few other places allow you to see logs of who has last accessed your mailbox and you can always ask your host the same if you use hotmail or a host that has many accounts i wouldn t expect an answer

183149
hard-drive	hdd
the best solution is to copy everything you need to save to a different drive a flash drive or external hdd which you can physically remove for extra safety then reformat the hard-drive and install a new os

183156
folder	directory
some software when installed puts some files in the windows folder or directory

183171
ubuntu	linux
if using the python version is not an option may i suggest that you try installing it in a virtualized linux machine for example virtualbox and ubuntu

183176
wan	lan	tunnel	lan	tunnel	wan
find out which ports are opened on your firewall router wan lan and configure a ip tunnel

183201
minimum	max
as i understand the minimum requirement is 2gb max is 192gb so if the minimum for 64-bit is 2gb the minimum for 32-bit is 1gb will i lose performance if i chose to install 64-bit at it s minimum requirement over 32-bit whose minimum is half the amount

183225
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
it is not possible to do an in-place upgrade from a 32-bit installation to a 64-bit installation so you may want to save yourself the trouble and just install the 64-bit versioning now

183233
bash	zsh
in bash ksh zsh you can replace command -p pwd by pwd -p

windows vista reports x86 for 32bit version and x86-64 for 64bit version

186520
bash	tcsh
i ve tried both bash and tcsh shells

186544
x86	64bit
in current terminology x86 normally indicates 32-bits with x86-64 or x64 indicating 64bit

186544
16-bit	x86-16
initally it was a set of instructions that operated with only 16-bit so historically could be referred to as x86-16 or x86-32

186544
16-bit	x86-16
but obviously x86-16 is no longer relevant as 16-bit processors died out a long time ago

186544
x86	64bit
x86-64 or just x64 is an extension to the x86 instruction set providing support for 64bit registers memory space and the like

186544
x86	64bit
it is fully backwards compatible with the 32-bit x86 instruction set allowing 32-bit software to be compatabile without modification in most cases and is taken to simply mean a 64bit instruction set

186547
wan	lan
the second connection may be used if you are on a lan and a wan and the second nic connects to a certain ip schema 192.168.4.x for example that is not a part of the first nic

186552

it connects to an usb bluetooth stick logilink bt0007 with csr chipset

186553
pop-up	dialog
from the dialog box that pop-up

186577
filesystems	ntfs
what is written there is not a valid ntfs filesystems

186577
filesystems	ntfs
whether safeboot provides linux drivers that can read data from dev sda1 and make it available as a transparent ntfs filesystems i don t know

186615
fink	macports
i heard that some people like to use both fink and macports since some packages exist in one and not the other

186630
filesystems	hfs+
ccc wouldn t work because it prefers to preserve all os x metadata only available on an hfs+ filesystems not fat32

186693
jobs	cron
read from one of my cron jobs

186782
vim	gedit
by default it uses gvim but i would like to use gedit or vim

width	height
wingetpos x y width height title

186833
pop-up	dialog
now click on the quantity input field and a dialog box will pop-up

186836
virus	botnet
this is just a guess and after reading what wil and harpreet have said and thinking why a process would put .htaccess in every folder it sounds to be like your computer is either infected by a virus or has in some way become part of a botnet

186851
subnet	packets
a subnet mask is used for routing ip packets

186896
ubuntu	linux
i would use a linux ubuntu live cd but you can pick your own one from this list

186917
notepad++	scite
in a perfect world i would use notepad++ scite

186918
ati	nvidia
you should be able to do this with either intel nvidia or ati amd graphics once you install the relevant software

186928
ethernet	wireless
for some reason all devices in the device manager ethernet wireless vid controller audio are still marked with a yellow mark

186936
mouse	keyboard
ideally a usb switch should present itself as a mouse and keyboard device to the pcs it is plugged into which is what a ps 2 switch does

186941
sudo	passwd
this command on this system is configured to allow anyone to execute without the sudo passwd

186941
sudo	passwd
the problem is when trying to execute this command remotely i am always asked for the sudo passwd

186991
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
since html5 doesn t have an official video file format yet and fullscreen support isn t in all browsers i ve been wondering if google-chrome safari or firefox can be instructed to have their html5 video players replaced with vlc and how i can go about setting that up pc mac owner here

186991
mp4	webm
this way we won t have to worry about lack of support for true fullscreen nor mp4 webm and ogv

187009
firefox	safari
the process for windows firefox and osx safari

187072
mouse	keyboard
going to system prefs keyboard mouse keyboard shortcuts keyboard navigation and click on move focus to next wondow in active application

187123
cpu	processors
cores of the same cpu are reported as different processors with the same physical id while physically separate processors will have different physical ids

187123
cpu	processors
so for example if your physical machine has 1 quad core cpu and your vm is configured to report 2 single core cpus you ll see 2 single core cpus in cpuinfo 2 processors with different physical id

187207
filesystems	ntfs
or you wanted a remote filesystems formatted as ntfs

187249
hfs+	ntfs
the first thing i can think of that would somewhat fit your description is to partition the drive so that one partition is an hfs+ partition and the other is ntfs

187249
put	get
you may get a u3 drive which includes virtually all of sandisk s drives with universal customizer alternate link to put the hybrid iso into the fake cd partition

187263
mouse	keyboard
if it s sleeping it wakes successfully when i press the power button mash the keyboard wiggle the mouse or send a wol packet

mouse	keyboard
is there a way in windows to adjust the backlight using the keyboard and or mouse only

187319
wav	flac	wav	ogg	flac	ogg	mp3	wav	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg
instead of wav you can use ogg mp3 flac spx mpc m4a if you have the codecs

187333
pull	push
if you just need to pull and push files off of one computer from all the others get a switch that has a gigabit port and run the server off the gigabit port with a gigabit network adapter the rest of the machines only need to be 10 100 from the switch this is a far cheaper solution if you are just in need of a file server

187357
emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs has some specific customization for faces which may be overriding your customizations done through the standard emacs mechanism

187357
emacs	aquamacs
the emacs wiki has some information on making aquamacs behave like other emacsen

187367
hide	show	mouse	keyboard
i would still like to use the dock and toggle show hide with the default keyboard shortcut but just take the mouse trigger out of the equation completely

187393
google-chrome	firefox
for automating clicking and form filling inside the browser try the free imacros for ie firefox google-chrome browser addons

187422
vmware	virtualbox
create a linux virtual machine with virtualbox vmware etc

187426
128bit	64bit
in ipv6 the 64bit host part of the full 128bit address is often automatically generated from the mac address and hence often is visible to the server one connects to

187515
put	get
you can put any old rubbish in that prompt and you should get into the share as a guest

187528
dpkg	apt
if you were installing with apt try installing with dpkg instead or dpkg --configure -a if the package has already been unpacked and the configuration stage failed

187528
post	get
if you post the full output from the installation script you may get better answers

187584
vmware	virtualbox
after reading various tips on how to increase performance with virtualbox i am attempting to switch from an ide disk to sata disk in my particular case virtualbox w an ide disk is an order of magnitude slower than vmware when compiling a small application with visual studio

187586
debian	linux	debian	mint
i am trying to install linux mint debian to the second partition

187598
vmware	virtualbox
i recently got a new workstation and i moved my virtualbox and vmware vms from the old pc to the new

187611
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i m not especially familiar with the linux mint system but my understanding is that it s derived from ubuntu and uses the same ubiquity installation system

187611
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
you might have already seen it but on the site you linked to there are some more specific instructions for an ubuntu windows vista dual-boot configuration that should be similar enough to adapt to your windows 7 linux mint setup

187620
ubuntu	linux
personally i would use a linux live disk such as ubuntu and see if you can connect from that

187654
folder	directory
right-click on the directory and set folder access to access files and set file access to read-only

187673
ubuntu	linux
by default on most linux machines the login shell is bash but you can change it with the chsh command or through some other tool such as the â œuser settingsâ in ubuntu

187673
bash	zsh
when it s a login shell bash reads .bash_profile if it exists and .profile whereas zsh reads only .zprofile because its syntax is not completely compatible with a traditional sh

187683
pppoe	dhcp
i don t know why but with auto dhcp setting and my windows 7 connected with pppoe settings works

187684
pppoe	dhcp
you need to set up the pppoe configuration within the router and have both pcs using just a basic network config dhcp through lan

187699
put	get
perhaps someone wants to start up a petition and get websites like anandtech.com lifehacker.com thinq.co.uk etc magazines and online shows like tekzilla to put pressure on laptop manufacturers to do this

187706
unix	bsd
a long time ago there was a common unix variant i think it was a bsd but i can t find the reference right now that would allocate every virtual memory page in the swap space

187706
disk	ram
allocating too much swap costs a tiny amount of ram for kernel data structures and of course disk space but nowadays that s usually dirt cheap except on ssd

187716
disk	ram
think - if you have 4g of ram and on top of that need an additional 8g of swap do you think your system will still be usable what with all the swapping to from disk it s doing

187720
button	checkbox
in the connection tab ensure the use alternate outer identity checkbox is selected and the use anonymous outer identity radio button is selected

187733
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu but i would like a distribution that allows me to tinker more with stuff and learn more about linux instead of offering an out-of-the-box os

187738
ubuntu	linux
all those built-into bash and ubuntu linux

187745
kde	gnome
all the other commands not just the command line ones though kde gnome gui programs are there too usually are in usr bin though you ll find some more in usr sbin or usr local bin

187781
versioning	upgrade
you can buy the home premium versioning and upgrade to professional versioning with an anytime upgrade for only a few dollars if you find that you need the additional networking capabilities of the professional versioning and you probably will

187781
versioning	upgrade
you cannot switch bit rate versioning with anytime upgrade so whether you start with 32 bit or 64 bit may be an important decision

187804
fink	macports
macports is doing their best to patch out any harcoded paths to sw which is used by fink

187888
firefox	safari
in both firefox and safari i am storing bookmarks to the bookmark toolbar

187897
firefox	safari
neither safari nor firefox has an option for showing favicons on the bookmark bar

187900
folder	directory
most people use the terms folder and directory interchangeably

187901
folder	directory
folder is a common naming convention when referring to directory in the context of graphical user interfaces

187903
folder	directory
directory is a classical term used since the early times of file systems while folder is a sort of friendly name which may sound more familiar to windows users

187903
folder	directory
the main difference is that a folder is a logical concept that does not necessarily map to a physical directory

187957
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
i ve been through macports fink and homebrew

187957
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
virtualbox vmware fusion parallels or any other

187957

ubuntu	linux
i am new linux user especially on ubuntu

187976
sudo	passwd
- the sudo command needs the passwd of the normal user and su needs the root passwd

187976
sudo	passwd
by default in ubuntu the root account has no passwd and you get to it by becoming root via sudo

187976
sudo	passwd
try sudo -i give it your normal passwd then do passwd root and you should be able to set a passwd for the root user

187976
sudo	passwd
normal user - sudo - user passwd - root for one command

187996
debian-based	ubuntu	ubuntu	debian
on debian should be the same on ubuntu or other debian-based distributions

if you do get to post put the card back in securely and try booting again

188018
folder	directory
displaying ipaddress folder meaning to list all files in the folder requires directory browsing permission for this folder

188027
folder	directory
you could use xcopy along with some scripting to check for folder contents and use the names of the parent directory to form the file numbers

188119
filesystems	fat
a brute-force way to decrypt the file on-the-fly would be to switch to fat as a filesystems on my usb drive but i don t want to do that either

188124
installation	upgrade
if the two machines are the same model it might be that the other discs are upgrade only and require an existing os x installation before the upgrade can proceed i had this problem with a macbook that came with tiger dvds and leopard upgrade dvds as leopard was just out - you had to install tiger first then upgrade to leopard

188199
ubuntu	linux
i would like to know whether i should use linux or windows i have some experience with ubuntu and leaning toward ubuntu server

kde	gnome
if you have a gnome only system i usually have both available you might try kde s k3b program which runs on gnome but i am not certain if it has this feature.

188325
google-chrome	firefox
the classic choice is autohotkey autoit for windows automator for mac and the imacros ie firefox google-chrome addons for web browser automation

188410
rpm	yum
btw if you can don t use rpm just yum yum rmeove xulrunner-devel xulrunner-devel-unstable

188454
sudoers	passwd
assuming you still have your passwd and you are in the sudoers list you can set a new root passwd by running passwd as root

188466
mouse	keyboard
you can record both keyboard shortcuts and mouse movements and clicks

188466
mouse	keyboard
for more reliable results use keyboard shortcuts only because mouse positions may not remain the same on different computers

188556
sudo	passwd
use sudo su and enter your user passwd when asked for it

188615
macbook	bootcamp
so i bought a macbook pro and because i prefer it and need it i have windows 7 x64 installed using bootcamp

188619
put	get
make sure the network on the far side of your internet sharing machine is not using that same subnet otherwise your internet sharing mac s route table will likely get confused to put it mildly

188679
disk	ram
however if you just run the app once the os will cache the data in ram that was loaded from disk so subsequent starts should be a lot faster

188684
google-chrome	firefox
normally i run google-chrome in one desktop for personal use and firefox on a second desktop for business

188684
google-chrome	firefox
update i ve been centering around google-chrome more recently and using firefox for testing

vmware	virtualbox
vmware is the way to go if you can afford it but i have also had great success with virtualbox

188707
parallels	bootcamp
are there any gotchas or known problems with installing using parallels with an existing bootcamp partition

188716
parallels	bootcamp
all you have to do is to set your bootcamp partition as a bootable partition in parallels

188719
xfce	gnome
if you re really worried use xfce instead of gnome it is better for systems with minimal resources and will let ubuntu run much better

188736
rar	zip
the great part is that you don t have to juggle the various command-line switches for tar zip rar etc in your brain just and voila

188797
versioning	upgrade
second i had problems with booting versioning 9 even from cd which went away when i upgrade to versioning 2010

188802
arp	dhcp
you can always consult the arp table on your router in some cases the router combines the arp and dhcp lease tables together

188836
mouse	keyboard
i don t care if people see what s on my screen in fact it s my work so i want people to see it but i don t want them to be able to use the keyboard or mouse until i unlock it with my password

188838
ethernet	wireless
if you are using an interface other than ethernet say wireless you will need to specify that such as

188874
folder	directory
the third-party service interferes with the active directory installation wizard when it recreates the sysvol folder

188934
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
in ubuntu you are probably still a sudoers so you should be able to use sudo with your user passwd not the root one

188940
mouse	keyboard
while xtrlock is running the mouse and keyboard are grabbed and the

188943
pop-up	dialog
if an app needs admin rights it should call the standard authorization apis to pop-up a dialog asking for your to authenticate as an administrator

188963
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd is enough to change the passwd of root

188966
opensuse	linux
linux is dell optiplex 270gx running opensuse 11.2

google-chrome	firefox
internet explorer history is included by default but i use firefox or google-chrome

188992
ethernet	wireless
ethernet 100mb wireless

188993
centos	linux
i m using centos 5.4 servers installed in a vmware virtual machine with no x.org server installed so all access is via command line and the linux terminal

189022
ethernet	wireless
one basic thing to make the transition as painless as possible would be to plug it in via ethernet to a machine and input the exact same wireless ssid passkey and security method and also the same local ip settings

189024
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs
added1 ideally i would use wrappers or scripts with some common version control software bazaar cvs darcs git mercurial subversion â but that s not an absolute requirement

189030
puts	gets
usr bin wodim fifo had 7275 puts and 7275 gets

189046

189122
put	get
how can i get middle clicking to put me into scroll-mode in all programs on the os

disk	ram
the drive s firmware stores what it thinks are frequently accessed sectors in the cache ram and thus it can immediately deliver them over the bus when requested instead of fetching it from the comparatively slow disk

189351
bash	subshell
another way is to tell bash not to spawn a subshell by using the dot syntax

189427
x86	64bit
is it true registers are 32-bit in x86 and 64bit in x86-64

189428

x86	64bit
on such a machine windows 7 x86 32-bit shows 3.5gb of usable ram while the 64bit version shows 3.62gb of usable ram

190811
x86	64bit
in the end you would achieve less than a 15 increase in ram minus the extra overhead of 64bit applications and the overhead of thunking required to run 32-bit apps in a 64bit environment program files folder vs program files x86 folder

the only thing i can think of that you wouldn t necessarily get with an upgrade is to turn off the optional packages you aren t going to use foreign fonts printer drivers ilife which can speed up the installation significantly

if the router has more ethernet ports and no wireless you can plug your husbands laptop straight in to that

191716
ethernet	wireless
failing this your best option with the least hassle is to buy a new wireless ethernet cable router non modem this will allow you to plug your current modem router if it only has one ethernet out in to it then it basically gives you extra ethernet ports and wireless ability

because windows 7 is already there the upgrade will activate just fine even though the versioning you upgrade from wasn t activated

191765
x86	64bit
an x86 64bit processor s registers can work with numbers from 0 through to 2 64 -1 18 446 744 073 709 551 615 giving it in theory a much larger virtual address space

191997
ssd	sata
the ssd showed up under the pata controller because i think the bios was doing emulation or something. switching the bios to use ahci on the sata controller didn t make any difference other than that the ssd showed up under the sata controller instead and was listed as using the ahci driver as you d expect

if you ring microsoft and advise them of your configuration they will provide you with another activation key for the unactivated setup either bootcamp or through vmware

192204
portrait	landscape
it is possible to make a single page have a different orientation in word the other pages in your document would be portrait but you can alter the page setup for a single page to be landscape instead

daemons	systemd	daemons	launchd
one thing to note about os x is that some systemd processes will be automatically restarted if they are killed by the launchd daemons i think

192353
tunnel	vpn
the nature of the vpn connection from the cisco device at the remote location is to tunnel all traffic for routing by the remote location

192353
tunnel	vpn
you will need the vpn administator at the remote location to enable split tunnel

192356

i then deleted the .virtualbox directory from my userprofile directory and i copied the .virtualbox folder that i had previously to my userprofile directory

192374

although i don t own a ssd drive i m pretty sure that installing windows 7x64 or x86 is the same as installing onto a regular sata drive

192393
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd sets the passwd for the user root

192393
sudo	passwd
what will not change is your user passwd ie the one you use to log in with and the one you use when you use sudo

disk	ram
one way to diagnose this is to remove as much hardware as possible all but one ram module if you have more than one all but one disk drive either cd dvd or hard disk drop down to the motherboard video chipset if any etc. if this configuration is stable add one more device say the video card and see if it s still stable

but reducing the number of disk access by adding ram is far more likely to pay off

192628
vmware	virtualbox
hope this helps my bits might be overkill but it works perfect for me and i also use vmware workstation instead of virtualbox as i like it s unity mode better than vbox and also exclusive mode allows the vm to integrate as if you re running it on a normal pc

assume i have a keyboard mouse and monitor for everyone connected to multiple video cards either multiple outputs on a single video card or one monitor card

they supply the keyboard mouse video devices which cost on the order of 75-200 per added user depending on whether you want to add users via pci cheapest usb or ethernet

193010
kde	gnome
if you ve got 4 gb ram or more on the laptop it stands a pretty fair chance of working - with 2 gb or less and it starts to get iffy since a modern gui gnome kde is going to need at least a 512mb ram vm in my experience

193024
installation	downgrade
it will tell you that the solution to your problem is to downgrade libtool to version 1.5.26-4+lenny1 and if you accept the solution it will install the older libtool version and php5-dev installation will be successful after that without any conflicts

193041
chown	chmod
scratch is ext4 so you would use chown chmod et alia to control permissions

193145
processors	hyperthreading
some processors are able to get much more from each cycle than others which is why you would still greatly prefer a 2ghz core 2 duo to a 3.4ghz pentium d even though the pentium d also has two 64bit processors cores and each runs at 3.4ghz with hyperthreading at that

193160
stdout	stderr
file descriptor 1 is stdout 2 is stderr

a dialog should pop-up where you can choose the encoding to use for saving

for example assuming backtrack includes the same keymaps as debian ubuntu loadkeys fr will give you a french layout loadkeys be-latin1 will give you a belgian layout etc

mouse	keyboard
this is super frustrating as it s virtually impossible to save whatever i m working on when the mouse doesn t work and seems to some impede keyboard shortcuts

strange thing is when my laptop b connects wireless through xyz it gets the ip address but then none of the browsers google-chrome firefox ie can show any web pages

if you really need it for vbulletin you might want to look at lazursus or other firefox and google-chrome extentions that serve the same purpose without putting spyware on your computer

193878
debian	linux
at least on debian linux you find boot grub menu.lst and change the order of the menu options near the end of the file

194020
vpn	wlan
another suggestions was to have a broken default route and a single working route to the vpn server in the wlan adapter so the only thing that works by default is contacting the vpn server when the connection is established the vpn sets the new default over the vpn device

194045
freebsd	linux
linux and freebsd have unionfs which does this

194090

i d suggest a minimum of 2gb of ram for windows 7 an intel core 2 duo or better and ideally a solid state disk ssd for the absolute best performance

194122

194378
x86	64bit
i am developing some software and actually my question is whether release x86 version is ok for both 32-bit and 64bit windows 7

194379
windows	wow64
no there is no guarantee and it isn t difficult to find examples of 32-bit applications or libraries not behaving as expected when running inside wow64 windows on windows 64-bit the 32-bit environment that allows 64-bit versions of windows to run 32-bit applications

194380
x86	64bit
as a real-world example my company does this for all our apps ie ship x86 versions which run on both 32 and 64bit os s

194412
filesystems	ntfs
in case of a power outage can the ntfs filesystems be harmed

194412
filesystems	ntfs
the user data is not guaranteed by the ntfs filesystems but applications like database management system has transaction managers that protects the data

194412
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs logs changes to metadata in a transactional manner so that filesystems structures can be repaired to a consistent state with no loss of file or directory structure information

194412
filesystems	ntfs
from the start ntfs was designed to include features required of an enterprise-class filesystems

194412
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs uses atomic transactions to implement its filesystems recovery features

194412
filesystems	ntfs
in addition ntfs uses redundant storage for vital filesystems information so that if a sector on the disk goes bad ntfs can still access the volume s critical filesystems data

194412
filesystems	ntfs
the ntfs recovery capabilities do ensure that the filesystems on a volume remains accessible but they make no guarantees for complete recovery of user files

194412
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs recovery support ensures that if a power failure or a system failure occurs no filesystems operations transactions will be left incomplete and the structure of the disk volume will remain intact without the need to run a disk repair utility

194412
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
furthermore unlike the fat filesystems ntfs guarantees that user data will be consistent and available immediately after a write-through operation or a cash flush even if the system subsequently fails

194475
tunnel	vpn
when a computer connects to an office network via vpn then usually the vpn client needs additional routes in its routing tables so that traffic for any of the office resources is routed through the vpn tunnel this can also be done by pointing the default route at the tunnel in which case all traffic goes through the tunnel

194475
tunnel	vpn
if these routes are not there the computer connected via vpn cannot see anything on the other side of the tunnel

194481
lan	localhost
or just stick with using localhost from inside the lan

194484

usually the problem is either that the proprietary video driver was upgrade to a newer versioning that s buggy with your particular video card model or that its compilation failed with the newer kernel

195095
disk	ram
to my knowledge no virtualisation solutions yet support telling the os in the vm that it is in fact on an ssd the virtual drive and controller will look the same to the guest os wether is it on a spinning-metal based disk an ssd or even an entirely ram based drive and translating trim commands from the guest os to correct trim commands relative to the host drive

195121

197106
vmware	esx
if you re interested in learning about vmware infrastructure 3 i highly recommend this book as it contains discussions about the architecture of vmware esx server and techincal considerations that you will hardly find anywhere else

197124
ubuntu	mint
can i use mint as a router service similar to the service in ubuntu called router advertisement daemon

197131
wan	lan
beyond that you d simply configure the system firewall to pass traffic from your lan interface to the wan interface anyone that s messed with iptables is laughing at this statement

197131
ethernet	wireless
if you have a wireless card you can also bridge that ethernet device with your lan device to make the behave as one

197217
bash	zsh
you could implement a similar feature in a window manager-agnostic way in a text terminal using a shell s completion mechanism zsh or perhaps bash and the wmctrl command

197220
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu offers a way to install linux in a file on a windows partition wubi

197275
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
starting in linux mint 8 based on ubuntu 9.10 there is an integrated font installer which i describe in my blog post here

197362
disk	ram
the problem is that windows eats about 1 gb ram for disk cache shown in task manager under physical memory - cached that leaves only 2 gb for applications

197397
pop-up	dialog
if i double-click on it it crashes and a your program crashed dialog pop-up opens up

197397
pop-up	dialog
if i launch it through a dos console it crashes and a your program crashed dialog pop-up opens up

197397
pop-up	dialog
no dialog pop-up

197397
pop-up	dialog
note that on windows xp everything works as expected a dialog pop-up opens... and i can debug the crashed program

197437
disk	ram
if the performance you get is not satisfying then you must invest in hardware either more ram or a faster hard disk

197447
disk	ram
windows thinks of ram more as an optimization layer over the hard disk

197447
disk	ram
it doesn t want to wait until you have to swap ram out before paging swapping it to disk

197447
disk	ram
this strategy works because it places the slow disk writes at the points when your computer is less stressed at the expense of slightly slower application loads and maybe paging some things it doesn t need to rather than at the point when your computer is already more stressed and running low on ram

197449
skype	ichat
we ve tried some screen sharing solutions like ichat skype and vnc

antivirus	norton
both computers run norton antivirus and it is up to date

197504
filesystems	ntfs
this is only true for some filesystems -- one example is ntfs

197504
filesystems	ntfs
for instance large hard drives with only one ntfs filesystems typically have a very large sequentially accessed master file table mft and it generally takes more time to read this mft than the smaller mfts of smaller partitions.

197526
put	get
put it in a zip lock back and put it in the freezer the metal will shrink then you should be able to boot for long enough to get your data

197529

you could backup your data and restore on a fat32 partitition or create a far32 partition and xcopy robocopy the files

197684
versioning	upgrade
how to upgrade php from old versioning to new versioning

197685
filesystems	ntfs
the best common format is probably ntfs as the majority of current linux distributions supports the ntfs filesystems out of the box and it doesn t suffer from the limitations of fat32

197685
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs
in case of performance problems on linux give a try to paragon ntfs hfs filesystems drivers for linux

197688
filesystems	ntfs
this is particularly problem for lots of small files ntfs can store them in the directory structure where they waste very little space but in fat32 they must have a block to themselves so a 10 byte file will effectively take a couple of tens of bytes under ntfs but up 32 768 under fat32 for filesystems above 32gb in size fat32 uses 32kbyte allocation blocks

197688
filesystems	ntfs
the lack of granularity in fat32 s space allocation method leads to much wasted space for lots of files whether they are small or not each file will wast on average 16kbyte on a large fat32 filesystems but 2kbyte on a similarly sized ntfs one - see here for more information on cluster sizes for the various ms fileystems

197693
demo	shareware
you can try an older shareware demo here

197802
folder	directory
on windows 7 you have to right click a folder or file and press share with everybody in order to share a file that has just been freshly written in the shared directory

197814
ubuntu	linux
this doesn t support using a physical disk as far as i can see so i d have to use a shared linux data drive with separate ubuntu installations for the vm and for real use

197815
switching	screens
since the last five days a pc with windows 7 shows the updates screens when booting and when switching off usually for about 5-10 minutes

197818
ubuntu	linux
i ve put my working dir on an ntfs drive so as to be able to work from both windows and ubuntu linux

197828
daemons	systemd
i m thinking that for your live music systemd you may want fewer daemons running a lighter desktop or other maybe some other tweaks to increase performance

197833
jobs	cron
cron jobs are habitual offenders because they trigger an auth log entry

197834
jobs	cron
cron jobs

197846
daemons	systemd
you should tell what os you are using but anyway a usual method to improve name resolution performance with unix and unix-like systemd is to use a daemons commonly nscd which caches positive and negative resolutions and quickly answers most requests

197869
put	get
then to get your command to run at startup put the command to run your script in etc rc.d rc.local

197909
vim	emacs
when using vim or emacs a lot the control key is used far more often than the caps lock key and it seems sensible from an ergonomic point of view to have the control key in the place that the caps lock key is

folder	directory
first it extracts the contents of the archives to a temporary folder then windows copies the files from the temporary folder to the target directory

197992
ubuntu	linux
it could also be a problem with a number of other things so it may be worth trying a linux live cd for example ubuntu to help eliminate problems with xp

198012
folder	directory
in the program files directory there is a realtek wireless lan utility and driver folder

198017
bazaar	git
if you re going to be working on several different computers i still recommend you set up a modern version control system but you may want to use a distributed system such as bazaar git or mercurial

198096
ethernet	wireless
connect linksys wet54g wireless ethernet bridge to existing meraki wireless network

198100
wan	lan
for example if the meraki system assigns an ip address to the wet54g and router wan of 192.168.0.xxx the router lan must be set to a different ip range 192.168.1.xxx

198106

ethernet	wireless
i want to connect one of my desktops wireless to the internet using my neighbours unsecured wifi with her permission of course and share it through the ethernet port to my wireless router so i can broadcast it for my use

198494

you can hook as many pcs through the ethernet bridge as there are physical ports and later use a wireless ad-hoc network to share even more

198556
ethernet	wireless
ethernet preferred to wireless wireless preferred to bluetooth etc

198556
ethernet	wireless
but failover exists as well so if ethernet gets disconnected windows will attempt to connect over wireless

i want to use fedora and be on the frontier of new software since i m not doing anything critical but if it s completely different than redhat i d rather just use centos

mouse	keyboard
sounds to me like you have a keyboard and or mouse driver issue going on

200204
mouse	keyboard
if you have any drivers for your keyboard and or mouse then i would suggest uninstalling them

200204
mouse	keyboard
don t worry you should still be able to use your keyboard and mouse but you probably won t have any extra functions like certain hot keys or even certain buttons on your mouse might no longer work - but you should at least still be able to use them

200204
mouse	keyboard
of course reinstalling drivers for a mouse and or keyboard theoretically will enable those extra abilities but you might also have that weird problem again too

200204
mouse	keyboard
the list of input or even output devices is pretty long but reducing your computer to it s most basic elements with just a basic keyboard and basic mouse is where i d at least begin the troubleshooting process

200204
mouse	keyboard
and if your keyboard mouse are usb devices you might also look into your bios settings too again that s a bit too borad a topic to go into here

200205
sorting	grouping
since domain names are based on a hierarchy representing these identifiers the same way makes sense the element order is rather arbitrary and reverse order also allows for proper sorting so that all files are grouping

200264
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
click ok or apply or whatever and do the same thing again for your storage partition but this time set the filesystems to ntfs or fat your choice and set the mount point to home obviously home is where all the user data goes so that s where you can store everything

as it was pointed out that the system was agp which i should ve checked to be honest there is a good likelihood that an up to date ati might work as well as it seems that nvidia have completely abandoned agp

the red hat magazine on the other hand states if the value is 0 then the kernel checks to determine if there is enough memory free to grant a memory request to a malloc call from an application

it prints all stderr stdout messages into the cmd.exe window and also expects any input commands to be typed in there

200784

it is possible that these services should not be restarted without a full systemd reboot but rebooting the systemd is much easier than killing and relaunching 8+ services and daemons

200854
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
most modern shells support csh s bang commands - bash tcsh and zsh

at this very moment i am using google-chrome but i am a huge fan of firefox and would prefer to use it

201053
switching	screens
we have a win 7 computer that is used by several family members and we use fast user switching to change accounts without logging each other out it s set up to go to the select user screens after resuming from screensaver

range	min	range	max	min	max
he wants the min max of the y-axis of a bar chart to reflect the min max within a range in column a of an excel spreadsheet

201061
min	max
the min max will change depending on his input into the spreadsheet

201061
min	max
i would write a min and max formula or sort by ascending order to identify the upper and lower bounds then change the axis options to fixed for the y-axis and type in the numbers

201061
min	max
is there a quick way to accomplish his goal without using vba and without having to type in the fixed min max values

201115
put	get
if you are just transferring the data over and you don t plan on using them as drive space in the new machine i would just get an ide to usb and or fireware enclose and put the drives in the enclose

bluetooth	usb
a tablet with bluetooth or usb input for a bluetooth dongle can directly interface with a pc

201134
mouse	keyboard
they are hackable in respect to using mswin tablet features such as on-screen keyboard and mouse keys

201152
filesystems	ntfs
however ntfs 3.1 is a highly complex and advanced filesystems and in fact its design includes features that not all versions of windows can support

201185
vmware	virtualbox
either you can use virtualbox or vmware or else simply use wubi and install ubuntu inside windows as another software

201222
filesystems	btrfs
maybe what you need is some form of raid this requires that the devices have multiple cf readers unless you re willing to sacrifice a lot of performance and disk space for a chance of detecting corruption or a filesystems with some corruption detection something which linux doesn t support well â i think your best bet is btrfs

201230
folder	directory
i need to create 1000 folder numbered 000 to 999 inside a directory

video signals in particular are all over the place depending on resolution width and height and frame rate

201411
folder	directory
i have just deleted 3 folder from a directory

201545
bios	rootkit
the best will include cutting edge rootkit which in a real-world case could include infecting your bios although i ve never seen that in theory not in the real world

201560
gentoo	linux
if you want to learn linux for real i recommend gentoo

201560
gentoo	ubuntu
maybe you could start elsewhere like an ubuntu command-line installation get familiar with that and then move on to gentoo

201562
ubuntu	linux	kde	gnome
ubuntu is an excellent platform to gain linux unix knowledge and offers both client and server versions - one based on kde and one based on gnome

201566
jobs	cron
you have to keep the ram chips alive some processing is done the hard drive may spin up for various cron jobs

201566
disk	ram
hibernation saving ram to disk and powering off and shutting down are the only true ways to eliminate battery usage

201578
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql

201642
disk	ram
for example you buy a computer with 4gb of ram or 3tb of disk

201713
width	height
under this path there are keys named in the format width x height x refresh rate hz

201728
fseek	ftell
if you do a stat on any of these pseudo-files you ll see it s a named pipe and you should treat it with pipe semantics - namely no fseek or ftell

201743
ssd	sata
in many cases io is even more important so the transition from good a sata hdd to a good ssd will bring you more than the transition from 2 cores to 4 cores

201745
rss	feed
an alternative approach could to just use a simple shell script from the command line to download the files found in the rss feed

201745
fink	macports
this link has a preferred answer that describes a solution using wget however i don t think wget is part of mac os x by default it is available through fink or macports though but there is a similar command that mac os x has by default that will also work curl

201745
rss	feed
here is a one line shell script that works on mac os x snow leopard that will download the articles of an rss feed to the current directory

201747
hash	md5
why do sites offer an md5 hash of a file

201750
hash	md5
an md5 hash doesn t protect you if the site gets hacked because the md5 sum an be changed as well by the hacker

201750
hash	md5
what an md5 hash is good for is making sure the file didn t get corrupted in the download process

201753
trojan	virus
a man-in-the-middle attack could possible alter your download and inject a virus or trojan or other malicious code in the download

201754
hash	md5
cryptographic hash functions such as md5 are designed to change if there s a change in the original file

201754
hash	md5
you may also need a better hash algorithm sha-1 sha-256 as collisions attacks have been demonstrated against md5

201806
ethernet	wireless
go to network and sharing center found by clicking your wireless ethernet icon in your taskbar

201822
16-bit	64bit
on a pc addressing is by byte and you can access a byte 8 bits a word 16-bit a double word 32 bits and a quadword 64bit

201822
integer	unsigned
good c programs generally define a set of preferred types such as uint8 - unsigned 8 bit integer sint8 - signed 8 bit integer and so on so that the program written becomes as independent as is sensibly possible from the peculiarities of the specific compiler and underlying hardware

201833
hide	show
use ctrl + shift + b to show hide the toolbar if you think it is ugly and don t want to see it

201886
disk	ram
the only way i know to reduce the ram is by installing a ram disk

201891

records interruptions no mouse keyboard activity for a given time

201980
emacs	gedit
since i completely use linux now gedit was not working for me as i wanted some friend recommended emacs and that is what i want to learn

201991
png	ico
i was able to convert png files into ico files thanks to turn pngs to one ico file but now i would like to create an icon bundle similar to system32.dll which contains several individual icons

202012
google-chrome	firefox
in office 2003 closes opened doc not the window windows explorer closes the window firefox closes the tab and them the window if it s the last tab like google-chrome notepad++ close the tab .

202012
google-chrome	firefox
you can certainly remap any shortcut using autohotkey for closing but implementing this new functionality present in firefox and google-chrome in all the programs seems not possible because it is program related not windows related like the regular alf+f4

202014
kde	gnome
under gnome that would be nm-applet but off the top of my head i don t recall its name in kde

202015
google-chrome	firefox
because otherwise you could just use firefox or google-chrome

202019
mouse	keyboard
discover and track your keyboard and mouse usage

202036
lvm	btrfs
i have 3 ideas - either lvm behaves bad over luks encrypted partition or btrfs behaves badly for some reason or ubuntu installation for some reason is screwed up which i doubt

202074
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux 10

202096
mouse	keyboard
usb ports aren t powering the keyboard mouse

202116
google-chrome	firefox
i can do this on firefox with the web developer extension but google-chrome doesn t seem to have the same option in their webdev extension

202117
rss	feed
i m running windows 7 and looking for a customizable app that i can run on a second monitor with things like clocks weather stock prices rss feed etc

202186
ethernet	wireless
simply bridge the wired and wireless network connections of your primary laptop then connect the lan ports of your two laptops via an ethernet cable

202217
google-chrome	firefox
is there a google-chrome browser extension like fireftp from firefox

202243
chown	passwd
but that was pretty easy to fix by editing etc passwd and etc group then a find piped to a chown

202245
hash	md5
if your system uses a cryptographic hash to store passwords md5 sha1 etc then there is no limit to the password length itself since these hash can be created with any amount of data

202245
hash	md5
an md5 or sha1 hash can be created for an entire hard drive and this is commonly done for forensic purposes because if even one bit is changed ever so slightly then you have a very different hash and hence you can verify the data has changed

202245
hash	md5
there is a slight downside to using these hash which is that a hash has a finite size for example an md5 hash is 128 bit

202245
hash	md5
this means that an md5 hash only has 2 128 or 340 282 366 920 938 463 463 374 607 431 768 211 456 possible combinations

202245
hash-collision	key
now while that is a big number what this means is that you can have what they call a hash-collision where you have two different items or key that produce the same hash

202245
hash-collision	key
in theory the larger the key size the lower probability of a collision and the longer it should take to brute force a password but that is strictly evaluating the entropy and how long it can take but there is also a chance that the first entry they try can be the one which matches even if it s a hash-collision

202245
hash	md5
generally speaking you really are safer using a hash which has a larger key size because suppose this is md5 the odds of the first password matching out of 340 282 366 920 938 463 463 374 607 431 768 211 456 possible matches is extremely extremely unlikely

202245
hash	md5
the password field may start with an md5 hash in the password field looks like where it starts with

202245
hash	salt
the salt is a randomly generated string that is concatenated with the key plain text password in order to protect against precomputed tables of known hash

202245
hash	salt
the hash is the cryptographic hash created from the salt and key password

202245
hash	md5
so you know ubuntu as of 8.04 which was released in april 2008 used md5 hash

202245
crypt	md5
crypt for a long long since at least md5 was used and probably before that has allowed character pointers for the actual key

202268
folder	directory
am looking for a script application to organize my downloads folder into different directory depending on say type of file and the day when it s downloaded

202270
freebsd	linux
can all hardware be used natively after booting say linux or freebsd

202272
opensolaris	bsd
linux opensolaris and the 3 open source bsd

202330
kate	gedit
crontab -e will probably run in vi if you don t know how to run vi maybe try kate or gedit

202331
hide	show
setting hide modes that this monitor cannot display to off does not show any more refresh-rates just the 60hz

202333
freebsd	netbsd
macosx is a modified version of the bsd s under the hood a mix of freebsd netbsd and some microkernel stuff to spice it up a bit

202333
fink	macports
look at macports or fink

202339
button	checkbox
now tell me what is the functionality difference between two radio button on off or one checkbox on off

202373
spyware	antivirus
they look like leftovers of some malware spyware that was removed from your system probably by your antivirus antispyware application

202428
switching	screens
when you say switching i m assuming that you mean move the actual window from one screens to the next

202430
ubuntu	linux
another option is put a linux distro such as ubuntu on it and see if that will find the drivers and then find a radio programme

202442
debian	linux
i would tend to use a linux distro probably debian but that s just because i m familiar with it

202470
google-chrome	firefox
i love keepass but i store my frequently used website logins with imacros for firefox and imacros for google-chrome free open-source browser addons

202482
rpm	yum
i want to install the latest version of git using yum and the rpm repository on kernel.org but adding the repo to yum.repos.d causes yum to fail with checksum errors

202493
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade firefox to versioning 3.6.11 and after the installation was done i got the message that adobe flash player 10.1 needs to be downloaded so i did even though the flash player i had before upgrading firefox was 10.1 but i reinstalled it coz i thought that since firefox got updated so it needs the plugin to be installed again and after that whenever i open any website with flash in it like youtube or facebook games firefox hangs and stops responding

202507
disk	ram
and then i just tried microsoft s ram utility disk and it eventually locked up on that the ram passed though

202521
slackware	suse
i d try debian redhat slackware or suse

202541
mp3	ogg
convert the ogg to mp3 or anything else

202541
rar	zip
a torrent file could do the same if who created it didn t zip rar the files

202561
macbook	bootcamp
i have a macbook pro 15 april 2010 edition which overheats and then freezes while running bootcamp

202573
mouse	keyboard
if a mouse and keyboard are connected you can wake it up and only use the external display

202604
gif	png
images png gif jpeg and makes a

202639
post	get
google is being useless with a load of post trying to get me to call a telephone number with letters in presumably an american number

202654
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu systems may have the realpath utility installed which provides mostly the same functionality as bin readlink -f in the coreutils package.

202655
versioning	upgrade
so you can either upgrade your fedora to a newer versioning or install mercurial through pypi

202665
folder	directory
else moving the users directory to e is fine as well gives every user of your system its own folder on the big partition

202671
width	height
you can also use absolute height and width instead of scale

202678
sudo	passwd	pop-up	dialog
sudo asks for the passwd on the command line and gksudo pop-up a dialog box for it

202680
vim	gedit
if you would rather use gedit than vim as your default editor then add this to your .profile

202722
chown	chmod
the fix was to chown and chmod the profile-dir recursively

202764
antivirus	norton
after lengthy analysis the conclusion is that norton antivirus 2010 is the culprit

202764
antivirus	norton
i went back to the image i had created prior to installing norton antivirus 2010

202764
antivirus	norton
i think there must be some one in a thousand conflict between the norton antivirus 2010 and the windows xp installation that was created by the recovery partition on her toshiba l300 laptop

202764
antivirus	norton
back then she had norton antivirus 2008 installed on the laptop

202777
mouse	keyboard
since it s a photo frame there is no keyboard or mouse

202777
pop-up	dialog
everynow and then i get a dialog box that pop-up requiring me to attach one or the other to click ok

202783
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to install cisco vpn client on linux ubuntu 10.04

202819
fink	macports
clean slate makes sense primarily outside you user folder system extensions drivers fink macports unix tools developer tools etc

202844
google-chrome	firefox
then imacros for firefox and imacros for google-chrome is what you need

202991
mouse	keyboard
i would recomend removing all add-on cards and usb devices and booting the computer with just a monitor keyboard and mouse attached

203001
afp	smb
if you get a response then try to connect to server afp or smb ipaddress and see if the shares show up based on what you enabled but first and foremost make sure your shares are set up properly with share points and users who can access them

203015
firefox	safari
this happens only in firefox - not in ie or in safari all 3 tested only on a windows system

203067
srt	subtitle
although as niklass says you ll probably have more success getting an srt file from one of the subtitle sites

203122
folder	directory
profile directory open containing folder

203163
punctuation	words
when i m using a browser and i click on a text field - for example the address bar or a search box - the first thing which happens is the entire field is selected.subsequent clicks seem to select parts of words often deciding arbitrarily to exclude or include adjacent punctuation

203252
disk	ram
your hard drives cd dvd drives network drives and even ram disk drives

203294
mouse	keyboard
with a keyboard shortcut that convoluted i m not going to remember it and might as well just reach for my mouse

203295
folder	directory
my user is a standard non-administrator account admin is an administrator account and the directory i m working in when i execute su is in my downloads folder

203302
folder	directory
the answer is to give admin access to any directory in your home folder you want it to be able to access

203304
disk	ram
the best reason i ve found is that the pagefile allows windows to use more physical ram for the disk cache which may be a better use for it than rarely used memory pages

203322
put	get
if so you can control how many labels get put on the x axis by right-clicking the x axis and choosing format axis... then for major unit choosing fixed and typing a value larger than the value that was automatically chosen by excel

203333
folder	directory
i just started using coda and the local folder defaults to my home directory when i open the program

203366
vmware	esx
for example vmware esx esxi will happily do over committment

203394
mouse	keyboard
i am just changed the motherboard of my pc my usb mouse and keyboard ps2 aren t recognised by my computer

203398
cat	tee
instead you can just add the exes from the unxutils project which include cat tee and many others

203453
disk	ram
until these programs offer a finer control on how to use their ram disk caches and memory usage the most efficient way to deal with it is by using a ram disk

203453
disk	ram
you just need to configure your programs to use the newly created ram disk to store their temporary files

203453
disk	ram
though some ram disk drivers also allow you to commit the changes to disk at shutdown time restoring it when you boot up again.

203498
trojan	virus
maybe your pc is infected by a virus trojan key logger

203532
switching	screens
the video should switching over to the monitor instead of being on the laptop screens

203540
disk	ram
add to that the fact that with a faster cpu faster and more ram a faster disk drive you can process data faster resulting in less time needed per task and you will have your answer

203557
ubuntu	linux
many linux distributions including fedora and ubuntu use readahead to really speed up the boot process

203571
filesystems	ntfs
pcs can use ntfs filesystems but macs cant

203571
filesystems	fat
macs have to have the filesystems formatted at fat for it to be read properly until it is fat or possibly fat32 it will be read only

203572
folder	directory
ie there s an audio file with no video there s a video file with no audio and some other random files and folder including a .trd file at the root directory

203577
google-chrome	firefox
is there a google-chrome plugin that does what text link does for firefox linkifies links

203599
ubuntu	debian
it just needs to work on debian based os s like ubuntu debian self

203656
ubuntu	debian
i d like to drop a file from a ubuntu vm to a debian vm both sit on a win7 host

203667
google-chrome	firefox
however ie google-chrome firefox msn messenger cannot connect to the internet

203741
filesystems	ntfs
note that i should be able to use this with windows computers and the filesystems has to be accessible from windows 7 so i guess it has to stay ntfs

203743
ubuntu	linux
i just upgraded my linux guest running on win7-64 virtualbox 3.2.10 from ubuntu 10.04 to 10.10

203743
pop-up	dialog
when i click the button it spends about 15 seconds searching for available drivers flickers everything grays out the dialog box for another five seconds or so then finally pop-up a dialog box that says desktop effects could not be enabled

203745
vmware	virtualbox
otherwise there is vmware or virtualbox but both of those would require a separate copy of windows loaded on them

203820
tunnel	vpn
when you have to encrypting all data using vpn ssh tunnel and similar tools is a good idea

203841
mp3	wmv
capture mp3 aacplus wma has wmv capturing but it s not relevant to this question

203877
tunnel	vpn
as mentioned in another answer you can use a ssh tunnel or vpn to a trusted location if you are currently in a hostile environment that you do not trust this would then allow you to have an encrypted connection inside of that network so then they cannot decypher your traffic although they can still capture it

203896
folder	directory
when i try hosting both folder in the same directory they overwrite each other because they have the same name

203899
filesystems	hfs+
to get case sensitivity you re going to need to switch the filesystems from hfs+ to ufs

203961
move	drag
you can drag and drop the bookmarks from the list cmd + b to a finder window or the desktop then copy or move those files to your new machine

203974
hide	show
doesn t show up in my computer but when i plugged it in autoplay pops up and then hide after a couple minutes without me interacting with it

203978
vmware	virtualbox
i know how to do that in virtualbox but not vmware

203996
google-chrome	firefox
now firefox i assume google-chrome may have better standard defaults but generally on any high speed connection i change the cache size to be at most 10-20 mb often i use 5 mb

204000
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs-3g is a stable read write ntfs driver but it is unfortunately extremely slow compared to both ntfs on windows and any native linux filesystems

204057
ubuntu	opensuse
extra benefit is opensuse is a pretty nice desktop environment w nice package management tools that doesn t suffer from limited functionality such as ubuntu s over-stripped down-ness and brown

204062
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu 10.04 is in the middle of a transition between two service management systems sysvinit the traditional system used by most linux distributions and upstart a newer system pushed by ubuntu and becoming available in more and more distributions

204099
ethernet	wireless
they are connected to the router via wireless although it has been tested with an ethernet cable as well

204110
ati	nvidia
what is the minimum ati nvidia graphics card to support windows aero

204119
tunnel	vpn
as it is right now inadyn like any other program on your computer uses the default gateway which when the vpn comes up is through the vpn tunnel

204121
ubuntu	debian
and unless you really know debian you might be better off installing ubuntu on it

204129
mouse	keyboard
applications take a long time to start mouse and keyboard input is choppy etc

204169
hide	show
since the crop tool of acrobat just hide the area from printing the resulting new pdf document will not show the hidden areas anymore

204228
hide	show
a checkedvalue of 2 hide hidden files a checked value of 1 show them

204236
vim	emacs
is there a way to tell emacs vi vim from the command line that i want to view the file in view-mode or read-only

204236
vim	emacs
i know how to open a file as read only if emacs vi vim is already running

204286
kerberos	ldap
samba can also authenticate against kerberos or ldap servers

204294
ethernet	wireless
unfortunately wireless routers have become synonymous with routers as most consumers don t know that wired routers still exist as popular devices are advertised to be wifi compatible no mention of wired ethernet

204305
ubuntu	linux
i have these version installed in ubuntu lucid linux

204307
pop-up	dialog
every time i start google chrome a uac dialog box pop-up with the question

204313
pop-up	dialog
i had exactly the same problem uac blocks the program because it asks for administrator rights but does not pop-up the do you feel lucky dialog because of the way the program was initiated

204349
folder	directory
also if i uncheck the show current directory only option then the menu to create folder and files on the current one that worked before disapears and i m unable to use it

204392
bazaar	git
you can try a dvcs such as git or bazaar or mercurial

204430
google-chrome	safari
i use google-chrome but i think it works in safari too

204434
unix	bsd
kill command works under both linux and unix bsd like operating systems

204479
ssd	sata
is it as big a leap in performance from a sata ssd to a pcie as it was from a 7200rpm to an ssd

204511
ubuntu	linux
i have a linux ubuntu gateway where i block pretty much everything except exactly what i want public like apache and forwarding of the windows 7 packets

204532
adium	ichat
there are some configs that you could possibly use a jabber gateway to access webex connect so in theory adium or ichat would work

204539
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
is there any video format that is supported by all 4 major browser ie google-chrome firefox and opera

204539
vp8	ogg
the current selection is ogg h.264 and something called vp8 i believe

204542
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
safari google-chrome and ie will be supporting h.264 while firefox is going to continue supporting ogg

204542
google-chrome	firefox
in the near future the webm format from google will likely see support in both google-chrome and firefox presuming it remains unencumbered by patents

h.264	webm
so in conclusion in the near future it looks like encoding to both webm and h.264 is probably the best way to address both camps

204543
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
webm will be supported by ie firefox google-chrome and opera

204572

ethernet	wireless
there is another time capsule at the extreme end of the house that has fair to poor access to the airport in the middle and no access to main tc wireless but again is connected to ethernet

204881
ethernet	wireless
it is not clear to me but is seems that even though the remote base stations are connected to ethernet they actually share the connection wireless and ignore ethernet entirely

204913
vpn	lan
there you need a vpn to connect your laptop at home through internet to your workplace lan so you can access the server and run your applications as if you were at the office

205006
folder	directory
guest access is forbidden. i then see the entire users directory containing my user folder and all its contents

you should also consider that modern oses like linux use unused ram to cache data for faster disk access

205102
google-chrome	firefox
is there any some way to automatically synchronize firefox s with google-chrome s browsing history and viceversa

205134
versioning	upgrade
in the last few days the software was pestering me to upgrade to a new still free versioning which i decided to do today

205138
emacs	aquamacs
i read about aquamacs but apparently it is not a port of gnu emacs but it is just loosely based on gnu emacs.

205356
parallels	bootcamp
intuit puts bootcamp parallels fusion and virtual pc together in one question and says intuit has not tested nor do we support the use of a quickbooks for windows product on the above mentioned pc emulators. bootcamp is not an emulator it is a collection of windows device drivers for apple s hardware

205361
ubuntu	linux
however at the bottom of the how to page there s a section for verson 3.1 on ubuntu linux that says

205361
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu linux it seems that the functionality of the alt-gr key can t be modified by openoffice

205361

i also have a wireless keyboard and magic mouse

and if its firefox have you tried something like google-chrome ie opera or such

if you cannot afford the five minimum licences that you need to but i have heard that norton antivirus is now much improved since its very bad phase during the last decade and is built on the same engine as symantec corporate antivirus

206036
folder	directory
everything i ve found so far will only copy the files and folder contained in c test into c test2 but leaves out the parent directory

206043
robocopy	xcopy
i recommend robocopy over xcopy as it has a lot more options including keeping timestamps intact which i find essential

206055
mouse	keyboard
oh to do this you will also need a keyboard and a mouse plugged into the docking station

ssd	sata

206229
google-chrome	firefox
does google-chrome has anything similar to about blank page in ie and firefox

206251
debian	linux
it s a debian based linux distro that receives regular updates and has lots of available packages for you to work with

206254
norton	mcafee
i ve used avg mcafee and norton and norton appears to provide the most transparent view as to what it is doing as it has its own task manager and resource usage graph over time

206254
norton	mcafee
i don t work for any of them but i would recommend norton over mcafee as mcafee mysteriously periodically severely slowed down my machine for a minute or so on occasions

206254
norton	mcafee
re mcafee occasional cpu hog issue at appears that norton has its own version of this to my won discovery recently though i m not seeing such a thing as much as i had with mcafee

206255
gentoo	linux
personally i think arch linux is sufficient but if you d like to take things a step further towards the arcane workings of linux gentoo s your guy

206287
mouse	trackpad	mouse	keyboard

toolbar	tabs
is it possible to store multiple links under one bookmark and put it at my bookmarks toolbar so the links under it will open simultaneously in their respective tabs each time i click it

206437
udp	tcp
ethernet is the tube used to send the message ip is an envelope in the tube and tcp udp is a letter in the envelope

206437
puts	gets
the tube gets carried to another door where someone a router opens the tube reads the address puts it back in the tube and sends it through another door

206463
disk	ram
there are two major kinds of competitors for ram process memory which can be swapped out and disk caches which can be re-read from a file

206463
disk	ram
the figures you give with about half say 30 â 70 of the memory devoted to disk caches is typical for systems that have a reasonable amount of ram for the tasks they re supposed to do

206471
centos	linux
i have a choice of linux operating systems centos 5.5 fedora 13 suse 11 sp1

google-chrome	firefox
this happens with ie8 firefox in google-chrome the files seem to open correctly

i hope you understand that when you post a simply question you must post a lot of extra data in order to get a precise perfect answer

206623
put	get
what function could i put into b1 to get a reference to a4 the cell containing the last occurrence of 4

206709
pop-up	dialog

206740
versioning	upgrade
i decided to try a firmware upgrade on the mbwe to versioning 02.00.19

206740
versioning	upgrade
the firmware upgrade completed successfully but now the mbwe does not display the usb drive in the system summary like it did with the earlier firmware versioning

206742
pop-up	dialog
add ctrl + s to the list of shortcuts ctrl+s will now pop-up the save-as dialog instead of silently saving

206776
switching	screens
i even tried the registry hack to enable aero manually but when i try to switching to that in the personalize screens the system freezes

206787
wpa	radius
for a start my belkin control panel gives me the choice of wpa-psk no server and wpa with radius server

206799
spaces	delimiter
this might be an off the wall idea but try making the file into a spaces delimiter file then open it with excel

206811
ubuntu	linux
knowing that you re talking about an midi keyboard gilles not a typists keyboard you might want to look at this howto which explains how to get linux not ubuntu specifically to recognize your hardware

206817
folder	directory
secondly i only want to add the last modified folder to the archive no matter how many folder exist in directory

206829
pop-up	dialog
a dialog box will pop-up

206832
mouse	keyboard
think of the console as the monitor keyboard and mouse physically connected to the server

206846
filesystems	ntfs
boot from ubuntu livecd download here mount your windows ntfs disk filesystems by double clicking it in nautilus

206871
ftp	smb
alternatively you can run an smb client on your phone which will let explorer map browse to it directly without ftp

206892
daemons	systemd
if you re on a systemd that uses upstart or has a similar daemons systemd you should model your script after those and use the functions in lib lsb init-functions or similar

206911
cos	exp	cos	sin
excel is written in c c++ and uses 64 bit numbers it also uses the microsoft floating point libraries to calculate functions like sin cos and exp

206911

numerical methods where you add and multiplying numbers over and over again get ugly fast in floating point as the 15 digits of precision go away one digit every 4 multiplication

206932
lan	intranet
one centos box comes with 2 lan cards one is for intranet 192.168.30.5 one is for public access 210.102.1.50

206941
redhat	fedora
edit not that redhat fedora distros are the only ones out there including libvirt kvm qemu etc

206941
redhat	fedora
i m just saying that redhat fedora being the point of development for those technologies means you re getting the technologies on the platform they were developed around from the company they were developed in

206971
put	get
it s slow as heck but lets me get some things done that the other oss will not so i put up with it

206979
ssd	sata
if you re doing heavy bulk sequential writes then maybe you want to stick with rotating media but otherwise an ssd even on sata 2 will be a very significant improvement

206991
folder	directory
i want to be able to select multiple items in a folder some being directory and have their full paths passed to the vim command line

207038
mouse	keyboard
mouse can t move keyboard doesn t work the clock at the bottom left of the screen simply doesn t moving forward it s as if the passage of time stops completely for the machine

207050
vpn	lan
both locations are connected via a lan to lan vpn profile

207068
vpn	lan
1 check that you have setup the remote lan ip address and subnet masks correctly on both routers in the vpn definitions - if they are wrong you can often connect but get no proper routing or cannot get past the router onto the lan

207100
folder	directory
i then tested to see if it was just a permissions issue but i couldn t even create a folder in the home directory

207105
ubuntu	linux
the process scheduler is part of the linux kernel rather than something contributed to the gnu linux operating system by the ubuntu distribution

207117
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is just a eye-candified and glorified version of debian with couple of ubuntu-specific software pieces and a consistent theme thrown at it

207117
dpkg	apt
debian is famous of its package management so especially learn dpkg which takes care of single packages and apt which for example takes care of dependencies of those packages hey in order to install foo you also need bar

207117
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
debian ubuntu are typical linux distributions using gnu user-land components and linux kernel

207117
debian	linux
anyway at that point i became aware about the differences between debian and red hat and realized that there s not a one linux distribution but many and they are not all the same even if they are similar

207117
ubuntu	linux
so if you truly want to learn linux i suggest you not only to learn ubuntu but distro-hop between couple of distros and see how things can be different

207117
gentoo	linux
for bonus points install gentoo and truly learn about the internals of linux distributions

207117
gentoo	ubuntu
i can guarantee you that if you install and use gentoo you ll soon understand much much more about ubuntu too

207124
folder	directory
i only want to add last modified folder to archive no matter how many folder exist in directory i just need the latest

207189
ubuntu	linux
see also this article linux kiosk an ubuntu gnome lockdown scenario

207202
macbook	bootcamp
so go for bootcamp an other alternative would be to upgrade your macbook to 4gb ram and then run a vm on it

207225
mouse	keyboard
it doesn t wrap but instead uses keyboard shortcuts to let you jump the mouse cursor to a different monitor

207233
google-chrome	firefox
when in incognito mode google-chrome or in in-private browsing ie or private browsing firefox do any of the browsers store cookies and or cache temporary files on disk or is it all in memory

207262
bash	zsh
there is another avenue which depends on your login shell being bash or zsh

207273
cpu	processors
processors - pentium dual core cpu t4400 2.20 ghz

207280
mouse	keyboard
with a usb mouse plugged in and possibly a usb keyboard i should have better luck

207284
folder	directory
if you want to debug this just insert a new action up top get specified finder items dropping on any directory that has any files within it - although technically the filter finder items should also be able to return folder

207286
folder	directory
all profile data for firefox is kept in the profile folder in your home directory

207288
folder	directory
however like maqleod said it would be good to backup that folder probably .mozilla or .firefox in your home directory first

207290
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
on any regular linux distro running in single-user mode passing your program to x as the only program to run so without something like kde gnome xfce whatever does the trick

207333
subtract	add
firstly i do not want to round my numbers i am using base 10 figures so excel should have no bother doing simple add and subtract

207333
put	get
i ve put cell formatting to currency with 2 decimal placed and i will get the correct display value but for all calculations i will still get -4.9999...7 which leads to further errors with conditional formatting etc

207345
ubuntu	linux
for linux this depends upon the cloning software and os used ubuntu in your case but any static settings relating to network interfaces is a big one

207358
joystick	keyboard
autohotkey can access the joystick which you can use to trigger keyboard shortcuts and macros etc

207422
debian	linux
they also appear both in windows xp and debian gnu linux

207534
switching	screens
is there a way using the keyboard to switching from a maximized full screens remote desktop connection back to the main computer

207534
switching	screens
that is close but i would like a way to just minimize it so i don t have to normalize- switch- maximize each time i want to switching screens

207566
short	base
3 short - base 64k ram failure

207648
ssd	sata
since you don t have a sata ii controller getting an ssd is kind of a waste it will still be faster but not nearly as useful for the price if you hook it up to a sata i controller

207648
ssd	sata
if you have money to burn and are upgrading your pc soon go ahead and get an ssd if you just need more room than get a sata ii mechanical drive with a good cost space ratio generally

207671
ubuntu	linux
i found out that linux can run from a logical partition which you can have multiple of ..however i do not want to format my ubuntu partition and i d prefer to keep the data on there all intact

207671
ubuntu	linux
is there a way to move my ubuntu installation on the primary partition to an extended partition where i could put multiple logical partitions for multiple linux installations

207696
folder	directory
format the operating system but retain user data copies the files under users to c backup folder but when i searched deeper i found that there are some people who already tried this option and couldn t find their user files under backup directory

207714
ubuntu	linux
install arch linux on the old ubuntu partition

207725
hash	md5
once your photos are tagged or any metadata is changed i think the md5 hash will change

207843
des	aes	3des	aes
so for a variety of reason rijndael became aes which is the successor of des and 3des

207845
hide	show
in excel 2010 is it possible to hide columns but still have the values show up in a graph

207845
hide	show
if i hide the columns say for everything before 2010 then the graph only show the 2010 data

207865
disk	ram
there are two reasons why the filesystem might be damaged it could be a hardware problem most commonly a failing disk or failing ram or it could be a software bug

207865
disk	ram
if it finds problems change your ram then start thinking about recovery or move the disk to another machine if you need the data now

207946
opensuse	mint	opensuse	linux
i got a copy of opensuse 11.3 and linux mint 9 on a dual side dvd

207946
opensuse	mint
i want to run opensuse 11.3 again when i try to install either i tried mint when suse could not see my other hd s it only see s the ssd

208011
16-bit	64bit
this why you have powerful multigigahertz 8-core 64bit sse4+ processors that still boot up in 16-bit 640kb 8088 mode just in case you still want to run dos

208011
disk	ram
the floppy drive used dma to transfer data from disk to ram

208011
cpu	irq
the keyboard is irq 1 so the cpu can assume any interrupt from irq 1 is the keyboard and it can then read the appropriate i o ports to get the keycode

208032
switching	screens
when booting up and the screens goes blank using digital dvi source on the monitor i can switching the monitor to analog dvi and now get to see the desktop

208083
hash	md5
so use something like sha256 better or md5 still usefull although under attack tp calculate the hash

208097
post	get
if you cannot get post beeps then make sure all your fans are spinning video card and processor are really the most important

208106
mouse	keyboard
the cideko air keyboard moves the mouse pointer just as intended

ethernet	wireless
i ve got wireless and ethernet in the baby room so there may be an option to use those to hook up to a camera

208269
gentoo	linux
that being said i personally think gentoo would be a horrible choice for someone trying to learn how to use linux install packages etc

208269
ubuntu	linux
i would recommend ubuntu for anyone wanting to get into using linux only because things just seem to work without having to do too much mucking around

cifs	smb
many things use smb cifs

208365
ati	nvidia
also do they both have to be the same brand like both be ati or nvidia

208365
ati	nvidia
i know ati has that catalyst config utility so if you tried to mix brands would that clash with the equivalent nvidia config utility

208365
ati	nvidia
this matters to me because i already have a good ati card i like so if i bought a machine with an nvidia card i don t want to everything to get all fluxed up

you can use firefox safari or google-chrome

208552
disk	ram
is there a program that could give me a summary of a pc s spec - processor ammount of ram disk and so on

208572
minimum	max
best practice for this situation would be to set the page file minimum size to twice the size of your currently installed memory the max should be double the minimum

208573
disk	ram
speccy will give you detailed statistics on every piece of hardware in your computer including cpu motherboard ram graphics cards hard disk optical drives and audio support

208587
kindle	nook
later when b n released the nook app they deleted my .pdb files and replaced them with epub files that only worked with their app which is terrible compared to the kindle app

208588
disk	ram
if the ram is good leave it on it s own in your machine leave the cpu and the psu connected but remove all other ram cards disk peripherals

208597
disk	ram
one thing you need to check is that you have enough ram - if you don t the machine will have to lean back on it s swap file which will mean intensive disk i o

208597
disk	ram
if you suspect this is the case if you have a reasonably decent usb disk you can use readyboost to help improve the situation though a ram upgrade replacement would be preferable

208658
mouse	keyboard
you can disable or deactivate a monitor without having to physically unplug it allowing you to use a laptop in clamshell mode with external monitor keyboard and mouse

208668
asterisk	pbx
well you could do it by setting up your own asterisk server using something like trixbox or pbx in a flash

208668
voip	sip
not sure where you are purchasing your 0845 number but i got mine from voip.co.uk i have used them for about 3 years and as this will be a voip-based number it will tie straight into an asterisk-based system - the 0845 number should be dirt cheap too and you ll be able to divert it to any other number - i have just setup one that terminates at a sip voip client on my mobile phone

208736
restrict	shared
i have a few shared folders setup on the server with restrict permissions so that people visiting wouldn t be able to access those folders from their own computers

208769
folder	directory
normally the finder only allows you to specify a single directory to return search results fromâ if you want to search three separate directory you usually specify the shared parent to all those folder even if that means you end up having to specify

208769
folder	directory
the last problem is that that doing this will recursively search the resulting directoriesâ so if you have a folder within one of the result directory you ll see the folder in the results but also all of its contents

208769
folder	directory
what we really want is something similar to a --max-depth parameter so we only see the files and folder directly within each of the union-ed directory

208771

it should show all visible files folder in the directory

mouse	keyboard
also...you can often define your own custom keyboard shortcuts in os x by going to system preferences keyboard mouse keyboard shortcuts then adding a new shortcut that matches the name of the menu item you want to access

i don t care if the secondary router repeats the wireless signal as long as i can get an ethernet connection out of it

209016
mouse	keyboard
otherwise multiple users would be operating the keyboard and mouse simultaneously

209039
cpu	processors
if the machine is older and the cpu thermal paste is dirty dry it may be worth your efforts to pull the heatsink off the processors and re apply some thermal paste

209052
mouse	trackpad	mouse	keyboard
the mouse functionality of the keyboard is its least functional aspect in my opinion and i have always supplemented it with an external mousing device---usually in the past a trackball but now with an ergo trackpad mounted on the display area of the left hand because i am left handed

209068
tail	nohup
that would defeat the purpose of nohup use tail -f out.log instead

209441
opera	google-chrome
it works nice in opera and google-chrome too

209444
x86	64bit
they shouldn t be slower in 32 bit mode because they natively support the x86 instruction set but would be faster in 64bit because of the advantages of that mode more cpu registers 64bit operations etc.

you might have some luck with asking for a version bump in the debian bug tracker and could directly use that package in ubuntu then

209507
versioning	upgrade
it is easy to upgrade firefox to the latest versioning and install the latest flash plugin from within the virtual machine as explained in the discussion

209509
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu often do no track the absolutely latest minor revision of a package that is actively developed unless there are significant feature fixes or security updates and even in the even of such changes they will often backport the update for the significant change to the revision they do carry rather than picking up a whole new revision

209509
ubuntu	debian
this is particularly true of debian stable and ubuntu released in general and debian testing and ubuntu next close to release time when they are in a feature freeze state

209509
ubuntu	debian
take the risk of using the later release of the distribution debian testing or ubuntu next - squeeze and natty respectively at the moment even though it is still officially in testing

209509
ubuntu	debian
you may still need to do a compile step if libc has been updated significantly between the releases but this is still easier than using the upstream source as you get the debian ubuntu tweaked version they sometimes tweak initscripts and related utility parts to better fit with the rest of their system layout and chosen standard tools and apt aptitude can bring down updated source for you when there are updates in the repository

209509
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu natty currently carries 1.7.2.3-2 which probably means 1.7.2.3 with at least two back-ported updates from later revisions the same as debian queeze

209516
x86	64bit
during testing when i performed many benchmarks a few years ago on windows vista it was clear that running x86 32-bit operating systems on modern 64bit cpus was faster than running native 64bit operating systems

you don t have to buy special paper with capturx - you can print your own documents whether they are forms from excel note pads from ms-office onenote maps from arcgis or any pdf file

209566
mouse	keyboard
make sure your keyboard mouse and monitor are plugged in powered up and operational before you power-up the system

209571
cpu	processors
so unless you have a motherboard that can flash a bios from usb without a cpu plugged in i think a few high-end models can do this you ll need to first plug in a supported processors

209901
filesystems	ntfs
there is a driver that will allow you to use ntfs filesystems on a mac

209905
kde	gnome
kde tends to be more customizable out of the box than gnome has been--more options are exposed in the gui than with gnome

209905
kde	gnome
then again gnome has been more stable than kde over the past year or so as a result of kde s growing pains

209931
ubuntu	linux
if it doesn t you could boot your windows machine using an ubuntu or any other linux distro live cd and format it from there

209931
filesystems	ntfs
remember though to be wary of the limitations of fat32 especially on large partitions it is very inefficient in terms of space use for small files and badly prone to fragmentation though depending what you use the drive for this may not be a problem for you there is no journalling at all unlike ntfs ext3 4 and other modern filesystems so be extra sure that you properly sync umount eject the drive before unplugging lest the filesystems become corrupt and so on

starttls	smtps
depending on your email software you can use imaps and smtps to secure your traffic or starttls on imap and smtps to prevent passwords from traveling in the clear

211204
tunnel	lan	tunnel	vpn	vpn	lan
it should tunnel lan traffic to a vpn server running on the linux router

211204

bonus points if each lan port tunnel to a separate interface on the linux firewall and the device does not bridge traffic between local ports vlan-style isolation of lan ports

211224
folder	directory
start by enabling audit of both success failure of object access for files folder etc directory access privilege use and process tracking

211240
kde	gnome
on a side note you can always look at there is always gdm often part of the gnome package kdm often part of a kde package or xdm that can start a x automatically at boot time using an rc script and then get you to your favorite window manager once you ve logged in

211250
folder	directory
does performance improve if you segment the folder to have fewer files at the root level of the directory

211258

i am looking for a 802.11n simultaneous dualband wireless router with gigabit ethernet ports but is one that comes with open source firmware or can accept custom firmware that are open source

211269
rss	feed
the easy option would be to use an rss feed from the website if it has one

211269
rss	feed
rss feed can be made to require authentication but i am not sure if they can be encrypted

211269
rss	feed
if the site does not have a rss feed the harder option would be to learn python and use the mechanize or scrapy frameworks to scrape the site and output the data in some form that is convenient to you

211307
mouse	keyboard
i am quite proficient with the keyboard and try to only use the mouse when necessary

211407

211460
ssl	https
beware that regarding kb ssl enforcer https everywhere looks rather cautious

211466
xfce	gnome
xfce is a good window manager but ubuntu s build is a little heavy imo it loads most of the gnome libraries

211474
vmware	virtualbox
i ve noticed that vmware workstation virtualbox slows right now when running multiple virtual machines.

211517
disk	ram
for total ram amounts on the host machine know that after about 80 total ram utilization esx will begin using the disk caching which is always far slower than ram just like virtual memory in the os even if you are hosting that on an ssd

211521
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i have installed safari for windows 5.0.2 and it correctly displays all my other browsers google-chrome internet explorer and mozilla firefox in this instance

211521
google-chrome	safari
what versions of safari and google-chrome are you using

211524
fink	macports
the fink and macports projects can help extend the toolsets you can learn with as well

211538

211538
ppp	dhcp
## if you are not using daemon-mode configure cron and dhcp or ppp

mouse	keyboard
15 monitor keyboard optical mouse

211627
unix	bsd
i like macs and it does give a good bsd unix experience but strictly on getting a linux experience on your pc i feel there are better alternatives

211646
vmware	virtualbox
the idea is to spin up a copy of w2k8 on virtualbox vmware on some spare machine just running remote desktop gateway

211674
versioning	upgrade
if a driver crashes during the install the windows 7 upgrade will eventually fail windows vista will be rolled back and the error this versioning of windows could not be installed will appear on the screen

211696
subclipse	mercurialeclipse
i then reinstalled the subclipse and mercurialeclipse plugins and svn mercurial show up as team synchronization options

211697
installation	upgrade
the installation guy said that the green cabinet i am connected to was the second one in the country to be upgrade to vdsl

211716
google-chrome	firefox
in the event that it is impression-based and not based on clickthroughs some ad blockers actually prevent the ads from loading adblock plus for firefox is a good example whereas others like adthwart for google-chrome just hide them

211747
ethernet	wireless	wan	lan
i am on windows 7 and wan to use my wireless connection for all the internet traffic and my ethernet wired connection my lan for connection to local office network

switching	screens
when windows is started or unlocked while not the active computer on the switching the screens resolution is set to 1024 x 768 on the switched screens

211807
switching	screens
the issue is that the kvm switching is reporting a max resolution of 1024 x 768 and i can t get windows to detect that there s another screens at the end of the cable without a reboot

211834
vmware	bootcamp
hey guys i m currently trying to ditch bootcamp in favour of vmware fusion

211870
debian	linux

211881
ati	nvidia
which family should i choose ati amd or nvidia

211881
ati	nvidia
does ati amd have an advantage over nvidia as novoue is completely reverse engineered versus some info available for ati amd

211957
folder	dir
ok so it looks like doing a dir from cmd lists only one desktop folder - the yellow one

211980
pop-up	dialog
i believe you can drag the file over again and then when the dialog pop-up to ask if you want to overwrite the existing file select resume instead

211990
ethernet	wireless
basically your laptop with wireless internet will share that connection with your desktop pc through an ethernet cable running between the two computers...you will need to go into the properties of your wireless internet on your laptop and check allow other network users to connect through this computer s internet connection

211995
put	get
the first time i put it in a usb port windows 7 tries to detect it and install a driver but i get a device driver was not successfully installed

212035
mouse	keyboard
if you really need 3d speed over 1-2 monitors and want to have only shared keyboard mouse two xmonads though - get synergy2

212045
filesystems	ntfs
wubi solves the problem partially as it allows me to boot into an ubuntu installation that is stored on a filesystems entirely within an ntfs file

212054
mouse	keyboard
especially considering i can do my method without taking my hands off the keyboard to use the mouse at all

212070
tunnel	vpn	tunnel	packets
my guess is you are seeing slow speeds due to fragmentation as a 1500 mtu is being pushed from the secondary computer to the primary the one with the vpn connection then overhead is being added the packets are being fragmented and moved through your vpn tunnel

212090
kde	gnome
i don t know about gnome but kde 4.x has a configure window behavior.

212099
folder	directory
here is a list of all the files and folder inside the directory of the installer

212134
umask	chmod
if you can enforce that applications that create files in this directory run with umask 007 and create files with no restriction on permissions and run with group www-data as their effective or supplementary group then all you need to do is chmod g+s repository.git

212134
ubuntu	debian
install the acl command line tools you need the acl package on debian or ubuntu

212139
google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome cookie switcher and swap my cookies are similar to firefox s cookieswap

212187
folder	directory
i had a similar problem and it turned out it was now looking at root .virtualbox virtualbox.xml so i just copied the xml file from my home directory to folder in root

212194
sudo	passwd
the reason truecrypt requires your administrator passwd is that it uses low level commands to create the proper devices and mount the filesystem and these commands in turn require root access which the administrator acquires indirectly via sudo

212208
ati	nvidia
ati and nvidia both list the percentage of improvement for specific games in their change logs when a new driver is released

212208
ati	nvidia
based on experience only i would estimate that an nvidia card would yield better benchmark results due to driver improvements over time than an ati card with respect to their original performance levels

212208
ati	nvidia
nvidia is typically known as having pretty good drivers an area where ati is often lacking though ati often makes up for lacking drivers with more impressive hardware

212223
cpu	processors
highly likely to be a dead supply though i have seen similar problems with the processors yes the actual cpu dead as well

212309
installation	upgrade
i downloaded visual studio 2008 sp1 from here vs2008 sp1 installed it it said that the installation was successful restarted the machine but nothing has changed in visual studio help - about and the sql server 2008 setup still tells me that visual studio 2008 is not upgrade to the sp1

212347

212710
wan	lan	lan	localhost
apologies as i didn t spot the relevant comment the first time i read the question or i would of said this initally but since you cannot ssh from the machine to itself this could well indicate a problem in this area this is assuming you are connecting to its lan ip or localhost and not the wan ip

212752
width	height
that is if the image is for example 100x100 width x height i need it to be 100x104 width x height

212789
centos	linux
i need to create an ssh connection between two linux machines running centos v5 but the latency could be as high as 25 seconds

212918
mouse	keyboard
today i copied this vm onto my home pc which is also windows 7 64-bit but with a g15 usb keyboard and mx518 usb mouse

212918
mouse	keyboard
for some reason the vm does not accept input from the keyboard or mouse which makes it almost impossible to use

212918
mouse	keyboard
my keyboard and mouse show up as usb devices in the bottom-right of the vmware player window and if i click them i have the standard option to connect disconnect from host

212918
mouse	keyboard
it seems like vmware is seeing my keyboard and mouse as usb devices and not input devices

212922
google-chrome	firefox
i have a pc that has equally severely degraded performance across all browsers ie firefox google-chrome however the underlying connection seems ok pings google at 40ms and the other pc i have on the same hub is fine

213051
ubuntu	linux
i can do this easily in autohotkey on windows but i m struggling on linux ubuntu lucid

213087
folder	directory
note also that you don t need to put int in system32 it s better is you put it in the rcurl directory ms no longer recommends putting libraries in system folder because of dll hell

213106
google-chrome	firefox
before switching to google-chrome i always used firefox and i always really liked how you could type into the address bar and it would search a fuzzy search

213119
x86	64bit
intel pentium 800 mhz 32-bit x86 64bit x64 or above or compatible

213222
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
as a work around i might recommend firefox in one space google-chrome in another and safari in a third.

213254
disk	ram
for performance you want to have as much ram as possible so that all the data you need is loaded from disk once

213259
mouse	keyboard
i came across some software a few years ago that allows different computers even running different os to share a single common keyboard and mouse

213264
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
some example websites are - ovi s sign in page although share.ovi.com loads fine and nokia.com loads fine live mail works on google-chrome ium and opera but not on firefox both 3.6 and 4 and other random websites

213269
debian	centos
i have no experince with centos or similar only debian

213277
ethernet	wireless
that can happen if windows was reinstalled and on reinstall the wired and wireless ethernet drivers weren t then installed

213280
mouse	keyboard
synergy makes it so that you can use one keyboard and mouse with four different pcs macs or linux desktops in a seamless fashion

213320
google-chrome	firefox
basically if you want to block and ad in google-chrome you have to block it in firefox first unless you know the syntax for blacklisting ads manually

213336
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
i currently use graphicsmagick but there s no commitment - i ll switch to imagemagick if it makes things easier

213346
ubuntu	linux
but if you have no choice cause you only have one pc for example then i would at least suggest you use a more modern linux distro such as ubuntu 10 even as old as ubuntu 7

213346
ubuntu	linux
but if you can t do that then it gets a little more complicated with linux where i secondarily suggest using ubuntu rather than knoppix or even ultimate boot cd

213355
disk	ram
so i would suggest to disconnect every possible device and internal card and strip the computer to just ram one disk and cd drive

213362
mouse	keyboard
try removing all the non critical hardware and booting it up with only your boot hdd a single ram stick keyboard mouse and onboard graphics

213400
google-chrome	firefox
this problem also affects firefox and ie it s just that google-chrome is my default browser

213413

filesystems	xfs
i would like to know if it is possible to mount an xfs filesystems on a mac as i want to use xfs on my flash drive

213421
filesystems	xfs
it could however be possible to find a port of the xfs filesystems to fuse which would be a hacky solution but still work

213425
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
another option that gets less attention than homebrew macports or fink is rudix

213427
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome s extensions aren t as good as firefox so i m not ready to switch but videos run so much smoother and more efficiently without the flash layer in between

213446

213622
wan	lan	wan	subnet
i ended up turning dir-655 into an access point turning off dhcp and pluging cable from pix lan interface into one of the lan interfaces on dir-655 and leaving wan port empty that works as far as dir-655 being on the same subnet now and i can access every machine

213670
versioning	upgrade
i used to run windows 7 32 bit but installed the 64 bit versioning because of a ram upgrade

since you mention that you can make normal https requests fine get but not your post request i think you should also check if you have mod_security running in apache and try to rule out it being a problem with that

just one key from the keyboard and one mouse click no matter where the mouse pointer is

214221
mouse	keyboard
so the question how can we show the browser but have the keyboard and mouse locked from any unauthorized access

214221
mouse	keyboard
it s important that the keyboard and mouse can be used when the machine is unlocked and highly desirable that the unlocking can be done quickly 30 seconds

214222
mouse	keyboard
just remove keyboard and mouse altogether and manage the mac remotely with vnc

214242
mouse	keyboard
people would still be able to use the mouse and keyboard but they wouldn t be able to do much with them

disk	ram
does it discard the ram away that was used by programs or transfer it to a page file on the hard disk

214532
afp	smb	ftp	smb
the mac-mini is on the same workgroup and the files are shared via smb ftp and afp

214534
disk	ram
basically what ram free ers do is that they reserve large amounts of ram forcing windows to swap other programs to disk and then freeing the ram they reserved

214550
disk	ram
since ram is faster than hard disk at worst case you will see a reduction in speed

214558
bash	zsh
doing the same but opening the file from bash zsh

214578
sudo	passwd
as the user sana when i execute the command in the shell sudo -u randeel usr bin wine cmd c wscript some.vbs it prompts for a passwd

214579
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
if you are not logged on as the root user of your system using sudo will ask you for your passwd and check that you are in the sudoers file

214579
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
adding yourself to the sudoers file does not prevent you from having to enter a passwd to use sudo it enables you to use sudo in the way you are experiencing

214611
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
in fat and ntfs filesystems a volume

214630
disk	ram
ram free ers are forcing other programs to swap most of their pages out to disk often by allocating lots of memory

214630
disk	ram
this doesn t actually give you more ram obviously but if you use faster disk for your paging files then the times involved in swapping pages in and out of memory will be lower and therefore less noticeable

214666
mouse	keyboard
according to this blog post xbindkeys can be used to bind mouse buttons as well as keyboard keys

versioning	upgrade
it is not clear to me if i can buy the upgrade versioning of windows 7 professional if the versioning i have is windows xp home or whether i can only buy the non-upgrade full versioning

214730
versioning	upgrade
can i buy the upgrade versioning of windows 7 pro even though i have windows xp home

214732
versioning	upgrade
yes you can buy the upgrade versioning no problem

214732
versioning	upgrade
technically you can buy the upgrade versioning even if you haven t previously owned windows

214732
versioning	upgrade
you are just limited to the one computer so if you upgrade your motherboard you are supposed to use a different versioning

214753
antivirus	norton
i would never install norton antivirus on my machine maybe it s just luck because it always crashed my pc

214783
ubuntu	linux
i m working on linux specifically ubuntu 10.10

214819
google-chrome	firefox
does google-chrome have an equivalent for firefox foxyproxy

214828
kde	gnome
annoyingly on linux it requires a gnome or kde environment

214829
ubuntu	linux
i want to uninstall win7 from my linux dual boot system and also want to remove booting option so that after removing windows it should automatically boot my ubuntu

214832
versioning	upgrade
on technet they say that upgrade across architecture 32 bit to 64 bit or sku home to professional or language are all forbidden yet on the actual order page they specifically say that any versioning of xp or vista qualifies

214834
bash	zsh
it won t notice anything if you start vim from bash or zsh

214849
vim	notepad++
i like the vim dark blue style in notepad++ but i want to use it with lucida instead of consolas

214879
titlebar	window
what i normally use is double-clicking the titlebar of the window

214894
photoshop	fireworks
i know fireworks better then photoshop but the general de-facto out there is photoshop

214919
photoshop	fireworks
for people creating mainly online content fireworks probably has most all the features they need and probably suits their workflow better than photoshop

mtu	pppoe
furthermore pppoe is the number one bringer of mtu problem for home users

214926

permanently debian and derivatives such as ubuntu if not using network manager

214926

214959
versioning	upgrade	migrate	upgrade
if you use zinstall xp7 to upgrade you can upgrade from any windows xp vista versioning to any windows 7 versioning home professional ultimate - this program will migrate all of your programs files to the new os

214970
mp3	flac
sometimes i doubt that flac files are made from original music because of deaf-dumb-blind feelings typical to mp3 s or because turning the highest frequencies on equalizer give no effect on sound

214982
daemons	systemd
simply enable it in the ssh daemons running on the systemd

214994
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i just downloaded a zip file using wget google-chrome firefox and safari and as expected the wget download has no extended attributes the browser downloads have as they re aware of that feature

214994
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome set both wget neither

215007
google-chrome	firefox
note that this uses the old cookies.txt file format rather than the sqlite database format that firefox and google-chrome currently use

215007
google-chrome	firefox
using firefox or google-chrome go to the site and log in

215032
wan	lan
here are screencaps of the wan and lan configuration for this attempt

215053
versioning	upgrade
however due to the lack of support for xen by ubuntu i can t easily upgrade to more recent versioning of the operating system

215053
cpu	processors
my current cpu an intel pentium 4 processors 640 is not kvm-compatible does not provide vt-x or amd-v

215102

first apple added this to safari for mac os x 10.4 then it was added to google-chrome chromium issue 22289 and there is an outstanding enhancement request to add it to firefox bug 337051

215107
ssd	sata
i would also like them both to share my two internal sata hard drives which is generally where all my additional files that are kept aside from the apps on the ssd that i use all the time

you might still have grubâ 1 if you upgrade but new installation get grubâ 2.

215149

215164
vpn	lan
if your company allows access to the lan via a vpn you can set up the vpn connection on the android

215173
bmp	png
png is better than bmp in my work and i too often forgot to change the file type before clicking save

215190
wpa	radius
for example many clients drivers do not support the wpa enterprises as well as radius

215191
folder	directory
i need to a folder into the programdata directory

215202
wan	lan

now the run as admin dialog pop-up

215236
ubuntu	linux
is there a way to get the matching linux kernel headers automatic on a regular kernel update via the ubuntu packed manager

215267
filesystems	ntfs
in general ntfs filesystems is recommended anyway for several reasons

215295
perl	tcl
but the risk of trouble with autoconf finding something it shouldn t under usr local needs to be balanced about the maintenance nuisance having two three or four different different copies of perl tcl and ruby each with different coverage of their different package libraries

215295
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
since my experience with macports and fink has typically been exasperation caused by exactly this and at some point switching to compiling the old-fashioned way to usr local i was pleased to see that homebrew didn t mess about with that

215295
macports	homebrew
homebrew in this respect at least does things the way they used to be done and macports tries not to interfere

215329
folder	directory
bootsect is located inside the boot folder so change your directory to boot

215346
daemons	systemd
it runs as a daemons on your systemd so your machine still needs to be on

215356
google-chrome	firefox
but when i set the cursor in a textbox in my browser ie9 beta firefox 3.6 or google-chrome 8.0 beta it scans correctly but opens the download dialog afterwards

215360
folder	directory
when browsing a directory in any of the transferred drives the only option available in the new context menu is folder right-click inside a folder new folder this is similar behavior for win7 when using the context menu in c program files

215360
folder	directory
however whenever creating a new folder within any of the directory all the context menu new items are available within the new folder

215360
folder	directory
again since i m an administrator on my system and the administrators group already has full control of the drive directory folder why should i have to explicitly add my user name to the security permissions

215369
ssd	sata
i have a very very insane problem with my ssd sata harddisk

215405
ubuntu	linux
i m planning on building a home file server with a few 2 tb drives and i wanted to use software raid 5 under linux most likely ubuntu

215440
freebsd	linux
the options read should include a device name e.g ttys0 or ttyd0 for the first serial port on a linux or freebsd system respectively

215471
disk	ram
i think this is because on wakeup the system has to read 24gb of ram from the hard disk non ssd while on boot-up the system has to read much a much smaller amout and from an ssd to boot pun intended

215499
udp	tcp
currports is network monitoring software that displays the list of all currently opened tcp ip and udp ports on your local computer

215499
udp	tcp
in addition currports allows you to close unwanted tcp connections kill the process that opened the ports and save the tcp udp ports information to html file xml file or to tab-delimited text file

215499
udp	tcp
currports also automatically mark with pink color suspicious tcp udp ports owned by unidentified applications applications without version information and icons

215528

i can get wireless working successfully without encryption but when i try and use wpa-psk wpa_supplicant gets stuck in a loop between group_handshake and completed as shown in the log attached to the ubuntu forum post

215608
ethernet	wireless
he does not have a wireless router instead he connects his laptop directly to the internet using an ethernet lead and modem

215651
l2tp	dhcp
i have an edimax router that is set up to connect to the internet via l2tp on cable and on the lan side it s set up as a dhcp server

215670
kde	gnome
the desktop that most distros run kde gnome is just another program like for example firefox

215670
ubuntu	linux
to answer your question then any type of linux will do but since you haven t any interest in running a desktop environment you can safely get any server type of distro ubuntu server for example

215676
ssd	sata
from what i have worked with the drives actually do all the work and the board just pairs them togehter and due to the fact that ssd drives have the same hook ups as a regular sata drive i dont think you will need to look for a ssd raid card specificaly just a good quality sata raid card should do the trick

215705
google-chrome	firefox
being a firefox 4 beta 7 user myself your question inspired me to try the first option listed there link target display which takes the same approach as google-chrome does

215755
put	get
so poor performance from wifi is normal at all times and when you put the equipment close to the ground floor it should be expected to get worse

215780
post	get
i m going to post the steps i took to eventually get the results i was looking for

215802
128bit	64bit
in ipv6 the 64bit host part of the full 128bit address is often automatically generated from the mac address and hence might be visible to the server one connects to

215813
cpu	processors
this has a system information window you can open which will show a totally cpu use or a checkbox to show utilisation of each processors core

215813
cpu	processors
it sounds like the reason you see 20 - 25 is that the jobs where you make the measurement are bounded to a single cpu which is running pretty much flat out the others are idling because the tasks you are doing can t exploit multiple processors

215830
put	get
that sticker was sitting right on the little round metal plate which i guess is the actual button where someone else put some additional material to apparently get more pressure in an origami solution to the apple macbook trackpad â œsquishyâ button problem

215843
rss	feed
i am looking to a rss feed reader or system for mac os x that checks every minute or so the feed and when there are changes it sends me instantly an email

215922
google-chrome	firefox
it is not happening in firefox which may indicate this is a google-chrome problem but not seeing any scrolling options in google-chrome settings

215938
folder	directory
so basically i could rip a cd to a certain directory in flac format then this app would see that new files were added to the folder and convert them to mp3s into another folder preferably

215944
mp3	flac
mp3fs is a fuse filesystem for converting flac into mp3

215951
width	height
where h height w width subscript i is image and subscript m is monitor

215952
width	height
height width hight-to-width ratio

215969
mouse	keyboard
for a long time i ve wanted a small computer to use for video chat with family members across the world that i can situate next to the hdtv and with a wireless keyboard mouse so i can video chat from the couch

215969
mouse	keyboard
i m not too keen on plugging things into the mini s usb ports other than keyboard mouse

215997
post	put
in the one instance i ve accidently tried to put an am2+ into an am2 board some asus it didn t post

216033
ati	nvidia
i m trying to determine which is the better of these two video cards 128mb nvidia geforce 8600gt card while the other has a 512mb ati radeon x1650 card

216033
ati	nvidia
on the one hand the ati has substantially more vram but the nvidia supports d3d 10 and sm4.0 as opposed to d3d 9.0c sm3.0 that the ati supports

216033
ati	nvidia
also i have always heard better things about nvidia cards compared to ati cards

216033
ati	nvidia
looking at the ati table and the nvidia table seems to indicate that the nvidia is better but then again the nvidia table also says that the geforce 8600gt is a pci-e card with at least 256mb even though the card in question is an agp with 128mb

216033
ati	nvidia
it looks like the ati card is not supported in windows 7 while the nvidia card is which i suppose is also a factor though not quite as immediately relevant as performance.

216074
centos	linux
i asked a question on stack overflow a while ago about learning to use linux and since then i ve installed centos 5 on a local machine to match my host

216075
redhat	fedora
for cutting edge support on the redhat distribution suite you might consider fedora which is where they put all the newest stuff which is more likely to support things like newer hardware .

216077
ubuntu	centos
have one partition for centos root another for ubuntu and then another for home home thus all your custom data is mounted the same on both setups.

216077
ubuntu	centos
alternatively you could run in ubuntu and then run centos as a virtual system.

216102
filesystems	ntfs
what filesystems type should i make it linux hpfs ntfs fat16...

216131
gtk	cairo
gtk and metacity are perfectly fine with using svg via cairo in order to render controls and window decorations

216133
udp	tcp
my first attempt was to block incoming and outgoing by default then allow both udp and tcp port 443 from any computer to any computer both in and out

216134
udp	tcp
to browse the web you will need to allow dns as well udp port 53 and tcp too but not so much

216215
ubuntu	linux
does all the memory show up on a 64 bit linux livecd like ubuntu for example

216226
spyware	antivirus
uncheck anything thatâ s not a firewall antivirus spyware sound drive anything you need to run your computer properly etc

216263
putty	winscp
the ssh code of winscp is based on putty so file transfers with the ssh-based protocols cannot be expeceted to be faster than putty

216315
versioning	upgrade
you say it is not possible on that versioning of pulseaudio and then i can only recommend you to recheck syntax or upgrade in some way

216318
google-chrome	firefox
i have personally seen it in firefox but supposedly this also happens in google-chrome

216323
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari can browse the internet fine but i can t ping google.com or apple.com

216323
bazaar	git
i have also found that bazaar fails but git works for some reason

216327
ubuntu	linux
i ve assembled a document explaining how to install and configure tinc on windows 7 and ubuntu 10.10 linux which should help you with the windows 7 xp clients

216357
put	get
sorry didn t get the make of the nas when we put his compact flash card from his camera into his card reader everything works fine

216363
pppoe	dhcp
you need to use pppoe if your modem is in bridge mode or use dhcp if your modem is in lan mode with dhcp server on

216366
ubuntu	debian
i simply love the debian package management structure and philosophy combined with the regular releases easier hardware detection and large community of ubuntu

216403
ubuntu	linux
the easiest way to install linux is to burn yourself an ubuntu boot disk or if your hardware supports it an ubuntu boot usb stick

216422
hid	joystick
i have an hid compliant usb device that purports that it will be detected as a joystick in linux

216422
centos	linux
i am using linux centos 5.5

216430
screens	tablet
my wacom intuos works without the pen having to touch the tablet as that is how you move the mouse pointer around the screens

216479
joystick	keyboard
if a usb device has no such driver that is loaded does this mean that the handler used is an event handler rather than a specific handler such as joystick or keyboard

216496
putty	winscp
i was thinking of using a combination with netcat having it listen to either winscp or putty sftp doesn t matter which

216502
filesystems	ntfs
if you want the filesystems to be readable and writable on both windows and linux use ntfs

216529
ubuntu	linux
here s an ubuntu installation cloning guide also linux installation cloning thread with a generic linux cloning guide

216543
http.sys	httplistener
httplistener uses http.sys

216567
filesystems	hfs+
your external hard drive is formatted as hfs+ the mac os x filesystems

216609
rtsp	sdp
hi can you tell me how to manually create the sdp file i want to play through the rtsp server

216623
debian	linux
like windows linux debian etc

216683
filesystems	ntfs
1 filesystems security comes to mind there is no way to translate between linux s security bits and windows ntfs acl

216713
multiplying	add
just add your signature as a layer set the blend to multiplying or darken and you are done

216718
rar	zip
if file names are too long first try to zip rar 7z them with an archive application and then copy the archive file to your local computer and then extract the contents

216776
disk	ram
if you want temporary web storage to be totally volatile look into ram disk software

216823
google-chrome	firefox
ideally this would be for google-chrome or firefox

216840
nas	qnap
i ve considered getting a commercial raid nas qnap or synology but hesitate because i want to be absolutely confident regarding disaster recovery

216849
sudoers	passwd
also in ubuntu there is no root user that you can log in as unless you re-enable it or you su to it from another user so the computer does not have a root passwd -- you only have to provide your own passwd if you exist in the sudoers file in etc i believe in order to gain root capabilities

216876
folder	directory
if you enter it in a terminal or with alt+f2 it will first ask for your password and then open a folder view of your home directory from where you can navigate normally

216878
spoofing	traffic
however most mitm attacks on ethernet or wlan use arp spoofing to redirect traffic

216882
ssd	sata
i have finally made a move to ssd ocz agility 2 oczssd2-2agte240g 2.5 240gb sata ii mlc internal solid state drive but using it without encryption makes me nervous.i ve searched here and elsewhere but can t seem to see if whole disk encryption will steal my awe with ssds performance

216914
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari couldn t write to their cache folder

216961
afp	smb
then set it as afp if you are both on a mac or smb if the other user is on a pc

216962
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i run both linux ubuntu mint and fedora and win7 on this machine

216962
ubuntu	linux
i have enabled and disabled automatic updates on both win7 and ubuntu linux

216978
cpu	processors
if i type ipconfig all is the physical address refers to the serial address number of the cpu or the processors

216979
cpu	processors
and for the cpu processors id you might get what you need with win32_processor

216999
temp	tmp
tmp launch-qggkph org.macports 0 or similarly named temp file

217005
onenote	ms-office
microsoft too provides an online ms-office web apps companions to microsoft word excel powerpoint and onenote to access view and edit documents directly from a browser

217135
xfce	gnome
the secondary screen really annoys me but all of the new terminals like xfce or gnome seem to have no way to disable this like xterm does

217135
switching	screens
it feels like i m being really picky but i sure would love to be able to use xfce and have a terminal that both remembers where it was and doesn t do the screens switching

217139
trojan	virus
you might want to try and run an online virus scanner or attempt to install avg antivirus to see if the initial scan before install is able to catch the trojan

217163
disk	ram
and much ram do you have and what is the free disk space on your drive

217181
dropbox	skydrive

217332
mp4	h.264
i tried setting folder options to always show icons never thumbnails disables thumbnails on the same folder with mp4 h.264 video files and explorer doesn t crash if the mp4 thumbnails aren t shown

217332
mp4	h.264
i tried testing in other folders containing other video formats with always show icons never thumbnails set to off like .avi xvid without an mp4 h.264 file and windows explorer shows the thumbnails fine without crashing

217332
mp4	h.264
i have not currently experienced problems with other formats only mp4 h.264

217379
freebsd	debian	ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	debian
first off i m a freebsd noob but i ve done quite a bit of debian ubuntu redhat

217409

it also looks like ati and nvidia report their specifications a bit differently making it harder to directly compare the two

217427

217463
linefeed	delimiter
i have a text file which consists of tab delimiter fields terminated with a cr linefeed

217491

217814
udp	tcp
there are very few circumstances in which udp is preferable to tcp

217814
udp	tcp
there are two requirements for a network packet udp or tcp to trigger an action on the destination machine

217814
udp	tcp
you re more likely to be able to bypass a firewall over tcp especially over https which firewalls generally can t block selectively so have to let by to permit web browsing than over udp

217817
bluetooth	usb
if it is possible i believe it can only be achieved with usb and maybe bluetooth headsets

217908
disk	ram
if you have your loved ones please share its components cpu ram mainboard hard disk case power supplier ect. with me

217922
disk	ram
my conclusion for the main parts 8gb ram with appropriate 64bit os 4-6 core cpu with hardware virtualization support fast system disk s with raid large enough data disk

217929
installation	upgrade
if you end up reinstalling windows before installing office 2010 64-bit my recommendation if you must upgrade you will need to be all the more careful and particular about manually reinstating your preferences and settings after the windows office installation

217942
ethernet	wireless
i have a wired ethernet port and a wireless port

217942
ethernet	wireless
i have a device connected directly to my pc running windows 7 by means of the ethernet port and the device connects to the internet which is available over the wireless network

on my p4 machines i use google-chrome or chromium instead of firefox - it s just plain faster

218159
cpu	processors
so cpu should not be your problem unless your trying to edit videos or something otherwise processors intensive basic e-mail web browsing document writing is not processors intensive - though watching flash videos can be thank you adobe

218200
wan	lan
when i disable that all lan systems resolve correctly but internet wan address cease to resolve at all

218234
folder	directory
but if it will be possible to change per-user links that for each user the mount folder will point another directory then we will be able to change some links as we want

218288
ubuntu	linux
altrough you could also try to start your computer with some live cd linux ubuntu and test that video file with linux just to confirm that is some kind of os problem

218318
google-chrome	firefox
i have not been able to reproduce the problem in google-chrome or firefox

218329
filesystems	ntfs
for example if you are running ntfs filesystems then you can use the ntfs compression tools

218351
tunnel	packets
these dummy adapters are called automatic tunnel pseudo-interface for encapsulating ipv6 packets with an ipv4 header so that they can be sent across an ipv4 network

218368
pop-up	dialog
in the resulting new image from folder dialog box choose dvd cd master and none from the encryption pop-up menu

218385
disk	ram
involves writing into the hard disk all the data needed to restore ram when os os booted up again

218403
debian	linux
backup source is on win7 64 bit destination is a remote linux box debian

218403
truecrypt	umount
the question is now how can i make rsync not only open an ssh connection and starting the rsync daemon but also to mount the truecrypt volume before and umount it after

218411
disk	ram
the misunderstanding here is that not all ram contents are swappable to disk

218452
google-chrome	firefox
but if i understand it correctly it also depends on the applications used on my computer a lot of memory is used by web browsers google-chrome firefox

218486
mouse	keyboard
measuring if your mouse and keyboard

218544
hash	md5
i m no stranger to linux bash perl etc. so i could write something to copy and compare md5 hash but i was wondering if something already exists reinvention wheels and what-not

218575
ubuntu	mint
i used a ubuntu variant mint and it modfiy the terminal each time i start a terminal it given characters like belows

218594
disk	ram
it would be too expensive to keep copying the ram to disk all the time when you don t need to

218617
xfce	kde
finally it might also have been from the applications - settings - xfce 4 settings - session and startup - advanced the launch kde services on startup i had disabled and then re-enabled later

218617
kde	gnome
if you run into this problem and gnome or kde are disabled in this box try enabling it

218618
filesystems	hfs+
ubuntu has as far as i know support for the osx filesystems hfs+

218630
tunnel	lan
there are settings for allowing inbound ssh to a computer within my lan but i can find no setting for how to allow outgoing tunnel

218630
tunnel	lan
does anyone know how to make an ssh tunnel to a remote site from one of the lan computers when connecting through an airport extreme

218648
xfce	gnome
go into the settings application xfce applications - settings - xfce 4 settings gnome system - preferences etc and modify the applications that are started for your session

218656
width	height
note that while 2.5 laptop hard drives are a uniform size in length and width they can vary in height

218693
switching	screens
if i lock the screens win+l there is a button switching users beneath the login prompt

218693
switching	screens
i can get directly to this screens by selecting switching users from the shutdown widget on the start menu

218693
switching	screens
i also found instructions on creating a shortcut to go directly to the switching users screens

218857
versioning	upgrade
after ubuntu upgrade some time ago from rather ancient versioning my lenovo s10 netbook fan does not stop

218903
wan	lan
all the free versions just show graphs on current usage for the wan lan and wireless network interfaces

218943
disk	ram
curious to know does using a ram disk in the mac os x operating system make sense in terms of performance and speed

218943
disk	ram
for more context i was thinking of moving my browser s cache folder google chrome to this newly created ram disk

218948
disk	ram
but consider a ram disk takes memory from all tasks including the os

218948
disk	ram
i m leaving the answer up for the comments about ram disk grawity s counter-example notwithstanding

218949
subnet	packets
a packets sniffer can capture packets information within its subnet even if these packets are not addressed to your computer

218975
ubuntu	linux
if you want to learn linux in particular and not just ubuntu certainly the best place to start is linux from scratch it will allow you to get a much deeper understanding of the linux kernel and how features fit around it

218997
opera	google-chrome
i am not able to connect to the internet using my google-chrome and opera browser while i am able to browse perfectly using firefox.i am using windows 7 and my connection is adsl and using a netgear wireless router

218999
opera	google-chrome
if it is set that way check the current rules to see if google-chrome and opera have been blocked

219016
ati	nvidia
from this table it would appear the current generation intel hd integrated graphics are about equal to the lowest end discrete ati nvidia cards of 3 generations ago nvidia 6600 or ati x1400

219016
ati	nvidia
that is 4 steps slower than the intel hd graphics nvidia fx 5200 or ati 9200

move	drag
if you re not sure which operation is going to happen you can always initiate the drag then command-drop to make sure files are move or option-drop to make sure files are copied

219042
portrait	landscape
you might want to use file page setup to switch the page from portrait to landscape orientation if you plan to display more than two columns

219056
folder	directory
my windows xp system folder c windows default has a lot of directory like this

219067
antivirus	mcafee
mcafee total protection 2011 is what i am looking at but dont know how it differs from their internet protection product or their antivirus product

219078
ethernet	wireless
effectively that would divide up the five components of the standard home router into four pieces dsl modem - firewall router - ethernet switch - wireless access point

219111
folder	directory
thanks i downloaded your .zip file and ran the restore default settings.reg file but this only gave me a libraries 32 bit directory that can t be opened in my desktop folder

219129
width	height
how do you increase or decrease the height or width of a vim buffer in a way so that when you hold down the key combo the buffer size constantly changes

219174
put	get
hopefully this will put you on the correct track however there are many different routes to try next but to be honest i am not sure what is the best to recommend so please give some feedback as to how far you get and i will try to help you further

219180
ubuntu	debian
another thing to look into would be virtualbox on ubuntu debian

219182
x86	64bit
the best way to is to go straight to the folder in which notepad++ is installed program files for 32 bit windows and program files x86 for 64bit windows there find the notepad++ executable right-click on it and select compatibility and at the bottom check the box for run as administrator

219241
bash	zsh
to get the last argument of the previous command in bash ksh and zsh

219253
min	max
since you ve only got three levels to compare min max and middle i think this can be accomplished with a nested if statements

219304
vim	emacs
gnu emacs 21.2.1 vim 7.3 and bash 4.1 all seem to be able to â œkeep up withâ large pastes i tried 8201 bytes

219405
kde	gnome
i am already in the process of downloading and installing kde packages will that conflict with gnome

219431
jobs	cron
pass parameters to the bash script via the cronjob so i can have two cron jobs one to be run with parameter foobar and the other foo

219449
packets	multicast
hardware ethernet multicast .. when the network card picks up a packets which has a destination mac that matches any of the multicast mac addresses it will pass it to the upper layers for further processing

219449
packets	multicast
once layer 2 datalink picks the multicast packets from the network because it recognises it as the destination mac address is a multicast it will strip the mac addresses off and send the rest to the above layer which is the network layer

219460
tunnel	vpn
you say filter out answers about use vpn but that is honestly the solution - an encrypted tunnel to a trusted network

219466
ssl	https
another solution is a firefox plugin called https everywhere that attempts to force ssl connections

219506
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse input has no effect although occasionally i can move the mouse nothing more though

219568
kde	gnome
kde gnome on linux

219620
afp	smb	filesystems	hfs
i can preserve hard links copying locally hfs to hfs but it doesn t preserve when i try to rsync off of a smb filesystems mount or afp filesystems mount

219632
buildroot	jffs2
after building buildroot with kernelimage and rootfs jffs2

219675
folder	directory
git does use a repo folder it s just hidden from normal directory views

219677
jobs	cron
there are some crons jobs in many linux setups that scan a chunk of the filesytsem if not all of it them occasionally to update search caches such as the updatedb task that updates the data used by commands like locate - if you find one of those is causing your slowness then they can be safely removed from cron s list of things to regularly run

219677
ubuntu	linux
lubuntu is a popular choice for this - all the usual packages are available should you need them but it installs less by default starts less services on boot by default and uses a lower weight desktop environment everything other than these changes is the same arrangement so you should find it relatively familiar even if ubuntu is the only linux variant you have much experience with

219716
mouse	keyboard
i would like to place the computer in a closet on the other side of the room so there is only the keyboard mouse and screen on my desk

219716
bluetooth	usb
a fairly modern machine with usb 2 and firewire i would be ready to add bluetooth if necessary

219738
opensuse	linux
i ve tried viewing linux livecd opensuse 11.2 and xubuntu 9.04

219744
ubuntu	opensuse
try a regular ubuntu livedvd...you might need more driver support than opensuse or xubuntu are providing

219757
mouse	keyboard
i have a dell bluetooth mouse keyboard combo

219768
cpu	processors
but since then people call the cpu the processors

219800
disk	ram
i try not to use hibernation either because it tends to be buggy as you describe and my laptop is older and i don t have a lot of room for all the disk space hibernation requires i understand it saves the contents of ram to the disk which can take up a considerable amount of space depending on your setup

219841
chgrp	chmod	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod
in linux how can i prevent users from executing chown chgrp or chmod

219861
mouse	keyboard
another lower tech option would be to have a locking cabinet that the keyboard and mouse would be placed in when the user was done with the system

219861
mouse	keyboard
you might want to think about getting them a wireless keyboard and mouse if you decide to do this

219873
zypper	yum	dpkg	apt
so as far as i can see the answer depends on your linux distribution yum apt zypper dpkg or any other package management system

219881
centos	linux
also which linux os to look for centos

219888
apache	nginx
you might get more into less by using nginx lighttp cheroke instead of apache and tweaking mysql to the nth degree but i d still say 512mb is a sensible minimum for what you describe

219888
ubuntu	centos
as for the choice of ubuntu centos other go with what you know is usually the best general purpose advice here though make sure you pick a distro and version that will be getting security updates for some time to come such as a recent ubuntu lts release rather than the latest-and-greatest build which might not be supported for as long - on a public facing server stable packages with long security support is often more useful to you than having more up-to-date feature-wise versions of everything

219888
vmware	virtualbox
a very good way to get a real gauge of how much of everything you need is to try it locally first install a virtualisation solution like virtualbox or vmware on one of your local machine and setup a small vm to see how far you can stretch it

219899
google-chrome	safari
this page didn t work on any desktop browser google-chrome or safari i wouldn t expect it to work anywhere else

219919
pop-up	dialog
if i create a new user and they use qwerty sometimes the password dialog pop-up in the system keyboard layout not the current user layout

219963
switching	screens
fastest most effective way i know to reduce screens brightness is to reach for the power switching

220002
vmware	virtualbox	vmware	bootcamp	parallels	bootcamp	virtualbox	parallels	virtualbox	bootcamp
with a mac computer you can always run bootcamp or virtualization software like virtualbox vmware or parallels to run the windows or linux

220019
ethernet	wireless
when you connect to a network typically an ethernet lan or a wireless lan your computer asks the network can i have an ip address

220062
kerberos	ldap
i observed that macos x 10.6 if machine is added to an active directory and set to authenticate over ldap to the active directory server requests a kerberos tgt as expected at each user login

220125
vmware	virtualbox
want an image file that can be executed in a virtual machine vmware or virtualbox or booted directly on my home pc

220126
mouse	keyboard
the only thing i can think of is that my mouse or keyboard driver is somehow keeping it active by somehow sending phantom keystrokes to the computer to top the screensaver activating

220126
mouse	keyboard
i have an external usb kensington keyboard an external hp mouse and my laptop is a toshiba with win7

220140
vpn	lan	vpn	wlan
for a home solution wpa with tkip could well be fine but for a more sensitive environment you may want to use a vpn on top of the wlan - the same way you would if extending a lan across the internet

220141
switching	screens
the other reason for waiting is because switching on a cold item and letting it heat up rapidly may result in thermal shock to delicate components eg disk drives and lcd screens especially the glassmount screens connectors as their parts expand rapidly

220147
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
even on osx it s only supported in the standalone quicktime x player or in safari but not in quicktime embedded in firefox or google-chrome

220161
wav	aiff
aiff wav are possible but most people would prefer to use some sort of compression to reduce the space requirements and to allow for easier tagging

220251
vmware	virtualbox
if not running xp in a virtual machine via xp mode virtual pc vmware or virtualbox will let you do just about everything else

220262
debian	linux
i run debian 5 + gnome and it seems that after i made certain updates with aptitude whenever i run a query in navicat sql program that runs on wine as the results are being presented linux goes into the command line and the gui dies and it restarts and it asks me to login again all my programs crash

220270
mouse	keyboard
i want control excel with my keyboard while using the mouse on firefox

220282
mouse	keyboard
i don t think it is possible to give the keyboard focus to one application and mouse focus to another application

220292
spyware	antivirus
i run a full antivirus and spyware scan on the system and restart

220297
parallels	bootcamp	virtualbox	parallels	virtualbox	bootcamp
bootcamp parallels virtualbox or fusion

220297
virtualbox	bootcamp
for a mac novice like myself is bootcamp the better choice or virtualbox

220306
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
it s trivial to do with parallels probably just as easy with vmware fusion and probably a bit of work with virtualbox

220310
mouse	keyboard
by input we understand mouse and keyboard

220310
mouse	keyboard
there is an exception tho listeners which listen to the os s keyboard and mouse events and reports them

220370
parallels	bootcamp
i recently bought and installed parallels 6 and set up a vm to use my existing bootcamp partition

220370
parallels	bootcamp
if i activate windows 7 from within parallels will that kill the activation when i boot into windows 7 using bootcamp

220387
fink	macports
you can install gnu coreutils on osx for example through darwion ports or fink or macports

220464
bluetooth	usb
if i wanted to steal data off the system i d transfer it off to another via the network bluetooth or some other mechanism or simply remove the hard drive assuming it is not encrypted or is poorly encrypted as it is likely to be in a scenario where the it staff feels that preventing usb access is going to do anything more than make it difficult for people to get their job done

220477
daemons	systemd	daemons	launchd
many preference panes install additional daemons agents or systemd components upon launchd or user action

220484
ubuntu	linux
download a live cd from ubuntu boot off of that and you should be able to find the files by mounting the drive with linux

220532
google-chrome	firefox
scrolling with the mouse wheel is not working in google-chrome on windows but works fine in firefox and internet explorer

220566
google-chrome	firefox
i d like to be able to transfer a browsing session from firefox 3 on my mac to google-chrome on my windows 7 netbook

220569
folder	directory
i m trying to figure out how to tell the shell tcsh to remember when i ve gone into a symlinked folder and allow cd .. to navigate back out of the symlink rather than just navigate to the parent directory of the linked-to folder.

220571
ubuntu	linux
with ubuntu linux the delay repetition speed configurations are incredibly accurate and now i m typing and using key repetition to the maximum speed i can

220620
mouse	keyboard
# map the right side command key on a mac keyboard to the middle mouse button

220624
pop-up	dialog

220660
post	get
i attempted to post this question first on the author s bug tracker forum but i could not even register on his site to get a login

220667
vmware	esx
virtual machines on hyper-v and other type 1 hypervisors like vmware esx esxi usually run server operating systems and the hosts are headless so the vms are accessed remotely

220678
cpu	processors
cpu intel core 2 quad q9300 yorkfield 2.5ghz 6 mb l2 cache lga 775 95w quad-core processors bx80580q9300

220685
ati	nvidia
not the monitor - it s a setting in both nvidia and ati control panels

220695
installation	upgrade
the best i can tell when using an upgrade edition of a windows 7 product it somehow detects an existing installation and saves that somewhere even if you format the drive then entering an upgrade key will be allowed once system is up and running

220712
folder	directory
as a test i took one of my users and switched them from a network home directory to a portable home directory phd this means the home folder was copied to the local hard drive

220714

220799
mutt	msmtp
my header from mutt and msmtp setup looks like the following

220806
filesystems	xfs
i personally like xfs for a general use filesystems although it doesn t work out of the box with selinux

220809
ubuntu	debian
on debian or ubuntu see myfile or edit myfile opens a file in the application that s associated to the file type through the mailcap mechanism

220809
ubuntu	debian
the command is from the mime-support package which i think is installed by default on both debian and ubuntu and anyway it s in many packages dependencies so it s probably installed already

220830
mouse	keyboard
lesson learned if you know what ps 2 is keep a ps 2 mouse and keyboard or adapter handy at all times

220833
disk	ram
obviously this is not zero cost but even the cheapest vps should be able to host a small ssh server for this purpose even the 1-or-2 month silly-small ones 64mb ram and a gb or two disk space that are occasionally seen though the bandwidth allowance on those might be quite limiting and be careful to make sure they don t count it as running a proxy if their tos prohibits running a proxy

220847
daemons	launchd
another option is to tell launchd to disable the mds daemons

220921
jobs	cron
if i set cron job for a normal user instead of root what account execute the scheduled jobs

when accessing a program on the 60g ssd any swap file access would go thru a separate sata channel

221008

i have removed the the full listing of installed ports prior to implementing the stack overflow fix because the answer didn t seem to need them but can add them back if i learn a way to show hide or otherwise minimize real estate

i have removed the additionally installed ports because the answer didn t seem to need them but can add them back if i learn a way to show hide or otherwise minimize real estate

cron jobs in etc crontab and etc cron.d run as the user specified in the extra username field

debian	linux
i have an 80gb intel x25-m ssd drive installed on a linux box running debian 5.0

221116
google-chrome	firefox
i ve recently switched from firefox to google-chrome and the thing i miss most from firefox is the awesome bar that suggests completions for what i type primarily based on page titles and then secondarily based on domain names

221116
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome offers both matching urls and titles just like like firefox but google-chrome seems to always prefer a matching domain name over a matching page title or a match to another part of the url besides the domain no matter how many times i pass over the former for the latter

221127
filesystems	ntfs
the drive appears in my computer with its proper name and filesystems ntfs

221128
put	get
the only way i ve found to get around this is to put all shared files in the write-only drop box folder which adds full permissions of the computer s owner s user account to the any file added to it

221191
google-chrome	firefox
is there a way that i could extract that key from google-chrome s profile and import it into firefox under windows

221206
mouse	keyboard
my mouse and keyboard were both wired and running off a usb hub

221214
ubuntu	mint
on the other hand trying ubuntu 10.10 netbook it works fine - given that mint is a variant of ubuntu i d have expected it to work the same

221251

try imacros for ie firefox google-chrome

221261
ubuntu	linux
now i d like to do something similar on linux ubuntu 10.10

installation	upgrade
if you own any valid upgrade key even if you ve already activated another installation with it there is a trick to make anytime upgrade work

221319
ethernet	wireless
get a wireless ethernet bridge

221321
google-chrome	firefox
nb i also tried with the latest google-chrome and firefox but no use due to the genuine advantage stuff so i decided to stick with ie

ethernet	wireless
if the player has an ethernet socket you could try find a wireless ap+switch that can play nicely in bridged mode with your main ap

221340
sudoers	visudo
i ve tried to access the sudoers file as well as run visudo but have no authority without root

221341
sudo	passwd
if you preface your command with sudo it prompts for your user passwd and then runs it as root

221358
sudo	passwd
now rob has admin permissions you could restart the virtual machine reboot and run sudo su to access root shell the system would ask for rob s passwd not root s passwd

221384
versioning	upgrade
if that is the case then no it cannot be upgrade to windows xp nor any other versioning of windows

221413
chown	chmod
this file isn t affected by rm rm -f shred mv chown chmod or any other command i can think of

221467
pop-up	dialog
however as i open each shell window i see an error dialog pop-up with title hello and the text

221483
width	height
you ll need to break out your shell and attack the xorg.conf modelines specifically the height width and all the porch variables for your display

221495
filesystems	ntfs
the filesystems used ntfs

221515
udp	rtp
note udp http mmsh and rtp methods require to select the stream option on

221515

i ve tried in firefox ie and google-chrome

you don t have permission to access on this server. i try repointing apache s home directory to another folder same hard drive same partition that s set to 777 recursively

google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
opera doesn t use the default ones shared by ie firefox and google-chrome

221706
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
this may be doable with firefox portable since i think it uses its own config files per installed copy but the problem is that the third party software used to administer the sites does not work with firefox the sites themselves do but the admin tools do not they work fine with google-chrome and ie and opera however

photoshop	fireworks
it is intended to be used as a flex interface designer software and it can transform photoshop illustrator and fireworks designs to interactive interfaces without writing code

my impressions are that this is best to be used as a prototyping tool between the graphical mockups and the first alpha version

221854
put	get
i pressed cntrl-i to get the raid bios up and put the disks in raid1 mirrored

221855

221935
vpn	lan	vpn	wlan
i ve got several network adapter in my pc from lan wlan vpn etc... and what i want to accomplish is that some specific adresses use the vpn adapter while all others use eiter lan or wlan

221935
vpn	lan
so for example is using vpn while www.google still uses lan connection.

221942
tunnel	vpn
many vpn providers prevent this unless you enable what is called split tunnel

221942
tunnel	vpn
unless the admin of your vpn concentrator has explicitly allowed split tunnel and defined which ip subnets should use the vpn then all traffic will flow through the vpn

221960
stdout	stderr
2 1 is to redirect stderr to stdout as strace writes to stderr by default

221993
ubuntu	linux
will not mount on any computer or os i have tired windows linux ubuntu mac

222024
daemons	systemd
also you might try running the computer in safe mode by booting with the shift key down see kb #ht1564 and #ht1455 -- this disables noncritical systemd extensions third-party daemons and a bunch of other possibly-problematic systemd components

222069
post	get
i m not sure if this is the best site to post this sort of question if it isn t then i do apologize other than that i hope i get relatively quick and good response

222086
hash	md5
if i remember right the ubuntu cds have a boot option that lets you check whether the cd is okay by i presume running a checksum of its contents and comparing it to a md5 hash on the cd

222120
vmware	virtualbox
i ve had this same problem occur under both virtualbox and vmware

222120

ubuntu	linux
i am on ubuntu linux and i was wondering whether there are tools out there that allows me to track that

222191
filesystems	ntfs
filesystems is ntfs

222196
move	drag
in the virtual machine no matter in xp or ubuntu if i open a terminal window then once i move the window by drag the title bar my command which is running in the terminal will be stoped just as i enter ctrl+c manually

222203
daemon	cron
the downside of it is that it is not as flexible as cron daemon in unix

222214
google-chrome	firefox
in both my firefox and google-chrome ctrl+l r causes the cursor to move between words

222223
hide	show
ctrl - y to hide ctrl - g to show

222243
jobs	cron
one approach i was thinking was to set up cron jobs on all the machines including the xp box courtesy cygwin so as to maintain synchronisation between music libraries on all machines using rsync

222294
ssid	wlan
netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode allow ssid xxxxx

222338
width	height
however if your file manager does something like read metadata like codec height x width thumbnail from a video when you open the folder then atimes aren t going to be of any use either

222367
filesystems	ntfs
is there a way to access read write my external hdd with ntfs filesystems from my imac 10.6.5 for free

222421
mouse	keyboard
is it possible to wake a laptop lenovo t410 in this case via a usb keyboard or mouse connected to the docking station

222430
mouse	keyboard
yes well it depends on which keyboard and which mouse it is

222431
mouse	keyboard
note that i mean equal rights sharing where both clients have full access to the keyboard and mouse

222446
ubuntu	linux

222493
versioning	upgrade
you will have to upgrade to a 64 bit versioning of windows to see a larger partition

222546
stdout	stderr
the only reasonable explanation so far is that something has changed in they way cygwin s grep splits output to stderr and stdout

222549
folder	directory
so i have created a global resources directory and symbolically linked that directory into each of the demo folder

222579
daemons	launchd
i ve tried manually creating a launchd daemons and used routesplit s launchd daemons to no avail

222590
folder	directory
by internally i mean given a particular root folder do the symbolic links within that root folder only refer to other files or directory that are also within that folder

222594
google-chrome	firefox
for example firefox uses a lot more memory to load any given page than google-chrome uses to load the same page

222656
disk	ram
my question for lamp development in a vm slackware with lamp stack is the bottleneck cpu + ram or disk i o

222669
versioning	upgrade
a month or so ago i upgrade to versioning 6 and .

222739
mouse	keyboard
i ve got a kvm switch which takes input from keyboard and mouse on ps2 ports

222740
mouse	keyboard
your item is a ps2 female to usb-a male keyboard adaptor so it should work fine for either mouse or keyboard afaik because mouse and keyboard are both on same ps2 standard

222744
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried ad thwart and adblock in google-chrome but neither of them provides ad blocking with a code like in adblock plus on firefox

222768
post	get
no it will not prevent power up and post screen but it would not be a bad idea to replace it if you get it booting

222774
tunnel	vpn
yes the isp can see your surfing traffic and dns queries if your vpn is set up as split tunnel where only traffic going to your corporate network goes over the encrypted vpn tunnel and every thing else goes out the regular internet path

222783
centos	solaris	centos	linux	debian	linux	debian	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
i have used my methods at work using solaris and cygwin and at home on my linux lan comprised of centos slackware debian and ubuntu

222783
folder	directory
i notice that you seem to have a .authorized_keys folder in the home directory

222783
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
i have never had problems using any version of solaris from about 6 on up freebsd and various iterations and flavors of linux

222789
mouse	keyboard
but keeping the keys unchanged might force me to leave my hand near the keyboard and not on the mouse which might reduce the time spent bent

222857
vpn	lan
the only limitations would be those that may be imposed by group policy preventing you from installing things to the work laptop or by your vpn service preventing you from accessing resources on the lan while connected to the vpn

222868
folder	directory
i know how to make db dumps cruise through the directory etc but the one last piece of the puzzle i need to learn is how to download folder entire directory from the server and onto my local computer so i can then move them to another server

222889
versioning	upgrade
around that time the antivirus avg free was upgrade to the latest versioning from the previous versioning - 2010

222893
mouse	keyboard
are there any well-estabilished solutions for using a computer efficiently with the left hand on the keyboard exclusively and the right on the mouse

the prompt for your shell bash zsh etc is configured by

223018
tunnel	lan	tunnel	vpn	vpn	lan
my problem is that beside the routerâ s â œvpnâ green led is switched on i am unable to link or route the traffic of lan my pc tv and ps3 through the vpn tunnel for the purpose of reaching the internet through the vpn service providerâ s server instead of reaching it directly

223018
wan	lan
i use only wan1 wan2 is disabled and use dhcp on wan and lan side as well

223018
tunnel	lan	tunnel	vpn	vpn	lan
i would like to ask someone to help me setting up this router to link the lan-side or only one lan connection lan1 to the internet through the vpn tunnel

223018
tunnel	vpn	tunnel	packets
the interesting part of my vpn tunnel problem is that if i go to www.google.com site before i establish the vpn connection with the router and leave the browser open and then i switch on the vpn client i can use the google-search and get search-results through the vpn tunnel the packets go through the vpn tunnel it is seen on the routerâ s vpn tunnel packets counter as well

223019
daemons	systemd
i then discovered that on one systemd another racoon daemons was running in this case ipsecuritas

223033
google-chrome	firefox
my question is can i run google-chrome or firefox on the windows server without compromising security

223075
ubuntu	linux
btw both my local machine and remote machine are running linux ubuntu

223165
google-chrome	firefox
while iâ m on this topic does anyone know why google-chrome doesnâ t just use keyword bookmarks like firefox

223204
gif	png
it also works on several other input formats including png and gif

223207
put	get
if it runs fine for a while then put one more in and so on until you get the problem again

223232
vmware	virtualbox
an older version of virtualbox or vmware should do it i think

223233
debian	linux
create new fat32 partition on disk shrink one of debian if needed install win98 then start some live linux bsd distro re-create mbr and that s it

223238
ssd	sata
you use a sata sas or ssd hard drive with a raid controller to create a raid volume logical drive

223238
ssd	sata
remember that a bad ssd is much worse than a traditional sata drive so don t be fooled by the cheapies out there as you re looking

223254
mouse	keyboard
ok i don t have an answer for your hardware kvm question but i might suggest that you look at synergy as a solution to your share keyboard and mouse between two computers

223254
mouse	keyboard
synergy is a lightweight client server app that uses the keyboard and mouse on the server to move the pointer and allow text input on client machines

223284
folder	directory
modifying folder and files in the program files directory requires elevation even if you are logged in as an administrator

223307
filesystems	fat
fat tends to be what they put on flash drives because it is the only filesystems that operates on all of the major operating systems

223319
hide	show
using the methods from the tutorial above i made the following example autohotkey script that sets f11 to hide all windows and f12 to show all windows

223321
vmware	virtualbox
kvm might be better when you have lots of vms to run but if you re used to using vmware workstation virtualbox will be the easiest thing for you

223326
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox however provides an excellent alternative and had some advantages against vmware workstation performance otherwise

223371
move	drag
for instance one could interpret your question and say it s been possible to move windows by a left-click and drag on the window s title bar since well before os x 10.0

223388
ubuntu	linux
another computer i run on windows 7 just notified me that it was infected through java and i m wondering if my linux box ubuntu 10 with java installed is vulnerable

223389
opera	google-chrome
notscripts noscript extension for opera and google-chrome

223396
trojan	virus
so is there a common virus trojan floating around out there that s doing this right now

223444
disk	ram
from vista on windows uses most free ram as cache which makes read write calls on disk much faster than before but also confuses people in terms of ram usage

223455
mouse	keyboard
one or two usb port emulated keyboard or mouse to every connected system

223467
ubuntu	linux
i have a usb key with arch linux which does not run a graphical environment and a usb key with ubuntu 11.04 alpha with compiz-powered unity

223482
daemon	cron
to keep the mirror current while you re logged in to handle the case where you change winhome while running linux you could schedule that scrap of script to run regularly using cron for example or employ some sort of directory watching daemon that you can use to discover when the directory contents change

223487
versioning	upgrade
i don t know if it matters but just for the archives on my os x 10.6 which is an upgrade from 10.4 via 10.5 library frameworks python.framework versioning 2.6 bin is not listed in path

223495
vmware	virtualbox
is there a way to safely access the guest virtual hard drive from the host using vmware or virtualbox

hash	hmac
hmac is a standardized method to turn a cryptographic hash function into a keyed message authentication function

223526
folder	directory
problem is that my home directory on my local pc also has my wine folder some other . configuration folder virtualbox containers etc that i would like to keep on my local pc and not have them be loaded across the network wine folder.

223546
disk	ram
now that i have 12 gigs of ram in my pc i d like to make the most of it and minimize the disk access of the application game i m using while i use it so i m wondering if there are some ways to preload as much of an application that can fit into ram when it s started

223558
ubuntu	linux
i m pulling down an ubuntu image to throw on the free space and see if i can boot linux and if i can see if grub can boot the windows install

223703
mouse	keyboard
how can i lock the mouse and keyboard but see the screen

223703
mouse	trackpad	mouse	keyboard
i could use the iphone remote or a mouse to steer everything while the main keyboard trackpad are locked

223741
solaris	aix
and not the linux aix solaris etc.

223758
ssd	sata
if it is an ssd with trim support connected to the motherboard sata port and you re on win7 then you may be in a bit of trouble

223774
google-chrome	firefox
where can i find the cache used by google-chrome and firefox in ubuntu

223820
versioning	upgrade
unfortunately all of the copies of that that i have found fail with the message this setup will only upgrade over an existing versioning of the microsoft vm . i can t seem to find something to download to get that existing versioning

223823
filesystems	ntfs
there s a chance you may want to look into ntfs-3g which is able to write to ntfs filesystems

223883
mouse	keyboard
it asks me whether i want to continue installation anyway but as it is in the phase of installing devices my keyboard and mouse do not work yet so i cannot tell it to continue

223902
gtk	xlib	gtk	xcb	xlib	xcb
at the very bottom is xlib and xcb but most people never go any lower than gtk or qt

223923
daemons	systemd
it is actually a daemons that creates those folders check the startup preferences its on the systemd menu i believe you can easily disable that feature

223943
vmware	virtualbox
if it s the thinkpad laptop it might be better to stick with the windows os it came with and install server 2003 in a virtual enviroment like vmware server microsoft virtual pc or sun oracle virtualbox

223989
parallels	bootcamp
it should have occurred to me beforehand hoping that parallels would mimic the bootcamp environment but i had to reactivate my copy of windows running as a vm

223989
parallels	bootcamp
would windows 7 enterprise require reactivation every time i switched between bootcamp and parallels

223991
width	height
you can force the width and height of the playback window

223991
width	height
by adding width 640 height 480 to the shortcut properties in windows or the command line on other systems for example

224006
disk	ram
ps is not talking about ram but disk here

224051
vmware	virtualbox
what i personally would do install virtualbox or vmware or something and then run windows virtually under ubuntu

224069
centos	linux
how i do i copy all files from dir to another dir and escape file already exist and not overwrite it using cp command under linux centos

224106
tunnel	traceroute
client connects and can use traceroute to verify everything is tunnel out the openvpn connection

224107
tunnel	lan
if it s everything i m assuming traffic from the lan clients is also going down the tunnel instead of out to the internet

224107
tunnel	vpn
you ve not said where the openvpn tunnel is going but if you re trying to engineer a setup where specific traffic goes down your vpn tunnel and the rest goes straight out to the internet you ll want to set up a split-tunnel style vpn

224107
tunnel	vpn
if you re not in a position to configure the server side of the openvpn tunnel you might have to get creative by manually adding routes after the vpn connection has come up although bear in mind that whoever set up the vpn will probably have it up the way the have for security reasons

224111
ubuntu	debian
this is how to mount one in debian ubuntu

224120
google-chrome	firefox
internet - i would install firefox or google-chrome

224127
ubuntu	linux
as to your original question i believe ubuntu and especially kubuntu will make the transition learning curve easier for a user migrating to linux

224158
rss	feed
i keep spending too much time looking at my rss feed and only want it to update once a day

224165
vim	notepad++
note this can be done with notepad++ and vim for example

224177
folder	directory
short of manually dragging each folder in the c directory onto an external hard drive and then out onto the recipient computer is there an easier faster way to do this

224219
put	get
if i could just somehow list get edit and put preferably as soon as i hit save automagically files inside of emacs without having to use filezilla fireftp etc then i d be super happy

224234

224234
rss	feed
select rss under accounts and check box include rss feed in this send receive group and click ok

224253
hfs+	ntfs
ntfs and hfs+ have completely different ways of doing this - you can t switch between the two without losing everything

224279
mouse	keyboard
if the f1 to f12 keys don t work go to system preferences keyboard mouse keyboard and make the choices from there whether to use the f keys directly or with the fn key qualifier

224300
tunnel	vpn
is there a way for windows host machines to connect outside to terminal services server windows 7 machines through some vpn tunnel means short of changing the current firewall ruleset

224316
portrait	landscape
i have a document that is formatted in landscape however i would like to save some space by printing 2 landscape sheets per portrait page

224316
portrait	landscape
whenever i set 2 pages per sheet option though whether i set portrait or landscape it always puts the two pages beside each other rather than one on top and one on bottom

224336
ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu linux i can open the cdrom drive but it still doesn t recognize the cds and it won t mount

224348
hfs+	ntfs
mac ntfs hard drive not mounted how to reformat to journaled hfs+ and keep data

224348
hfs+	ntfs
i have recently connected a hard drive to my mac pro and im not able to use it because its formatted in ntfs whilst the other drive containing the os is formatted to journaled hfs+

224350
rss	feed
another thing you could do is use rss feed instead when they are available

224370
put	get
this resulted in an install with no place to put an activation key i don t have one anyways but i still get the following error when i try to start it

224389
vpn	lan
well hamachi is a vpn so running a web server and a resumable downloader of some sort might work or any error tolerant method you d use to transfer files over a lan would work

224401
mouse	keyboard
other remote access software often have a way to put up a screen or blank out the host screen and ignore the mouse keyboard but don t know that rdp has

224417
google-chrome	firefox
that s firefox in front looking normal like every other program and google-chrome above and behind with the buttons at an off-standard position and size

224447
opera	google-chrome
and unlike opera and google-chrome

224456
disk	ram
is it possible to use a storage disk such as a usb drive as ram

224468
folder	directory
if you create a junction you will change directory seamlessly and it will appear like a normal folder

224487
filesystems	ntfs
my guess is that it also requires the ntfs filesystems

224511
post	put
when i leave the old 512 ram in and put the 2gb next to it to the other socket my system completes the post and i m able to enter the bios menu

224541
opera	firefox
i m looking for a firefox setting or extension that can easily toggle between showing and hiding of all images without reloading the page similar to opera s feature - the show only cached images feature is preferable but optional in my case

224541
hide	show
i have found an extension that can show hide images image-show-hide but it needs to reload the page to show hide the images

224566
disk	ram
ready boost serves to eliminate hard disk bottlenecks wherever possible - the ram cannot serve this function as it is a temporary open space of memory that is close to the cpu and cannot permanently store data

224566
disk	ram
and every once in a while you will require the hard disk storage device to load more and more files into the ram when the application or a function of the os requires it to do so

224566
disk	ram
this is therefore a comparison between the efficiency and speed of the hard disk vs that of the flash storage device - and these two serve totally different functions to the ram

224614
ubuntu	linux
so now i have windows on the original hard drive and ubuntu linux on the new hd

put	get
click the button beside the format values where this formula is true box and select your cell range so you end up with something like k6 k20 1 minus the quotes after the second you can put whatever you are matching text will need to be in quotation marks and you may have to press f4 a couple of times after selecting the cell number ranges to get rid of the sign

224899
bluetooth	usb
i have no idea why it didn t work with built-in device that is somewhere inside my laptop but it did with another external bluetooth usb thumb

firefox is right and detecting something that neither google-chrome nor safari is detecting like say my router that may be hacked

224934

it says about winmove if width and height are large most windows will go no larger than approximately 12 pixels beyond the dimensions of the desktop.

225044
titlebar	window
however here is a similar thread with interesting suggestions windows program to remove titlebar frame etc from a window

225049

folder	directory
one can use sgid to force the permissions of all new files folder in a directory to be the same as that of the directory itself

225380
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is in general a more robust filesystems but the main obstacle with fat32 that i run into is the 4gb file size limit - you can t have a single file larger than 4gb which rules out certain things like dvd images or hd movies etc

225405
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i m pretty sure neither firefox nor safari include it on any platform but google-chrome on windows does not sure about mac or linux

225588
filesystems	ntfs
you don t have to convert your linux partition to ntfs filesystems in the virtualbox you can use share folder to access the host os s filesystems

225590
filesystems	ntfs
when formatting be sure to pick the ntfs filesystems and make the disk bootable by picking the correct option from the options menu in the erase tab

vmware	virtualbox
if you need a quick virtualisation solution i would use virtualbox or if you need a proper virtual server solution i would use vmware

225741
tunnel	vpn
i would grab a miniitx board with intel atom processor 120 with ram and old psu then put some linux system on it which will run a simple vpn client then setup a vpn server maybe openvpn in the us and tunnel their connection through yours

hash	md5
i have the string that was used in a webapp with md5 hashing to come up with a hash

225787
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
but the md5 of the string doesn t match the hash so i m guessing there s a salt involved

225792
hash	salt
in standard hashing functions unix passwords in etc shadow the salt is stored as part of the hash

225792
hash	salt
pass the stored hash value as the salt and you should get the correct result

225792
hash	md5
the hash function in this case 1 representing md5

225792
hash	salt
however by passing in the salt the second field from the hash value above we can match it against the original hash

tunnel	vpn
you could get another ip address if you connect to a vpn tunnel somewhere

226185

as categories can be assigned with client-side rules on emails that have already been sorted into folders on an exchange server using server-side rules i would think that your rules are not working because categories are not really intended to be using on non-exchange accounts

226197
mouse	keyboard
if not and you don t have an external mouse can you navigate with the keyboard

google-chrome	firefox
some ips can t resolve properly it doesn t matter if i try using firefox google-chrome or ie i end up with a domain not found server not found etc.

226386

you could put enough resistance in the circuit to get your amp s signal down to something your sound card won t find offensive

226501

you can save your whole home directory make sure all hidden files folder are transferred

226687
profiler	yourkit
if you are willing to pay yourkit yourkit.com has a pretty good java profiler

that would only be possible with some proxy software and a vpn or ssh tunnel

226741
ethernet	wireless
a word of advice though you might find it hard to find a good wireless card for linux so i d recommend using ethernet directly hooked up to your router switch

226771
xfs	ntfs
each drawer can be formatted organized in a different way with ext rfs xfs ntfs etc

226771
disk	ram
swap partitions are very specifically formatted pieces of the drive formatted exactly as the os formats its memory spaces so that memory can be cleanly and more importantly quickly moved out of ram and onto disk and vice versa

226778
mouse	keyboard
just an idea but you could also hook your third screen to your desktop but use synergy to control three screens and both computers with your laptop mouse keyboard

226781
disk	ram
if i have 4gb ram over 320gb disk what should my swap partition size be and why

226781

affinity	processors
well talking about shotgun solutions i think you should go the script way using as an example command line process viewer killer suspender for windows nt 2000 xp and write a script any language accepted that would take all active processes excepeted the one of your choice and set their affinity to any other processors than the chosen one

226932
affinity	processors
however as it is only an affinity i can t ensure you that your processors will be left alone for your preferred program

add your userid as someone that can run sudo without a passwd and then try running your script using sudo scriptname

227468

this doesn t work because the script is run by the gitolite user instead of the redmine user owner of the repository cloned folder

227507

227511
openbsd	solaris
i was able to build it on both openbsd from ports and solaris 11 with devel gcc-3 package installed

227555
folder	directory
it indicated that the only folder that had a recent modification date apart from some boring cached data directory was ruby and a subfolder that contained undeleteable files

227564
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox fails even harder as it starts mac os in verbose mode and crashes very quickly but seems to be able to access the partition so i think it would be easier to get vmware access my partition than to get virtualbox to run it

227585
ubuntu	debian
i guess debian or ubuntu are the most popular variant

i thought it would be cool to use mozilla s prism to create a webapp for min.us but drag and drop is disallowed because the site doesn t see the program as firefox google-chrome or safari those of which are apparently the only browsers allowed to do drag and drop for fear that something will be horribly broken

i can get here to post this question

227671
freebsd	linux
i am not fully familiar with freebsd but expect similar support to that found on linux albeit perhaps omitting some of the more unstable drivers found on many linux distros

227678
filesystems	ntfs
the filesystems uses ntfs

227681
freebsd	linux
ntfs is now supported by open source software through ntfs-3g on recent versions of linux osx and freebsd

227686
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
edit the 64bit installation cd is not broken but i found out when trying to install from the 32bit versioning that it s trying to upgrade not preform a fresh install - odd

google-chrome	firefox
how to emulate the firefox i m using v3.6 address bar search redirection in google-chrome

227699
google-chrome	firefox
so seems like firefox redirects automatically to the highest ranking search result url - is there a setting or add-on for google-chrome to achieve the same behaviour

227714
disk	ram
the tmpfs uses memory and swapspace as it s backing store a filesystem uses a specific area of disk neither is limited in the size the filesystem can be it is quite possible to have a 200gb tmpfs on a machine with less than a gb of ram if you have enough swapspace

227724

i created a new linux hard-disk in virtualbox and while virtualbox is installing ubuntu from that cd it generates following error after some time

227843
xfce	gnome
ripping out compiz might get you some better results this may preclude you from the latest gnome packages though and force you into xfce or some other alternate desktop

227856
udp	tcp
you could grep tcp or udp instead to get outbound ports instead of listening ports

227859

these are symlinked from the ssd so applications like iphoto and itunes will still find everything where they expect

228046
vim	emacs
if you re only going to be using emacs vim for development can you forgo the x server and just install a terminal-based version of ubuntu in a vm

then you need to connect your old printer via an ethernet cable to the network as well you can do this by putting another wireless router next to the printer and connecting that router via wireless to the router upstairs

228243

if the room your printer is in has wireless signal from your neighbors house then you could just get one router instead of two and that router would connect to the printer via an ethernet cable and would also connect to your neighbors wireless via wds

is there a gui gnome kde equivalent to sudo

228619
ubuntu	linux
unlike most other linux distributions ubuntu does not have allow root login by default

228620

it seems you can enable it using sudo passwd root which will prompt you for the passwd to use for root but this is not recommended at all instead you should use sudo to gain temporary root access

after you ve done that you can lock sudo passwd -l root and unlock sudo passwd -u root the root account as you will

i knew beforehand that it would be a challenge to get windows to boot and install drivers for the new hardware particularly since the foundational components are new but i am completely unable to even attempt to get through the work of installing drivers for things like the video card because the keyboard and mouse won t work they do work in the bios screen in dos mode in windows 7 in xp s boot menu etc. just not in windows xp itself

230838

unfortunately i cannot click next since the keyboard and mouse won t work yet because the motherboard drivers for the ps 2 or usb ports are not yet installed

google-chrome	firefox
i was wondering if anyone was familiar with a firefox google-chrome add-on extension thinking like a greasemonkey type script maybe or an application that would allow a non-technical person to add comments revisions to live pages even if it was just typing over it or similar to how word does it with the built-in collaboration feature

put	get
you need to check it in person to make sure that it can support a video card but since you say you will put a low to mid level card in it it likely won t be an issue but you may want to make sure that you don t get one that needs external power as that machine likely does not have pcie power connectors

235398
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	btrfs
if you are using linux with a relatively modern filesystems ext3 ext4 btrfs ntfs this can be done with posix acls

for os x i d suggest creating an iusethis profile and subscribing to your personal rss feed

are there any tools out there that attempt to fix this kind of problem removing the blurriness and making solid areas solid again so that the image looks better and can be usefully compressed with png or gif

filesystems	ntfs
when using the ntfs filesystems 8.3 name creation can be disabled system-wide using

235668
pbkdf2	salt
if ascii characters are used the 256 bit key is calculated by applying the pbkdf2 key derivation function to the passphrase using the ssid as the salt and 4096 iterations of hmac-sha1 the actual protecting codes have set sizes

235672
gif	png
you could use that to clean up the image and convert the vector back to a gif png or other format that uses lossless compression jpeg is lossy

235672
gif	png
at worst you can add the jpeg as a semi-translucent background image add a vector layor manually trace vector lines curves over it and delete the under layer before saving as gif png etc

ubuntu	freebsd
i want to install the latest ubuntu which i know i can just install right on top of but i also want to install freebsd and either windows server 2003 maybe 2008 if i can get my hands on it

235690
ubuntu	freebsd
do all the windows partitions first and then ubuntu freebsd

235690
ubuntu	freebsd
ubuntu and freebsd know how to talk to grub which will most likely be your bootloader and windows cant talk to it

235715
filesystems	ntfs
furthermore since ntfs is a journaling filesystems actual filesystems corruption should not be one of them

235728
folder	directory
you have to set up your computer to import the pictures automatically to a specific folder like you would with a digital camera and then point your itunes photo library to that directory

235731
sorting	grouping
then you can easily grouping them in your regular view by sorting by the checkmark column

235754
filesystems	ntfs
there are drivers made for linux and mac that can allow you to read and write to an ntfs filesystems

235781
ati	nvidia
multi-output multiple cards - with nvidia cards you can add a second matching pcie video adapter to handling additional monitors and they will perform similarly to an ati eyefinity configuration

then last night i woke the computer up from sleep as usual and it got to the logon fast user switching screens then bluescreened

235917
google-chrome	firefox
if you want to change how things look in your browser you would be better off using a more customizable browser like firefox which has themes that affect the entire layout and personas which just change the colors images or google-chrome which has different style themes but you can t change the layout

235926
tunnel	vpn
ifconfig route comes to mind is the post request that i am about to submit going to go through the tunnel created by my vpn

235934
tunnel	lan
i then opened a command prompt and type ipconfig and the only network adapter that appears is the tunnel adapter toredo tunnel pseudo-interface there are no lan adapters listed

235934
ethernet	wireless
all wireless drivers and ethernet drivers appear to be working in the device manager and the only error in the system log is the following boot-start or system-start driver s failed to load vflt.

235946
disk	ram
i should add though that while your disk speeds would decrease if you ran ubuntu natively you would be able to make full use of all your ram instead of sharing it with windows

235954
versioning	upgrade
if it reports a versioning less than 7.4 the current versioning as of this writing follow the upgrade instructions to use the latest org-mode code

235957

236128
stdout	stderr
as a side effect it will redirect stdout and stderr to a file nohup.out if these streams were pointing to the terminal

236128
bash	zsh
if you ve already started your program and you happen to be running bash or zsh very likely on linux you can use disown

236128
bash	zsh
then you type disown 1 to make bash zsh forget about it

236160
sudo	passwd
while sudo is asking for your passwd the window s name will be sudo but once you ve done that and sudo launches emacs the title will be emacs

width	height
the frame width frame height and audio sample rate remained the same

236376
google-chrome	firefox
lately i noticed that google-chrome unlike firefox spawns process instead of threads for tabs.but this time i had just had one tab open in google-chrome and it spawned 12 process

236377
filesystems	ntfs
blue file names indicate you ve compressed the files via the ntfs filesystems

236414
x86	64bit
just reading all the above and what i believe is that if you uninstall the x86 file your product id licence is hijacked meaning your warranty is lost microsoft themselves advised me not to try and get rid of this folder as i thought it was quite strange myself with a 64bit win 7 os with x86 program files too

236415

236548
ubuntu	debian
to answer your question - most likely ubuntu had partitioned your harddrive without you knowing or you may have forgotten ubuntu had a nice installer at least for me coming from using slackware and debian from early versions.... you need to resize the partition if you don t want to destroy the partitions

236555
ubuntu	linux
are there any other linux distros apart from ubuntu which allow you to install on windows

236558
pop-up	dialog
â when the pop-up is too large to see any close button then hit esc or return to close the alert dialog

236575

ubuntu and debian use upstart as a replacement for init but legacy init scripts are supported

236641
switching	screens
i run dual monitors and every time the screens saver came on it would switching to only a single monitor on being woken requiring me to go change it back in the desktop settings

236649

historically this comes from television resolutions where there was less emphasis on the width and more on the height for whatever reason

236665
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd

236665
sudo	passwd
and after entering a new passwd the system stop asking me passwd whenever i use sudo command

236667
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
ubuntu uses sudo in its privilege elevation model so essentially your passwd is used as the root passwd because you are in the sudoers file

236667
sudo	passwd
now to change the root passwd in ubuntu you need to open a terminal type sudo -s then su root this will switch you over to the actual root user and from here you can then run passwd and set a root passwd

that maximum seems to be the maximum for either dimension but there is a limit to how many pixels can be drawn which is the width multiplied by the height

i plugged a laptop directly into the router and was able to download a 5.5 mb file and verify its md5 hash which is not proof that the problem is downstream of the router but makes it seem quite likely since i failed to download the same file several times from two desktops one mac one windows

vmware	virtualbox
vmware and also virtualbox on a side node virtualizes 64bit inside a 32bit machine

238508
versioning	upgrade
in many cases the upgrade will require downloading the new versioning or having a disc shipped with the new updated versioning

238509
versioning	upgrade
please note that the serial number of the home versioning is kept during the upgrade

238523
vmware	virtualbox
if you are getting into more complicated linux-only stuff then for my money it is worth actually running linux either natively or in a vm solution like vmware workstation or virtualbox

238526

even though the keyboard mouse and speakers are all usb

239225
cpu	processors
in the world of x86-type cpus and many others the running of the processors is controlled by a timing clock to synchronise what s happening with other parts of the system ram rom etc. and this determines the overall speed of the cpu but the things that the processors can do also go through a number of specific states - called timing states or t states

if that s not available is there perhaps another filesystems that can be used on windows maybe even commercial that s faster than ntfs

240731
filesystems	ntfs
i get a feeling that ntfs is long outdated and slow compared to linux filesystems

240863
filesystems	ntfs
you should be able to use the ubuntu windows installer to install ubuntu to a filesystems in a file on top of ntfs however you will likely have to install grub manually and configure it to use the filesystems file

240867

yes you can definitely do this as long as you have video port the keyboard and mouse will just work

parallels is a virtual machine bootcamp allows you to run windows directly on your hardware

244089

this is much different than changing the memory cleanup and garbage collection options as you can force firefox to use less ram and use more disk cache

to limit the amount of ram firefox uses before using the disk cache navigate your browser to about config

well your screens redraws every other line 60 times a second task switching happens much faster than that

mp3	wav
it really depends on the source and the codec - most voice recorders tend to use a very low bitrate and this is often smaller than a mp3 -the rule of thumb to me is - if your current wav file is less than 1 mb per minute of length of the audio track transcoding it to mp3 may not be an advantage

peer	p2p
you can use multiple addresses simultaneously but your p2p software would have to do that explicitly and incoming packets won t automatically split up optimally instead whichever peer are given address a will use connection a and peer given address b will use connection b to send you data

247909
peer	p2p
estimating the bandwidth to each peer in order to set up the p2p link using the right address for optimal balancing is decidedly non-trivial

solaris	bsd
if the machine is only doing backups you have no requirements otherwise as to what applications should run on it it shouldn t run as an htpc etc. you might want to look into using solaris a solaris spin-off illumos openindiana or a bsd variant as they all support zfs as native kernel modules linux also supports zfs but only as a fuse module - it s slower though very stable i ve been using it for almost two years in a 14tb array

instead of firing packets straight out into the internet your computer will instead transmit them down an encrypted tunnel to a vpn endpoint on your university s network which then sends them out into the internet

248876
folder	directory
the alldup solution is best if you don t care about which copies of the files are preserved and which are discarded in a directory folder tree and you have a mix of tagged and non-tagged files in the same folder that you want to run the duplicate check on

248876

beyond compare is best if you want to retain the diectory folder tree and are compare 2 separate folder directory structures helped also by using the on-the-fly non-destructive flatten-tree option

umask	sudo
for the record the current version of sudo as a new option umask_override which should prevent the umask s from being merged so you should be able to lower the umask too

there are some virus files which will never allow you to get access to some popular website like fb and other depends upon the trojan code so i guess browser re-installation do not fix it because virus file is installed in your system s hard disk

the malware producers are winning that war and any benchmarks and tests used among the various anti-virus makers and journalists that show how well their product works are effectively just smoke screens to hide this fact

b given that i just have sata ii is it worth waiting paying extra for upcoming vertex 3 ssd or should i just get one of the current crop i gather the crucial c300 or vertex 2 are the best

250417
post	get
googling the answer is hopeless because searching for copy printer or duplicate printer you get a bunch of post about printer copiers or people complaining about duplicate printers getting created in the background precisely what i d like to be able to do

250437
gentoo	debian
i only worked with gentoo ebuilds so far which are extremely simple compared to the debian control files which i still find completely undecipherable

there s no need to upgrade the msdn versioning

250504
mouse	keyboard
even under very low processor and graphics loads i m experiencing fairly regular jerky freezes the computer seems to freeze for about half a secondâ audio and video halt and keyboard input gets delayed but the mouse cursor keeps moving

250565
screens	tablet
i m not talking about pinch to zoom on the tablet client where i can zoom in on an area of the screens to see it better but where the desktop doesn t know anything about it

250588
versioning	upgrade
if your machine is one with a third-party g3 upgrade card you may need to hack the newer versioning of os x to run them but this is a relatively straightforward process and you won t have any performance problems once you get it installed

250588
unix	bsd
my not-so-humble opinion is that mac os x absolutely blows away any linux distribution even for the hardest core unix fans considering it runs on top of a bsd unix-based kernel

250588
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
be sure to download the latest version is an incredible browser on the mac less so on windows or you can run firefox opera omniweb google-chrome etc

250707
vpn	lan
so my question is when connected to university vpn how do i still access my lan computers through hostname

250707
vpn	lan
i am kind of hoping that there s a way i can say myhomenetwork will always refer to lan and therefore even if connected to vpn t60p.myhomenetwork still refers correctly

250715
tunnel	vpn
as you already guessed just setting up dns records is not enough to have connectivity to your computers as all traffic is going through vpn tunnel to university network and your router is blocking incoming connections

250727
folder	directory
the erroneous assumption that you re making here is that moving subfolder items in an explorer folder is a simple operation that involves merely modifying a couple of directory entries

250727
folder	directory
a move of a folder item may end up as being a copy to new name then delete original at the low-level rather than rename this directory entry to that parent directory

250727
folder	directory
for starters it s because a folder is not a directory

250727
folder	directory
not all folder that explorer presents to the user are honest-to-goodness bona fide directory on a disc volume

250727
folder	directory
explorer has to for example work out what it means to move a directory from to a virtual folder denoting remote files on a smart phone viewed over a bluetooth ftp connection

250731
ubuntu	linux
i would like to use the following scenario for my favorite applications under linux ubuntu 10.10 in order to save grabbing the mouse and clicking them

250744
cpu	affinity	cpu	processors	affinity	processors
now i want windows to use 2 processors cores so i changed the setting in vb in windows device manager i see two processors but windows task manager shows performance graph for only one cpu and i cannot change processors affinity for applications

i need to reset it but want to know if there are any settings i can get out of it or need to put back in for the thing to work

250906
mouse	keyboard
these include mouse keyboard pci modem the ide optical drive power and data and the sata hdd power and data

250919
disk	ram
since there is at least 1.5gb of ram not being used something like allocating 1gb just as hard disk cache is it possible

250964
post	get
remove the ram completely and see if you get any post ram failure beeps long slow low-frequency beeps

250970
width	height
also bonus points resizing window to top of screen keeps width but changes height to cover screen from top to bottom

250994
vmware	virtualbox
an alternative to using wine would be to use virtualization with virtualbox or vmware for example

251024
affinity	processors
the windows function setthreadaffinitymask allows you to set the processors core affinity of a thread

251026
ati	nvidia
i believe it supports both ati amd and nvidia graphics cards

251094
cpu	processors
edit since you want specific information about why the wei score is lower for the mbp processors i should point out that the i7 m640 is a dual core cpu with 4 threads whereas the q6600 is actually quad core

that said i would not rush to get a 6gbps sata ssd

251176
filesystems	fat
arc firmware on arc systems the firmware does understand disc partitions and at least one filesystems format fat

251176
filesystems	fat
that executable program will be a boot loader than in turn loads and runs the linux kernel from another ordinary file on a not necessarily fat if the boot loader has its own extra filesystems drivers disc volume

i m having a lot of problems with flash player in my win 7 x64 laptop in youtube the videos are completely black you can only hear the sound and in vimeo the videos are played well in normal size but completely black in fullscreen

251264
google-chrome	firefox
i m sure that the problem isn t the browser since this happen in google-chrome firefox and ie 8

251286
google-chrome	firefox
this is independent of the browser whether i use google-chrome firefox or others the ad does creep in

251304
ubuntu	linux
my first take which succeeded on ubuntu linux was using

251308
udp	rtp
so far i know that i need to serve an rtp stream over udp that s streaming an mpeg-4 avc main or high profile with aac or ac3

251337
udp	tcp
this article gc html udp-in-ssh-tunneling.html shows one method using dns as the example around the problem by encapsulating the udp in tcp first

251340
bash	zsh
these examples use syntax that is specific to more modern shells such as bash ksh and zsh

251359
ethernet	wireless
how do i connect my ethernet networks to wireless

251373
ethernet	wireless
you need a wireless bridge or a wireless gaming adapter which is a device that connects to a wireless network and provides one or more wired ethernet ports

251395
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
undelete files from fat ntfs and ext2 filesystems

251397
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know for firefox but someone noticed using glintercept that google-chrome was using directx on his computer to display webgl contents however i m not sure if it s really angle or an internal google equivalent

251398
lan	localhost
2 - you configure chrome to use a socks proxy in the panel options under the hood change proxy settings internet propriety lan settings proxy server advanced servers fill the socks fields with the tor settings localhost and the tor s port

251410
versioning	upgrade
the stability means that you won t be getting the most recent versioning of packages through the official repositories but also that a standard package upgrade is extremely unlikely to break anything

251495
vmware	esx
it is a vmware virtual machine meaning you need either vmware workstation server or esx to host the virtual machine and make it usable

251539
wan	lan
your cable modem should go in the wan port of the router and the pcs into lan ports

251539
wan	lan
alternatively you could use the switch into a lan port and a separate long cable for the modem and the router via the wan port

251547
folder	directory
however you can then make a symlink to the folder of choice and save it as a favorite or display it on your desktop or home directory

251562
x86	64bit
i have x86 as my program files on my d drive and i downloaded the 64bit version of tortoise too

251574
g++	gcc
this version of knoppix seems to include gcc but not g++

251574
g++	gcc
so my question is can i write a script that calls gcc with appropriate options and flags to compile a c++ program that students could use in place of g++

251583
cpu	processors
to execute locally-installed applications using another computer s cpu and memory you could â assuming that the processors are compatible â try this

it is determined by protocol tcp udp local ip address and port and remote ip address and port

251614
ubuntu	linux
i need to work in a linux environment so i installed ubuntu 10.04 64 bit desktop edition and made my laptop dual booting

251652
postgresql	mysql
for mysql there may be something similar i m not sure hopefully someone here who s familiar with whatever database you re using can help with this if it s not postgresql

251654
folder	directory
you can move all folder including having more than one tmp folder by setting them in the directory panel of the preferences

251661
cpu	processors
a failed cpu fan could also be a problem because your processors could be running too hot

251677
disk	ram
i remember it may be possible to change windows xp from being a desktop mode to more suited for being a server in a server mode -- probably more ram allocated for hard disk caching network resources etc instead of for gui resource

251679
google-chrome	safari
i personally loath safari google-chrome is a good alternative imho

251697
put	get
so i guess there s no reason why you couldn t get a sata one and put it in an external usb housing

251698
fink	macports
in general i would add new libraries using a package manager fink macports etc

251739

the viewport switching speed changes relative to the amount of windows on that virtual screens - empty screens switching almost at normal speed single browser windows work almost decently but just 4 rxvt terminals slows the switches down to a crawl

251870
vmware	virtualbox
even if vmware isn t the virtualization platform you plan to use their converter is fantastic and i ve had success using the images it creates on hyperv and virtualbox

251945
affinity	processors
can processors core affinity be set on the process running the virtual machine

251945
xen	openvz
i am confused with xen kvm virtualbox openvz etc

251948
affinity	processors	vmware	virtualbox
if you run a virtualization system that uses a single process per machine such as virtualbox or vmware server you can set the affinity of that process to a particular processors

251953
restrict	shared
due to everything like shared etc being seen as filesystems they are restrict to what the operating system can cope with - in the case of ms-dos that s 8.3 format

on windows the most popular text formats are doc rtf and txt

252103
move	drag
dragging and dropping from one folder to another on the same logical partition both folders reside on lets say the c drive is actualy a file move not a file copy but when dragging and dropping a file from a folder in one logical partition to another folder on a diffrent logical partition moving a file from c d drag and drop will perform a file copy proccess

252105

252175
ubuntu	linux
consider mounting your windows partition from ubuntu or a linux live distribution to backup important data and reinstall the system

252216
virtualbox	bootcamp
if you are running windows on virtualbox not with bootcamp then remeber to change your host key from left command to right command from virtualbox not virtualbox vm menu virtualbox - preferences - input to make those shortcuts work

252226
ubuntu	linux
i m sure there are other versions of similar software available for linux and ubuntu

252229
hash	salt
what gets stored is the hash code of the password + salt and the salt itself

252229
hash	salt
in your special case you could if one salt is used for all passwords use a table with passwords + salt and the generated hash code

252230
super	implements
it will probably be super +s or something similar and then the number instead of super +number straight away because that is simpler to implements

252230
super	implements
oh and unity is also implements this super +number

252253
opensuse	linux
it is logical that openwrt is compatible with linux in your case opensuse since both are probably using very similar software

252277
direct3d	direct2d
and that i m not being presented the option of installing sp1 i dispatched an update to silverlight and a fix for internet explorer 9 being hosted in a direct2d or direct3d application

vmware	virtualbox
all that said i suggest setting up a vm product like virtualbox or vmware and seeing if running rhel6 in a vm meets your needs

252305
folder	directory
i ve seen some python java tools to automate openoffice but has anyone reliably scripted this to do more than one file and recurse through a folder directory tree with .doc files in it placing the converted .txt and .html files next to the original file in its location

252315
folder	directory
within this directory i have created a folder called recipes and a user called recipe

switching	screens
when i shut down my macbook it doesn t really power off the screens turn black as if it were switching off but when closing the screens the sleep led turn on

252415
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu and probably other distros run the script etc rc.local at the end of the boot process so that is probably the simplest place to put the command

252427
ubuntu	linux
before you do anything you might try booting from a linux livecd something like ubuntu and see if it will mount and if you can get anything off of it

252445
ubuntu	linux
the linux client tsclient on ubuntu anyway defaults to trying to reconnect every 60 seconds

252459
folder	directory
i m not sure what type of files they are there is no extension but the folder directory is structured like this

252489
mouse	keyboard
open task manager and keep it open and on top of the desktop sometimes freezes are only input devices like keyboard and mouse etc and you can still see what is happening in task manager look for processes using too much cpu cycles or the memory use is rising for a particular process

252508
freebsd	solaris
while the zfs implementation in freebsd isn t as up to date as the one in solaris most notably it s missing support for deduplication it s part of the core stable os

252508
freebsd	solaris
freebsd probably has better hardware support than solaris as well

252588
put	get
the bit density is fairly low at 350 bpi and the signal is manchester encoded so if you can get the data some other way you could certainly put it into an emulated pdp or vax see simh-vax works very well simh.trailing-edge.com vax.html

252645
ubuntu	linux
i personally like dsl for these types of situations but if you are not familiar with linux then go with an ubuntu live distro

252711

on a side note if you want some fun put the ssd in as the laptop s main drive and use the old sata as the external data drive

252735
mouse	keyboard
i can use keyboard shortcuts but its a real pain trying to operate 2nd machine with no mouse pointer

252946
x86	64bit
all x86 architecture processors since the 80286 both intel and amd and certainly including the 64bit flavors have an mmu and no desktop operating system in common usage attempts to disable its use

252948
solaris	bsd
all modern cpus used in normal computers desktops notebooks and servers have a mmu - as a matter of fact all modern operating systems the nt line of ms windows mac os x linux bsd solaris require a mmu because things like memory protection and virtual memory rely on it

252954
ethernet	wireless
the switch s is a jensen wireless router set to bridge has 4 10 100 ethernet ports

as such the temp or tmp directories could end up not technically pointing to a valid directory eg the â userprofileâ in userprofile appdata local temp not getting expanded to the userâ s actual profile on disk

253021
ati	nvidia
windows 7 in conjunction with ati or nvidia drivers has good support for various configurations of dual monitors

253032
openbsd	linux
i believe many of these projects focus on using linux for this i think openbsd would be an ideal fit as well given its excellent reputation for paranoid security which could make it possible for you to include openvpn and other such technologies to better meet your needs

253051
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
in any case if the filesystems is indeed some flavor other than fat or ntfs is this error consistent with that

253052
ubuntu	linux
you should be able to mount on windows with explore2fs or alternative grab a linux livecd or liveusb like ubuntu and mount it from there

253112
ubuntu	linux
i am using linux ubuntu and i cannot run any flash file

253132

for example someone upgrade through every versioning of windows starting with dos 5

253146
portrait	landscape
how can i set the resulting pdf s orientation from portrait to landscape

253175
switching	screens
yes you can and it s a new ability to windows 7 as iirc the fast user switching gets disabled when using domains in previous versions i cannot remember about vista but i think at least the welcome screens got disabled

253180
bluetooth	usb
the solution is to either move the bluetooth dongle to a usb port further away from the headphone socket or just leave it plugged in assuming that the interference only happens when it s inserted into the socket

253192
rar	zip
i think there are evaral application which can crack rar or zip files easyly by brute foce method or using dictionaries

253194
rar	zip
password protection of archives is usually not very strong i know of pwds in zip and rar is probaly not very much different

253202
mouse	keyboard
why don t you get a wireless keyboard and mouse

253204
mouse	keyboard
it simulates keyboard presses so you should be able to set it up to do whatever you want and according to the description you can control the mouse with it

253215
x86	64bit
right now it s 2010.10.2 and it supports 64bit x86 kernels

253240

253351
google-chrome	firefox
i don t want to use firefox or google-chrome

253351
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome does not follow my gtk2 customizations and firefox is just too resource heavy

253362
disk	ram
of course more memory means you can run more applications at the same time with less disk i o due to swap file activity -- the swap file is used to temporarily move data and code in ram off-line so that the same ram can then be used by something else

253362
opera	firefox
if you run two windows 7 machines side-by-side that have the same specifications except that one has 2 or 4 gbs of ram while the other has 8 gbs and start up the same applications google earth openoffice.org and opera or firefox at the same time the machine with more ram tends to get things started a bit faster

253362
disk	ram
after using them for a while type the same address in google earth open up the same web sites in opera and load a few documents in open office the one with more ram will see a lot less disk activity

253362
disk	ram
compared to the cost of replacing a disk earlier and for the performance gains i typically see it tends to be more noticeable after the user has been using their machine for a few months and has all sorts of toolbars background processes services and add-ons installed i find it to be a smart investment to start with more ram right from the beginning

253368
wan	lan
i may allow you to bridge one of the lan ports to the wan port

253368
freebsd	linux
you could then install linux or freebsd and build an appropriate firewall

253368
wan	lan
the bridging solution would involve bridging one or more lan ports to the wan port

253370
vmware	esx
i m thinking vmware s esx

if you need really high security because you re dealing with private information that has certain legal requirements for protection you d probably be much better off with a vpn such as that encrypts all communications that pass through its tunnel but this isn t the same as a proxy server anymore

yes setup a virtual machine and assign it a separate keyboard and mouse

254199

i know that with dd in linux you can copy a debian.iso to the usb and then install debian with it i ve done it using something like dd if win7.iso of dev sdb but i don t know if this would work for windows 7 iso and if dd will correctly copy the iso to the usb

disk	ram
if the host system permits it you can have a very large virtual machine with a lot of virtual ram and disk

256509
disk	ram
also you can decide to go the other way around to give the virtual machine a very modest amount of ram and disk and then choose and configure the os appropriately

256515
disk	ram
an old pc 300mhz pentium-ii with 256mb ram and 6gb disk is fine if you install and run just the bare os + a non-graphic firewall software package + just the extra packages you need in order to administer the machine like gnu screen etc but with no x-windows or desktep environment

256524
disk	ram
you can share ram using ram disk but that looks just like sharing normal disk except that these are in another computer s ram

256527
cpu	affinity
it s up to os to assign tasks to cpu cores or to individual cpus in an smp environment and you cannot force affinity of certain processes to a given core

kate	scite	kate	gnome
scite is closer to kate than kwrite in functionality but is gtk gnome based and has the line numbering wrapping and many other options available right in the menus just like kwrite

256590
switching	screens
as far as i can tell there s no actual fix but the workaround is to switching from the none or blank options in the screens saver menu to another one such as ribbons

256595
kde	gnome
no desktop like gnome or kde just icewm as the windows manager and nothing else that normal users might consider essential

256600
debian	linux
you don t specify your linux distribution but on debian the corresponding package is autofs5

filesystems	btrfs
however it only works for supported filesystems and does not currently support ext4 or btrfs

256622
stdout	stderr
you can have the shell run a program â œin the backgroundâ by appending but do shell script will still wait until every process has closed any instances of the file descriptors it opened for the programâ s stdout and stderr

unix	bsd
freebsd is a unix-like for legal reasons it can t be called unix operating system which has grown out of the original bsd berkeley system development operating system of the early days of unix

256690
unix	bsd
bsd was started back in 1977 by the studens and staff of berkeley university california and rapidly took hold as one of the most widely used version of unix mainly in use on the east coast of america the west coast was largely at t unix

while not as popular as linux freebsd has a good following amongst server sysadmins because the lightweight streamlined code and kernel make for a good stable server platform

textmate	notepad++
i am trying textmate on a mac and there are a lot of things i miss on notepad++ that i wish textmate has

256832
disk	ram
some code will be twice as big both in ram and on disk and some data structures will be larger too due to larger pointers and for efficiency reasons structures being padded to align with 64-bit boundaries rather than 32-bit ones but most bulk data such as that held in ram by a database will not have a noticeably larger footprint

256832
disk	ram
if you have as much paged out to disk as you have in ram then you are likely to see a significant performance drop due to swap thrashing pages constantly being swapped between ram and disk if you get into a situation where you have 8 times as many memory pages on disk as you have in ram i expect the vm will have long since effectively ground to a halt

256848

i was told i could take up the battery for the bios and put it back in to reset it but i can t get the case open

chown	chmod	chown	mount
if not do i need to chmod all files to 664 and chown all the directories that are used to mount the usb device and the iso image

256895
stdout	stderr
â the proper method is to redirect stdout and stderr and have the shell run the program in the background

256895
stdout	stderr
the redirection is required because not only does do shell script wait for its immediate child the shell to exit but it also waits for all instances of the writable ends of the pipes it creates for the shellâ s stdout and stderr to be closed

256895
stdout	stderr
the shellâ s stdout and stderr do shell script â s pipes are inherited by the programs it runs without redirection even ones run in the background with

256895
stdout	stderr
the other answers that use open inside do shell script work because open actually launchservices does the equivalent work of backgrounding the resulting program and sending its stdout and stderr elsewhere

256899
sorting	filtering
if you have thousands or more which is common with mp3 music collections that aren t categorized into sub-directories then the file system may be slowing things down even with indexing it can still be slow especially if the application accessing it is doing manual filtering sorting

256905
unix	bsd
i m basically targeting unix platforms osx linux bsd

256921
cpu	processors
by looking at cpu-z s real-time report of the processors s clock speed it seems to be loosely related to what frequency the cpu is running at which would imply that it means percent of maximum possible frequency the cpu is running at

i ve been using applications to enhance trackpad and magic mouse usage bettertouchtool and then magicprefs but since these problems arose i deleted them

257035
vim	emacs
i am currently interested in switching from vim to emacs

257037
vim	emacs
it s interesting to me that your reason for switching from vim to emacs is about unix integration and how you ve seen emacs folk with shell buffers etc. as it s telling of your experience level with these two editors in general

257037
vim	emacs
neither emacs nor vim come out of the box the way that you d like them but rather act as platforms on which to develop a work flow

257037
vim	emacs
for example vim doesn t come with the functionality you describe out of the box but plugins like conque and addon-async much the same way emacs doesn t

google-chrome	firefox
extensions in google-chrome are not as powerful as the ones in mozilla firefox

the first time i noticed it was when i was watching a youtube video a few weeks ago the browser i ve tried with internet explorer firefox and google-chrome same results looks normal but the video player itself is really blurry

wan	lan	vpn	lan
if you can esablish the vpn using some other means your router a vpn server etc. then you might try using wake on lan but it s tricky to make it work on a lan and it gets a lot trickier when a wan connection is involved

257218
filesystems	ntfs
as explained by others it is hardly necessary to run chkdsk to find unexpexted filesystems errors on an ntfs partition as these are marked unclean when they are not unmounted correctly

257218
filesystems	fat
in my experience chkdsk on fat can easily destroy what s left of useful filesystems information making recovery even harder

257218
filesystems	fat
if you have a bad fat filesystems don t touch it create a bit-by-bit partition image make a copy of the image and try to recover data from the copy

affinity	processors
as far as the operating system and applications are concerned each core is a separate processors and is subject to the same affinity rules as having multiple processors

257408
processors	hyperthreading
which processors be it real core or hyperthreading a process runs on depends entirely on the operating system s scheduling system

257415
cpu	processors
for example lets assume we have two processes with two threads each and a single threaded application all working hard on a dual core processors or dual cpu makes no difference here

257415
cpu	affinity	cpu	processors	affinity	processors
if we then go and set up processors affinity for process b to limit it to one cpu then all the threads of that process are bound to that cpu as well and will not run on any other cpu

257448
opera	google-chrome
to be more clear i want opera to be able to access the tcp port 1850 but i want to block google-chrome on tcp port 1850

plug-in your spare mouse and keyboard to your computer

257519
afp	smb
yes airport extreme and time capsule both share their usb disks via both afp apple file protocol the default remote filesystem mounting protocol for macs and smb server message block the default remote filesystem mounting protocol for windows which is what the open source samba server serves

257519
ubuntu	linux
so the smb client in ubuntu should be able to mount your airport extreme s usb disk just like it mounts a windows server or linux samba server

what you will need to do is first examine the html of the login form to find the form elements that the login system uses and the form s action then use curl or wget to send a request in the right format post or get to the form s action url containing the login variables and data

versioning	upgrade
i thought iâ d bought the full versioning but it looks like iâ ve bought an upgrade versioning because when windows 7 prompted me to activate today it said it couldnâ t because iâ d bought an upgrade versioning and done a clean install with it

257849
tunnel	vpn
many home routers with vpn pass-thru won t allow more than one outgoing vpn tunnel at a time at least not to the same server

257849
vpn	lan
if you connect to the vpn with one system another on the home lan won t work

once that s done the vpn can then be connected to by different computer on the lan often rebooting the router will speed this up

folder	dir
the difference is that answers to the other question and all the other help on the net recommends using dir x from the command line in order to get the 8.3 filename and then using rd - but my folder does not have an 8.3 filename

258343

i also have virtualbox installed and the auto-bridging feature of vmware workstation won t pick one of my built-in adapters because they re now labeled virtualbox bridged networking driver miniport at the end instead of just the built-in names

258363
ethernet	wireless
to get the most performance you would probably want to buy a router with gigabit ethernet built in since most only come with 100mbit sec ports - limiting throughput to around 12 mbytes sec which is less than wireless n speeds and far slower than the full potential or a wired network

with input director you can share a single keyboard mouse across a set of systems

switching	screens
you switching which system receives the input either by hotkey or by moving the cursor so that it transitions from one screens to the other in a very similar fashion to a multi-monitor setup

i don t think synergy can be configured to perform events on mouse keyboard actions only to produce other mouse keyboard events

i don t think this would work because when you move the mouse cursor off the server the active window is defocused so if you could type on the server s keyboard there would be no active window for the keypresses to go in to

ubuntu	linux
on a mac what vim versions are there and are they 100 compatible with vim for ubuntu linux

259464
openbsd	linux
or if you have a better crawler suggestion that works in linux or openbsd then suggest it instead

259495
perl	tcl
vim can also embed one or more other general purpose languages lua perl python ruby and tcl for use in â œscriptingâ vim

if it s enabled the lines labeled direct2d enabled and directwrite enabled will say true

259526
versioning	upgrade
we will not be able to offer an upgrade product within europe said john curran windows business lead at microsoft uk adding that only the full versioning of the software will be available to europeans

259526
versioning	upgrade
in europe microsoft will send buyers of new pcs a full versioning of the software rather than an upgrade versioning

259526
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	switching	screens	firefox	safari
the preferred remedy for europe he said was to offer users a screens when they first switching on windows 7 that gives them a choice between ie google-chrome firefox safari or opera

259554
ubuntu	linux
so i just recently installed ubuntu linux 10.04 on my desktop machine alongside windows 7 it booted just fine the first few times but after i went into my windows 7 recovery software provided by packard bell i did this on accident btw i exited it straight away and made no changes as far as i know and re-booted i get this screen

259563
udp	tcp	tunnel	packets
however when one of the nodes is connected to the internet via an unstable internet connection unstable lots of dropped packets inconsistent speed constant out-of-order packets high latency etc. openvpn will fail continuous timeouts and packets non-delivery regardless of whether the tunnel is being made over udp or tcp

259563
tunnel	packets
i have tested pptp but the result was subpar - it did not drop packets the way openvpn did but the resulting connection was maybe 50 - 100x slower than w out a tunnel

259573
ubuntu	linux
the system has windows 7 and ubuntu linux 10.4 installed in two separate partitions

259578
versioning	upgrade
i was running synergy+ before the upgrade not sure on the versioning

259614
google-chrome	firefox
to do the transition i have a basic feature i need to configure on tmux switch the the tab n by using cmd + n like firefox google-chrome iterm2 itself etc

the antivirus pops up an alert on the download that s ok but i cannot run the eicar.com program because it s an 16-bit program and i m running win7 64bit

259624
versioning	upgrade
but since it is an old versioning it does not support new pdf format and i don t want to upgrade for such a simple use

259637
pull	push	mouse	keyboard
i pull the mouse and keyboard usbs out slightly before the room gets cleaned i just push them back in to turn it on

259648
disk	ram
you can limit how much it gets used by disabling hibernation so it doesn t write gigs of ram info the disk every time it sleeps and by using the windows power settings to turn off drives when they re not in use click start type power edit press enter click advanced go to hard disk section

259668
folder	directory
i m trying to set an additional include directory in a visual which i understand usually exists in a c c++ folder

259668
folder	directory
any ideas how i get the c c++ folder to show up so that i can set additional include directory

259703
filesystems	hfs
now what s going on is the apple s hfs filesystems is putting the file properties in the ._ foobar names so that they can be restored on another mac system

259718
ubuntu	linux
the two kinds of linux in question would probably be arch and either ubuntu or fedora. from what i have read it seems like the hybrid mbr gpt combination required for multi-booting means that you are limited to a maximum of four partitions one of which is used by the macbook as an efi system partition and this scheme would require at least five probably six or seven if i wanted a swap partition and or shared storage

259740
mouse	keyboard
press menu key on keyboard opening the same menu as mouse right button menu + n key.

259762
bash	zsh
you can write a shell script that will mount partition even ask a password for it and then exec bash or exec zsh etc

259777
freebsd	netbsd
i m not too up on the internals of netbsd - i m more of a freebsd person

259799
cifs	smb
if you need to access files from another computer the easiest way is to share them via windows file sharing smb and then mount it via the cifs automount section of the management tab of the administration section

259800
google-chrome	firefox
another less ideal option would be to simply search your hard drive especially in the firefox directory if you have that for the file and copy it to the google-chrome directory but again thatâ s not ideal particularly since that file should not even be in the google-chrome directory

259806
switching	screens
alternatively you could switching to separate x screens instead of using twinview xinerama

259812
folder	directory
without having to specify any folder or change my working directory in the command line

259828
ssl	https
eavesdropping is commonly countered by the use of secure connections such as ssl https and vpns

259898
wan	lan
on my home lan behind the router accessing my website via the wan direct gets me to my router s admin login page

259898
wan	lan
accessing my website via it s home lan ip address from another computer on my home lan gets me to the website but the layout display is broken and clicking on any link takes me to the wan direct ip my router s admin login page

259899
wan	lan
i would be willing to bet that your browser is looking for stylesheets at your lan ip address but it should be looking to the wan ip address

259908
folder	directory
but how does the system know where in the directory tree the file or folder is and how does it translate the filename into an i-node

259908
folder	directory
an explanation from the file systems point-of-view of the process that happens when i request the file folder directory filename would be much appreciated

259909
folder	directory
scan the directory looking for an item named folder

259909
folder	directory
if folder is not a directory or a symlink pointing to a directory return enotdir

259909
folder	directory
scan the directory folder looking for an item named directory

259909
folder	directory
scan the directory folder directory looking for an item named filename and get the associated inode number

259909
folder	directory
note folder and folder directory can be mount-points for completely separate filesystems

259911
rar	zip
if it s a compressed archive format like zip or rar then they generally have an option to add files to the archive without unpacking the entire archive first

259941
pop-up	dialog
nevertheless each time that google calendar sync starts a synchronization outlook pop-up the select profile dialog

259973
gmail	hotmail
as well as being supported by local e-mail clients pop3 is also supported by most webmail services such as hotmail gmail and yahoo

259980
cpu	processors
what is the difference between multiple cpu processors ie pentium d and multicore processors ie core 2 duo

259984
google-chrome	firefox
i ve had it over a year and file upload in a browser has never worked on any website in any browser ie firefox google-chrome

259995
ssl	https
https stands for http secure and is a combination of http and ssl tls secure sockets layer transport layer security and is used to provide an encrypted connection to a website

260029
cpu	processors
multiple cpu processors like the pentium d are literally just two distinct cpus two dies that just happen to share the same physical package

260029
cpu	processors
multi-core cpu processors like the the core 2 series are two processing units that share the same die silicon substrate

260029
cpu	processors
so the multiple cpu processors are like having 2 cpus which are just conveniently packaged together whereas the multi-core cpu processors are 2 cpus on the same chip

260040
fullscreen	minimized
and even with a mouse - when i want to play pause i must activate firefox window select the tab where music plays and hit play pause button manually - this is a pain especially when you play a fullscreen game that can not minimized itself

260042
cpu	hyperthreading
with hyperthreading there is one 1 cpu but it can maintain the state of two threads at the same time such that when one thread is waiting for a long process like waiting for the hdd or a memory operation the other thread can execute

260047
png	ico
i have bunch of svg icons that i d like to use for my application to be developed in vb.net 2010 and since it has no support to handle svg icons i need to convert those icons into either png or ico with preferred output resolution

260053
mouse	keyboard
your regular account different keyboard and mouse than your regular ones esp

260056

after installing drivers from somewhere online the trackpad doesn t work and not listed in device manager as mouse

260128
switching	screens
and will switching the display mode to 640x480 and fill the whole screens

260134
freebsd	linux
i would prefer it was linux or bsd although i can barely get around in freebsd right now just dl ed it yesterday

260136
ubuntu	linux
i would definitely recommend ubuntu server if you are beginning or even have administered and set up linux nix based systems before

260156
switching	screens	mouse	keyboard
then you can just place your computer screens next to each other and switching from one to the other with just one mouse and one keyboard

260202
ubuntu	linux
for chromium in ubuntu or kubuntu linux uninstall the package flashplugin-installer

260206
unix	bsd
if you are looking for enterprise linux most will use red hat enterprise or use unix instead such as a bsd variant like open bsd unix

260206
unix	bsd
bsd of freebsd unix is what the mac operating system is now based on

260208
versioning	upgrade
if you had renamed or moved your older versioning of iphoto or fcp before you did the upgrade then the new versioning is probably in the standard location name and you can safely delete the old versioning you had put elsewhere

260223
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
you can try compiling your own tar or installing it from macports or fink if available homebrew doesn t have it

260224
ubuntu	linux
i use windows 7 but in my time here i have used xp pro vista and even linux ubuntu

260225
folder	directory
this will give you a desktop folder and put everything but favorites under it including your user directory

260233
ethernet	wireless
if you decide to buy one for this purpose make sure it supports dd-wrt . you can also have a computer with a wireless adapter that is connected to the apartment wireless network that subsequently shares that connection via ethernet cable with your own wireless router or via a second wireless adapter in the computer

260238
vmware	virtualbox
you could use usb flash disk to transfer files between host and virtual machine vmware and virtualbox do support usb

260264
bash	zsh
you can use this variable on individual commands by taking advantage of the ability of bourne-style shells sh ksh bash zsh etc. to prefix commands with extra environment variables

260338
kde	gnome
there should be support in gdm gnome and kdm kde as well

260339
afp	smb
you can set up afp smb and nfs all together assign users to them and tweak a few detailed options as well as being all kerberised if you re doing single sign on

260342
ubuntu	debian
does ubuntu differ from debian in power management

260351
wan	lan
put your internet into the wireless router and then put the wired router s wan side on the lan side of the wireless router

260356
pop-up	dialog
assorted software occasionally pop-up dialog boxes with questions or messages

260359
pop-up	dialog
some are making system calls so that the dialog boxes will always pop-up on the main or primary monitor

260405
ubuntu	linux
i would advise you try to recover your data from a linux based operating system like ubuntu you ll get less chances of getting a virus copy and you can also see hidden windows files more easily

260418
ubuntu	linux
also if we re just talking about getting a user s session who s logged in at the linux pc then in ubuntu at least you can share your desktop with system preferences and share desktop

260465
folder	directory
these logs won t tell you much about what caused it look and see if you have a folder in the windows directory called minidump see if there are any .dmp files in there

260486
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs filesystems will issue trim

260489
nas	qnap
however our backup strategy is pretty non-existent we all have access via webdav to our qnap nas located at home however we copy files accross when we can remember to do so terrible i know

260540
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
install coreutils from fink macports homebrew then use

260554
cvs	svn
what should i do to change the server name in the cvs configuration and what should clients do to something analogous to svn relocate

260584
asterisk	pbx
asterisk is the go to open source pbx

260584
voip	sip
your standard home router possibly isn t going to handle nat traversal for voip very well so if you can get the client to ring sip but don t hear any voice rtsp this is likely why

260585
voip	sip
i assume what you re paying for is voip already so perhaps all you have to do is get sip credentials from your service provider and use their voip server

260646
mouse	keyboard
if i plug both keyboard and mouse one of the devices won t work

260663
rar	zip
the discussion of compress and then encrypt or vice-versa led me to ponder the following question many compression containers like zip 7z and rar support encrypting these containers

260664
mouse	keyboard
external drives and such consume more power than a mouse or keyboard

260703
stdout	stderr
is equivalent to which redirects both stdout and stderr to the given file.

260761
mouse	keyboard
but it s just not interacting with the display at all mouse doesn t move keyboard does nothing

260774
notepad++	textpad
notepad++ notepad2 and textpad will all do tailing i think

260788
cpu	processors
what do processors and cpu cores mean here

260790
cpu	processors
cpu cores means the number of cores in each physical processors two here

260796
range	min	range	max	min	max
smcfancontrol only lets you set the fan speed in the range of apple s min and max values

260821
ethernet	wireless
i am guessing you are on wireless and your ethernet adapter is showing as not connected or the other way around

260841
filesystems	ntfs
microsoft has no desire and no real reasons to provide the open source community with details of the full inner workings of the ntfs filesystems

260841
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
it is also possible for different linux flavours to have different versions of the ntfs drivers which could be why ubuntu was fine but mint is not though if you were using xp with ubuntu then that could be why they were happy

260855
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs
to retrieve the last version of each file if you have a lot of different files for each project you could use a free versioning software used usually by developpers like cvs bazaar or git

260861
mouse	keyboard
i m using a standard apple keyboard and an hp mouse

260964
gentoo	linux
well to make things more difficult i m essentially cross-platform windows cygwin and linux gentoo are my two main ones but i ve been known to flirt with mac os x as well so open options would be great

260988
chunked	transfer-encoding
these are chunk markers of http chunked transfer-encoding as defined in rfc 2616

260989
ubuntu	linux
i booted the machine with a ubuntu 10.10 live cd it could not recognise the linux hard drive any more

260989
filesystems	fat
testdisk told me that the linux hard drive is now in a fat filesystems

261025
sudo	passwd
number of minutes that can elapse before sudo will ask for a passwd again

261056
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has a significantly more restricted extension api than firefox

261056
google-chrome	firefox
as such it seems to me that a very significant subset of the google-chrome api could be implemented in firefox either as a firefox extension or a separate extension compiler like there exists for greasemonkey scripts which incidentally are another example of something that works exactly the same way as google-chrome content scripts

261056
google-chrome	firefox
if implemented this would allow most google-chrome extensions to install and run in firefox

261056
google-chrome	firefox
even if they weren t i d be very surprised if this early effort still worked with either firefox 4 or the latest changes to the google-chrome extension api

261056
google-chrome	firefox
so my question is does anybody know what the current state of the art is with regards to google-chrome extension api compatibility layers in firefox

261067
3des	aes
3des is computationally intense compared to aes for example and it could be that you re bumping against a cpu limitation

261071
google-chrome	firefox
many google-chrome extensions are just greasemonkey scripts and these can be used with the greasemonkey extension or compiler on firefox with no changes

261071
google-chrome	firefox
if you re looking to port a google-chrome extension to firefox or planning to write one for both take a look at mozilla s new jetpack extension api which was designed to work in a manner similar to the way google-chrome s extensions work but still offer the vastly increased access to the browser the original firefox api is known for

261097
udp	tcp
dns queries are done over udp not tcp

it would know the format of jpg gif png word docs exif segments of photos etc

261233
hide	show
this show then hide the start menu but keeps it focused

261237
bash	tcsh
you can either use tcsh as your shell chsh -s tcsh or install bash and use that

261256
ubuntu	centos
ps i am new on mac after few years on centos ubuntu so i am familiar with the use of package managers such as yum or apt or installing via sources

as far as i know mozilla firefox creates a directory in home folder local settings in case of windows

261307
mouse	keyboard
a while ago i had a similar problem that showed up days after i had upgraded from ubuntu 9.10 to 10.4 i could still login and even open an application or two and then suddenly keyboard and mouse would lock up but the applications would keep running music or videos would keep playing running downloads would keep running etc

261481
trojan	virus
some googling revealed a possible virus trojan - but i m not quite willing to jump to that conclusion quite yet

261509
ubuntu	debian
for the example i ll be using an ubuntu debian machine

261523
ethernet	wireless
also i just tried to share my wireless connection through ethernet through firestarter and that didn t work either

261537
folder	directory
unlike all the other folder in my c users matt directory these folder did not have the location option in properties so i couldn t move them that way

261544
128bit	64bit
if a suitably sized quantum computer capable of running grover s algorithm reliably becomes available it would reduce a 128bit key down to 64bit security roughly a des equivalent

can t you just do grep -v 3 assuming the columns are delimiter by spaces

261560
ethernet	wireless
the ethernet and wireless drivers showed the yellow triangle with the exclamation mark in control panel

261568
google-chrome	firefox
ok i m addicted to firefox but i cannot be blind google-chrome way to handle webpages pre-loading rendering and other features is great

261568
rss	feed
third i don t need live bookmarks because i notices i put them all in a directory notizie so something that will contain all rss feed is ok but should be always visible

ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i have a linux mint box pretty much an ubuntu distro

261614
mouse	keyboard
mouse and keyboard were still working so i tried a usb drive in the back panel same thing

261617
bash	zsh
i d like to log in switch to bash or zsh and source my own account s .bash_profile or .zshrc

261637

lots of websites don t seem to be loading at all in all of my browsers safari google-chrome firefox

261741
google-chrome	firefox
put below code in .mozilla firefox xxxx.default google-chrome userchrome.css

261749

by using the numerical width and height of the edit artboard tool modifies the size maintaining the center point

261779
filesystems	ntfs
or recover the filesystems journal on an ntfs disk

261817
opera	firefox
if you need to know how to do this more in-depth i would google change proxy browser-name such as internet explorer firefox opera

261822
folder	dir
the message file has vanished means that rsync called the proper system calls to read the contents of a folder dir dirent i believe and when it later tried to read one of the contained files it did not find it - open 2 failed

261867
svg	vml
vml was submitted as a proposed standard to the w3c in 1998 ... development of the format ceased in 1998 ... vml is still available in internet explorer 9 but microsoft expects web sites to transition to svg in the future

261892
post	put
the manufacturers sometimes put a lot less care into their software than they do their hardware as can be found at the hp cpu assassin su blog post

261918
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
to be sure you can exclude them explicitly especially if you use a unix package manager such as homebrew fink or macports that uses opt which doesn t exist by default the system also has certain folders that are hidden by default such as bin

261918
folder	directory
remember that the system itself is quite small with by far the most data being in users home directory and the applications folder

261923
switching	screens
since i frequently switching from one task to another each of which often involves multiple windows it s not uncommon to have at least 40-50 windows open carefully arranged to make the best use of screens real estate

261933
bash	tcsh
this is the case in most of the unix shells bourne shell tcsh bash etc. cmd.exe and windows powershell on windows and command.com on dos

261986
vmware	virtualbox
i ran 3 vmware virtual machines plus the virtualbox all with 2-gigs memory and had no cpu issues whatsoever

261998
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux ubuntu 10.10

262022
copying	overwrite
copying is trouble cause you could overwrite newer drivers plus you ll surely copy far more than you actually need filling up your folder with unnecessary files

262033
voip	sip
i m new to voip telephony and the sip stack but i have lots of experience with media servers as a developer

262046
chown	chmod
i had chmod 777 chown angela

262047
asterisk	pbx
i think you can start with asterisk as the pbx software and freepbx to configure asterisk using a web interface

262085
pppoe	dhcp
look at the model of your router and google for the manual find out how to access it and set up its connection type you need to change it from dhcp to pppoe and enter your credentials

262096
icmp	tcp
as far as why does one work and not the other one thing to remember is that ping uses a different protocol icmp than http tcp

262101
disk	ram
assuming a fairly recent computer with middle-grade drives on a minimal linux boot disk running just the zeroing operation no gui internet etc loaded entirely to ram it could be anywhere from 2-12 hours

262107
mouse	keyboard
i know in notepad++ i can use mouse doubleclick to select whole word but i want to use some keyboard shortcut

262115
mtu	pppoe
if your dsl isp uses pppoe your mtu probably needs to be 1492 or less

262141
notepad++	scite
use a text editor that understands both line endings like scite or notepad++ if you don t need to convert all line ending in all your files but just don t want to see the entire file bunched up on the first line

262156
filesystems	fat
on fat filesystems the inode and the directory entry are the same entity - so removing a directory entry also removes the file

262176
cpu	affinity
after that if you still want to set the cpu affinity of a process on linux you can use the taskset command or if you re writing the program yourself the sched_setaffinity system call

262206
robocopy	xcopy
if that s annoying you can always use xcopy or robocopy via command prompt for large number of file operations

262220
mouse	keyboard
your keyboard mouse and monitor plug into the kvm and then the kvm plugs into your two computers

262241
vmware	virtualbox
you may use a virtualization software like virtualbox or vmware

262262
vmware	virtualbox
i have an installation of vmware virtualbox and avira antivir

262278
vmware	virtualbox
just go with either virtualbox or vmware i would go for vmware though as a personal preference

262285
vmware	virtualbox
the most important benefit that i ve found to vmware over virtualbox is the usb support

262285
vmware	virtualbox
that s comparing vmware which is free against virtualbox

262304
filesystems	fat
exfat basically takes the fat filesystems to the next level adding a large amount of long awaited features that the fat32 system was sorely lacking

262304
filesystems	ntfs
what microsoft developers have basically done is update the fat32 filesystems to exfat moving from 32-bit addressing to 64-bit addressing to offer an improved speed alternative over moving to ntfs at the same time making it possible to create store or transfer huge files files greater than 4gib

262304
filesystems	ntfs
in theory exfat does not have as much of the operational overhead of ntfs as it lacks many features that add complexity and therefore processing time and disk latency to the filesystems

262314
ethernet	wireless
i had some trouble with dns turns out my laptop was trying to use my wireless connection instead of my ethernet connection to access it

262346
perl	tcl
i d prefer to do this using pure windows xp dos or unix commands - or if needed download an existing executable utility that doesn t need installing like tcl or perl scripts

262347
pppoe	dhcp
preferably i would like to monitor at the pppoe interface or possibly my dhcp server interface

262347

when trying to run an installer jar file i am getting an error saying that write access is denied to create a directory under the program files folder

but sometimes when i get back to my office i forget to put back the old battery

262642
folder	directory
you need to set your home environment variable to whatever directory you selected for creating the .ssh folder it doesn t have to be necessarily users username

262655
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome

262655
google-chrome	firefox
for both current versions at time of post of firefox and google-chrome in osx cmd + shift + f invokes a full

262709
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is great for that its like linux with training wheels

262716
vmware	virtualbox
depends on how minimalistic minimalistic is - vmware server and virtualbox run headless if you want them to and you can run them atop windows or linux

262716
vmware	virtualbox
if you re new to virtualisation vmware server or virtualbox are better bets tho - esxi is notoriously finicky about hardware and running atop windows or linux means you rely on the host os s hardware support

262730
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari
since firefox google-chrome and opera not sure about safari has their own sync services it might be not a good idea for using third-party services

262730
google-chrome	firefox
the article ars examines google-chrome and firefox bookmark sync protocols is a good start for writing firefox synchronisation or google-chrome synchronisation plugins

262759
ant	maven
maven ant etc

262776
temp	tmp
go into sysdm.cpl - advanced- environment variables and set the tmp and temp environment variables to point to the hdd and not the ssd

262788
switching	screens
i was only pressing it once and expecting it to switching screens

262839
udp	tcp
and that both machines have ports 137 udp 445 tcp and 139 tcp open

262848
ubuntu	linux
i agree with mitsosc on ubuntu because dell chose ubuntu as their official goto linux flavor and they also ship with ubuntu

262872
google-chrome	firefox
there is more than one dns resolver in mac os x and firefox and google-chrome may not be using mdnsresolver

262893
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i ve tried firefox google-chrome and safari and none will load the page

mount unknown filesystems type ntfs

263021
vmware	esx
you use vmware server esx workstation player elsewhere

263021
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
parallels and virtualbox tend to have better performance than vmware across all platforms that i have used virtualbox linux windows os x parallels os x

263022
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
parallels vmware fusion and virtualbox

263024
versioning	upgrade
the primary reason for my change is that the versioning upgrade versioning 2 to 3 versioning 3 to 4 of parallels seem to continuously corrupt my virtual hard drive image

263024
versioning	upgrade
i have had problems with the versioning upgrade every time new parallels software is released been a user since version1 was released

263027
centos	linux
linux distribution is centos 5.5 wine is 1.2.1 1.2.1-1.el5.rf from romforge

263065
disk	ram
even using windows vss to snapshot the disk underneath a running vm is fraught with danger - you have copied the windows disk state for a running machine but without the contents of ram

263066
folder	directory
so i have to move from folder to folder uploading the programs in that directory

263070
debian	linux
i ve been using a good old powerbook g3 bronze keyboard with debian linux for years now

263073
put	get

263099
mouse	keyboard
make sure you have the latest version of intellipoint available here microsoft mouse and keyboard hardware - download software

263114
kde	gnome
xterm however is desktop environment-agnostic because â most importantly â it was created long before kde and gnome and qt and gtk

263114
gtk	xlib
xterm is a pure xlib program and uses the font rendering provided by x11 while gnome terminal being written with gtk uses freetype via pango

in etc sudoers visudo add a line like this

263142

my cpu is an amd athlon tm 64 x2 dual core processors 6000+

ssl	https
if this is an https secure address click tools click internet options click advanced and check to be sure the ssl and tls protocols are enabled under the security section

263179
mouse	keyboard
just the blackscreen shows up i think it is because of the memory is like full and the mouse cursor is on the keyboard responses like caps-lock led goes on and off when i press the button but i cant turn back to windows

263388
ubuntu	linux
unetbootin allows you to create bootable live usb drives for ubuntu fedora and other linux distributions without burning a cd

263405
put	get
i get a permission denied if i put sudo ssh-agent .

263414
mouse	keyboard
the software is for display only and doesn t require any user interaction via keyboard or mouse

263416
mouse	keyboard
if it s linux disable inputs from the mouse and keyboard and don t allow usb drives or cd to boot

263431
x86	64bit
i am trying to install mysql server 5.5 now just wondering which tar file i should pick - ia-64 or x86 64bit

263434
x86	64bit
x86 64bit

263436
ethernet	wireless
what you require is a small maybe 4 of 5 port switch to increase the number of ethernet ports available on the existing router and a wireless access point to share the network out as and when you want it

263502
google-chrome	firefox
the ie8 bookmark-manager has no add bookmark function like google-chrome firefox .

263537
google-chrome	firefox
support ie9 google-chrome 10beta and firefox

263555
mouse	keyboard
what i m looking for is some kind of utility that locks all keyboard and mouse access and enables it again when entering a password or something basically the same that screensaver does except it doesn t show webpages

263589
hfs+	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+	filesystems	hfs
mac os x uses hfs+ filesystems and windows have no built-in support to read and write from hfs+ partition but there are some 3rd party drivers that can support hfs in windows you can read more about hfs here while this and this page has some guidance on enabling read-write support in mac for ntfs filesystems that will work with windows

263593
mouse	keyboard
still locks and demands a password if you touch the mouse or keyboard but shows the contents of the screen rather than some natty effect

263604
runas	schtasks
presumably you could use runas to launch schtasks under the system account

263615
put	get
if it s small enough i d put it in an airtight container with a desiccant you could get one of those ones intended for closet dehumidification

263646
fiddler	charles
the most universal way would be set up a small proxy such like proxomitron free fiddler free ie-only privoxy open-source or charles 30 day trial - then you will be able to see everything for any browser

263760
folder	directory
you could rename the folder while putting a symlink called applications pointing to it inside its parent directory

263772
google-chrome	firefox
i would like to use google-chrome instead of firefox because of his synching mechanism which in firefox is quite faulty only bookmarks are imported a big problem cos i need extensions too

263772
google-chrome	firefox
i managed to make google-chrome really similar to firefox with plugins and things like that i asked it in my previous question how to turn google-chrome into firefox clone

263772
pop-up	dialog
however i m missing an important thing i need to bind in some way changing the source code of the plugin or using anything else ctrl + b to click to an icon in the plugin bar basically i have to show the dialog that pop-up when you click on that icon

263784
mouse	keyboard
if you don t have microwave ovens nor baby monitor in your environment i would recommend to use bluetooth keyboard mouse set

263784
mouse	keyboard
other things you should be aware of when using wireless keyboard mouse set

263787
rpm	yum
i am trying to install yum utility on my centos 4 system that doesn t have any rpm utility or build-essentials

263802
unix	bsd
i think this functionality came down to whether or not your unix s behavior followed system-v at t or berkeley s unix bsd .

263802
jobs	cron
setting up cron jobs to run on other user s accounts

263832
filesystems	btrfs
in addition since there is currently no fsck for btrfs it is possible to damage the filesystems and render it unusable in the event of a power failure because there is no means to recover from the damage

263832
filesystems	btrfs
until a filesystems check utility is ready i would not recommend btrfs and it would probably be best to select option 3

263861
sudoers	passwd
i guess i have to edit the sudoers file to give user1 the user executing the script privileges to be able to log as user2 with no passwd prompt

263872
filesystems	hfs+
some sources state that hfs+ the default-filesystem of mac os x doesn t suffer as badly from lack of trim as other filesystems

263888
sudoers	visudo
in the sudoers file visudo have

263939
udp	tcp
in the netgear i have added a tcp udp service on port 9091 called transmission

263966
wan	lan
lan -- wan is most likely csma in a hub and multiplexed in a router

263977
google-chrome	firefox
i was using firefox for long time and recently moved to google-chrome

263978
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome can do this because the developers know where firefox and the other browsers store their data

263978
google-chrome	firefox
in exactly the same way the firefox developers know where google-chrome stores it s bookmarks

263989
rar	zip
i have rar zip files that i made a year ago and i don t remember the password

264015
google-chrome	firefox
there s a similar plugin that will use firefox to render the page inside google-chrome so you can use google-chrome for all your url triage needs

264015
google-chrome	firefox
note this solution just changes the rendering engine so you can view and interact with sites that are normally not compatible with google-chrome but you can t access things like ie s developer tools when in a google-chrome tab or firefox s firebug when in a firefox tab

264018
ethernet	wireless	tunnel	vpn
i ve analyzed it systematically only for wired ethernet connections but i have seen the same problem happening for a vpn tunnel forticlient and wireless connections

264090
x86	64bit
need a x86 32-bit or x64 64bit

264090
16-bit	64bit
if i understand it correctly skyroads is a 16-bit program which is not supported in a 64bit operating system

264094
vmware	virtualbox
your best bet would be to try running it on a 32 bit os in virtualbox or vmware

264138
google-chrome	firefox
are there any google-chrome firefox plugins that can do the same using a single browser

264184
move	drag
alternatively use the move tool with the ctrl command key pressed down and drag the layer across

264193
maya	3dsmax
pretty much all of the big 3d rendering programs maya 3dsmax etc. support this through metal ray however typically the require licensing which can get quite expensive

264208
vim	textmate
switching from textmate to vim i d like to have vim launched and opening a specific folder at startup on macos

264292
backtracking	greedy
the backtracking found a new â œstoppingâ point but now the second in the first group is doing its greedy matching

264296
button	checkbox
i only have synergy 1.3.4 but when i start the synergy server screen i can hit the options button and check the check clients every ____ ms checkbox and if it can t get a response then it will disconnect that client and return control to me

264363
ubuntu	linux
i use putty on windows 7 to access a linux machine with ubuntu 10.10

264383
folder	directory
i want to maintain the user and group permissions recursively for all new folder and files placed in the parent directory

vmware	esx
i ve inherited a vmware esx server 3i 3.5.0 but haven t found any documentation especially not the root password nor have i gotten hold of the former admin

264402
hash	md5
have you done an md5 hash on the iso to make sure it isn t corrupted

264406
octal	binary
rw- permissions â 110 binary â 6 octal

264424
photoshop	paint.net
i have access to photoshop if there is a filter out there that would do it or gimp imagemagick paint.net etc if there are some basic steps i could follow

264436
hfs+	ntfs
however there are drivers available for windows and mac os x which are capable of reading ntfs or hfs+

264436
hfs+	ntfs
ntfs for mac and hfs+ for windows

264438
google-chrome	firefox
cutting that out of the loop and downloading the file using firefox google-chrome alone gives me a file that i can boot from and that matches the hashes published by red hat

264453
dropbox	evernote
it stores any personal data on my work machine firefox profile evernote database dropbox etc

264488
vmware	virtualbox
more or less everything you re thinking about virtualbox vmware virtualpc etc will have slower disc performance than the host system because it s a filesystem in a file on a filesystem

264495
udp	tcp
you can t proxy udp simply because unlike tcp udp is a connectionless protocol

264499
mouse	keyboard
the only hardware plugged into my new computer on bootup are the essentials power cord monitor mouse and keyboard

264525
pull	push
git can push and pull over ssh without any special configuration

264530
ati	nvidia
there is a setting in nvidia and ati settings for overscanning over cropping or something similar to that

264553
google-chrome	firefox
with increasing competition from other web browsers such as firefox and google-chrome microsoft has released a number of versions of internet explorer in recent times the most recent of which scores 95 100 on the acid3 web standards test

264561
versioning	upgrade
upgrade kde to the latest stable versioning

264566
mouse	keyboard
still trying to use a single keyboard and mouse but w 3 desktops and a single monitor

264569
freebsd	linux
the drives in question are used as backup drives for a couple of linux and freebsd servers

264569
freebsd	linux
i am using the ext3 filesystem to make sure i can quickly recover the data since both freebsd and linux can read from that without problems

264569
freebsd	linux
if someone has a different solution for that 2 drives in raid 1 that are readable by freebsd and writeable by linux i m open for suggestions

264588
vmware	esx
according to vmware s changing a forgotten root password on an esx host page

264594
freebsd	linux
it is native in the freebsd kernel note you need to make some kernel mods to make it work without kernel panics - basically increase the kernel memory and there is a fuse module for linux

264596
mouse	keyboard
synergy is a way of sharing the keyboard and mouse amongst multiple computers each with their own monitor

264632
mouse	keyboard
my current setup has two 24 screens and i d love to have a third plus keyboard mouse etc

264635
mouse	keyboard
what happens when you plug in a keyboard or mouse

264647
ati	nvidia
it might be that it s in some power-saving mode like ati s powerplay or nvidia s powermizer -- try seeing if that s the case first

264714
jobs	cron
the syntax for cron jobs is fairly simple and there s a slick tool that will help you create them without remembering the code positions

264757
google-chrome	firefox
it shows up in firefox 4 and google-chrome 10 but not in internet explorer 9

264760
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard mousepad and usb mouse in xwin are locked using parameters in xorg.conf

264795
tiff	png	tiff	bmp	gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
if it s a deep image type such as bmp or tiff convert it to jpeg or png or gif instead

264803
post	get
if you need infos about the video codec etc.. just tell me how to get them and i will post them

264823
width	height
because both can have different width to height ratio

264834
spyware	antivirus
i have an antivirus nod32 have checked for spyware unloaded everything suspicious from the start-up configs and installed a load balancing tool called proctamer

264861
ssd	sata
any standard sata ssd in the same form factor i believe that laptop uses a 2.5 hard drive should work fine

264867
nas	qnap
a qnap ts-559 pro+ nas enclosure has 2 e-sata ports on it along with 4 usb and 2 ethernet ports

264899
ubuntu	centos
install openssh-server on ubuntu forward the ssh port tcp 22 instead of vnc and connect from centos with

264900
cpu	hyperthreading
i have an intel core i7 cpu with every hardware stuff enabled except hyperthreading

264923
des	aes	3des	aes
aes des desx 3des 3des_112 and

264933
vmware	virtualbox
so if you have 64bit windows look for a 64bit edition of virtualbox vmware etc

264933
disk	ram
there are other changes in the move to x64 also but for the most part those won t help your vms as much as the ram saved from a smaller pointer word size will because vms have more i o issues and need the ram more to help save going to disk as often

264933
processors	hyperthreading
most people with quad core processors don t even use all the cores a lot of the time and additional core provided by hyperthreading just aren t that powerful because of conflict issues in the pipeline where the two instructions happening in the same physical might be related in some way

264987
vim	emacs
it allows you to program your own shortcuts or open your favorite text editor to work with web forms emacs or vim anyone

264987
vim	emacs
using a browser or addon that is modeled after emacs or vim conkeror vimperator etc. is another extremely powerful option

265021
folder	directory
corrupt synchronization files navigate to target directory open the _notes folder and

265031
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i started with ubuntu then switched to fedora and now i m fond of linux mint

265080
switching	screens
1. control panel users change the way users log on or off see if use welcome screens and use fast user switching is ticked if not ticked tick them

265090
vmware	bootcamp
is there some way that i can run the wubi install of ubuntu through vmware fusion so that i don t have to boot into bootcamp

265097
put	get
so i do some reading online and apparently 0x0000007b errors have to do with the boot disc in this case it is kingston ssdnow v series gen ii 128gb 2.5in sata2 solid state disk flash drive -- one of the suggestions is that sometimes depending on which sata port you put your cd dvd drive into the system can get confused and think the cd dvd drive is the boot disc

265106
folder	directory
fonts can be installed outside of that directory by checking an option in control panel - font settings but even then you install the fonts by placing a shortcut in the fonts folder

265170
installation	upgrade
i used the upgrade option at installation and overwrote my 10.4 os

265188
pop-up	dialog
only when a security dialog pop-up

265200
ssd	sata
it might be an option to use one of these to connect an sata ssd to the system

265211
put	get
that will start the server on desktop 7 port 5907 so any other vnc servers you might otherwise start won t get in the way and you ll have a predictable desktop number to put in the html file

265214
folder	directory
there should be a folder called boot in the tftpboot directory which contains an installation of windows pe

265214
windows	winpe
this means your version of winpe is mismatched with your windows iso

265214
windows	winpe
here s a rough table of ver to winpe version to windows iso

265225
bash	zsh
note that other shells like zsh wouldn t include them and iirc also bash after setting some options

265247
ssd	sata
i ve tried downloading the 250mb sata driver package from the asus site assuming it must be an issue with the ssd on to a usb drive but to no avail

265262
folder	directory
not folder based or at least not only - i want to point it to a directory and have it show me thumbnails of each image it can find within this directory obviously descending and recursing into any subdirectories

265262
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu linux x86 32-bit

265262
kde	gnome
that means gnome and gtk please no java too slow for my old pc or kde

265322
disk	ram
i see ways to limit ram and hard disk size and number of cores but i need to slow the cpu down to 800 mhz in order to really simulate the system configuration

265335
ubuntu	linux
if you use a home router solution you ll need to forward incoming tcp 22 to the ubuntu machine running ssh in order for the incoming connection to be properly forwarded to your linux box

265339
vmware	esx
on vmware esx and esxi you can create a resource pool and limit the cpu resources for that pool

265354
win64	windows
i have installed oracle client 11g r2 win64 on windows 7 x64

265365
move	drag
i find it odd that by default everytime i try and drag and drop a file or folder i get asked if i want to move them to that location or copy them

265399
bluetooth	usb
this cellphone has bluetooth and i own usb bluetooth dongle

265403
ubuntu	linux
for ubuntu 10.04 or other linux distros you need to install blueman

265466
mouse	keyboard
i would love to have a multi user system based on linux using only one x11 session with multiple screens and pairs of mouse and keyboard

265475
versioning	upgrade
this has led to slow adoption of the new versioning as many people are dependent on the extensive libraries available in python and many libraries have not been upgrade to support python 3

265515
textmate	textwrangler
since you can t issue any commands from terminal.app i think you can either use onyx there s an option in onyx to show hidden files in the parameters tab or download a text editor that sees hidden files eclipse-based ides usually see and can open hidden files or something like textwrangler or textmate can do that same

265521
bash	zsh
you could try to temporarily use another shell than bash like zsh

265571
daemons	systemd
how can i build a modular high-spec computer which will have similar power consumption when idle - when the systemd is normally running but the user nor any daemons on the systemd itself is doing anything just waiting for user input

265589
tunnel	vpn
i m using a mac laptop and when i am connected to the cisco vpn all traffic is routed through the tunnel

265601
redhat	fedora
i have shell access and the server is centos redhat fedora

265622
ubuntu	linux
i got my hands on ubuntu ultimate so i tried linux for last one month or so

265624
winpcap	wireshark
if you install wireshark it will ask if you want install the winpcap drivers when you fire up wireshark you will have the ability to turn on promiscuous mode in wireshark

265634

google-chrome	firefox
i m using mozilla firefox 4 and i would like to be able to receive notifications similar to google-chrome s built-in notification system like so

268667

lan	localhost
the lan ip of my computer is 192.168.1.100 and i have apache running on localhost 127.0.0.1 at port 80

xfs is perfectly usable on 32-bit linux systems although a few additional limits are placed on the sizes of files and the filesystems itself

268800
mouse	keyboard
however is there any keyboard or mouse shortcut to place one window on top half the screen and another window on bottom half the screen

268803
ubuntu	centos
i ll give centos instructions but you could just as well use ubuntu server

268807
vmware	virtualbox
my personal experience is to use virtualbox or vmware server to host the vm and either of them will work fine

268825
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs new technology filesystems is a filesystems developed by microsoft and used by windows computers windows 2000 and later

268831
pull	push
you may want to consider letting b pull tarballs from a rather than have a push them onto b

268848
wan	lan
let the firewall drop all lan to wan packets except from 3 ip-addresses

268849
xmonad	xmobar
that runs xmobar as it should be run even when you reload xmonad

268853
folder	directory
personally if i have applications that need to write to their own app directory i would grant modify permissions to the users group on that specific folder

268878
tunnel	vpn
i m using a vpn that tunnel all my internet traffic to one i

268878
tunnel	vpn
this happens especially if a program is already open before the vpn tunnel is established

268892
folder	directory
in this case assuming nothing strange is done any files you copy into new alice s documents will be treated like any other file or folder in that directory and the same is true for bob

google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
another reason to use google-chrome firefox or opera browser

268907
mouse	keyboard
computer monitor and computer had power but no signal on monitor lights on keyboard and mouse were off

268922
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox use history and cache to store favicons..

268929
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox use google s safebrowsing database and internet explorer 8+ uses microsoft s safescreen

268929

269124
minimum	max
here the minimum value is 15 max is 47

269127
folder	directory
something like if i m in projects someproject somesubfolder the console command should say home va1en0k someproject if there is a .git folder in this directory or something like this

269140
gentoo	ubuntu
the ubuntu guide is more focused on the installation of ubuntu itself while the gentoo guide contains lots of information on how to do things by hand

269154
switching	screens	mouse	keyboard
a normal kvm switching allows you to use one screens keyboard and mouse setup for multiple computers now a network-kvm would allow you to control those computers as if you were on location.

269156
ubuntu	linux
if you were using linux you could try pxe pxe on ubuntu

269159
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox and virtual pc are good too and are free but both are a far cry from vmware

269162
bluetooth	usb
my samsung has built in bluetooth broadcom bcm2070 bluetooth 3.0 usb device - driver version 6.5.0.131

269226
ati	nvidia
i m not real keen on ati drivers and software so might avoid them in future try nvidia perhaps and have had some crashing problems on our adobe air app but that could be completely unrelated to the hardware or drivers

269252
xfce	kubuntu
however xubuntu uses the xfce 4 terminal emulator kubuntu uses konsole and ubuntu gnome-terminal

269258
filtering	grouping
however whenever i try to apply a between date filtering to the grouping date field either the year or month grouping my table blanks the rows of the filtered-out dates but continues to display the row labels

269311
ati	nvidia
if you get ib m vga compatible bios. you can continue through the memory with d enter no quotes where it may show a string like nvidia xxxxx or ati xxxxx

269317
mouse	keyboard
in the latter case i would try to exchange the keyboard and the mouse plug

269323
folder	directory
no you can only add folder directory to libraries

269346
chown	chgrp
using 777 on an server with an ftp is not safe so unless it s a very isolated network i d suggest using 700 and changing the user chown or 770 and changing the group chgrp to manage the permisions if you are developing with some other users

269422
versioning	upgrade
if you don t want to upgrade try to re-install the old versioning

269582
ubuntu	linux
or a more difficult question - how do i install php 5.2.4 on ubuntu linux 10.10

269612
ssl	https
not making advertisement but in my campus swissvpn service which runs openvpn works fine because that guys configured the openvpn server to accept connections on port 443 often used for https and since the openvpn socket is ssl layered to the stupid firewall in my campus it s like i m doing https with some server

269612
ssl	https
https is not distinguishable from anything else running on a ssl enforced socket

269612
ssl	https
some poor firewalls assume ssl on 443 https

269620
filesystems	ntfs
my hang up right now is how do i get the local hard drives using ntfs filesystems to mount and then how do i access the files on them

269638
folder	directory
this script was located in the cron folder and the directory structure looked like so

269649
switching	screens
this is assuming the monitors form a more-or-less complete rectangle with no gaps all the screens are in a line. if the pc with three screens doesn t have them in a line two side by side and one above then it becomes much more complex and may not be possible to switching screens from every monitor edge you would like to

269664
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
while surfing with any browser internet explorer 8 firefox v3.6 firefox v4 google-chrome 11 safari some pages get timeout randomly

269678
ubuntu	linux
my goal is to eliminate all my existing windows partitions i currently dual-boot between ubuntu 10.04 and windows vista to free up space for linux

269697
scatter	graphing
this is relatively straight-forward for a pure scatter plot but when combined with a column graphing gets very tricky

269729
mouse	keyboard
further the user is unable to accept the dialog s because windows has not installed the drivers for the keyboard or mouse or other input devices

269729
mouse	keyboard
and configure it to perform whatever keyboard or mouse actions you need this way you can â œdoâ things in windows without actually having any input devices available

269735
bluetooth	usb
if you want to go the bluetooth route you can your laptop s internal bluetooth card if it has one or any usb bluetooth dongle that ubuntu supports

269756
rss	feed
every time i see an html5 audio file say in a rss feed chrome will start to download it automatically

269757
hex	binary
use a free hex editor to search the binary for the string watch without the quotes and change it while keeping the same total number of characters for example to vatch

269774
daemons	launchd
if you can look something up with dig but not with dns-sd then you could try killing the mdnsresponder daemons and letting launchd automatically relaunch it i ve found that hupping mdnsresponder isn t always enough

269780
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
opera google-chrome and safari will

269780
rss	feed
once this change takes place depends on what version of chrome you re using you should see the audio files not preloading unless the rss feed webpage etc explicitly states that it should preload

269783
gentoo	linux
i have small dedicated server celeron 1.2ghz 2gb ram 250gb hdd running currently on gentoo linux + mysql

269811
postgresql	mysql
my dinky little atom server dosen t suffer from running postgresql and mysql at the same time.

269815
opera	firefox
opera saves them in mhtml just like firefox does with an add-on

269839
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
if you have been running virtualbox ose versioning 3 and you are trying to upgrade to virtualbox 4 you will probably have to uninstall versioning 3 before installing versioning 4

269839
versioning	upgrade
certainly in ubuntu the two versioning use different package names so a simple upgrade isn t possible

269868
versioning	upgrade
some of the guides are a bit old so you may have to install older versioning of ubuntu and later upgrade or try your luck by experimenting with newer versioning

269893
folder	directory
all support transferring a whole folder including directory structure

269922
skype	voicemail
i don t use skype s voicemail

270052
rss	feed
but all i am looking for is a place that lists the most common specified parameters that are standard in most rss feed

270058
ubuntu	linux
especially on linux gnome 2 has notification-daemon ubuntu has notifyosd gnome 3 has it as part of gnome shell

270069
rss	feed
how a site generates rss feed and what parameters they use is purely down to the whim of the person company that wrote the rss feed software in use of that site

note that so far i ve noticed that udp packets from my protocol and icmp ping request packets are missing

270139
x86	64bit
you need a x86 32-bit or x64 64bit version of the program and then

270184
ubuntu	linux
im not sure exactly how it works but this enables wifi under ubuntu and should work on many linux distribs as well

270237
folder	directory
you use it by sending all the folder paths to the script and specifying the repository directory it must not exist

270247
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
choose properties click the compatibility tab and tick the compatibility mode checkbox select windows 95 from the dropdownlistfor

270252

to upgrade across minor versioning start by finding the file config.nice in the build directory of your installed server or at the root of the source tree for your old install

270253
rss	feed
i am using outlook 2010 to subscribe to some rss feed which require authentication using my active directory account

270290
x86	64bit
check your computer s system information to see whether you need an x86 32-bit or x64 64bit version of the program and then contact the software publisher.

270298
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to set up synergy between windows xp server and ubuntu linux

270298
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard and mouse are very slow and hard to control

270340
versioning	upgrade
in many ways a mft is an upgrade versioning of a file allocation table fat

270373
ethernet	wireless
since with wireless i will have to authenticate but with powerline i connect as if i connect directly into the router with ethernet

270377
gentoo	ubuntu
for example install apt-get on gentoo and connect ubuntu s repositories

270403

270440
opera	google-chrome
since two days ago i cannot open one website in any browser mozilla ie google-chrome opera on my private computer

i ve fumbled plenty in the lmi site and configurations renaming the machines profiles etc. but continually get the same problem - two machines fighting for the same lmi slot knocking each other ready but offline

270483
google-chrome	firefox
using some extensions out there with this purpose to save tabs i ve even used good old febe back when google-chrome sucked and i was on firefox but those were never as reliable as google-chrome have been with its native feature

270511
folder	directory
i want to compile and build ffmpeg in my home folder since i don t have sudo privilege but how to specify search directory for external libraries while running configure

270579
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
are all of the programs that can be run on ubuntu able to run on linux mint

270579
ubuntu	mint
i m thinking of switching ubuntu to mint but there are a lot of programs command line mostly that i d like to be able to use on mint

270579
ubuntu	mint
i believe mint is based on ubuntu

270585
width	height
also the frame should be 720 in width and 576 in height same as the .vob files

270593
ubuntu	mint
in general using ubuntu repositories is not a good idea unless you re certain that the version of mint and ubuntu are the same - you might be able to get away with limited ppas

270627
vmware	virtualbox
you can use microsofts disk2vhd utility to convert existing windows installs into a vhd file which can then be imported into your hypervisor like virtualpc virtualbox vmware etc

270636
hide	show
win+y hide gadgets win+n show gadgets

270655
filesystems	ntfs
to circumvent this file corruption i am looking for the safest way to copy files from one ntfs filesystems to another preserving all file properties including a crc32 check - if possible without involving the shell

i m trying out firefox 4 after living with google-chrome for a while

270694
rss	feed
by installing rss icon in awesomebar thanks to in firefox 4 how do i get the rss feed button back

270700
cpu	processors
more cpu cores available does not mean more power is available to any one task see my answer at how do i calculate clock speed in multi-core processors

270702
udp	tcp
netbios name service is tcp udp 137 and netbios datagram is udp 138 but you do not need any of these to connect to shares

270749
vmware	virtualbox
there are several virtualisation products out there the most known being vmware commercial and virtualbox open-source

270781
versioning	upgrade
there are two versioning of ubuntu 10 perhaps you are using the older one 10.4 and need to upgrade to the new one 10.10

270823
switching	screens
i would like to keep it on one of my secondary monitors in full screens so i can keep and eye on it easily without needing to switching to it

270884
switching	screens
by using the .net based utility i can switching on off the screens

270900
pull	push
you can connect them but unless either the scanner or the printer is smart enough to push pull documents to from the other device there s no way of getting anything across the connection

270926
ethernet	wireless
the guests will not be visible from the outside by default though they will continue to work as the host operating system may change ip configurations going from a wired ethernet connection to 802.11 wireless for example

270949
rar	zip
in this situation something like zip or rar would be much more sensible

270965
firefox	safari
so i have a simple bash script that deletes firefox s file cache flash s shared objects flex s assetcache and safari s cache.db file

270969
sudo	passwd
you need a method to supply the passwd to sudo

270969
sudo	passwd
setting up sudo to not require a passwd to run rsync as your userid is one option

271016
google-chrome	firefox
i d like to find a browser extension or bookmarklet google-chrome and or firefox that allows me to zap all images on a page with a single keystroke ctrl+number for example

271020
cpu	processors
are these the number of the processors used for boot time or the cpu cores

271064
min	max
setting the min and max in etc conf.d cpufreq seems to be making it stick at the right values

271082
opensuse	debian	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian
it s packaged for debian ubuntu fedora opensuse mandriva and is tested on ubuntu 10.10 maverick meerkat

271086
notepad++	scite
the closest linux text editor i could find that was somewhat similar to notepad++ was scite

271118
mouse	trackpad
whenever i click the right button on my usb mouse or trackpad of my laptop windows explorer will crash and restart

271147
width	height
but i almost always use them scaled down in width and height

271173
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade to 64-bit os windows 7 from my old 32-bit versioning

271214
versioning	upgrade
all you can really do is upgrade your versioning of the .net framework check windows update .

271239
filesystems	xfs
i chose xfs as the filesystems for this main server because of his great handling of large files

271245
filesystems	xfs
do journaling filesystems like ext3 ext4 xfs present special concerns for a usb drive

271269
switching	screens
i have an xp box connected to a kvm switching every time the computer boots the screens resolution gets reset to the switches maximum resolution which is different than the screens native resolution

271270
daemons	systemd	daemons	launchd
i am struggling to understand where packagekit is launchd from at boot time fedora fc13 and i m starting to suspect that - since my previous experiences with much older linux distros - in modern systemd daemons services programs are launchd at boot time from many other different points

271290
spyware	antivirus
i would reccomend an antivirus coupled with windows firewall and a spyware removed such as super anti spyware

271309
peer	p2p
also you may need to limit the number of peer connections the p2p software allows as too many can swamp a router s nat table if you are using nat and then everything grinds to a halt

271344
folder	directory
usually you would have a folder named public_html or httpdocs depending on where you are on the server directory structure

271345
windows	wow64
bear in mind that on 64-bit windows 32-bit applications are being executed through an emulation layer known as wow64 which does impose some additional limitations not present when running under a 32-bit windows os

271345
windows	wow64
therefore execution speed under wow64 on x64 is similar to its speed under 32-bit windows

271369
google-chrome	firefox
i m switching from firefox and google-chrome on a daily basis

271381
google-chrome	firefox
use a plugin like lastpass that works with multiple browsers including firefox and google-chrome

271382
firefox	safari
i know xmarks is available under firefox chrone safari and ie

271385
onenote	ms-office
you can try printing the whole document into pdf files or ms-office onenote - this will flatten the images and you can re-use it again

271393
mouse	keyboard
this is because when that uac dialog appears windows prevents most programs from controlling the mouse and keyboard to prevent a malicious application from clicking the yes button on your behalf

271419
mouse	keyboard
however if i happen to be in the middle of a transition from one windows 7 machine to the other it s never happened to the mac but i don t flip to it that often when visual studio hits a breakpoint the mouse and keyboard both completely lock up and the only way i can seem to do anything is to physically unplug the mouse and keyboard and plug them back in

271419
versioning	upgrade
i did note that it was much more frequent with the previous versioning i had of synergy+ before i upgrade sidegraded to the current versioning of synergy

271422
tunnel	vpn
if this is an accurate description of the scenario then your hypothesis is correct - the vpn tunnel is blocking you from accessing your home computer

271422
vpn	lan
you probably won t even be able to use your home computer to access shared drives and printers on your home lan or allow other computers on your home lan to access the vpn d computer

271422
tunnel	vpn
also it is likely that firewall proxy restrictions will not permit computers from your company s network to connect to your home computer even if they know the ip address assigned to the vpn tunnel

271459
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
i wouldn t be surprised if fink macports or homebrew or all 3 had make binaries you could use

271479
mouse	keyboard
15 keyboard shortcuts allow you to do a single keystroke where normally takes a few mouse clicks - if you turn off your computer connect to the internet run applications etc

271496
folder	dir
i would love to make that my home folder for the terminal so it would just open there - i know if i ctrl+shift+t to open a new tab it defaults to the same dir but it would be nice to have the first opened terminal default to there

271500
ubuntu	linux
i have linux ubuntu 10.10 and mac 10.5.8

271548
gentoo	linux
i ve installed gnome 3 on my gentoo linux it really awesome and i love it

271550
vmware	virtualbox
like previous comment virtualbox or vmware which is free or virtualpc from ms is the best option

271553
google-chrome	firefox
as there is no option from google for that are there any extensions for google-chrome or add-ons for firefox that can block sub-domain results from google search

271560
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i would start with standard ubuntu then try some of the derivatives like linux mint

271560
debian	linux
after a few months of experience try something like fedora debian so you can learn more about how the linux ecosystem works

271586
portrait	landscape
these are known as signatures and are typically 32 pages a result of 8 sheets of landscape paper double sided and folded in half to give portrait pages

271596
affinity	processors
process -a name_of_exe 1 sets the affinity mask to processors 0

271596
affinity	processors
process -a name_of_exe 11 sets the affinity mask to processors 0 and 1

271606
ubuntu	linux
googling for that doesn t turn up anything currently useful for ubuntu or linux in general

271606
ubuntu	linux
note that i m not aware of any user-friendly guis for configuring apparmor on ubuntu - its strictly a text editor and command line operation so if you re new to linux you may want to avoid this

271608
google-chrome	firefox
one of the right mouse click options in windows explorer is save target as how do i do the same thing in google-chrome or firefox

271614
pop-up	dialog
i am not getting any found new hardware pop-up dialog at all

271639
put	get
if you put a disc into a dvd cd-player in a computer that is affected with a virus the disc won t get it

271649
installation	upgrade

272136
opensuse	linux
i m running opensuse and some other flavours of linux does this still apply to me

272140
afp	smb
fortunately the linux package netatalk provides afp services much as samba provides smb services

272154
kde	kubuntu	mouse	keyboard
i have a boxee remote that basically registers itself as a usb keyboard via the dongle and for some strange reason kde 4.x whichever one is included in kubuntu 10.10 allows my regular ps 2 keyboard to work on 0.0 and 0.1 however i am trying to dedicate xbmc to full screen on 0.1 and would like the remote to operate it independently of what i m doing with my keyboard mouse in screen 0.0

272177
mouse	keyboard
do not have a definitive answer to the cause of this but in my experience it usually appears to be a lock on one of the keys hindering mouse or keyboard operations

272252
folder	dir
already tried explorer dir and explorer path both of which opens my documents for some reason just explorer opens the libraries folder open which is undefined explorer dirname which gives me that dirname is undefined and probably other stuff that i can t remember

272257
ubuntu	linux
after booting puppy linux using live cd by mistake i also deleted the boot grub folder on the ubuntu partition

272269
perl	tcl
to actually validate all have the structure i think you are going to have to write a script looking at this list - and i think you would have to do this in a more powerful scripting language than shell perl python ruby tcl

272284
cifs	smb
yes you can easily share any path you want using samba and mount it in windows samba implements the windows-native smb cifs protocol so you can mount it on windows just like you d mount any other drive from a remote windows pc

i guess your windows 7 is in ntfs filesystems as usual

vmware	virtualbox
i know that it is possible with virtualbox vmware workstation and qemu but all the guides and tutorials i ve seen seem to be pretty outdated like 3 years old

272315
vmware	virtualbox
i used to be a big fan of vmware but virtualbox has just got the edge because it is so much more open than vmware

272315
vmware	virtualbox
qemu i don t even place in the same class as virtualbox and vmware

272320

that should tell you where your traffic is going whether it s tunnel through the vpn or exiting your local gateway to the internet through your isp

272498
tunnel	lan	tunnel	vpn	vpn	lan
normally if the vpn is configured properly only lan traffic bound for the vpn will route through the vpn tunnel and all else will route out your local internet gateway why your stuff is staying up after connecting with anyconnect

i need to be able to do this with both opensuse 11.3 linux 64 bit using kde and with windows xp sp3 as i dual boot

versioning	upgrade
and i don t think the speed limit is on the router it s still a quite recent model get s constant firmware upgrade even beta lab versioning

272567
sudo	passwd	daemons	launchd
a few more less critical changes i d make first lose the sudo -- it s not needed launchd runs daemons as root unless told to do otherwise and if it were needed it wouldn t work it needs to prompt for a passwd and there s nobody available in daemons context

272571
ubuntu	linux
i m brand new to ubuntu and linux and downloaded apache 2.2 worker through synaptic

my ubuntu allows the use of l as a command to print out the current directory much like ls except that it is actually better in that it specifies which are folder files and executables

272645
ethernet	wireless
the location of the second router is too far to run an ethernet cable between the routers so i was wondering the best way to connect the two routers wireless to share the same internet connection

272645
ethernet	wireless
i have been told that the linksys e1000 wireless router does not support this mode without the ethernet cable so i would have to use it as the main router

272833
rss	feed
depending on the rss reader you choose being able to filter the feed by source should enable to you see something like threading

272867
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is firefox still uses the windows frame around it whereas google-chrome doesn t and i m guessing that makes the menu bar only allowed at the very top

272892
antivirus	norton
norton and trend micro offer antivirus programs that run on the nas or will at least scan the files being requested by the nas

272902
toolbar	tabs
i could not perform your requirements for toolbar positions but you can do that with ff4 place bookmarks toolbar between firefox orange ribbon and the tabs

272929

blender 3d has a script to display keyboard and mouse

272950
ubuntu	debian
you can find the command apt-add-repository in debian as well as ubuntu

272953

both should be available in standard debian ubuntu repos

pinging the router from the computer and pinging google from the router both work as expected with minimal packet loss and low round-trip time min avg max 1.601 3.465 9.926 and 20 20 70 respectively

272956
rar	zip
best is probably an archive zip rar sit - are

have you looked at logmein hamachi

272977
tunnel	vpn
it s a pretty simple but very secure and free private vpn tunnel service

vpn	lan
4 if you want to test accessing additional systems inside your simulated lan for testing the vpn in a road warrior or other telecommuting environment where you need to access multiple services inside the remote network

272999
vim	textmate
i know vim and textmate support it but do other sites support yaml syntax highlighting as well

273000
sudo	passwd
just going by the simple instructions you open a terminal and execute sudo apt-get install chntpw and run the command chntpw -u username sam and it should ask you for what passwd you want

273008
mouse	keyboard
my boss give me a job to record some hundreds script manually it would break my fingers...is there any free tool for recording and playback windows mouse and keyboard action

273008
trojan	virus
the tool need to be safe i don t want any virus trojan mali hidden in the software

273032
google-chrome	firefox
firefox or google-chrome don t trigger the crash

273046
wan	lan
one completely optional suggestion i have for you to make things work even more smoothly though is to configure only your main router to serve dhcp and set up your wireless routers to not do this if your wireless routers don t support passing ip traffic through from the wan port without nat then you should at least be able to disable the dhcp server options and just not use the wan ports at all -- instead of connecting the main router to the wan ports just plug it into the regular lan ports of the wireless routers that have dhcp disabled

273048
mouse	keyboard
if you re using a wireless mouse keyboard make sure their batteries aren t running low low batteries in these devices can cause this type of unreliability

273056
wan	lan
to get them to act this way the simplest option is normally just to turn off dhcp on the child routers and run a cat5 network cable from a normal lan port on the parent to a normal lan port on each child rather than to the wan port

273145
nas	qnap
i m trying to set up an openvpn server on my qnap nas

i can connect to the qnap nas openvpn server from an outside client but can t reach some other computer through that connection

273159
ubuntu	linux
i d suggest using a linux live cd to avoid booting into the hard drive - you can use your bog standard ubuntu cd and install it in there with apt and follow the step by step guide at the test disk website

273210
ati	nvidia
the only other issue i see is that you are running an nvidia and ati video chipset

273210
ati	nvidia
the reason being i know that the drivers from nvidia s site will remove some of the necessary drivers for ati

273240
cpu	processors
the motherboards are of different architecture for each processors it supports so when you need to replace the motherboard for a particular processors then go for same architecture as your existing motherboard which will ideally suit the cpu architecture

273249
temp	tmp
so i was thinking that i could reserve a couple of gb from my 12gb ram and use that as a tmp and temp drive

273249
temp	tmp
also regarding tmp and temp is it ok that they are wiped everytime the computer reboots

273249

xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
it would be nice to know the terms used by all platforms windows mac os gnome kde xfce etc

273349
google-chrome	firefox
gnome knows the file extensions so i would have expected that firefox could just use the already-known file mappings there to open the right stuff as i presume google-chrome does

273372
google-chrome	firefox
i m primarily a firefox google-chrome user and i want to get ie8 to exhibit the same behavior of firefox wherein i can specify that if i download files of type x they get auto-saved to the preference-specified download directory without being prompted to save or open and or specify the save location

273400
google-chrome	firefox
i m back and forth between firefox and ie and will likely eventually be using google-chrome as well so a consistent ux is important

i want to host a subversion repository on my macbook in some folder within my home directory

mouse	keyboard
i used to happily use the wheel mouse to zoom but after upgrading to the mac magic mouse using only finger slide movement to scroll and pan i can no longer hold ctrl and roll the mouse to zoom driving me crazy and i can t see a useful keyboard shortcut and the zoom slider bar in the lower right of the word screen isn t practical in my experience

i checked that in firefox though new interface for under the hood options in google-chrome still puzzles me

273643
mp3	ogg
my music collection is mainly encoded in ogg apart from a few bought albums in mp3

273685

273719
jobs	cron
though many of us has asked many question related to cron jobs let me ask my one.

273723
vmware	virtualbox
vmware workstation is not as snappy uses more memory etc - but also does a better job of juggling multiple simultaneous vms and seems to handle the server oses overall better than virtualbox

273750
mouse	keyboard
in short when he shares his desktop and i take control i am able to move the mouse and use the keyboard just fine when ie has focus or notepad or windows explorer

273750
mouse	keyboard
moving my mouse or using the keyboard no longer registers on his desktop

273750
switching	screens
note after switching to vs smss i can still see the client moving his mouse or switching windows so it s not like the entire session freezes - rather just my control of the remote computer seems to be terminated and not returned until my customer moves to another window and tells the screens sharing program to give me control again

273777
firefox	safari
i tried mac safari firefox win32 and ubuntu windows explorer windows xp notepad2 windows xp but nothing seem to open it.

273784
textmate	notepad++	textmate	bbedit	notepad++	bbedit
i d try to open it in a text-editor like e-texteditor or notepad++ on windows or bbedit or textmate on a mac

273791
opera	firefox
from there you should be able to load it with opera or firefox relatively quickly and probably faster than as a local os-based file using something like as the uri

273797
mp3	ogg
alternatively is there an extension for nginx so i can point it to a directory with mp3 files and have it serve ogg files on the fly

273800

imagemagick	graphicsmagick
if imagemagick did not work the way you needed try out graphicsmagick homepage here

273879
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
yes it is a fork of imagemagick but i have at one occasion banged my head against imagemagick because of a feature being incompletely and or incorrectly implemented only to find that the same feature worked like a charm and in a way i found logical and consistent in graphicsmagick

273892
google-chrome	safari
this script rejects safari on windows and google-chrome has the string safari in its user-agent

my question is does truecrypt automatically umount an encrypted volume after it s been idle for a certain amount of time

other ssh software may have their own storage formats such as rfc 4716 or putty s ppk but they store the same rsa dsa ecdsa information

274067

for private keys belonging to the certificates pem format is usually used â base64 surrounded by headers begin private key key in a pkcs#7 structure or begin rsa or dsa private key bare key openssl format

274067
pkcs#12	pfx
pkcs#12 and the slightly older pfx are encrypted containers storing both the certificate and the private key often the issuer s certificate too

when i press switching on button fans are working but it shows black screens

you should first go to that rss url on internet explorer and subscribe to that feed

274197
rar	zip
essentially i d like to avoid extracting unnecessary files from zip rar or 7z archives in windows 7 - files like windows 2000 xp s thumbs.db file thumbnail cache and mac os x .ds_store file desktop services store while not being too strict and also not extracting files which just contain thumbs.db or .ds_store in its filename

274197
rar	zip
also is there a better entry in the prohibited files list that will work to exclude only thumbs.db and .ds_store files for all directory levels in a zip rar 7z file

rss	feed
it s ok or good if the gadget is animated when the rss feed is updated but as long as the rss feed isn t updated it should just stay calm and not distract my work

274230

that are t distracting or any other minimalistic rss feed reader that can notify me for updates

274232
folder	directory
war files java web application archives are based on zip but have a defined folder structure and requirements to some of the files in there some stuff needs to be in a web-inf directory

disk	ram
recent versions will always try to fill up ram with cached data that it thinks is going to be needed quickly and will deliberately swap other stuff to disk

274340

so ssds are not a replacement for ram saying get more ram is missing the point but a possibly faster alternative to virtual memory on hard disk

if you have access to another computer download the free version of avg antivirus and use it to scan for rootkit

274428
post	get
two things that are particularly strange about this situation is that there are no indicators of any post error - i don t even get a single beep and that the system spontaneously quit working after years of perfect operation i ve had plenty of hard drive and psu failures but i ve never had a system just stop working for no apparent reason

274428
post	get
edit tried taking out everything but the motherboard cpu and psu and i get the usual post error beep

if you get the post beeps after the first attempt then slowly replace individual components starting with the memory then the video etc until it fails

it s not about bloat as someone else posted slackware uses kde which is just as bloated but about the way that gnome packages itself

274703
post	get
see if you get a bios post

274703

274952
sudo	passwd	stdout	stderr
why sudo 1 asks for passwd when stdout and stderr are redirected

wan	lan
is the modem bridged and connected to the wan port of the router and is the router configured to supply ip to your lan dhcp

274990
cpu	processors
i have already checked the advanced power management section and made sure that minimum processors state and maximum processors state are both set to 100 for the high performance plan yet everest shows that even with high performance mode selected the cpu clock is not at the fixed 1.8ghz setting i am trying to configure

274990
cpu	processors
i fully understand how automatically slowing the processors down while idle helps lengthen battery life reduces energy consumption reduces temperatures and helps prolong the overall lifespan of the equipment but i still want to have manual control over the cpu speed in windows as i have in linux

275019
tunnel	vpn
if you have the option of connecting to the remote vpn end via ssh you can create ssh tunnel on the specific application port directing them to localhost destination_port

275044

debian	linux
i surfed the web to search an alternate os i also searched for another web browser and i found opera mini but it s the same installed on phones so it s not so good for netbooks but i don t understand if debian or other linux based oss can be installed on this machine

using the windows os s host file to redirect an url to an invalid one 127.0.0.1 will help me to stop that url in internet explorer and firefox but not in google-chrome

275134
tunnel	vpn
note that the ssh tunnel is the only vpn-like connection i can make and i do not have rights to install or run additional software on the ssh server end-point so i cannot establish an openssh vpn or other alternative real vpn setup

275134
debian	linux
the ssh tunnel itself is initiated on a linux debian server in my home network but it s the traffic from mac os x 10.6 that needs to be routed

275152
filesystems	hfs

275173
sudo	passwd
sudo remembers your passwd your authentication for some time so you do not have to enter the passwd for multiple commands in quick succession

there is reportedly a blueprint for integrating this in ubuntu 11.04 already and a feature request for inclusion in opensuse as well

275494
chown	chmod
also if you want to mimic that you should give full permission to the group perhaps making a special group for just these two owners and the extent to which this actually mimics owernship will be paltform dependent old-style unix-en tend to be very strict in their rules for allowing chmod chown

275547
wmv	asf
i am trying to understand how to convert wmv to asf file using either ffmpeg or expression encoder application

275567

the new certificate verifies fine in internet explorer 9 google-chrome and firefox 4 - but when trying to browse check out the repository with tortoisesvn i get the following error

275611
pop-up	dialog
one recurring problem i ve noticed is the following dialog which tends to pop-up after the machine has been idle for a bit

275632
put	get
someone with some time on their hands could write a program that uses a mutex object to check if there is another instance already running and if there is to pass it s file to that instance and then close whereon the original instance will put that file in a queue and get to it once it s done processing its own file

275632

vpn	lan
the problem is that when i am connected to the customer network using the vpn client application and after a few minutes i lose my lan internet connection

275824
versioning	upgrade
if security patches or service packs come down for say .net framework 4 and you have .net framework 1.1 sp1 2.0 sp2 3.5 sp1 all setup and working then your registry and hard drive can be left in shambles as the service pack attempts to upgrade all the previous versioning to .net 4.0 sp whatever

276590
tunnel	vpn

perl	tcl
the script does a lot of parsing of log files calls other scripts in languages like perl and tcl creates new files and calls executables

276681
folder	directory
anything related to the windows installation i research online as i ve seen suggestions that wholesale linking folder such as the program files directory or the windows winsxs to a hdd will cause problems and instability

276718
filesystems	ntfs
as far as how ntfs s compression stacks up against other filesystems compression methods i am unsure

276718
filesystems	ntfs
if you want to stick with vanilla windows 7 without installing other filesystems i d say ntfs is going to be your most painless bet

276847
disk	ram
my goal is to build a desktop system that will automatically move files among a hard disk a solid state drive and a ram disk based on how and how often they re accessed in order to control wear through opportunistic volume selection

276847
disk	ram
files that are read frequently but are opened for read-write access would be placed on a ram disk

276847
disk	ram
however i get the sneaky feeling that a similar effect could be accomplished by creating a primary filesystem on the hard disk a swap partition on the ssd and reserving a large quantity of ram for a filesystem cache

276856
ssl	https
the way to make this work for https as well is to intercept the ssl certificates and replace them on-the-fly with your own so that you can decrypt insepct then encrypt again but this is likely to cause a lot of unforseen problems and complaints for users who notice what s going on

276870
macbook	bootcamp
i ve installed bootcamp windows 7 on my macbook pro

276913
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu and other debian derivatives you can find out your bitness by running

for some reason i can t scp rsync git pull or git push files larger than 1406 bytes

277005
x86	64bit
ia64 refers to the 64bit itanium architecture while x64 is the 64bit extension to the x86 architecture

277008
cpu	processors
ia64 is itanium a server cpu architecture intel created around 2000 incompatible with the x86 processors in wide use on desktop systems

277008
x86	64bit
a lot of linux people will use the term amd64 instead because amd was the one that first came out with cpus that extended the intel x86 32-bit instruction set and architecture to 64bit rather than developing a new incompatible 64bit processor

277057
ubuntu	linux
i run ubuntu linux 10.04.2

277264
pop-up	dialog
ignore the dialog that pop-up

277270
folder	directory
if you re only concerned with files under a home folder run chmod o-rwx on the relevant directory

277322

whether or not date and time copy properly will depend on a number of factors including the underlying fs on the nas and quite how the nas is exposing smb cifs - this can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and browser-configured permissions aren t always quite what you expect

278848
ssd	sata
i suspect it is either the ssd or the sata controller on the motherboard

278852
ssd	sata
esata and plain old sata are electrically identical and should offer you the same speed as an internal drive if the host system supports it.if you have to go ssd and external esata is your best choice

278857

278967
traceroute	packets	icmp	udp
traceroute is based on icmp or udp packets

278967
icmp	udp
if hop 6 isn t responding it s probably specifically blocking icmp udp messages

278967

279102
ati	nvidia
i am a strong believer that there is no reason to update a driver unless it introduces a specific feature or bugfix that you need - especially in the case of video drivers nvidia and ati both love to introduce new features in their drivers that often break certain configurations

279126
xmonad	xmobar
i m using xmonad with xmobar but i still use gnome for some system services

279132

this would have been a good question for the r-sig-debian list which is for questions regarding r on debian ubuntu

279238
gif	png
that said assuming that they re not stored in a non-standard secret obfuscated format i d guess that they re just stored as gif or png image resources in the executable and that tools such as pe explorer will allow you to look at the innards of the app and at least see the emoticons

279243
chown	sudo
sudo chown myusername staff . entries

279255
sudoers	visudo
edit etc sudoers visudo

279267

firefox appears to be pulling that hit from your browsing history and if you have no such hit in your google-chrome history that s a pretty darned unfair test

279302
ubuntu	debian
it defaults to booting ubuntu well debian squeeze now with grub giving me time to select windows 7 instead before the autoboot

279420
google-chrome	firefox
my question simply is how can i save my internet browser cache firefox and google-chrome that i can reset this cache file any time explorer removes it

279421
min	max
of course instead of sampling you could average or take max and or min

279446

get the new drivers and drivercleaner free edition or driversweeper and put them on a thumb drive for example

279557
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
iâ m a long time tcsh user but all the cool kids seem to be using either bash or zsh nowadays that is completion patterns for git or stuff are available for bash and zsh rarely for tcsh

filesystems	fat
i ve tried a few methods - from running checkdisk in windows to creating a new fat filesystems in linux

279645
cpu	hyperthreading
the notion behind hyperthreading is basically that all modern cpu s have more than one execution issue

279662
cpu	hyperthreading
i have some anecdotal evidence to add to geoffcâ s answer in that i actually have a core i7 cpu 4-core with hyperthreading and have played a bit with video transcoding which is a task that requires an amount of communication and synchronisation but has enough parallelism that you can effectively fully load up a system

279662
cpu	hyperthreading
my experience with playing with how many cpus are assigned to the task generally using the 4 hyperthreading extra cores equated to an equivalent of approximately 1 extra cpu worth of processing power

279672
sudoers	visudo
from there you can edit your sudoers file by running visudo without sudo before it you re root anyway

279677
macports	homebrew
if you are on mac os x then something like homebrew or macports might help you here as they both have packages ports for sox

x86	64bit
if you need a specific version though then you ll need to find the appropriate .exe file which might be under a sub-directory called common or common files which should be somewhere under c program files or c program files x86 stuff is often scattered between both of these as applications are slowly transitioning from 32-bit to 64bit

an easy way to test this out is to switching out of full screens mode with your video player software and see if the thin black edges do show up between the gui borders of the video player window and the video itself

280923

usually alt-enter is the keystroke to use to switching in and out of full screens mode -- if not with your software then try vlc player as i believe it does have this feature

of course you ll want firefox and google-chrome

282793
ubuntu	linux
next i would try booting off of a linux livecd which supports ntfs ubuntu should work

282798
folder	directory
password-protecting the folder won t really do a whole lot if they can just log in as an administrator and claim ownership of the directory themselves

282798
put	get

fedora is rpm -based distribution that uses dnf for package management

282881
redhat	fedora
fedora is a linux-based free operating system sponsored by redhat

282884
disk	ram
the downside is slower load times for items that are not already cached as the item must be both read from disk to and ram and then the ram written back to disk

282884
disk	ram
your question asks about two things reducing disk use and pre-loading information into ram

282884
disk	ram
because this ram can t be swapped to disk that ram will be unavailable to applications and your computer will often be slower not faster

282884
disk	ram
now you will have to wait for apps to load from disk into memory but you will have access to all your ram when you need it

282890
rar	zip
if a program decided to store the data in an ntfs alternate data stream your zip client won t see that portion it needs to explicitly ask for it and rar is the only one that does this currently

282902
ubuntu	linux
i have eliminated the possibility that i have a faulty motherboard by going into other operating systems such as ubuntu linux which instantly recognized my bluetooth and even successfully paired with one of my devices all running off the live cd

vmware	virtualbox
i think there is a utility for vmware but is it possible to do with virtualbox

283051
vmware	virtualbox
if no one else comes up with an answer all in one tool then i would suggest simply using the vmware converter tool and importing the virtual machine to virtualbox

283057
put	get
go to microsoft update put the machine on auto-update and wait for days and days to get the zillion updates downloaded and installed tying up her phone for all that time and running the risk of having call waiting interrupt things

there are also commercial client billing management systems that integrate with xen openvz to take care of that side of things automatically

283572
ubuntu	linux
there may be a driver available under linux ubuntu that will allow you to read and or write to a windows based raid array

283572
filesystems	ntfs
this is an area fraught with difficulty as windows uses ntfs and linux uses ext3 or ext4 as the underlying filesystems and they are not compatible

283612

the two that i would look at are opensuse 11.4 and ubuntu server which is different from ubuntu desktop

283643

i unblocked the kdc ports tcp udp 88 by going into server admin firewall settings services allow kerberos v5 kdc and now network login takes only 5-10 seconds same as local accounts

you could then use either a general purpose vm software like vmware or virtualbox in bridged mode or a vps specific server like openvz

folder	directory
installing to folder with no spaces in directory structure

283737
folder	directory
i have used chmod -r 775 on the www folder but after i try to create a folder test through my sftp server using filezilla the group of the directory created has only r and x permissions and i am not able to log in with the second user user2 and create a directory within www test due to a lack of w permission to the group

283773
voip	sip
at home i have an voip router avm fritz 7270 which transparently chooses the right sip provider depending on the number being called

283775
voip	sip
you want to go with a standard sip provider and then you can use a standard phone connected to a voip gateway linksys spa3102 or do like i have done and get a snom 370 or other ip phone

283809
switching	screens
then i can switching among 4 remote desktops in full screens with one mouse click each

my desktop environment is screwed up and won t let me use the keyboard or mouse at the login screen

283855
put	get
where can i go to get free copies of windows and then put in my licence key to unlock it

283858
disk	ram
often used data will stay in the caches anyway and older data can be written to disk to free some ram for applications

283863
nas	qnap
i have a qnap nas that offers a few smb shares

283933
versioning	upgrade
so seems like the upgrade process didn t work well with the ati driver and my xserver versioning - well probably just the ati drivers

283961
opera	firefox
as a last resort if that still does not work you could use the same interface to set first opera as the default browser for all files and protocols related to browsers instead of only http and https then set firefox afterwards the same way as you did with opera

283980
mouse	keyboard
to save myself a lot of extra work i would like to use the keyboard for translational movement and the mouse for rotation much like in a video game

283984
matplotlib	scipy
perhaps more importantly now that i think about it i m going to be using scipy numpy nltk matplotlib some type of database api mysql or something i m not that far yet so i m not sure and maybe some other hard-core scinerd stuff that i don t know about yet

284008
ring	counterclockwise
rotate the bottom cover counterclockwise until the white dot painted on the bottom cover is aligned with the ring inscribed on the outer case

284034
mouse	keyboard
one thing that might be important to note the usb keyboard and usb mouse were not lighting up at all as in the keyboard scrolllock did not light up even when you pressed it

284073
dmz	was
you should keep in mind then that by dmzing a computer inside your network setting it as the dmz destination you lose that layer of security for that computer it is now completely open to incoming connections from the internet so you need to secure it as if it was directly connected

284082
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
not too long ago i posted this question and got an answer that works perfectly in ubuntu 10.10 and linux mint 10

284082
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
the problem however is that this no longer works in ubuntu 11.04 and linux mint 11 rc

284082
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
here is the output of rsyslogd -v on linux mint 11 rc and ubuntu 11.04 where the solution above does not work

284082
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
this is the output of rsyslogd -v on linux mint 10 and ubuntu 10.10 where the above solution works perfectly

284082
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
according to www.rsyslog.com the latest stable version of rsyslogd is actually 5.8.1 which does not seem to be available as an update for either ubuntu 11.04 or linux mint 11rc at this time

284082
opensuse	mint	opensuse	linux
sadly i m finding that i m not crazy about opensuse and so i ll be going back to linux mint where i m still having trouble

284089
kde	gnome
using fedora 14 on gnome and kde both

284110

note i m looking for an arbitrary redirector not kb ssl enforcer which only works for the specific task of redirecting to https

284118
pop-up	dialog
a dialog box will pop-up asking you for the location of the ipsw file

284119
folder	directory
i ve to go to that directory or folder change the view mode to large icons than right-click and set group by type to get what i want

284133
executable	sfx
the sfx modules need to be in the same directory as the 7z executable

284162
docx	xlsx
for some reason i ve always assumed the older formats office 2007 xp doc xls were the safest to maintain compatibility with office simply due to them being aged and likely more mature however i ve recently been told one of the reasons benefits for docx xlsx is that the old formats are actually an abomination

284204
google-chrome	firefox
if the xml file is valid then most browsers ie8 google-chrome and firefox give a message like this xml file does not appear to have any style information associated with it

284212
hide	show
the invisible button has been set to show a group of other buttons on rollover and hide them on rollout

is there any way to know which process had created any file in linux red hat centos 5

284351
freebsd	linux
unix derivatives freebsd gnu linux os x

284361
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh
in most command-line shells temporary environment variables are set using export sh bash zsh or setenv csh tcsh commands

284361
bash	zsh
examples for prepending to in bash or zsh

284373
google-chrome	firefox
good for people who use google-chrome all the time not so good for people who use firefox all the time like me

284373
google-chrome	firefox
i find myself using the view this page in google-chrome add-on for firefox and sending the page from google-chrome

284384
google-chrome	firefox
interestingly enough it seems like google-chrome sometimes ignores the windows hosts file source whereas internet explorer and firefox obey it

284391
move	drag
drag and drop either the html file or the folder and watch as it move the other one

284399
feedback	review
i know several microsoft employees and they have all told me that even though feedback request almost always get reject responses publically internally they still track feature requests and if enough requests come in they will prioritize it on a list of review topics for future versions of products

284409
mouse	keyboard
i like to use the keyboard exclusively without touching the mouse

284420
redhat	fedora
on the same page below the template are complete instructions for writing headers for initscripts on redhat fedora centos systems

284456
filesystems	btrfs
you ll also note that the most modern filesystems such as btrfs and zfs do online disk scrubbing where the system will actively read and rewrite disk sectors to maintain the magnetic integrity of the disk

284465
udp	tcp
ordinary users can only do udp and tcp

284484
ubuntu	linux
for linux systems it would depend - i use remastersys on ubuntu boxen and would probably use mondo mindi on systems where it d work

284496
debian	linux
in case it matters i m on a windows vista 64-bit ultimate host with a linux debian amd64 guest

284503
msg	eml
â msg out to eml files then running a standard duplicate-file-finder then re-importing but that would strip them of their flags accounts etc

284515
vmware	virtualbox
if you are going to run photoshop cs4 or above on a guest vm you may want to consider vmware workstation 7.1 as it has far better 3d video performance than virtualbox according to this source

284518
vmware	virtualbox
i know vmware workstation supports this not sure about virtualbox

284565
hide	show
uncheck hide protected operating system files and check show hidden files

284585
ubuntu	linux
for windows and linux ubuntu oses

284586
antivirus	norton
for what it s worth i much prefer using microsoft s security essentials antivirus anti-malware over norton

284591
x86	64bit
if you have office installed you should be able to find mspscan.exe in the folder programfiles common files microsoft shared mspaper 32-bit or commonprogramfiles x86 microsoft shared modi 1x.0 64bit where 1x.0 is your office version 10.0 11.0 12.0

284594
ati	nvidia
i personally don t use ati s but my colleagues told me that the multi monitor support of ati os much more advanced and usable than the nvidia s

284597
hide	show
there are 2 types of apps can bring up the taskbar - applications that show notifications in windows 7 just hide those notifications to avoid this behavior or applications that simulate key strokes

284599
put	get
what magic stuff should i put in my vimrc to get the awesome functionality back

284618
chown	mkdir
mkdir and chown etc are taking enough time already

284622
google-chrome	firefox
i would guess you ve got some web filtering software installed perhaps as part of a larger av suite and it installed a plugin for ie and firefox but not google-chrome

284631
tunnel	lan
these tools connect from your lan to a server and are tunnel the network-traffic from source-pc to target-pc with http-packets

284632
udp	tcp
there might also be an option for tcp and udp timeouts - you might also want to lower these as inactive connections tend to linger around too long thus clogging your routing table

284641
stdout	stderr
in your script you could echo something like and in your cron redirect both the stdout and the stderr to a file

284647
pull	push
i m just getting into google sketchup and i m already annoyed with the way rectangles are drawn and the pull push tool works

284648
filesystems	hfs
which seems unlikely since as noted above ubuntu should be able to read the hfs filesystems

284659
rsa	dsa
switched to using a new key with dsa instead of rsa

284688
filesystems	ntfs
the filesystems format is actually governed in such cases by the actual volume contents and labels such as fat12 and ntfs for the partition types are simply misnomers

284703
disk	ram
slices of the machine s precious resources cpu ram disk network

284709
vpn	lan
how can i maintain local lan access while connected to cisco vpn

284709
vpn	lan
when connecting using cisco vpn the server has to ability to instruct the client to prevent local lan access

284709
vpn	lan
assuming this server-side option cannot be turned off how can allow local lan access while connected with a cisco vpn client

284709
vpn	lan
rerouting local lan and internet traffic when in vpn

284709
vpn	lan
vpn client allow local lan access

284709
vpn	lan
allow local lan access for vpn clients on the vpn 3000 concentrator configuration example

284709
vpn	lan
lan access gone when i connect to vpn

284716
ethernet	wireless
i know it itunes that is the problem since i m connected via ethernet to the nas not wireless

284724
irssi	mirc
i would like to be a more active user of irssi as i am not a big fan of either pidgin xchat or mirc having used all of them for over a year

284764
mouse	keyboard
some tasks which need frequent mouse keyboard switching - i find it easier to go from keyboard to mouse than to pad

284782
emacs	aquamacs
for what it s worth i do most of my file editing using emacs aquamacs in osx is it possible it is setting weird permission bits

284784
uninstall	upgrade
don t upgrade - download adobe reader x do a complete uninstall of 9 then a fresh install of x

284813
folder	directory
to do this in finder select the folder you want to search your home directory and press cmd-f

284844
ffmpeg	handbrake
another note handbrake also uses libavcodec which is bundled into ffmpeg so it should have been able to decode your mov files as well

284846
filesystems	hfs
i have no good explanation for why those files are getting locked but my hunch would be that whatever hfs support software you re running in linux is either misunderstanding the purpose and the deprecated status of the old finder lock bit and setting it when it shouldn t or it s intentionally using the lock bit as a mechanism to map some kind of linux filesystems semantic concept onto hfs

284846
emacs	aquamacs
it could also be that aquamacs is abusing the old finder lock bit to carry out emacs file locking wishes

284865
ubuntu	debian
i just switched over to debian from ubuntu and i can t seem to figure out how to add a vpn connection through network manager

284870
filesystems	ntfs
since the filesystems appears to be ntfs through ntfs-3g you should be able to just use

284891
folder	directory
the maximum directory depth on the flash drive is 6 and it s copied 3 folder deep into the hdd s filesystem for 9 max depth on the hdd

284925
pppoe	dhcp
whichever device does pppoe also has to do nat and whichever device does nat usually does dhcp

284931
photoshop	fireworks
apparently it s possible to do this using fireworks but i can t find a way to do it using photoshop

284952
xfs	umount
i then umount all the lvm-volumes and tries to run xfs_check on one all the logical volumes are using xfs

284958
kde	gnome
i m using less version 429 in a gnome terminal 2.26.3.1 under kde on a fedora 11 system

284963
put	get
get one big enough to put at least your os and programs on it

284963
put	get
get a large standard hard drive and put all of your data on that drive

284972
macports	homebrew
i am planning to migrate from macports to homebrew

285012
put	get
i figure i could put some kind of terminator into the jack and then take a voltmeter to the basement but for rooms with 3 jacks in the wall this would take a while although i d get in some good cardio running up down the stairs

285023
arp	dhcp
the isp i work for uses an erx to serve ips it stores mac addresses in its arp table and assigns ip address based on the card and port which is mapped to a circuit through atms and eventually a dslam or cmts on similarly setup cable providers - we statically assign but not based on dhcp

285023
arp	dhcp
other isps will use the arp table to assign addressing via dhcp where static address are simply removed from the dhcp pool but will appear on the lease table

285060
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i am intending to install either linux mint or ubuntu distribution

285060
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
but i am not sure which distribution to go far as i have read online that linux mint comes with many features such as flash support but for ubuntu need to install them manually i am not used to linux commands so prefer an easy to use distribution

285082
ubuntu	mint
both mint and ubuntu are new-user friendly distributions

285098
decoder	encoder
it s a very efficient low level c-based encoder decoder library but it s never been targeted towards distributed coding

285101
folder	directory
then i right-click the directory properties - sharing - advanced sharing - uac yes - x share this folder - permissions - everyone full control - ok - ok - close

285112
filesystems	ntfs
i have windows 7 with ntfs filesystems

285124
ssd	sata
unless you have several sata hdd linked up in raid 0 or a fast ssd on both ends high throughput cannot be achieved.therefore super-fast data transfer cannot be achieved without a lot of very expensive fancy hardware

285161
cpu	hyperthreading
you have a cpu with hyperthreading technology

285164
mouse	keyboard
this sounds like you have some usb device mouse keyboard webcam that performs a wakeup action

285166
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
what i do know is backuppc must run under linux because of the hard links it uses which means the filesystems i believe has to be a certain type other than ntfs fat

285222
folder	directory
it deletes and remakes the print folder directory so that i don t constantly fill up my flash drive

285225
post	get
i found a promising solution description blog post no longer available online involving editing the com.apple.timemachine.plist but all i can get timemachine to do is backing up the sparsebundle files themselves

285265
move	drag
select the movies or music that i want to move to an external drive and drag and drop them copy to the external drive via the finder

285276
rss	feed
here s a list i made when i checked out different notifiers for my private rss feed

285276
rss	feed
does not support private rss feed

285276
rss	feed
fuzzyduck download 4mb in memory 14mb does not support private rss feed

285276
rss	feed
klipfolio download 2mb in memory 7mb does not support private rss feed popup tested works

285278
filesystems	ntfs
are there any raid solutions that just mirror the traditional like ntfs filesystems so when a single hdd is gone i can just take the other and plug it as a normal regular drive

285285
redhat	fedora
according to this site redhat enterprise linux is based on fedora

285289
redhat	fedora
redhat enterprise linux or rhel is a commercially supported derivative of fedora tailored to meet the requirements of enterprise customers

285289
redhat	fedora
it is a commercial product from redhat which also sponsors fedora as a community project

285289
redhat	fedora
fedora is upstream for redhat enterprise linux but there are several other derived distributions available too

285319
google-chrome	safari
i initially thought it was google-chrome but it happens with safari as well

285328
mouse	keyboard
using the keyboard and the mouse

285334
cpu	processors
cpu - intel core i7-860 2.8ghz quad-core processors

285385
put	get
generally if one has gone through all the expense to get a xeon processor and ecc ram they ll just get a server board to put it on

285389
vmware	virtualbox
there are plenty of no cost options including virtualbox vmware and ms virtual pc

285396
youtube	vimeo
most flash blockers also allow you to load native h.264 video from popular video-sharing websites like youtube and vimeo

285407
minimum	max
that said if you re doing twitch gaming first-person shooters and the like over the internet you always want the max bandwidth and reliability and minimum latency you can get and wireless will never compare to a wired connection for those criteria

285422
wan	lan	wan	subnet
if this is a home network and the only reason you have separate subnet is because you have machines on both the wan and lan side of a box that s doing nat then easiest solution might be to disable nat and dhcp on that box make it act as just a bridge so that it s not creating a separate subnet on one side

285432
deb	dmg
supported formats unpacking only arj cab chm cpio cramfs deb dmg fat hfs iso lzh lzma mbr msi nsis ntfs rar rpm squashfs udf vhd wim xar and z

285440
bash	tcsh
why don t you open a shell ksh tcsh or bash and run find and or grep directly

285441
textwrangler	bbedit
you will need to replace bbedit with textwrangler in the applescripts

285456
redhat	fedora
so redhat became the enterprise distro where fedora is still real open-source and top of linux development

285461
sudoers	visudo
man sudoers and man visudo will tell you how to do that exactly

285479
portrait	landscape
i would upgrade your video card drivers maybe run dxdiag and run some of its tests in both landscape and portrait modes

285495
filtering	grouping
they will let you grouping summarise filtering and sort your data with a great amount of flexibility

285508
sudo	passwd
both times it wants the auser passwd su always asks for the passwd of the account you re switching to while sudo asks for the account you re switching from

285514
ubuntu	freebsd
i want to run hackintosh windows 7 and maybe ubuntu on the ssd but i m also thinking about freebsd and since i d mainly be using ubuntu was wondering if i could install an os on the 2tb hard drive instead

285547
udp	tcp
doesn t ping bypass the transport layer thus it does not need tcp or udp ports but rather uses raw sockets

285552
icmp	udp
datagram is traditionally interpreted as a packet belonging to an unreliable service which would include ip icmp udp etc

285572
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu 11.10 and am looking for an equivalent to process explorer on linux

285590
required	placeholder
it looks like the reason why i couldn t see the placeholder borders was because i had set the line color of the text box to no line. visualizing the placeholder of the text box when dragging it required a line to be present

285605
stdout	stderr
i want to write stdout to a file but also prints stdout and stderr

285605
stdout	stderr
but this causes the printed stderr and stdout to be interleaved incorrectly if the correct output should be

285605
stdout	stderr
is there any way to print both stdout and stderr to screen and also write the stdout to a file without gobbling up the printed output

285627
google-chrome	firefox
is there a way to force the status bar in either firefox or google-chrome to show the actual target

285655
disk	ram
note that when you have 20 services all being started at the same time each will start up slower as it competes with the others for slices of the machine s precious resources cpu ram disk network

285702
wan	lan
prevents hosts on lan from using wan address of router to contact servers on the lan which have been configured using port redirection

285729
centos	linux
is it possible to backup centos linux

285731
temp	tmp
temp folder c documents and settings your user local settings temp c user your user application data roaming temp temp tmp

285732
disk	ram
how much ram cache does your disk have

285732
disk	ram
see if the whole file fits in ram and you aren t using the disk for anything else the actual drive hardware won t be hit at all by any uploading of that file

285765
mouse	keyboard
at work i am using a wireless mouse and keyboard

285832
post	get
if the link in amartel s post isn t enough to get you there i can write a detailed post on my blog and shoot you a link in the comments but here is the basic outline of what you need

285833
cpu	processors
processors intel core i5 cpu m430 2.27ghz

285868
jobs	cron
certainly going to be an easy way to set up cron jobs from there

285868
jobs	cron
something called cron jobs or scheduled tasks or something like that

285911
disk	ram
also ram could be bad the other comment about ultimate boot cd is a good way to go also i know ubuntu has a ram checker on most all of their bootable disk you can download

285950
versioning	upgrade
the downside to that is you may then also need to upgrade your operating system to a 64bit versioning so there are hidden costs there too

285962
ethernet	wireless
these can be used on usb s as well including the ability to update over ethernet or linux compatible wireless adapter

286004
google-chrome	firefox
i normally browse in google-chrome but i tried firefox to see if that would help

286010
ubuntu	linux
how can i format this 50gb partition in windows either using windows disk manager or some other disk partitioning tool so that ubuntu setup can see this partition as a distinct one and allow me to install linux on it

286073
width	height
second i suggest sticking to multiples of the image width and height

286076
mouse	trackpad
using both the trackpad and an external logitech mx5000 mouse i see the same issue

286080
folder	directory
is it possible to set your home directory home username to point to the contents in your windows user folder c users username

286105
kde	gnome
it tends to work well enough in gnome and kde environments and less well the further you stray from those

286124
wan	lan
since their purpose is to serve as lan interconnections they don t have wan ports and capabilities vpns etc...

286132
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
but windows based fat and ntfs filesystems will not work

286135
bash	zsh
some advice to change default shell in the terminal to bin zsh and restart the terminal to see if the problem is specific to bash

286137
macbook	bootcamp
i m running windows 7 32-bit on a mid-2010 15 macbook pro intel core i5 under bootcamp

286178
folder	dir
you can use processexplorer to find out if any process is still using one or more folder in that dir

286179
folder	directory
the thing is usually these folder are deletable my an administrator account unless they have been installed so it sounds like you are trying to delete stuff from the windows directory which is usually a bad idea and even if you do theyâ ll probably be re-created anyway

286184
background-color	transparency
trying to add a display block property to a class i tried to edit an existing rule that didn t matter background-color transparency but as soon as i change it the rule disappears

286186
ubuntu	linux
next check if you can access the file system with a linux livedisk with ntfs3g ubuntu s a good common one but nearly any disk will work - these sometimes manage to open drives that windows fails to open

286189
google-chrome	firefox
personally i now prefer to use firebug in firefox and the google-chrome development tools built in to google-chrome - i don t really have a favorite but i find firebug better for css design and google-chrome better for cookies scripts etc

286193
folder	directory
simply delete the shorcut entire folder in question from the c users all users microsoft windows start menu programs directory

286218
min	max
transfer rate min 12.6 avg 16.4 max 16.8 mb s

286275
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox will only work if you install the 32-bit java

286307
udp	tcp
a well-known counterpart to tcp is udp which is targeted towards non-reliable communication and realtime applications like video conferencing or gaming

286308
google-chrome	firefox
are there any add-ons for firefox or google-chrome that prevents links loading when not on facebook.com

286310
pop-up	dialog
i believe an option dialog should pop-up

286328
uninstall	downgrade
you should not uninstall or downgrade the default python on an ubuntu machine since internal programs and services do rely on it

286332
vmware	virtualbox
there is free vm software such as virtualbox or commercial software like vmware workstation

286339
virtualbox	parallels
as far as i know this feature is not available in virtualbox at least i cannot find documentation relating to it. it is available on other platforms like parallels on osx and it s called shared applications

286358
ubuntu	linux
from my personal perspective and experience it is a good idea to run a linux as your host os i use ubuntu

286358
ubuntu	linux
virtualbox and chrome can both be installed in ubuntu then you also don t really need av but if you insist avast does have a linux virus scanner which im pretty sure would just search for windows viruses on the linux file system

286365
mouse	keyboard
but is it a better financial investment to build a home server then create virtual workstations and simply have the typical peripherals like monitor keyboard and mouse at each user location

286381
ubuntu	linux
boot the ubuntu installer which will load gparted or just load gparted from any linux livecd and delete the fourth 50gb partition then create a new one of type ext2 which includes ext3 and ext4

286397
vim	atom-editor
where w is a vim regex atom-editor meaning non-word character. see

286423
pop-up	dialog
you could in theory create a vbs script and assign a hotkey to it which pop-up a dialog where you type an alias and it will place the correct char code into the clipboard which you then paste

286424
sorting	grouping
linux has seen a similar behaviour for a long time through the prevalence of their .tgz format or .tar.gz to use it s full form as the tar is simply merging all the files into a single stream albeit without sorting and grouping of files and then compressing with gzip

286428
versioning	upgrade
virtualbox an old versioning but i can upgrade

286437
logmein	hamachi
i m looking at logmein hamachi as a vpn and wondering where the user authentication settings are

286476
disk	ram
windows is like linux where free ram acts as a disk cache so if the balancing act is played right it can contribute to overall performance

286514
wan	lan
you basically have a wan ip and port on each router that has to be forwarded to the corresponding ip and port on the device on the lan past it

286534
wan	lan
some gateways don t let you disable those services very easily so you have to disable dhcp or set the size of the dhcp address pool to zero and then stop using the wan port -- just plug a lan port into the upstream gateway

286535
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu 11.04 but i m guessing whatever solution you may have will work on almost any recent linux distribution

mp4	h.264
whenever i convert a video into mp4 with h.264 codec it doesn t play immediately on windows or ipad

286561
folder	directory
but actually syncronizing your mail storage can be quite a bit more tricky than syncronizing directory of files -- because of various flags new read labels movements or copies of messages between folder and-- the most tricky part--the server-internal message ids used by mail access servers imap or mail clients

286597
width	height
i converted a video with mencoder and kept the same height and width but the video aspect ratio looks different

286647
centos	linux
this applies to all distributions of linux not only the centos which you are using

286656
ubuntu	linux
ms windows requires 16 gb of disk minimum and ubuntu my favored distribution of linux requires 8 gb so make sure your partitions are at least that big

issue su -c chntpw sam or sudo if that s your thing and reset the passwd with the asterisk character

286691

it seems to only happen when i am not using the computer directly manipulating mouse or keyboard

then i would download a live boot linux cd i would go with ubuntu and the cd usually has a ram checker right off the boot screen the newest cds you need to push a button on the keyboard to get to the menu

286926
bluetooth	usb
i believe it started when i was trying to install a bluetooth usb dongle

286932
ethernet	wireless
you could have two ethernet connections a card and a motherboard connector and multiple wireless wifi 3g connections available and be connected to the internet on one while another connection is not

286980
ubuntu	linux
use a live linux cd usb to get at the hidden partition - you can make a copy onto a usb hard drive or simply toggle the hidden flag within gparted this ships with ubuntu - not sure about other distros

287007
vim	emacs	vim	gedit	emacs	gedit
the kind of metadata you are talking about is added usually by document editors like openoffice and microsoft office but not by editors like vim emacs gedit notepad etc

the ram you do not need will cache the disk so the more the better

287036
ati	nvidia
some laptops have a key combination like function+f8 that toggles the external display and if you have an ati or nvidia icon in the system tray you could try changing the resolution there

287063
wan	lan
but my broadband internet provider issues the same wan ip to all the customers while each of them has a different lan ip

287128
stdout	stderr
so in terminal two you will see stdout content as it is written to stdout.txt and in terminal one you will see stderr

287128

you can also forward both stdout and stderr to a file and do the same thing

287128
bash	tcsh
this will work on tcsh but you can do it in bash too.

287177
switching	screens
this doesn t answer your question directly but if i m inferring correctly that you re going to be jumping between directories a lot you could use a terminal multiplexer like gnu screens to keep the different directories open in different windows and simply switching between them as needed

287182
folder	dir
this for example will let you cd into any dir in your home folder from anywhere in your system

287186

most video cards eg ati nvidia with more than one output allow you to use â œclone modeâ where each output ie monitor displays the same thing this is usually most useful for presentation kiosk type things

287778
switching	screens
if the game does not properly capture the mouse then moving the cursor towards another screens could cause the game to lose mouse focus and thus cut your in-game control and if you happen to click while the cursor is on another screens the game will pause and or switching out to the desktop on the primary display and or continue on its own without your having any control

287801

this way creating folder etc won t cause explorer to re-sort your list of images every time the directory contents changes

sudoers	passwd
we ve got the etc sudoers file set up so that users can run commands from bin like cat or mkdir without entering a passwd

288385

filesystems	ntfs
you might find that a defrag will go a long way though not on ext3 or ext4 filesystems which are much less prone to fragmentation than ntfs to increasing your speed regardless of the transfer medium as your drive will a lesser seek time and even a slightly smaller amount over large amounts of data adds up

288714
bash	zsh
i m using bash but i d like to have zsh style autocomplete you hit tab and it tabs through the possibilities rather than what bash seems to do which is display a list of possibilities but not choose anything until i type some more to disambiguate

288714
bash	zsh
how can i get zsh type behavior in bash

288714
bash	zsh
i can probably eventually make sure i have it working the same way in zsh but for now it s easier if i use bash and just get it behaving more like zsh during interactive use.

filesystems	ntfs
ntfs has become much more of a journalling filesystems seemingly during the lifetime of windows xp and has adopted a lot of features that make chkdsk unnecessary

289021
filesystems	ntfs
windows vista introduced transactional ntfs which appears to be similar in principle to a journalled filesystems where specific check-disk type events should be rare or unnecessary

289021
filesystems	fat
as mentioned in the comments there are cases where these systems do not protect you and it is entirely possible for your system to become corrupt to the point where chkdsk is necessary especially when using filesystems that do not support these advanced features such as the fat filesystems used on flash memory sticks

289021
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is a journaling filesystems and uses the ntfs log logfile to record metadata changes to the volume

289033
freebsd	linux
so lets say you want to run an intel freebsd binary on an intel linux machine

289033
freebsd	linux
someone would have to write code for the linux kernel to realize that when you run a freebsd binary to use a different syscall table

289033
freebsd	linux
since linux is more common than freebsd there really isn t a need for a lot of people to emulate freebsd on linux

289033
freebsd	linux
it would be rare for an app on freebsd to not be available on linux

289033

ethernet	wireless
in case your wireless ap is actually a router usually such devices have a 4 + 1 port ethernet connection

289839
wan	lan
4 ports lan + 1 port wan

289839
wan	lan
then make sure you disable the dhcp server on your wireless ap and hook it up to your router using a lan port not the wan port

289839
wan	lan
connected to the dsl router using one of the lan ports do not use the wan port if it has one

289884
ati	nvidia
i didn t have to disable firefox 4.0.1 hardware acceleration with my old nvidia geforce 9800 gt so that would strongly suggest that this is an amd ati problem.

i m trying to remove this directory pear from my tmp folder but it s not letting me

289907
switching	screens
you have other sorting options too holding the ctrl key will reveal these to you along the bottom of the screens and pressing the same sort key combination again will cause sorting to work in the opposite direction you can keep switching between ascending and descending this way

289930
ethernet	wireless
but if i do is there a way to tether them using an ethernet cable - i must have a crossed one laying around or through the old wireless router i used with the last provider so the ubuntu pc can access the internet

289939
mouse	keyboard
note i realize the keyboard shortcut alt + up arrow will do the same thing but when working with windows explorer my right hand is normally on the mouse not the keyboard

289948
mouse	keyboard
you might be able to use the mouse driver to assign keyboard shortcuts to special mouse buttons

289956
hash	md5
compute the md5 hash value of the download with md5sum and compare with the supplied md5 hash value

289964

289997
mouse	keyboard
so are user scripts in opera only runnable on every page load and not under specific circumstances like keyboard strokes or mouse gestures

290010

ethernet	wireless
i want the desktop to access the internet directly through an ethernet connection and then i want to wireless broadcast this signal to my other devices

290220
ethernet	wireless
a wifi router would be the ideal solution if it weren t for the fact that i stubbornly want my desktop to be connected via ethernet and not wireless - also assume that the desktop has only one ethernet port.

290224
mouse	keyboard
first try with a minimal system just memory cpu graphics and keyboard mouse as well as screen connected

and it is said that if we change dns from udp onto tcp the problem can be temporarily solved

290236
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse can be shared over a lan with synergy

290244
put	get
you need to put the pattern in quotes so that it does not get expanded by the shell

290265
ethernet	wireless
all consumer grade wireless routers these days have a built in switch with at least 4 ports you can still use ethernet to plug the computer into one of the switch ports on the router and have all your portables on wireless

290267
mouse	keyboard
even x server nor windows windowing system doesn t call video mouse keyboard driver directly

with the skype business edition there seems to be a focus on pbx integration and centralized administration for an office manager but the full list of features is still unclear and there doesn t appear to be anything helpful on skype s web site

290450
vmware	virtualbox
use a vm like virtualbox or vmware to install windows so you can take pictures of the setup process from the host environment

290450
filesystems	ntfs
moreover you would need storage like a usb stick with a filesystems writable by the setup tool usually this would not be any windows ntfs drive

290450
mouse	keyboard
these devices are connected to the video output as well as keyboard and mouse and provide a web interface which shows the screen output remotely

290491
jobs	cron
it would be helpful to let us know what the errors are but the most frequent issue people have with cron jobs is not specifying full paths in commands and files or not having some other environment variable set that is required for the task

290507
folder	directory
another option if you need this on a permanent basis and the directory structure and the file name is also constant you can simulate the directory structure on another location on your disk and use junction from the sysinternals pack to create a link from the fake d folder to the real file - then you always have an empty folder structure of and don t have to worry about junk in the archive

mouse	keyboard
i imagine an os must keep track of when the last user input keyboard or mouse use for example was or of how long it s been since the last user input in order to know when to run a screensaver

put	get
so put the ubuntu dvd into the reader turn the machine on and you should get into a minimal system

wan	lan
he uses this url whenever he is connected to the lan or wan

290861
wan	lan
however if he disconnects from the wan and connects on the public internet he needs to login to citrix from a different url like as the internal url is only for lan or wan ip addresses

290861

the only difference is that when he is inside the lan or wan internet explorer needs to go through a proxy server to connect to the first url

291646
sudoers	passwd
so backing up my users and groups related files passwd shadow groups sudoers apache mail apps and jabber daemon configs var www and the whole home resetting the server to default configuration and then installing necessary packages and plugging in their configs and data seems to be the answer

291652
width	height
the reason it allows a smaller height when horizontal is because each icon still has a wide width so it stays easily target-able with a fingertip

291659

ubuntu	linux
i mean how to attach my terminal to it again under linux ubuntu 11.04 - just like with the screen package

292462
versioning	upgrade
since microsoft comes up with new versioning of their products almost every year with some of them requiring latest-and-greatest oses upgrade are quite frequent

292582
stdout	stderr
nohup does not disconnect from terminal it makes your app ignore sighup and usually redirects stdout stderr

292582

forget the share for a moment open your c-drive and right click a directory folder pick a small one to test the following on ...it will say read-only

292666
google-chrome	firefox
going to i can see that that firefox and google-chrome expose more about system fonts and browser plugin details than i prefer

292666
google-chrome	firefox
how can the permission of a web page to access these settings be disabled in firefox and google-chrome

292696

so i was hoping to make a gzipped backup of my entire directory stucture but i was very stupid and issued the command gzip -r . hoping to add all files and folder to a single gzip archive

292731
ati	nvidia
i ve recently tried to upgrade an older machine with an nvidia chipset asus m2n mainboard with an ati radeon hd 5770 card

292755
cpu	processors
there is the physical layout such as the layout on a floppy disk or cd and there is the file system function which depends on having some intelligent entity cpu or peripheral processors of some sort to take the nonsense on the disk and return it as a meaningful sequence of bytes

292760
freebsd	linux
if you were to take a set of disks install a linux of some kind set them up with lvm install several ext3 filesystems on the logical volumes and then place the drives in a freebsd machine that freebsd machine would be able to read the disks

292772
put	get
when i examined the permissions while it was mounted everything looked right but in order to get things to work i simply put it on a drive letter--and the permissions were now wrong

292791
777	tmp
further more every time i try to chmod 777 tmp mnt sda2 the permissions are not changed and no error is produced

292793
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu

292808
disk	ram
this model can t take more than 2gb ram unfortunately late 2006 models can take more and i have plenty of hard disk space 87gb left on a 250gb drive but it s nothing but the spinning beach ball no matter what i do

292812
filesystems	fat
the fat filesystems does not support unix permissions so the ones specified in fstab apply to all files

292826
versioning	upgrade
i already have a previous versioning of virtualbox 4.0.4 on my computer and i want to make an upgrade by a direct overwritten-installation

292829
folder	directory
you can share any directory but keep in mind that your virtual machine can read and write if the shared folder is not read-only to those files and directory

292829
folder	directory
security-wise you would keep the virtualbox shared folder separate from your other files and directory to avoid any data-loss if you come across malware in your windows vm

292830
post	get
be sure to use the right method get or post in the method attribute of the html form statement

292856

inherited	properties
when creating a style in libreoffice you can link them to other rules so that they inherited the other rules styles and only modify specific properties

292866

how can i change a properties back to a value of inherited or simply remove it from the contains list

292893

i ve also tried hooking up a usb keyboard and mouse and closing the laptop

292923
ati	nvidia
i know both nvidia and ati s control panels have settings to control the quality output from the card

292924
cpu	processors
if you use a graphics card or a motherboard cpu with integrated graphics that can be used to decode video codecs and pass the files to it via the dxva decoding there will be few tweaks required as your processors will pass all the hard work off to the gpu

292925
srt	subtitle
i need to add subtitle to a movie i already have avi format video and srt format subtitle file and now i want to encode them both into one file

after a lot of trial and error i upgrade my system s default versioning of python on ubuntu

293070
afp	smb	ftp	smb
afp smb and ftp servers do not expose the underlying filesystem semantics of whatever filesystem they re using on the back end

293075
installation	upgrade
the install would have found the old installation location and you could have upgrade it which would overwrite any hardware information but leave all the other aspects like installed programs and settings intact

293087
ubuntu	linux
i am looking to run a undecided flavor of linux guessing ubuntu as my primary os and several windows installs with a windows 7 install for .net development and gaming as virtualized environments

293091
put	get
ec2 is not oriented towards disk space although the block storage system does provide you with disk space for operating system and software instead file storage should be handled by s3 which is a system that simply allows you to put in binary data and get that data back out on demand

293107
ati	nvidia
this is partially because vmware is acting as a middle man between the graphics hardware partly because games can t take advantage of ati or nvidia specific features because they see the vmware card only and partly because there s an extra level of indirection to access system ram inside the vm nested page tables soften the blow here somewhat

293124
opera	firefox
on the same note i m just realizing how customizable opera browser really is after coming back from firefox after years

293153
wan	lan
you ll need to port forward port 80 wan outside to lan ip of system that way requests coming in are forwarded to your system.

293154
ssd	sata
i have replaced my hard drive with a intel ssd 320 series 120gb and changed the sata mode to ahci in the bios

293179
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
there are known issues with virtualizing sls depending on which you use vmware parallels or virtualbox

293189
bluetooth	usb
though i m interested in if it would provide any benefit for any device i was specifically thinking of a usb hub that i plug my bluetooth receiver and flash-drives into

293200
fink	macports
you can alternatively use macports or fink they likely also have this package available

293205
windows	wow64
example windows wow64 windows32 on windows64 emulation

293205
x86	64bit
over time more and more 64bit will be used and more and more x86 will not be used

293212
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
a 32 bit cpu can add divide subtract multiplying two 64 bit values but not in a single hardware operation

293219
x86	64bit
these features are strictly not about 64bit but about cutting legacy and remedying known x86 limitations

293227
rss	feed
how do i set up a subscription to just download all new entries in an rss feed

293256
move	drag
in xp when i had a window on the projector display say firefox and the projector was powered off all i did was right click firefox on the task bar select move and blindly drag it over to my main display

293285
mouse	keyboard
windows 2008 servers and windows 7 share the same core for monitoring the status of connected devices - the os will continuously check communicate to all the i o devices including keyboard mouse audio devices and display monitor...etc.

293293
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
run windows you need a licensed copy under a virtual machine e.g virtualbox which is free parallels or vmware fusion

293319
ubuntu	linux
used almost exclusively on linux arch and ubuntu but initially formatted on windows 7

293319
filesystems	ntfs
back to the familiar linux fdisk -l does find ntfs filesystems but im a bit afraid to do an fsck or ntfsfix

293355
put	get
i don t know what else to try except maybe buy a video card to put into the pci express slot and see if i get a signal from the card

293356
hash	salt
actually for best security you should use a salt hash which complicates searching -- you have to find the user entry figure out the salt that was used with its password hash what the user typed with the same salt and compare that with what s in the file

293385
ubuntu	linux
since you re new to linux i suggest that you install virtualbox and install ubuntu in a virtual machine

293406
rss	feed
so what i did was leave the utorrent rss feed alone and used google desktop bar rss feed to get the news then get the torrent that way

293411
versioning	upgrade
i had word 2007 and upgrade it to 2010 so it became unable to open other .doc files against created with on 2010 versioning

293427
opensuse	debian
debian opensuse and fedora are three alternative suggestions that also have large communities and a good level of support

293441
tar	gunzip
what is the equivalent of gunzip -c to pipe the content of a bunch of tar.gz files without having to permanently tar xzf them and tar czf them back

293451
notepad++	gedit
as for programming editors ubuntu comes with gedit which is a good alternative to notepad++

293483
ubuntu	mint
other less hardline distros such as ubuntu and mint offer an easier path in this respect since the repos will contain proprietary software

293483
kde	gnome
beyond that there are different package managers to learn and you need to pick a desktop environment kde gnome being the most popular

293483
opensuse	mint	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	mint
in no particular order i suggest trying ubuntu 10.04 lts mint 11 fedora 15 and opensuse 11.4

293535
xfce	kde
this affects lxterminal xfce s terminal and kde s konsole

293551
trojan	virus
also some dvd images you can download from the less legal websites may contain some sort of infection trojan virus spyware ...

293558
trojan	virus
afaik git does none of these things - i suspect you got yourself a trojan virus

293584
ubuntu	linux
the setup for virtualbox only allows you to specify linux ubuntu 64-bit

293594
google-chrome	firefox
i ve noticed that when browser tested with firefox and google-chrome has been running for a long time it stops connecting sites

293595
ubuntu	linux
i have two pcs one is a windows xp box the other is a linux ubuntu box

293595
mouse	keyboard
obviously the mouse keyboard input would need to switch in keeping with the monitor however that presents a problem under scenario #3 above where i m viewing both at the same time.

293595
mouse	keyboard
since i no nothing about kvms i ll wait to see what the su community thinks before making any decisions about the mouse keyboard

293613
google-chrome	firefox
i honestly don t believe this is a problem with firefox or google-chrome directly

293613
google-chrome	firefox
i currently have 1220 tabs open in google-chrome and 732 in firefox and it has been this way for over a week without a restart

293619
mouse	keyboard
i m not sure that a kvm will do what you re looking for your #3 since you only have one keyboard mouse and it wouldn t make sense to share it

293635
mouse	keyboard
i have 2 dvi on my monitors and are using usb keyboard mouse

293635
mouse	keyboard
connect the keyboard and mouse to a usb hub

293643
ubuntu	linux
yes a bridged interface would solve the issue however there is another solution made available because linux is so flexible to use the ubuntu host as a gateway to access the whole network

293652
post	get
i get no post beeps and no other signs of life

293652
hdd	floppy
i tried to add remove various other parts like floppy drive required for bios recovery procedure which i was required to follow a few hours before it broke dvd drive hdd drives tv card .

293652
put	get
how do i put out the noise and get the mainboard back in business

293653
width	height
this will create a multipage tiff g4 compressed fax format which is grayscale from pages 13-15 of your input.pdf with the default resolution which is 204dpi width by 196dpi height

293665
ubuntu	linux
however the suggested method for confirming this given by the suppliers was to run prime95 and cpu-z - these are windows applications whilst i am using a linux ubuntu 11.04 environment

293684
vmware	virtualbox
any of the mainstream virtualisation products - free or otherwise - xen virtualbox vmware server vmware esxi etc

293688
post	get
if you pulled the ram and video and didn t get any post error beeps then your motherboard is more than likely toast

293697
bluetooth	usb
my computer didn t have bluetooth so i got a usb to bluetooth adapter for about 30 on amazon

293712

293716
button	checkbox
there is a checkbox under the hidden files and folders radio button labelled hide empty drives in the computer folder

293815
hex	binary
i don t believe you can easily fix this since you can t easily reproduce the metadata structure that the file originally had unless you perform some complicated editing possibly at the binary hex level

293820
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i m using virtualbox-nonfree on linux mint based on ubuntu and have the vm installed and working all fine

293879
ethernet	wireless
there is no specific security risk to having two network interfaces enabled beyond the fact that it is possible for the user to not notice which interface is in use the laptop may have automatically connected to a wireless network while the user thought it was using the ethernet connection

293879
ethernet	wireless
you can avoid this problem entirely by simply turning the wireless power switch off when using an ethernet connection or just looking at your network status occasionally

293921
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
vmware virtualbox parallels and so on each with several versions and their own quirky emulated graphics cards.

293939
irc	xmpp
i m thinking that installing xmpp server on the 24 7 box and using portable miranda that could work but maybe there is also irc client that can show notifications for each new message

293973
versioning	upgrade
dropbox has been uninstalled re-installed with the latest 1.1.35 at the moment versioning but this has persisted across a dozen upgrade

293978
ssd	sata
given that hybrid hard drives like the momentusâ xt never really took off there was only one manufacturer so tier 1 oems did not want to use them plus the drives only cached reads anyway it looks like there are limited options for ssd hard drive caching an add in sata card or a software solution

293978
ssd	sata
these days more manufacturers are selling hybrid drives after rebranding them as sshd which sounds deceptively close to ssd but they are still only 5400rpm laptop sata drives no more than 4tb in size and they still only have 8gb of flash

293978
ssd	sata
even using the card as a 6gbps sata iii port resulted in worse performance with an adata s511 ssd than just using the on-board 3gbps sata ii ports

294041
versioning	upgrade
the issue is an upgrade kernel doesn t boot and i d like to just boot the prior kernel versioning without having to go to a rescue cd and edit grub.conf

294052
minimum	max
you can calculate the minimum time as bot47 did but max time is not known in advance

294098
folder	directory
the question is is there any application or script but i guess that s pretty hard to exist that can cleanup your users folder and remove any directory that do not have their corresponding application installed

294151
wan	lan
some wi-fi routers don t let your turn nat off because it s always enabled between the lan ports and the wan port

294203
ubuntu	debian
from the package psmisc at least in debian ubuntu

294205
apache	nginx
so the main reasons nginx + apache is faster than straight apache is a static files handled much more efficiently b reduced load on heavy apache resources

294205
apache	nginx
finally for the other benefits part of your question nginx also handles ssl connections faster than apache although again that doesn t make it better for all cases

294215
pop-up	dialog
i ve noticed that the first time i try to use a key on my ubuntu laptop teeks i get a dialog which pop-up asking me to type in my key passphrase

294225
pop-up	dialog
if i click the browse button i am then shown a pop-up dialog that offers that i can select a folder path and also press a button to create a newfolder

294226

ubuntu	linux
i need mac for iphone development windows 7 for .net and silverlight and genuine linux red hat or ubuntu for fooling with the linux kernel

294296
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
you could use virtualbox or a commercial program like parallels or vmware and will allow a fairly seamless experience and the vm s are very responsive.

294328
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox also provides some support though it s probably not as complete as vmware s

294344
ubuntu	linux
i m a ubuntu linux user

294365
afp	smb
if it s 100 megabit and your vm is introducing lots of latency then i could easily see getting only 30 megabits per second of afp or smb throughput in that situation

294365
afp	smb
i think a very telling test would be to install freenas and some of your media files on its own partition preferably on your external usb hard drive so you re not changing too much all at once and see what afp and smb throughput you get when freenas is running natively instead of via virtualbox

294369
ubuntu	linux
he can t use linux he needs microsoft office so i suggested to use a ubuntu live cd instead when needing to enter sensitive information somewhere

294378
packets	multicast
if multicast handling is broken on your client it might not be receiving certain broadcast packets in 802.11 broadcast is a subset of multicast that are fundamental to low-level network operation

294382
post	get
first to get bluetooth working i had to follow this post

294385
mouse	keyboard
you could just look in to buying a microsoft keyboard and mouse as a set since they d come together with one receiver for both

294387
switching	screens
so are there any full screens customisable distraction free word processors which i can switching move across screens

294423
dpkg	aptitude
if you haven t already done so aptitude install aptitude dpkg is usually a good place to start so that you can be sure the bulk of the upgrade will be handled by the best available tools

294441
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
i know theres a way to check which one for google-chrome or firefox -- is there a native method and or extension to do this in opera

google-chrome	firefox
i use google-chrome reguarly but i have used firefox and ie in the past and they both scan all downloads automatically

294453

i ve recently moved from using textmate to using vim a lot more because i split my time between mac and linux

294486

294535
folder	directory
godaddy told me i m not allowed to have over 1024 files in a single directory and that i need to reformat the folder structure which isn t possible as this software is maintained and run by a point-of-sale system at my client s brick and mortar store

294546
google-chrome	firefox
is there any twitter plugin for google-chrome which is similar to echofon for firefox

294546
google-chrome	firefox
i think this is the only reason of using firefox instead of google-chrome - suitable twitter client

294593
filesystems	fat
you do not necessarily need to use the fat filesystems as mjrider said in his answer

294593
filesystems	ntfs
there is a driver that will allow you to use ntfs windows primarily uses this filesystems filesystems on a mac

294609
google-chrome	firefox
also i don t want to use firefox unless i have to i have three other machines all using google-chrome and synced and i just prefer it over firefox

294633
filesystems	ntfs
just for the record i had increased the size of my ntfs partition using gparted that s why i used extend filesystems in diskpart

294637
opensuse	linux
how to access my linux machine opensuse 11.3 that is being hosted at my hoster company from my home win pc i found tightvnc but i am confused should i install it on both systems viewer and server

294667
hdd	floppy
i ve never just copied the disk image from a floppy to the first 1.44mb s worth of sectors on an hdd

294667
hdd	floppy
you need to take sector 0 from the floppy image and copy it to the hdd s sector 0

294736
disk	ram
when you tell your operating system to hibernate it stops processes saves the contents of ram to disk and then enters this mode

294747
folder	directory
i believe the folder you actually want to copy to preserve your data is in your home directory

294752

mouse	keyboard
i need to enhance the setup by connecting my second laptop such that i can control it from same keyboard mouse while i have it s display in either in the monitor or my first laptop

294795
mp3	flv
is it possible to generate an flv out of an mp3 and a jpg without uselessly looping the image and still be able to seek the audio

294797
mouse	keyboard
you could set up a kvm between your keyboard mouse and monitor and the docking station and the other laptop

294797
mouse	keyboard
this would allow you to switch the external monitor keyboard and mouse between the two devices

294803
ethernet	wireless
no the ethernet switch portion of the wireless router should be able to direct packets between the pcs without having to access the mikro tik

294881
stdout	stderr
i m redirection stderr to stdout and replacing sed error with error in bold and red color

294895
google-chrome	firefox

mouse	keyboard
first is used to switch between win and linux machine and has ps2 ports for mouse and keyboard

294951
versioning	upgrade
will i run into problems if i import a database from an older trac versioning or is the system intelligent enough to handle database upgrade itself

294955
ethernet	wireless
q#2 3 is possible with a network media player such as the popcorn hour or wdtv live and a wired or wireless ethernet connection

294969
debian-based	ubuntu	ubuntu	debian
under debian and debian-based system such as ubuntu you put your startup script called foo to the directory etc init.d then you call update-rc.d foo defaults

294997
google-chrome	firefox
i tried with the browsers - ie9 firefox 4 google-chrome

295037
switching	screens
additionally the monitor will periodically blink off for a moment trying to switching from digital to analog and back the syncmaster shows text on the screens to tell you it s trying to do this

295047
spyware	antivirus
according the author most antivirus software would not be able to detect the presence of a spyware or keylogger program unless it was a known type

295070
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
there are some apps on the mac that interfere with the network such as vmware parallels virtualbox

295088
versioning	upgrade
consult the software site for upgrade info - especially about database versioning - and see if this gives any clues

295088
versioning	upgrade
upgrade the software on the spare box to the latest versioning and see how the database fares

295088
migrate	upgrade
hopefully one way or another you ll either end up with a working upgrade install where you want it or you will have a working install that can be copied migrate

295104
spyware	mcafee
7search sued mcafee in 2008 to have it stop calling its toolbar spyware and several reports that can be found explicitly classify this as not a virus

since i m on redhat i can use either yum or rpm

295123

this sun ray client using only usb port for both mouse and keyboard

295123
mouse	keyboard
however after i plugged usb keyboard and mouse into the sun ray client it seems that the sun ray client cannot find the keyboard there is no affection when i click on keys or click on mouse buttons

295123
mouse	keyboard
in window it should take time at first to install driver for keyboard and mouse how about sun ray client

295211
cpu	processors
and it would be a little more cpu efficient but i doubt the efficiency difference will be significant unless you have a very low-power processors and i prefer the method with cat as the command flows better left-to-right

296657
tunnel	vpn
bottom line if you re already using an ssh tunnel you probably will not see a benefit to switching over to a vpn

296657
tunnel	vpn
as for security no a vpn is no more secure provided that all of your traffic including dns queries and other potential leaks are indeed going through the ssh tunnel but neither is it any less secure unless it s a really bad product but the same could be said for ssh clients and servers as well

296662

wan	lan
but it s unnecessary as you already have an internet connection and routers are meant for connecting a lan and a wan the internet

296957
ethernet	wireless
another choice is setting it up as a bridged network in my screenshot it s pointing to my ethernet but there should be an interface for your wireless wlan0 perhaps this will make your vm act as if it were a computer in your physical network and get local ip address that will allow you to browse to it from other devices in the network

google-chrome	firefox
if you are using ubuntu then you can configure the proxy settings for ubuntu not for google-chrome or firefox

298726

sample output from my system note a list of packages that aren t in the debian ubuntu repositories

298958
google-chrome	firefox
as seen above even though my default browser is set to google-chrome on 11.04 whenever i click on a link from broadcast twitter the links open up in firefox instead of google-chrome

298983
client-side	server-side
php is not a client-side system itâ s a server-side program so it doesnâ t use uri-relative paths it uses local file-system paths

298983
google-chrome	firefox
itâ s strange that google-chrome and firefox would work

299015
integer	unsigned
for example an unsigned 32-bit integer can only access 4 billion addresses meaning 4 gb of ram

299023
tiff	png
...convert xps files to pdf or postscript jpeg tiff png ...

299025
ati	nvidia
you could then get an ati or nvidia graphics card that supports 3 monitors and you would be good to go

299038
chown	chmod
the chown and chmod commands will set the required permissions for the directory

299042
fat	hfs+
mac os x only has native read write access to hfs+ and fat although 10.3 still supports hfs you should be abandoning it because 10.6 dropped write support

299055
wan	lan
my connections wan internet and lan drop randomly

299099
sunos	aix
aliases work on all unix-like environments sunos mac os x linux aix etc

299161
google-chrome	firefox
is there a read out loud text to speach plugin for firefox 4 or latest google-chrome version

299173
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
when i install upgrade versioning 2 of the rpm on top of versioning 1 or install versioning 1 of the rpm on top of versioning 2 the installation gives an exit code of 0

299212
mouse	trackpad
however as kirk pointed out in the comment below you can also hold down the trackpad mouse button to achieve the same effect

299232
kde	gnome
the kernel the x server kde gnome or some other service somewhere

299237
x86	64bit
with this i get cdcd is not recognized as an internal or external command + i did install subinacl and did use x86 as i m on a 64bit os

299296
xfce	gnome
xfce is somewhat similar to gnome and is only about 15mb

299306
pop-up	dialog
the problem is that i cannot save login details for any additional accounts the wand save password dialog never pop-up instead i m just logged in into gmail

299322
sudo	passwd
but a normal user can gain access like a root with su or sudo command and their own passwd

299324
sudo	passwd
the su and sudo command traditionally require root s passwd

299324
sudo	passwd	passwd	visudo	sudoers	visudo	sudoers	passwd
however you can setup sudo so that ordinary users can achieve root privileges with their own passwd by modifying etc sudoers as root preferably with visudo

299324
sudo	passwd
modern linux distributions preconfigure the first user to be able to sudo with her own passwd

299328
folder	directory
to use shared folder you must have the current version of vmware tools installed in the guest operating system and you must configure your virtual machine settings to specify which directory are to be shared

299336
switching	screens	screens	tablet
the screens is rotating normally when switching from tablet to laptop mode so there does not appear to be an inherent problem with rotation

299345
sudoers	passwd
it is my understanding that they do the same they ask for my passwd if i am allowed in etc sudoers and give me a login shell as root

299349
put	get
i tried and i know that i can just change passwd file and put the path i need however when i just logged in i cannot access my s drive mounted in windows cygwin s and i need to type mount -a to get it working

299349
folder	directory
so when i put user home folder to this drive cygwin s home and try to ssh it appear that cygwin can access this directory and put user home folder to tmp

299351
sudo	passwd
for the second pair the difference in behavior is this sudo su will always start the shell listed in the user s etc passwd whereas sudo -s will check the shell environmental variable first and only execute the shell in etc passwd if shell is unset

299355
folder	directory
create one folder in media or mnt or of your choice directory and then give the mount point like

299359
switching	screens
after some time when i turn on my laptop the screens is black and i can t access safe mode with f8 also i can t switching the screens with fn and f7 can somebody help me

299426
google-chrome	firefox
so why is firefox and google-chrome shying away from supporting h264 in html5 and instead developing their own inferior codecs such as vp8 and theora

299429
google-chrome	firefox
the real reason firefox google-chrome et al. want to move away is that vendors and manufacturers do have to pay royalties and again they could at any time lose access to future licensing

299429
youtube	vimeo
if h.264 becomes the de facto standard which it is becoming or has already become then large companies who build their platforms on top of encumbered technologies like h.264 youtube vimeo most flash video sites etc. are then beholden to the whims of this monopoly which google etc

299454
folder	directory
this will compress all pdf files and only pdf files in folder below the current directory

299456
hash	salt
if your password on service a differs from the password on service b by only a single character and both services are secure store salt hash for your password instead of the straight hash or the plaintext itself then it is â œcomputationally infeasibleâ to determine whether the passwords are similar let alone how similar they are

299504
readonly	temporary
this file is normally flagged as readonly so you ll need to temporary remove the readonly attribute before editing it with a plain text editor like windows notepad and don t forget to flag it as readonly again after completing your edits

299511
daemons	systemd
now whenever the bluetooth daemons exits as it s doing when your systemd sleeps systemd will automatically restart it

299537
nginx	lighttpd
if you are using lighttpd nginx or something else adjust the grep pattern

299544
x86	64bit
64bit applications go to program files 32bit apps are installed in program files x86

299554
folder	directory
home directory library folder cache files

299583
ubuntu	linux
i have never liked ubuntu s startup - and linux s in general

299589
vim	emacs
maybe editors such as vim and emacs can help you

299620
x86	64bit
and program files x86 serves as backward compatibility for 32-bit applications running on a 64bit platform

299637
bonjour	avahi
apple s mdns is not part of windows but fairly common nevertheless and available for windows bonjour and linux avahi also the only officially open protocol in this list

299642
pop-up	dialog

299667
ati	nvidia
the onboard video is ati now owned by amd and you re trying to install an nvidia card

299679
vmware	virtualbox
i installed vmware workstation 7.1.x and virtualbox 4.0.8 on two different hosts so i could compare

299679
vmware	virtualbox
the vmware guest continued to use a nat address but the virtualbox started using a nat address as well

299680
fflush	gets
the cache you are talking about is very volatile and gets fflush often almost certainly when turning network discovery on and off

299689
vmware	virtualbox
it appears that vmware uses a 192.168.0.0 24 range by default and virtualbox uses a 10.0.0.0 range

299689
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox and vmware will both now get addresses from the same place

299705
tunnel	vpn
or is the username completely meaningless and just establishes a tunnel over vpn that has nothing to do with the acls in any way

299753
vmware	virtualbox
as is well known by people that have the joy of having a firewire professional audio interface virtual machines virtualbox vmware etc. cannot access firewire devices

299755
folder	directory
is it possible to change the directory of what the menu shows because as i stated before it shows 5 more folder or even more and makes it harder to find the ones i use

299800
mouse	keyboard
found here lists of default mouse and keyboard shortcuts for noteoad++ and some plugins

299823
innodb	myisam
there are many options that control mysqldump s behavior when dumping myisam and innodb data plus accommodations for making the mysqldump s output perform binary log rotation on the master prior to dumping and preparing replication slaves to change replication coordinates master log file master log position during reload

299828
mouse	keyboard
i know that i could just open the file with my mouse but i feel like moving from keyboard to mouse breaks my focus a little bit

299850
ethernet	wireless
i want to plug in 30 usb wireless or ethernet adapters into my server and let each vm access one and only one of these devices

299923
freebsd	linux
linux freebsd and some other oses can boot fine from gpt disks on bios-based computers

299948
ssd	sata
i tried swapping out all the ram sticks i.e just installing with 1 but still no luck i since swapped out my ssd 80gb for a new sata drive but still couldn t get through installation

is there a plugin extension that is like the google-chrome process list that tells me what tab addon of firefox is using up so much cpu

300065
post	put
according to this post see last post i can put a

300074
cpu	processors
processors pentium r dual-core cpu t4300 2.10ghz 2 cpus 2.1ghz

300078
ssd	sata
bay 1 is the bay in which the stock hdd was originally placed it has a connector on the motherboard that looks like a miniaturised sata connector and comes with an adaptor dell part u589f that works with both the ssd and the hdd just fine

300090
ati	nvidia
all ati 5000 6000 series cards support bitstreaming i haven t actually checked the nvidia ones

300118
move	drag
you can drag it over to one side or the other to move it out of your way

300161
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i need to upgrade my mysql installation to versioning 5.1 from 5.0.37 and i have studied the documentation here and performed all the necessary preliminary steps but call me stupid i can t find anywhere what one actually has to do to perform the upgrade

300171
filtering	grouping
the nice part is that yahoo does spam filtering before forwarding to the grouping

300182
ubuntu	centos
just some desktop recorder for ubuntu none for fedora or centos

300233
folder	directory
lastly it could be a corrupt file in this directory windows installer folder

300261
processors	hyperthreading
with some processors you can indeed turn hyperthreading on and off it is usually in the bios

300272
cifs	smb
another option could be to rsync from the linux side - you could set up a means for the remote machine to access local files and then rsync from over there take a look at mounting smb cifs shares

300298
macports	homebrew
if you installed git using homebrew than you might adjust the macports advice a little and add this to your .bash_profile and .bashrc

300306
vim	gedit
i m not sure how gedit behaves with multiple arguments in case you don t have completely unique filenames but with vim it ll go through the files one at a time

300309
ubuntu	linux
in search of an ubuntu gnu linux equivalent of this handy hastab-tool i recently stumbled across a great hastab tool called gtkhash for ubuntu gnu linux just search for gtkhash in the ubuntu software center

300309
ubuntu	linux
i personally find gtkhash to be the best substitute for the hashtab-tool experience i had back in my windows xp days for ubuntu gnu linux

300323
mouse	keyboard
during this time all programs lock up and freeze and the mouse and keyboard are useless

300326
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu 11.04 aka natty narwhal is the 14th release of the ubuntu linux distribution

300327
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu 11.04 aka natty narwhal is the 14th release of the ubuntu linux distribution

300342
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i would recommend just setting ubuntu as your default os then using grub to boot from windows because that is what i did when i install linux mint alongside

300346
bash	zsh
if you re using a modern shell - like bash ksh93 or zsh you can take advantage of the fact that ps1 is reevaluated upon execution

300369
hash	md5
if you name all the evernote images with a hash md5 it should be easy to link up plain text files downloaded from google docs with the original image

300398
switching	screens
the --pos switching should allow you to set the position of an individual output ie monitor within the overall virtual screens

300399
ubuntu	linux
you could use compiz in ubuntu and most other linux distributions for making the windows transparent

300417
temp	tmp	disk	ram
the tmp partition will be a ram disk on linux same ramdisk on windows to map temp and other temporary locations - shutting down will clear anything in memory

300425
ssd	sata
intel 320 series 80 gb sata ii ssd

300446
mouse	keyboard
to restrict access the unit will not have a monitor keyboard or mouse

300446
mouse	keyboard
to setup and maintain the units onsite multiple locations rather than have to carry a monitor keyboard and mouse everywhere unpack and repack etc i would like to use a laptop for example for the purpose of display keyboard control of the pc unit

300474
diffmerge	winmerge
i prefer winmerge to diffmerge

300479
udp	tcp
the downside is since there is no udp connection entry of the likes tcp maintains it will really take sniffing for udp applications

300507
vim	sublimetext	vim	textmate	textmate	sublimetext
if you want a modeless gui editor you may try textmate or sublimetext editor but none will be remotely as powerful as vim

300572
gif	png
it show me all the file formats i check for the gif png and jpg extension but only gif extension mode is showing rw+ but for png and jpg its showing rw-

300598
tunnel	vpn
i am not an expert with cisco s vpn but i think what you are looking for they refer to as split tunnel

300663
udp	tcp
tcp 1433 tcp 1434 tcp 1444 udp 1434

300668
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i am aware of the duplicate how to sync bookmarks between firefox google-chrome and safari on multiple computers

300737
vmware	virtualbox
as well with vmware as said before i highly recommend virtualbox

300749
google-chrome	safari
i only tested this with safari and google-chrome but see this thread for a more complex script

300755
folder	directory
home directory library folder cache files

300755
filesystems	hfs
do you mean like journaling the hfs filesystems on the ssd

300772
put	get
not sure how technical you want to get but i just put this together

300774
hide	show
windows 7 file explorer does not show this file at all even though i have selected show hidden files folders and drives and deselected hide protected operating system files

300799
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu

300799
redhat	fedora
redhat fedora

300812
versioning	upgrade
how long will firefox 3.6 be supported for those who choose not to upgrade to versioning 4 or later

300867
cpu	processors
here are some listings by processors for many cpu s including sorting by yield

300893
mtu	pppoe
for systems that use a pppoe connection an mtu of 1492 1500 being default works better than anything else

300897
decoder	encoder
what is the difference between an audio video codec which apparently is a shorthand for encoder decoder kind of like how modem is really modulator demodulator and an audio video format

300925
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu personal package archives ppa are an easy way for developers to make their source packages available to the common user like myself through apt debian s great package manager

300935
h.264	webm
the problem is i still want native h.264 support in the browser since so many sites youtube which google runs yeah... don t provide webm html5 video

300942
jobs	cron
using it in cron jobs does not make sense

300953
width	height
width and height define the size of the hover rectangle or in other words the number of pixels that the mouse can move and still be considered as hovering in-place

300997
h.264	hevc
a codec h.264 hevc vp9 is only responsible for the video or audio part and one or more codecs can be merged into a container

300997
decoder	encoder
a codec is short for encoder decoder which basically just means the following data generated by an encoder can always be decoder by an appropriate decoder

300997
decoder	encoder
this happens to be valid for video audio but you could also think about cryptography an encoder needs an appropriate decoder to display an encrypted message

300997
decoder	encoder
often they supply a reference encoder and decoder but how an encoder is then written to match such a format completely is up to manufacturers

300997
h.265	hevc
hevc h.265

300997
h.264	hevc
this is the go-to format for h.264 video but it also wraps hevc mpeg-4 part 2 and mpeg-2

300997
ffmpeg	libavformat
ffmpeg relies on the open source libavcodec and libavformat libraries for creating codecs and containers respectively

301022
stdout	stderr
you can also have several output files for stdout and stderr

301026
folder	directory
negative current june 2015 official setup requires administrator rights even though it actually does not need one root directory outside system folder

301047
pop-up	dialog
however using this technique i was able to at least enable the screen saver settings dialog box to pop-up

301085
pull	push
after commiting to local repo you push your code to remote repo and people usually clone or pull it from there

301130
folder	directory
the root directory does contain the cygdrive folder which is the contents of the host computer

301203
mouse	keyboard
this has been happening to me several times recently just after i disconnect my mba from a usb hub for an external keyboard and mouse

301208
ftp	telnet
for example my isp seems to be blocking every port such that canyouseeme or any other system cannot connect to my system regardless of the portâ eg ftp telnet http mysql svn etc

301208
icmp	udp
canyouseeme is good for the most part but it is too limited no protocol options so i canâ t test udp or icmp therefore no ping

301227
ubuntu	linux
i m on ubuntu linux 11.04 64 bit

301277
put	get
in an effort to get my brother to play less wow and go to school i put a scheduled task on his machine which would fire every 5 minutes from 11 00pm to 8 00am and shutdown the computer

301318
debian	linux
i use it as a system drive in debian linux squeeze and in my opinion it s really fast

301359
udp	tcp
moving on i now want to access these web interfaces from outside my network as well and so i ve configured port forwarding in my ptcl modem to forward all traffic on ports between 8000 and 14000 both tcp and udp to ip 192.168.1.2 .

301386
vmware	virtualbox
i have read that virtualbox has no issues reading vmware vms including vms with snapshots

301386
vmware	virtualbox

301423
norton	mcafee
some of them like norton and mcafee i uninstalled immediately

301445
cvs	svn
all popular software i know git svn cvs ... is out of question because they save too much overhead they diff the binary files

301446
versioning	upgrade
the second will upgrade all packages on your system to the newest versioning that jaunty used before support ended you ll be asked for confirmation first

301502
filesystems	ntfs
it s used for reading and writing to ntfs filesystems

301503
filesystems	ntfs
you need a ntfs library to format ntfs filesystems in linux

301503
filesystems	ntfs
you can also mount ntfs filesystems to read write data when these libraries are installed

301631
post	get
yes if it is there it is necessary and i doubt you will even get past the post test probably will beep

301641

daemons	systemd
guest operating systemd daemons failed

301760
vmware	virtualbox
i mean is pae required in the processor to run a virtualized os x using virtualbox vmware or any other solution

301768
cpu	processors
cpu lga1155 socket for intel 2nd generation core 3 processors

301784
vim	emacs
what really compelled me to switch from vim to emacs was org-mode which allows for flexible personal organization or publishing

301784
vim	emacs
i really enjoy using vim but now currently use vimpulse mode udner emacs which is an enhancement of viper-mode to make it vim-like

301806
ubuntu	debian
shutdown -h is exactly equivalent in debian ubuntu and most other systems

301820
vmware	virtualbox
also virtualbox supports acpi 2.0 guests but vmware workstation 7.1.4 still does not if that matters

301834
vmware	virtualbox
i have used vmware vmdk files under virtualbox with great success but not for the past 18 months or so during which vb has had multiple releases

301880
sudo	passwd
obviously although this is obviously frowned upon we get tired of typing sudo before each command we type which would require that we constantly type in our wonderfully complex passwd that are mandated on us over and over again so naturally we all just execute the sudo su - command upon login to avoid all of this

301918
ssl	https
but always when i access my page through https i get a ssl error with the following message

301921
nsis	uninstaller
product code in this place is more related to install uninstaller technologies msi installshield nsis ... support

i m a ubuntu linux user lucid lynx who is running apache

301932
folder	directory
i have a collection of zip files in a folder in my home directory zip_files which i would like to be able to link to through apache such that when somebody who visits my website which i m using apache to host clicks a link to one of the zip files he can download it through the web

301940
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox and google-chrome i can easily turn off javascript and the background is always white

301976

302172
mouse	keyboard
i d need each person to be able to run an .net app or maybe a browser window with keyboard and mouse support

302172
mouse	keyboard
from what i remember windows only supports one mouse keyboard and i am sure linux is the same way

302200
daemons	systemd
most unix-like systemd have numerous logging daemons which cover specific areas and subsystems

302200
daemons	systemd
the kernel log daemons on linux is klogd and it would be where to look for systemd startup along with the more general logd daemon. all such logs are located in the var logs directory

302217
post	get
i can post details of the os chrome version and wireshark export for each if necessary but it would get pretty long

ethernet	wireless
long story short the computer was disconnected during a lightning storm but a lightning strike travelled in via the ethernet cable it was directly connected to a power brick commonly seen on those long distance isp wireless transmitters and the motherboard was shocked

302262
cpu	processors
processors thermal trip means your cpu is overheating

302283
wan	lan
the router is connected to my isp and has a wan ip and a lan ip

302284
wan	lan
q1 your wan ip is usually globally visible but there are cases where there is actually another isp formed lan between you and the internet

302284
wan	lan
nat devices like your box at home change your private lan ip adress to your public wan address but all subsequent routers don t change src ip addresses so your packet arrives at the webserver with your public wan adress in its src field

302287
udp	tcp
nat - your nat router knows how to deliver return traffic because it inspects the ip tcp udp session information such as tcp or udp port number and remaps back from the translated public address it assigned to your private address on your lan

sure using camera as sathyaâ suggested in comment which won t give you good results or on other computer using remote kvm keyboard video mouse solution

302489
ubuntu	linux
in any case i have given up on being able to use switchable graphics in ubuntu unless someone here knows a simple way to make it work so i would like to set it up to only use the integrated graphics - i pretty much only use linux for coding so the discrete graphics are overkill and make my computer run hot and battery die quickly

302531
opera	firefox
i want to use something like opera turbo on firefox

302566
hfs+	ntfs
when i set up an external hard drive for use between oses i usually format it with multiple partitions an hfs+ partition for mac-specifc use a fat32 partition for cross-platform use and if necessary an ntfs partition for windows-specific use i m primarily a mac user so i don t always need an ntfs partition

302566
hfs+	ntfs
it s a lot easier to use fat32 for cross-platform purposes than trying to get windows to read write hfs+ or trying to get mac os x to write ntfs macs have read-only support for ntfs out of the box but write support requires aftermarket software

302568
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs
i m not an hfs expert but i ve looked into ntfs and ext3 filesystems

google-chrome	firefox
is there an extension or setting for google-chrome or firefox that can disable images in a web page so that i can have a text-only view

302579
google-chrome	firefox
so far all i could find was this extension for firefox that lets you block images and this extension for google-chrome that lets you block images and other content

xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
i even once had xfce gnome and kde on there

302709
ubuntu	debian
note that in 14 years of running debian ubuntu on many dozens of machines both desktops and servers this has never happened to me

302714
daemons	launchd
yet another approach would be to write a launchd daemons that mounts the sparse disk image at boot time optionally for all users

302726
google-chrome	firefox
install firefox and google-chrome and compare results

302749
plink	prompt
c get password prompt cannot provide password like with plink i know i know use keys but this is a closed private network and its easier not to bother with keys

folder	directory
my first inclination was to place everything inside of one root folder mydadsdocs and then write a script that recursively traversed its directory subtree and set the file permissions to read-only

302897
ubuntu	linux
some of the speed you see from ubuntu linux is probably file caching

302897
disk	ram
with linux when you copy a file that is smaller than about 50 of your ram the entire file is copied into file cache and then written to disk as time permits

302925
google-chrome	firefox
i already tried ie 8 firefox 4 and the latest google-chrome which comes with its own flash plugin

302929
robocopy	xcopy
the standard copy builtin in windows isn t very good but windows comes with two advanced commands that are far more efficient xcopy and robocopy

302951
afp	smb
in contrast remote filesystem protocols like smb and afp tend to do individual reads and writes in blocks so between blocks tcp doesn t have anything to send

302955
post	get	post	put	put	get
besides the usual get post head put many http proxy servers understand an additional connect request which establishes a raw tcp connection to the remote host

302988

303011
afp	smb
i personally use smb but afp should just work

303011
afp	smb
alternatively you can use following line to use smb instead of afp

move	drag
this distinction becomes important when you want to do things like what you describe it is impossible to move windows accross desktops move as in drag whereas this is entirely possible with workspaces if you drag a window accross the edge of a page it will flip to the next page or just scroll the viewport as you describe

303370
mouse	keyboard
as i understand it it s not the mouse or keyboard that s legacy ps 2 hasn t changed usb is backwards compatible with other usb versions it s the operating system - legacy mouse mode emulates a ps 2 or at device when a usb mouse is used with a os that doesn t support it

303370

advice use the windows anytime upgrade this will convert the home to pro in minutes without re-install and will not damage the mbr be sure to record your anytime upgrade key some place safe you will need it if you ever recover the pc as this upgrade will not change the recovery partition to a pro versioning you will have to upgrade it again after recovery

google-chrome	firefox
firefox 5 is the first release as part of mozilla s new rapid release plan matching google-chrome s rapid release schedule and rapid version number increments

303531
google-chrome	firefox
my guess they re fast-tracking the version numbers of firefox to catch up with ie and google-chrome

google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari are both based on webkit under the hood but i ve seldom had problems with them on a system that wasn t broken

303651
wan	lan
regarding your second comment iptables only applies when your traffic is crossing between the wan and lan parts of your router meaning if your address is in the private range 192.168.x.x then getting that delivered to the proper host on the lan is done using the lan interfaces only whereas public addresses on packets originating in the lan are automatically dumped to the wan for delivery

ati	nvidia
you can also allegedly i run intel and nvidia mostly change the key combo from ati catalyst control center

303849
disk	ram
for your reference this is much different then changing the memory cleanup and garbage collection options as you can force firefox to use more ram and use less disk cache - which is one option i highly recommend if you use a solid state drive

303849
disk	ram
before i go into how you can do this note that if you have the choice between using a disk drive mechanical or solid state or ram for cache regardless of the application go with ram always that s what it s there for

303849
disk	ram
now to set the amount of ram firefox uses before using disk cache navigate your browser to about config

304617
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard connected via the docking station ps 2 port works fine but the mouse connected via a docking station usb port is unresponsive although the red laser light on the underside is on indicating that the mouse is receiving power from the usb port while the pc is in the bad state.

304624
16-bit	64bit
the edit.com command is a 16-bit ms-dos program and is not included with 64bit versions of windows since you cannot run 16-bit software in 64bit mode

304653
x86	64bit	ubuntu	linux
i ll add these 32 versus 64bit considerations aren t inherent to ubuntu but rather the x86 architecture and thus any os on it is subject to the same considerations - windows osx linux bsd whatever

maybe if you install python via macports it ll upgrade the system versioning

edit3 update is used to resynchronize the package index files from their sources and upgrade is used to install latest versioning

304968
udp	tcp
the two types you listed tcp and udp are enough to support 99.9 of situations that are likely to occur and as connections cost less with faster networking devices and features like selective acknowledgement the requirement for acknowledged yet connectionless protocols becomes minimal and if you truly don t want a connection broadcasting to multiple computers then acknowledgement could create a processing bottleneck coming back to you

304988
udp	tftp
tftp uses udp and relies on acknowledgements to function

304991

x86	64bit
finally you could realize that trying to randomly remove files or downplay their importance on a given system without further analysis from systemroot and programfiles and programfiles x86 on 64bit systems is a really bad idea and can only lead to undereducated users breaking their systems by trying to optimize things based on bad advice

rar	zip
i am trying to automate an archive process using automate to zip rar whatever a collection of folders files on one of my disks

305054

while gpus can have hundreds or even thousands of stream processors they each run slower than a cpu core and have fewer features even if they are turing complete and can be programmed to run any program a cpu can run

not only is there the obvious problem that someone with wireless sniffing software will still get the ssid there s also the not so obvious problem - in turning off the ssid broadcast on the router the client has to do a form of ssid broadcast instead and this happens no matter where the computer is being used - any time the computer isn t connected to a more preferred network it will be broadcasting looking for the hidden ssid

kb283165 - how to change the pppoe mtu size in windows xp

317914
mtu	icmp
unfortunately most firewalls block these path mtu discovery icmp packets so your machine never realizes the packets are being fragmented or worse dropped because they couldn t be fragmented

317914
mtu	icmp
fragmentation of packets is not allowed in ipv6 everyone is required to correctly allow icmp mtu discovery packets

technically i haven t had problems in running xe on a virtualised server though i generally use virtualbox rather than vmware

318318
post	get
if you get any error messages post them up here as they will be key to what the problem is there is one example of an error message and the fix for it on the linked kb.

318322
post	get
i accidentally pulled the power plug when my system was starting up and i started to get a boot error after post

318379
gentoo	ubuntu
install windows first then ubuntu then gentoo - ubuntu will replace the windows bootloader with its grub install and add gentoo to that rather than the standard gentoo install procedure for the bootloader

318379
gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux	ubuntu	linux
windows should generally be the first primary i install xp then 7 in the first two primaries and linux is fine on logical partitions - in this case i d probably install xp 7 and ubuntu in primaries and gentoo and storage as logical partitions on an extended partition

318380
range	max
filling your hard drive to max multiple times the arm in the drive that moves rapidly gets use to a certain range of movement when the exceed that movement the arm slows not the spinning disk

led	electronics
i ve been wanting to get this data off of these floppies for some time but feet dragging has led to the current state where powering up my two ancient mac monitors resulted in distinctive frying electronics sounds and the old laptop i have won t start

318396
filesystems	hfs
the floppies are presumably formatted as hfs the old macintosh filesystems which can be read under linux

318396

if you do the math width 0.6 x height

318551
disk	ram
ltfviewer can view text files right from the disk without loading the whole thing into ram

318585
notepad	textpad
it may be a windows thing since i m sure it just uses the default windows file open dialog but other programs textpad notepad are able to default it

318623
hex	binary
one solution is to change the program binaries doing some code changes if the code is open and you are licensed to do it and recompile it to generate a different program binary or to hack the binary changing some files with an hex editor or a already created patch

318698
ubuntu	linux	kde	kubuntu
kubuntu is an officially recognized derivative of ubuntu linux that uses kde as its desktop environment

318701
disk	ram
of course disk caching algorithms which i believe linux uses by default would keep most of the recently used world data in ram anyway but this would prevent writes to the chunks from blocking the server

318707
mouse	keyboard
this means you switch from mouse selecting to keyboard copying to mouse right-clicking to keyboard pasting and enter

318718
kde	gnome
in this respect it is intermediate between the ultra-light lxde and the full-featured gnome and kde

318726
disk	ram
windows pcs and macs have a feature hybrid sleep on windows which allows a combination of sleep and hibernate where the computer sleeps but also copies the contents of the ram to disk in case of power failure

318733
vpn	lan
i have a vpn connection through cisco anyconnect that i d like to make available to other devices on my lan

318733
vpn	lan
i wanted to have one computer on the lan that would be in charge of receiving the traffic from these vpnless devices on the lan and route it through the computer s vpn connection essentially making the vpn available to those devices

318733
vpn	lan
not all devices need to connect through the vpn so they would still connect as usual on the lan

318734
udp	tcp
smb over tcp ip udp

318741
ubuntu	debian
in debian and in ubuntu per extension as is debian based is aliased to sh

318796
disk	ram
the line initrd boot initramfs-kernel.version.img is telling grub where to find the initial ram disk to be used by the kernel when booting

318796
disk	ram
during the boot process the linux kernel mounts the initrd ram disk which contains a temporary filesystem some kernel modules and other utilities needed for the boot process

318796
disk	ram
if the the ram disk can t be mounted for some reason the result is a kernel panic

318796
disk	ram
you can check to see if the correct ram disk image was created during your upgrade by simply seeing if it exists in the boot directory

318799
cpu	hyperthreading
this is because hyperthreading is actual physical hardware on the cpu die and thus can be enabled disabled on a hardware level only

318799
affinity	processors
use the following command to launch a process with a particular processors affinity again the affinity argument was only added in windows 7

318799
affinity	processors
where should be replaced with the hexadecimal mask for the processors you want to run the processors mask is just a binary mask enabling disabling that affinity so 00000101 enables cpu0 and cpu2 and 00000010 enables only cpu1

318799
hex	binary
to calculate the hex value you can either convert the binary mask or take the sum of 2 to the power of the cores you want to run the program on starting from 0 and convert that value to hexadecimal

318833
umask	sudo
i see that now my user account creates files which reflect this new umask setting but the service accounts do not when i manually created files using their accounts sudo -u serviceaccount touch newfile

318836

i just bought a macbook pro and i am trying to install bootcamp software so that i can install and use microsoft publisher it didn t come with the windows for mac software i purchased

318914
google-chrome	firefox
this functionality annoys the hell out of me especially as i use google-chrome at home and firefox at work

318925
parallels	bootcamp
how do i create an iso file of a bootcamp partition from os x to use the iso in parallels later

318987
mouse	keyboard
keyboard mouse only on leopard now should be similar in lion

319032
bluetooth	usb
insert a bluetooth adapter into your computer s usb port

319039
ati	nvidia
if it is grayed out i read this on a forum there is no way to disable hardware acceleration with ati or nvidia s installed

319063
16-bit	64bit
64bit windows cannot run dos applications because it does not support 16-bit processes

319120
cpu	processors
having done this recently i needed to buy a new motherboard processors cpu cooler case powersupply and video card

319128
cpu	processors
this is possible given that your motherboard and processors support cpu virtualization

319128
cpu	processors
the underlying idea here is that if you have a 64-bit processors which supports virtualization it is possible since the virtual machine executes code directly on the cpu

319132
min	max
is there a tool to aggregate nmon reports of the same server over a period of days hours and get a summary of min max avg of cpu memory etc

319143
daemon	cron
programs started by the cron daemon do not have the authentication data needed to connect to your x server

319178
tunnel	vpn
so how should i set up this i guess that i should be using vpns in some way but how should i put a router there that in some way connects to the vpn does consumer routers even handle that should i set up separate vpn tunnel to each machine locally

319179
tunnel	vpn
if you want a constant vpn connection the best is to get a second router at your house and have your company have a constant vpn tunnel from your router to theirs

319195
chown	sudo
if that s the case you probably want to change the permissions on the whole tree sudo chown -r www-data www-data site-directory

319195
sudo	passwd
you ll still need to use sudo but it won t prompt you for a passwd

319223
cpu	processors
i don t know which processors drivers or windows updates control this setting but i ve seen systems with value 0 which will jump cpu frequency while executing a 100 single threaded task superpi

319245
filesystems	ntfs
it is a junction on the ntfs filesystems

319285
vmware	virtualbox
longer answer you could however attempt to virtualize a windows instance on the ubuntu machine using such things as vmware virtualbox kvm and others

319294
post	get
if things look ok physically ie heatsinks etc. then if you remove your ram and you get no post beeps telling you you have no ram your motherboard or psu is probably broken malfunctioning

319322
folder	directory
create a folder named chrome in the directory that opens

319323
ati	nvidia
my primary os is linux so i want to know whether ati or nvidia has better linux driver support

319327
ubuntu	linux
i have installed 2 linux distributions fedora 15 and ubuntu 11.04

319327
folder	directory
if i create a folder mnt files test using mkdir in this common partition from ubuntu when im on fedora and try to create a directory inside this folder say mnt files test test2 it says that i dont have the permissions

319327
chown	chmod
i have read som solutions and the most of them says that i have to change the permissions or the owning of the folders using recursively chmod or chown but the problem is that i have to do this every time that i create a new file or folder on the other distro

319331
ati	nvidia
this is from personal experience i had no trouble finding good nvidia drivers for my laptop as opposed to ati for my other laptop

319331
ati	nvidia
just googling it also generally shows more positive results for nvidia than ati

319343
hide	show
i checked folder options and it can universally hide show its folders sub-folders and some other settings but not this

319346
range	minimum
minimum current probably in the 6.0 to 8.0 amp range for the 3.3-5.0 volts and 1.0 to 2.0 for a 12 v

319349
pop-up	dialog
i never even see a pop-up or dialog that asks for permission when it comes to these automatic entries

319356
ubuntu	linux
it s just too easy especially if you re just starting to get your feet wet with linux ubuntu

319364
ati	nvidia
whereas the current nvidia driver support consumer cards back to the 6000 series the ati driver supports cards back to the 2xxx series about 3 years back

319364
ati	nvidia
on the other hand because ati provided open source support for some time in the past open source support of ati cards is much much better than nvidia especially when it comes to legacy cards

319364
ati	nvidia
if you are looking at brand new cards both ati and nvidia provide proprietary drivers that will power your cards

319364
ati	nvidia
historically nvidia has kept up linux support for their older cards much longer with ati you might be out of support 2 years down the line

319373
google-chrome	firefox
ie google-chrome and firefox are no matter what page i go to coming up blank

319399
x86	64bit
from my understanding saying that a system is 64bit means that it has a processor that recognizes and handles the x64 instruction set instead of x86 instruction set

319399
x86	64bit	cpu	processors
yes a 64bit cpu simply understands the amd64 now commonly x86-64 instruction set the ia64 instruction set is also 64bit but is for the itanium processors and is not x86 compatible without a translation layer

319399
16-bit	64bit
the core driver for 64bit computing is a larger address space though most processors don t yet implement the full 64bit wide address bus externally usually the external bus width is 48-bit though internally it s 64bit the top 16-bit are masked to 0

319399
x86	64bit
intel initially wished to abandon the x86 architecture at the transition to 64bit computing hp had developed the itanium processor which was later a collaborative effort between hp and intel

319408
folder	directory
i have noticed that hidden files do not count when i hover the mouse to see information on directory size however hidden files get counted when i click on folder s properties

319446
folder	directory
i usually press tab to select directory on windows how do i ask it not consider internal svn folder .svn

319448
folder	directory
is the first case just a specific behavior of cd which tries to go through the directory hierarchy folder by folder

319482
mouse	keyboard
if you want to use your laptop s keyboard or mouse with another computer you can use hidclient for linux

319482
hid	wii
i have also found some info about wiimote emulation at www.wiili.org which is down but can be accessed via web archive someone wrote a little program to change your computer s hid descriptor and communicate with the wii but there are no further developments

319484
multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	subtract	add
subtract 1 multiplying by 7 and add 1 will give for each row the starting daily row as a number

319485
width	height
deconstructing a little offset reference rows cols height width defines a range that starts rows down and cols across from reference whose dimensions are height rows and width columns

319485
multiplying	subtract
row with no argument returns the row number of the cell containing the function so in the case above it returns 1 in b1 2 in b2 etc so we just subtract 1 and multiplying by our desired size 7 in this case to figure out where in the list our target for summing should start

319496
macbook	bootcamp
therefore i tried installing windows on my macbook using bootcamp but unfortunately i don t have space enough on my harddrive to do so

319497
vmware	virtualbox
a simple solution is installing vmware or virtualbox on your mac and creating a new machine and putting its files on the external drive

319539
unix	aix
i need some help writing a basic unix shell script that will run on aix

319589
udp	tcp
i am trying to only allow port 22 tcp udp and port 80 tcp udp from anywhere using fedora 15 iptables and all the rest will be never accessible nor scannable from a public network

319589
udp	tcp
block all except for 22 80 tcp udp

319614
odt	opendocument
opendocument text odt is the standardized opendocument file format for word-processing documents

319615
odt	opendocument
opendocument text odt is the opendocument word-processing file format

319644
disk	ram
since your data is only a few hundred megabytes you could create the intermediate disk image in ram tmpfs to save time in any file system with free space tmp resize and then dd it to your hard disk

319650
filesystems	hfs
bear in mind the vms are represented by files on the harddrive of your mac and therefore the more important fragmentation metric would be their representation on your hfs plus filesystems

319707
versioning	upgrade
it seems apple keeps two copies of the firmware image in the flashrom a recovery image that always stays as whatever versioning shipped from the factory and the main image that you can upgrade

319718
mouse	keyboard
recently i bought a microsoft wireless keyboard mouse set

319718
mouse	keyboard
at first i figured this is due to the distance but even if i leave the extender cable laying on the floor further away than if it was plugged into the back of the case the mouse and keyboard respond perfectly

319723
mouse	keyboard
if you have a slide out shelf for the keyboard and mouse

319732
rpm	yum	redhat	fedora
there are different methods depending on the linux distribution -- on redhat fedora the the installation is done though rpm packages which then are distributed for update and installed mostly using yum -- how to create a rpm is documented here

319760
mouse	keyboard
i have issues with my bluetooth wireless mouse with my apple wired aluminum keyboard

319760
mouse	keyboard
if the machine that the mouse is connected to is on the left of the keyboard and the mouse is on the right the mouse appears laggy and jumpy on the screen

319760
mouse	keyboard
if the computer and mouse are on the same side of the keyboard i don t have an problems

319760
mouse	keyboard
or if the usb extension cable does not bother you use that to bring the receiver closer to the mouse keyboard

319762
tunnel	vpn
i d like to set up a vpn running somewhere on my home network that would enable me to securely tunnel all internet traffic through it from an untrusted network

319821
ubuntu	linux
also i kind need to be able to decrypt the file on ubuntu linux

319821
freebsd	linux
i tried enigma crypt on freebsd and then when i copy the file to linux crypt cannot decrypt it

319822
mouse	keyboard
in modern usage the terms refer to multiple users using one personal computer each with their own console consisting of a keyboard a mouse a monitor and possibly headphones

319836
tunnel	vpn
i m not sure i clearly understand your approach to securely tunnel all internet traffic through it from an untrusted network but openvpn is the de facto open source vpn server client software

319871
debian	linux	debian	mint
i wanted to install it and i started with mint linux debian just for fun i was going to partition the drive into two so i could run debian and then another distro at this time mint

319896
ubuntu	debian
i m guessing that this is a debian or ubuntu system based on the file system layout so i d say

319907
ssl	https
if you need https ssl also select secure www https 443 tcp

319932
filesystems	ntfs
linux does have some support for reading and writing ntfs filesystems but in the end the windows tools are considered definitive even for ntfs partitions being accessed under linux

319940
ubuntu	debian
i m not sure of backwards compatibility issues wrt lvm but given your description i would try a recent debian or ubuntu live-cd

319970
mouse	keyboard
note that many of the dos and ms-dos tags suffer from the same mistake ms-dos initially had only a textmode a commandline interface called command.com + norton commander for many of us and a homegrown textmode windows with frames drawn with ansi.sys but controllable not only by keyboard but by the mouse but more easily with the arrowkeys and hotkeys too

319977
width	height
you can develop a chrome extension or even a greasemonkey script that access the dom before it s being written gets a list of all images or elements and deletes the ones with height 0 and width 0

319984
width	height
you can look in the width and height attributes of all the tags in the document and check if they are 1

320001
ubuntu	debian
on debian or ubuntu you can ask your package manager about installed packages

320004
stdout	stderr
also it looks like scselect at least on snow leopard outputs the defined sets to stderr instead of stdout so you probably need to redirect stderr to stdout

320015
vmware	virtualbox
if i install vmware and virtual pc on the same host as virtualbox will it cause problems eg

320028
put	get
i have a 120gb sd hard drive that i have put into an oker portable usb enclosure it comes with two usb output presumably one is redundant just to get extra power

320041
centos	solaris	ubuntu	centos	solaris	bsd
before you can install xen you must first install an operating system such as redhat centos ubuntu bsd solaris or windows in the normal way

320061
google-chrome	firefox
is there an extension for google-chrome or firefox that allows viewing of comments only with only a certain number of votes for a post on google+

320099
mouse	keyboard
i need to control a single pc windows from two locations two monitors two keyboards two mice but while the monitors may show the same screen only one location may use keyboard and mouse

320110
notepad++	gedit
recently i often edited a txt file with notepad++ on windows xp and gedit on linux mint

320142
x86	64bit
64bit issue the bug appears both on x86 x64 versions of windows and wmp

320187
ftp	smb
gb network performance is slow with smb 45mb s compared to ftp 105 mb s

320194
google-chrome	firefox
adblock plus is available to both firefox and google-chrome which are very much recommended for security reasons too

320203
udp	tcp
you ll need to know if you want to sent tcp or udp syslog messages or both and therefore which firewall iptables ports to open etc

320221
width	height
1024x1024 is the width and height of the required crop

320234
ati	nvidia
basically i have an ati 4770 and a nvidia nvs 290 and am wondering if it is possible to run physx on the nvidia card while having the ati card still being the main card

320234
ati	nvidia
i read somewhere that the 257.15 drivers from nvidia allow you to use an ati card in the same system

320259
mouse	keyboard
across the room there is a little monitor with a more work like with it s own mouse and keyboard for well work

320260
ati	nvidia
since the release of the 186 nvidia drivers you will not be able to do this but before that you can run physx on the nvidia card while using the ati card for output

320265
opera	safari
safari opera or some other browser

320284
folder	directory
instead it now saves streaming videos to the regular browser cache folder in the user data directory localappdata google chrome user data default cache and the files can be easily copied from the os windows explorer

320297
ubuntu	linux
i had ubuntu on my hard drive and tried to install arch linux

320320
opensuse	linux
it s available in the opensuse repositories so i imagine suse linux enterprise has it too

320340
dropbox	evernote
evernote dropbox xmarks and what not

320380
appdata	uninstaller
if this does not help then try uninstaller the firefox deleting all settings under users appdata roaming mozilla firefox and then installing again

320392
bash	tcsh
greatest innovation of ps over the unix-style shells you may be familiar with tcsh bash etc. is this

320397
versioning	upgrade
if you can t print from any application or if you have tried upgrading the program to the latest versioning already i would recommend you look for a print driver upgrade just in case it is a compatibility issue

320424
debian-based	linux
damn small linux is fast light-weight and compatible with debian-based packages

320458
google-chrome	firefox
i am using windows 7 with google-chrome firefox and internet explorer 8

320461
versioning	upgrade
thus the only real patch that you can apply is an upgrade to a 64-bit versioning of your operating system

320481
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
no lxde xfce and of course no gnome and kde

320492
tunnel	lan	tunnel	vpn	vpn	lan
the vpn server dictates a compulsory tunnel then logging-on to it will cut off any other access to any external computer including the lan so no sharing is possible

320499
ubuntu	linux
for linux the same approach is described in how to boot from usb in virtualbox on ubuntu

320546
versioning	upgrade
yesterday i upgrade from bios versioning 0501 to 0606

google-chrome	firefox
i m running windows 7 ultimate 64 bit and all web pages display fine in ie9 google-chrome firefox but when i open a program which loads images from the internet
