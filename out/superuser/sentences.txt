perhaps not exactly what you had in mind but there does exist such a device - the wd dual 2.5 drive - it s a 2.5 hdd + a reasonably sized ssd inside a single 2.5 chassis - the main issue i see with alternatives is that even if you managed to get two small drives in there say two msata or similar the laptop won t have more than one sata connection there so you would also need an adapter raid device right there which would make it more complicate but guess what - those also exist- look for 2.5 to dual msata adapters they will have raid support built-in
