generally speaking i get the impression that nant offers more flexibility compared to msbuild whereas with my relatively simple needs i ve been fine with the latter so far

23203

i really like thompson s haskell the craft of functional programming because it s well written and haskell allows an easier start than other functional languages while being completely pure unlike lisp or scheme

26602

that leaves us with only one drawback of doing show hide logic in javascript - the html sent to user is bigger than necessary

27134

my concern is that a dvcs makes it easier to not share your work since you don t have the drawbacks of not sharing your work you get with svn

27443

in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end

32145

i see a lot of debate about getter setter class methods and is it better to just access simple property variables directly or should every class have explicit get set methods defined blah blah blah

38097

this is more of a how-to-implement tip but i started dabbling with creating an activerecord datamapper implementation in php and quickly ran into many hurdles with array-like access

41479

this is no better than the equivilent foreach var item in somelist .

45886

of course asp.net provides much better ways of accomplishing the same thing but it s still a bit of a loss and can make migrating an old site to .net a pain

45963

finding a package that can work with both new delete and malloc free obviously gives you more flexibility

48015

textmate is a better emacs for macs though that won t help you with solaris

49953

java has much better performance than python and has way better tool support

49953

sometimes those things matter a lot and java is the better language than python for a task

50632

otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

51512

yeah java has gotten better since 1.5 but for example you can iterate through a string in python with this same construct

54827

scala has much lighter syntax than java has a repl is statically typed and runs on the jvm - you might give that a shot as well

58771

a non-open source approach is pdf creator pilot which provides more language options including c++ c# delphi asp asp.net vb vb.net vbscript php and python

59093

i think the mxml and actionscript approach flex is designed to appeal much more to programmers where as the flash side is designed more to appeal to graphic designers

62097

you should generally know why you re optimizing code as in a specific task in your existing codebase is taking too long not i heard php is slower than python

62198

personally i feel that you can get pretty far by checking that you get the right results 1+1 should return 2 in a addition function trying out all the boundary conditions you can think of such as using two numbers of which the sum is greater than the integer max value in the add function and forcing error conditions such as network failures

64446

if you get a positive you could compare the actual data to make sure it s not a false positive - though this would be extremely rare you could go with a quicker hash algorithm like md5 or crc instead of something like sha which is slower but less likely to collide just so it s quick and then compare the actual data when you get a hit

precedence rules specify priority of operators which operators will be evaluated first multiplication has higher precedence than addition pemdas

77086

i know that serving a python base webpage via cgi is slower than php because of its long start up every time

77883

bazaar is imho easier to learn than git

78327

your second solution of using ldap for authentication and a db for authorization seems more robust as the ldap data is controlled by the user and the db would be controlled by an admin

82018

sreg is the older of the two and specifies a set of fields that can be requested and sent with authentication whereas ax allows requesting of any attribute

84438

testing the distance between rectangles is easier than testing the distance between polygons and you can immediately eliminate any polygons that are more than nearest_rect + its_diagonal away possibly you can refine that even more

84893

wcf though has much better server throughput than .net remoting

86346

my personal take is that the wcf approach is more clean as you can do contract-driven services and focus on messages not objects i m making a generalization here based on the default programming models of wcf .net remoting

a second option is to use the webclient class this provides an easier to use interface for downloading web resources but is not as flexible as httpwebrequest

however we ve now added a dynamic dispatch call where static would suffice the object is larger even in the production version and we ve added a new failure path for foo s constructor allocation can fail

99817

that is the height is more than half the width and depth -- little rule of thumb

101066

i have set up another question for any task that takes more than a minute or two and so ought to be scheduled into a deployment process

101239

row and col at first glance this seems more succinct than row_num and col_num and just as descriptive

101381

that s one reason why going from hex to binary is much easier than from decimal to binary

101969

using this trace method not only would i have to keep adding and removing keywords from in front of variables as i worked on different bugs but i don t think that it would be any real improvement over just adding good logging debugging messaging which is much easier to remove or disable when pushed to production

although several ci tools such as teamcity have better support for nunit probably would change as mstest becomes more popular

if your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors

118503

yes purely asymmetric encryption is much slower than symmetric cyphers like des or aes which is why real applications use hybrid cryptography the expensive public-key operations are performed only to encrypt and exchange an encryption key for the symmetric algorithm that is going to be used for encrypting the real message

i wasn t trying to imply that linq is better than ruby python

124612

perl is generally better than python for quick one liners especially involve text regular expressions

127922

mbunit has compatible syntax with nunit but has more features especially data driven tests

133247

how to convince people python is better than perl

134346

using a non-reversible hash such as md5 is much more secure and you can store the hashed value as clear text

135198

perl has constants multi-line anonymous functions and autovivification but python has better default object orientation

138306

even in scalar code loading 8-bit or 16-bit values is no slower than loading 32-bit since movzx movsx is no different in speed from mov

however if the distro is more than a few years old it may not exist and alternative mechanisms include browser older attempted standard gnome-open gnome kfmclient exec kde exo-open xfce or parsing mailcap yourself the text html handler will be likely be a browser

160729

what you want to do is on page load walk through the dom and for every image or alterantively pass a function an image id if it s just a single image check if which attribute of the image is greater it s height or width

163188

we could leave them out since the priority is higher for division and multiplication than of subtraction but this gives us more readable code

169083

instead of testing the width see if the height of the element is more than one line measured in ems since you ll be changing the font size around

170479

the problem is you can t really tell the user how many characters are allowed in the field because the escaped value obviously has more characters than the unescaped one

170669

apache itself can be configured to function this way although if you are on linux or unix squid is the better option as it is specifically designed to do this very job

as for the read timeout that is trickier you need it to be low so you don t exhaust your pool of workers who are waiting for the remote service to return but you also don t want it so low that it closes the connection before reading a response

172525

log4net is a richer and more flexible way of tracing or logging than the in-built trace or even asp health monitoring

in this case i would argue that using functions to perform the action and update the state is better than having a setter getter that performs an action as a side-effect of updating the property

177346

however slapping labels on methods is faster than building logic to show hide buttons or do security validation in code

i ve heard that configobj is easier to work with than configparser

191465

on my dev machine i use a quad core cpu and although our project has more than 1200 files it is still easily processor limited during compile time although a faster hard drive would still help speed things up

193887

i think the biggest difference is that ruby is much more similar to perl in terms of useage

193887

ruby got all the advantages of perl and the oop is much more similar to smalltalk than perl s oop hack

196705

anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and rails

198136

sorteddictionary tkey tvalue like sortedlist but stored as a tree of key value pairs which gives better performance in many situations

198148

in general a commit is much faster than a rollback but in the case where you have done nothing they are effectively the same

198624

because representation of a given problem with a nfa is far easier than the equivalent dfa

199481

for example checkstyle has stronger support for checking javadoc and finding magic numbers to name a couple
