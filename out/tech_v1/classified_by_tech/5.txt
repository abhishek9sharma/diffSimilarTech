also i want to add even if you find places where lisp will make sense you will probably not convince anyone else that it should be used over java c++ c# python ruby etc

5607

with identity page fill factor is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to 100 - rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one

9144

honestly i doubt that you ve got a lot of incoming developers who suck with c++ but would be awesome with python anyway

14515

we use nunitlite although i think we did have had to add some code to it in order for it to work

15712

there were some excellent suggestions already but i just wanted to mention that perl can also be called can call to c c++

15838

the practice of programming be improved using any of c s native utilities if i set the i variable to be a register variable

classes can be written in scala then extended in java for example

27622

the trace macro can be used to output diagnostic messages to the debugger when the code is compiled in debug mode

28319

output can be exported to xml postscript csv or plain text

28700

it stands as much of a chance to be installed as python or ruby

28947

when you compile without the debug flag set any call to writedebug will be removed as was assumed was happening with debug.write

29852

with that setup the svn revision number of the metarepository could possibly be used for versioning the complete system

35409

the second since it basically says that for given z and first-order property p you can construct x z p x but to generate the russell set you would need z v the class of all sets which is not a set cannot be generated from any of the given axioms

36291

if it doesn t then the property code queries the database and computes it then stores the value in the _total field so that it need not be recomputed the next time it s requested

37024

also some tools some o r mappers expect object data to be represented by properties and do not recognize public or protected member variables

you can then have ssrs export the report to about 10 different formats and send to the client including pdf excel html etc

50861

you can set __malloc_hook __free_hook and __realloc_hook to point to functions which will be called from malloc realloc and free respectively

53056

for some objects not this one a quick hashcode can be generated by tostring .gethashcode certainly not optimal but useful as people tend to return something close to the identity of the object from tostring and that is exactly what gethashcode is looking for

57528

i seem to recall reading somewhere that the command object shouldn t be used in vbscript or jscript because of security vulnerabilities but i can t seem to find that article

have used this for over a year on wordpress ip.board and mediawiki sites and have absolutely zero spam

61029

in order for the #make and #model divs to sit side by side with out the use of floats they must be displayed as inline elements so add display inline to both #make and #model note that this will lose the vertical margin on those elements so you might need to make some other changes to get the exact layout you want

61924

you can set a simple rule described in your header file that any variables to be accessed external to the class must be accessed via the property or by using custom methods on the class to affect values

basically you are enabling your .net classes to be called through com activex from your win32 code delphi or c++

77018

there is nothing useful in soap that can t be done with rest for transport and json xml or even plain text for data representation

77166

since python is far less ubiquitous than php i wouldn t be surprised if hosting developer and other maintenance costs for it long term would have it fit this scenario

78217

must be able to be accessed from any number of web applications on just about any platform windows nix php asp c# python django et cetera

79774

so for example if i have an expiry set to 08 march 2008 i want that value to be returned to any client - no matter what their timezone is

what may have confused the author of the thinkvitamin article is the fact that hitting enter in the address location bar in safari and opera results in different behavior for urls with query string in them

86325

note the abort message will be written to stderr as opposed to puts which will write to stdout

86812

for example a single abstract class that can have child nodes if no children its a leaf if no parent its a root but this can change in its lifetime

90039

although the csla framework is written in .net the overall approach can be used in any language

92135

now if you use primitive types instead like int or float and pass them as method parameters changes in object c cannot be seen by object a because object a merely passed a copy instead of a reference of its own copy of the variable

96163

it is possible for iptables i guess your suse has iptables firewall to be setup to let trough only ping icmp packets

98237

javascript prototype can be used to extend existing objects much like c# extension methods

98915

it also can be used to process documents that are generated in another language php ruby which i imagine is not practical except to help in transitioning existing applications to use jaxer

104939

deletepersoncommand will have the execute and in the execute can check attribute that will be passed by getter setter previously the call of the execute

105817

if you have solid proof using the query plan that the query can t be executed any faster than that then you should increase the timeout there s no other way to keep the connection that s the purpose of the timeout to terminate the connection if the query doesn t complete in that time frame

107691

most awk one liners can be achieved with perl one liners - if you choose to get into a perl one liner mindset

108949

and because it also detects ssl you wont have to worry about weather your resources will be sent over http or https if you ever add ssl support to your server

113879

edit i can t think of a c++ library with the type of pluggable persistence mechanism you re describing but i did something in python that could have had this type of facility added

a fully correct standard-compliant and portable solutions could be constructed using std ifstream s rdbuf into a std ostringstream and from there into a std string

116063

tex can be converted to mathml for browsers which support it thus

117370

the logging application block has a instrumentation event that can be used to trace events you can find more info on the ms enterprise library docs

119132

also a library may be compiled under x86 with 32-bit ints and you may be comparing its components on a 64-bit process would would give you a different result if you were doing this by hand

119538

the lua version posted above is faster but relies on the truncation of double to a 32-bit result therefore it requires the x87 unit to be set to double precision and cannot be adapted for double to 64-bit int conversion

122571

edit sorry i should ve specified jndi to lookup the db connection and jdbc to perform the operations

123002

now before i started using an inversion of control container i would have created a factory and maybe even a simple objectsettings object for each of the objects that requires more than 1 setting to keep the size of the constructor to the recommended less than 4 parameter size

124797

there is no advantage to be gained by switching from perl to python

124797

there is also no advantage to be gained by switching from python to perl

126056

some methods will be left private and tested implicitly as part of unit tests for the public protected methods

127017

looks like i may just be stuck with downloading editing and re-uploading the document

129369

the system.componentmodel.typedescriptor stuff can be used to add attributes to types properties and object instances and it has the limitation that you have to use it to retrieve those properties as well

130678

when decoding the letters a truncated final block can be filled out with zero letters and converted to a 47-bit base 2 representation

132295

my question is how this can be done in weblogic webspehre glassfish etc.

134149

when invoked as a constructor a new object will be created and this will be bound to that object

134374

for example when an element is appended by anything to the document i would like to be passed that element to act on it like

139218

while you might find a solution that works for strings for numerical predicates you need to also make sure they re only passing in numbers simple check is can it be parsed as int double decimal

140469

i think hudson can even be used to call ant tasks though a maven wrapper might be in order

141873

all of these operators can be applied to integer values int long possibly short and byte or char

142165

if you remove the generic constraint above where t entity you could make this a generic rules engine that could be used with any poco

144467

and use a component that has a prompt to show the prompt and enable input and a also follows the usual shell abstraction of having stdin an inputstream that reads from the prompt but can be bound to let s say files or so and stdout and possibly stderr outputstreams bound to the textarea s text

144771

and just as a complete set of tax forms includes not just the main tax form but others that may need to be filled out additional schedules for example so a package contains not just the main classes but other classes it may need to interact with

i d have to check up on how annotations work in java though but this stuff could easily be done with python annotations.

150902

how can an object be loaded via hibernate based on a field value of a member object

the reason is that the one of the other border elements with a templatebinding of borderbrush was further down in the visual tree and was capturing the mouse click that s why setting the borderbrush to null allowed the checkbox to correctly receive the mouse click

153419

asynchronous testing cairngorm events can also be done with flexunit but is not as elegant as with dpuint

156009

because of the more tedious way of adding hosts to be monitored in nagios it requires defining a host object as opposed to the previous program which only required the ip and hostname i figured it d be best to automate this and it d be a great time to learn perl because all i know at the moment is c c++ and java

156684

can be used for security - pass in some kind of value to identify the client - from their the webserver will either deny or grant access to the client dependant on some criteria - maybe a lookup list

157151

furthermore setting the icon of the form from a png is an unessecary performance hit it should have been an ico in the first place

158997

that is rather than dealing with time and frames in flash one is dealing with describing where components should be placed with mxml and how those components work with actionscript

159002

so yes everything that can be done with mxml can be done with actionscript but not the other way around

mono can be run on linux bsd unix mac os x solaris and windows operating systems

171213

if it cannot be done platform-independently linux unix is a priority for me

173276

for example if i have a single-bit field isready it may make perfect sense for this field to have a default value of false and null not be allowed but this implicitly asserts that we know that the whatever is not ready when in fact we may have no such knowledge

176110

for a more complicated answer there is such a thing as sample counting clipping detectors that require x consecutive samples to be at the max min value for them to be considered clipping where x may be as high as 7

the tools need to be accessed from windows linux various unix s vms and solaris

180528

python has for example a wonderful solution with jpype that automatizes the process although the same solution cannot be applied to c++ due to c++ and python different natures

edit olliej sigh nevermind this only works in safari and ie and i can t be bothered downloading a firefox nightly to see if it exists in trunk -

181341

http goes through a proxy -- i m not too concerned about my traffic being sniffed as it s ssh that ll be going plaintext through the tunnel -- but it s a lot more likely to be mangled than https which fundamentally cannot be proxied

181698

if you only wanted to trap selection of a single column of cells you could insert a hidden column to the right extend the selection to include the hidden cell to the right when the user clicked and this gives you an editable cell which can be trapped every time it is clicked

182008

yes lighttpd can also be used as frontend to apache and or fastcgi
