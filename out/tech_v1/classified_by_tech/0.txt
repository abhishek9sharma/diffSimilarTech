i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv

3455

another option is vmware fusion which is much better than parallels in my opinion + windows xp + sql server management studio

12140

this works better in any case much better than having all those objects need some global settings object --- that of course effectively makes unit testing impossible disadvantage can be that you sometimes need to set a dozen of properties or that you need to let those properties percolate into sub-objects

15093

if you have a sql statement like the one above that may change data in more than one row you might want to include a cursor to update all records affected by the trigger

16381

gethashcode should be a lot quicker than equals but doesn t need to be unique

18132

finally what are thoughts on using nhibernate which has been around for a long time and may be more mature than the ado.net entity framework

20752

of course shells do more than that like piping input and output but you should be able to accomplish the basics using fork execve and waitpid

23109

c# - performance wise its far better than either of the big three p s in lamp perl php and python

24035

in fact your going to get a value bigger than an integer can hold 4 billion unsigned 2 billion signed before the stack is going to over flow fibbonaci 46

24564

i have found that visualsvn is about 50 slower than running svn as a native service

25105

and of course the bsd man pages which are an excellent resource as they are maintained to a far greater extent than your average linux man-page

27443

in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end

28276

vmware is beefer and sucks more of the system s performance away by default also seems to perform somewhat better than parallels but can have serious graphical problems depending on your setup particularly if you try to use unity mode

34338

i found simpletest was even easier than phpunit to set up

36398

since hbase and hypertable are all about performance being modeled on google s bigtable they sound like they would certainly be much faster than hive at the cost of functionality and a higher learning curve they don t have joins or the sql-like syntax

42888

an xpath style api might be better than a dom api in that case - it might you decouple the nodes from the tree a bit more and treat the mutated tree more intelligently

43037

if your core requirement is a data-interchange format lighter than xml then you might want to consider using json instead of yaml

43548

+1 for visualsvn being better than ankhsvn having tried both and +1 for the fogbugz add-in

43743

i found some wild remarks that asp.net mvc is 30x faster than asp.net webforms

45499

that code sample tries to turn xmlreader style code into sax style code - if you re writing code from scratch i d just use xmlreader as it was intended - pull not push

49953

java has much better performance than python and has way better tool support

49953

sometimes those things matter a lot and java is the better language than python for a task

50595

flotr ++even prettier charts than flot +-uses prototype which i ve never worked with -no pie charts either

50909

vimeo will always have fewer users than youtube because the user experience is poor for low bitrate users

53056

if you do this just keep in mind that the hashtable s size needs to be set bigger than your dataset when you start otherwise you are going to rehash the data which will trigger reinserts and more equals evaluations though possibly more realistic

54827

scala has much lighter syntax than java has a repl is statically typed and runs on the jvm - you might give that a shot as well

55855

is there an easier way than subclassing the textbox and implementing icommandsource to hook up the textchanged event to my viewmodel class

58301

speed is usually faster than gdi and slower than directx and depends greatly on how you do things seen something to work 60 times faster after rewriting in a sensible way

61138

performance is the main downfall with python being somewhat faster than ruby as i understand it

61734

ruby will expose you to more concepts than python does due to it being more liberal in how it handles things like lambda functions code blocks eval and so on

62198

personally i feel that you can get pretty far by checking that you get the right results 1+1 should return 2 in a addition function trying out all the boundary conditions you can think of such as using two numbers of which the sum is greater than the integer max value in the add function and forcing error conditions such as network failures

67312

transcendental functions are always much more slower than addition or multiplication and a well-known bottleneck

67312

transcendental functions are always much more slower than addition or multiplication and a well-known bottleneck

67714

https traffic is much bigger than its equivalent http traffic due to encryption and certificate overhead and it also puts a bigger strain on the server encrypting and decrypting

70423

but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average

70881

precedence rules specify priority of operators which operators will be evaluated first multiplication has higher precedence than addition pemdas

74327

this is also the reason why gc can be faster than malloc free

75798

ruby has similar issues and although i do like ruby much better than i like python i get the impression that rails is roughly in the same boat at django when it comes to managing supporting the app

77086

i know that serving a python base webpage via cgi is slower than php because of its long start up every time

77328

i really do not get the appeal it s marginally better than textwrangler bbedit s free little brother but if you re spending money you may as well buy the better tool for a few dollars more

78327

your second solution of using ldap for authentication and a db for authorization seems more robust as the ldap data is controlled by the user and the db would be controlled by an admin

83952

also of note vmware forbids any type of benchmarking to be posted on the internet unless if they authorize the data you will not see any benchmarks that show vmware as slower than tech x the rumor mill states that you can see better performance with hyper-v xvm sun s enterprise version of virtualbox and xen

84408

and as for what makes python easier than java you might check out this question java - python

95373

also python and perl are older than java and c# from the days when it was illegal to export cryptographic software from the us

96689

from a practical perspective i generally consider any select that ends up taking more than 10 lines to write putting each clause condition on a separate line to be too long to easily maintain

100937

they are most probably much less mature than any common lisp or scheme implementation but there are lisp dialects for .net l# and dotlisp

101239

reads as the row num ber is less than the max imum number of col umn s

101239

at best reads as the integer loop counter for the row is less than the max imum number of col umn s

101381

that s one reason why going from hex to binary is much easier than from decimal to binary

103591

doing some tests if you connect to a database even with a slow dynamic language like perl and perform some row by row operation on a dataset the speed will still be much greater than a cursor in the database

104770

you can make more than one movieclip dragging at once using events mousedown mousemove and mouseup

109735

if you really need very quick estimation you can do work breakdown structure with every task for 1-2 days or smaller and after this estimate every task by providing min and max estimated values

115838

as a general rule png is never worse and often better than gif because of superior compression

116210

indexed png less than 256 colors is actually always smaller than gif so i use that most of the time

116461

if your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors

116461

if your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors

120530

i never found parallels to be much faster or slower than vmware - it often would be a case of the state of the vm i was running the host machine itself and the app s i was running within the vm

122033

i wasn t trying to imply that linq is better than ruby python

123076

edit double metaphone was specifically designed to be better than soundex and work in languages other than english

124612

perl is generally better than python for quick one liners especially involve text regular expressions

128221

unfortunately g++ packed the structs significantly looser than gcc which caused significant problems sharing objects between c and c++ code

130264

amazon doesn t support more than one set of credentials per account

133271

if a function is static thus not exported anyway and only called once within your code and you never use a pointer to the function chances are good that gcc will decide to inline it automatically as it will have no negative impact the binary won t get bigger by inlining it only once

137962

if my memory serves correctly the private keyword is the only way to create a privately scoped property getter or setter when its opposite has greater than private accessibility

138034

you also might want to consider opensolaris as it is from the same company which developed java in the first place and i ve heard rumours that it supports threading better than linux does and in java threads are quite important

138306

even in scalar code loading 8-bit or 16-bit values is no slower than loading 32-bit since movzx movsx is no different in speed from mov

139120

i suspect codeigniter doesn t have quite as flexible a structure it s smaller and lighter than cakephp but a quick look at the cakephp manual to see how behaviors components helpers and the vendors folder may be helpful

140359

it certainly looks nicer and has better usability than mantis or bugzilla but it s not open and it makes some tradeoffs for a simpler interface

145087

if its mainly cpu bound then i would create no more than 1 worker thread per processor core on the box

147392

emacs or vim is not significantly better than vim or emacs

149164

your web server should use compression for this extension and your code should check if the number of rows returned is greater than what excel can display in one worksheet

149445

bottom line making lots of short requests over https will be quite a bit slower than http but if you transfer a lot of data in a single request the difference will be insignificant

163280

if you have more than 6 lines wihtout a blank line then that group is probably not a cohesive thought idea operation

168371

i work in php in the lamp stack so i don t have to handle bunches of external libraries the way i probably would if i was using perl and the projects i develop on lamp are usually simpler than my windows development

169083

instead of testing the width see if the height of the element is more than one line measured in ems since you ll be changing the font size around

170948

here is a solution in scheme because i know that better than common lisp and have an interpreter for checking my work

172734

i had a nice 4 processor machine that wouldn t use more than 1.2 processors at a time

175266

in this case i would argue that using functions to perform the action and update the state is better than having a setter getter that performs an action as a side-effect of updating the property

177346

however slapping labels on methods is faster than building logic to show hide buttons or do security validation in code

178555

yes vhdl was once much more feature-rich than verilog but later revisions of the language verilog 2001 verilog 2005 systemverilog etc.. have cherry-picked most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for verilog and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience vhdl is only used here when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously

180358

i like the vcl gui stuff delphi seems more suited to windows api calls than vb6 i really like the fact that it s much better at oo than vb6 and i like the unit-testing framework that comes with the ide

192409

if you don t support this in the base class you ll run into major problems when you try to implement anything more complex than a textbox and a button

194130

it is much better than ant because for most common tasks you don t have to write a complicated build.xml maven has very good defaults and it s all convention over configuration

194306

since it will take a while to work out the nuances you ll probably be happier with a dynamic language like python or ruby than with a static language like java or c#

194596

is your own dsl and vm better than java or python

196705

anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and rails

198148

in general a commit is much faster than a rollback but in the case where you have done nothing they are effectively the same

198624

because representation of a given problem with a nfa is far easier than the equivalent dfa
