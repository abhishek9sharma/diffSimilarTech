case-statement	declare
you can t declare a variables in a case-statement like that

92434
dialog	pop-up
i m having a problem with an application hanging and giving me the default please tell microsoft about this problem pop-up instead of the unhandled exception-handling dialog in the application

92472
value	field
but when i do the same for number field with comma seperated value it comes out something like

92540
subclassing	base-class
my forms are subclassing and i have base-class code that automatically saves the form positioning and size in the registry keyed on the form name

92551
subtract	add
add and subtract intervals from timestamps

92556
perl	php
i ve been a unix-based web programmer for years perl and php

92556
perl	tcl
i could do this is perl tcl tk but i want something more native for a variety of reasons

92563
versioning	upgrade
also if your perlcritic is old you may want to upgrade it as some old versioning gave some incorrect errors in moose classes

92569
boost-test	cxxtest
i ve used homegrown solutions cxxtest which requires perl and boost-test

92573
sql-server	oracle
it has been a while since i worked with sql-server in oracle there is a call that can be made to switch the identity of the user

92585
any	set
but bear in mind that this will replace any existing styles that are set on the style attributes

92588
httpwebrequest	webclient
a second option is to use the webclient class this provides an easier to use interface for downloading web resources but is not as flexible as httpwebrequest

92633
subtraction	addition
when you only need to update simple variables 32 or 64 bit int or pointers perform simply addition or subtraction operations on them or just swap the values of two variables most platforms offer atomic operations for that further gcc offers these as well

92633
32-bit	64bit
however atomic makes sure that if one thread writes a 64bit value to a memory location for example and another thread reads from it the reading one either gets the value before the write operation or after the write operation but never a broken value in-between the write operation one where the first 32-bit are already the new the last 32-bit are still the old value

92635
linux	osx
i can t speak to mono s osx support but it is used for some pretty big projects in linux such as banshee and f-spot

92638
account	api
is there an api for opening new hosting account at other companies so it could automatically scale itself and protect itself against the insolvency of any one host

92641
defined	declare
in c without the static you would need to ensure that only one source file defined val while the other source files declare it extern

92642
perl	ruby
and python ruby perl is where the puck is going to be

92664
inlining	inline
as for inlining in this case the variables is likely inline but that s only because it s declared const

92685
bots	api
and as for the api there is not currently a general api for this aside from the creator writing some sort of bots script that could sign up for some of the current host companies .

92718
constructor	object
and the wrapper if it can even be called that is kind of weird as it uses the same class to wrap different object just uses different constructor 1

92750
mstest	nunit
so right now we use unittest++ for unmanaged c++ and i m currently deciding between mstest and nunit for the managed libraries

92754
lgpl	gpl
is that possible to switching an open source project license from gpl to lgpl v3

92765
selected	textbox
however you can get the listviewitem that is currently selected and use the visualtreehelper class to get the textbox from the listviewitem

92774
hardware	monitor
you can use performance monitor to tracking hardware and os factors - like cpu usage memory

92776
virtual-memory	paging
basically this mechanism uses the os s virtual-memory paging system to map your files and present them programmatically as byte buffering

92778
any	set
this methods only loops on search results until it loops on the first search result if any and puts a bookmark on the found lines and optionally set an indicator on the found items

92788
case-statement	declare
most of the replies so far are wrong in one respect you can declare variables after the case-statement but you can t initializer them

92798
account	api
a bank account can t exist without a legal entity to own it but that s just a detail here - other failures are that amazon might pull sc2 or raise the price or make an incompatible api change or be bribed by your rival or ordered by a court to remove your app

92802
shell	bash
i have a bash shell script in which i would like to pause execution until the user presses a key

92809
communication	messages
do you quit or close all communication have you informed people that an away messages really means you are a way or something else

92815
order	add
get the offset of the order date add the lead time then do a lookup on the calculated offset to get the end date

92840
directory	folder
and then add a folder named vb_code and another folder named cs_code in your app_code directory

92868
json	xml
the back-end doesn t matter much but i do recommend using json as your protocol of choice over xml

92959
contains	any
some user-controlss are entirely self contains for example a user-controls displaying current stock quotes does not need to interact with any other content on the page

92963
.when	ready
the im is preferable because you can choose to answer it .when you re ready - unlike the phone or face-to-face

92971
debian	linux
i guess this is a big ask for the general case so to narrow things down a bit i m most interested in gnu emacs 22 on windows and debian linux

92980
python	java
it contains concrete advices of do-s and dont-s for clean and pretty code with java python examples

92998
groovy	java
in groovy you can easily mock java interfaces using the as operator

93034
space	input
that is to say i think that determining the amount of stack space used depends on the branches taken which in turn depends on input parameters and in general requires solving the halting problem

93044
widget	button
when the signal is called i get the button widget and eventargs as a parameter

93044
widget	button
i need to determine the page number based on the button widget but mynotebook.pagenum buttonwidget always returns -1

93051
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
sharpdevelop is an open source ide something of a visual-studio clone

93074
32-bit	64bit
call iswow64process to find out if your 32-bit process is running in wow64 on a 64bit operating system

93080
mstest	nunit
accorting to kjetil klaussen this is caused by the visual-studio testrunner running mstest tests in testdriven.net makes mstest performance comparable to nunit

93094
arguments	default
how to assign a default constructor arguments value

93126
decrement	increment
for now you can use pthreads or create your own platform independent wrappers around compare and swap and or interlocked increment decrement

93134
.net	wcf
you would have a lot of options at this point for communication but .net remoting or wcf would probably be good and easy choices

93150
order	join
i don t want to specify the join order and details manually-- there are too many queries affected by this for it to be worthwhile

93150
order	join
is there a way that i can hint that a join will have a lot of rows without specifying the entire join order manually

93156
tcsh	bash
bash uses uid while tcsh uses uid and in case matters

93156
tcsh	bash
i ve also found that tcsh sets gid but i wasn t able to find a matching variable in bash

93159
attributes	properties
partial classes are an option but if the properties i want to decorate with the data-members attributes is already defined in the autogenerated designer.cs file then i can t add the same properties definition to the partial class as this means the properties will have been defined twice

93209
directory	folder
we tried deploying direct to the site using the built in deploy but that removes the entire directory deleting a whole bunch of static files we have within the iis root folder

93211
base-class	inherited
you could create a base form class with common functionality such as remembering the positioning and size and inherited from that base-class

93224
spring	jsf
in my case i have spring s messagesource integrated with jsf using messagesourcepropertyresolver

93229
primitive	int
in the same way that integer has to be immutable to behave like int strings have to behave as immutable to act like primitive

93233
superclass	subclass
subclass of the hierarchal superclass

93236
executable	upx
upx can encrypt compress mac osx executable

93252
aes	rsa
if they really need that much protection they probably should be using a more stable solution for data-access than a website a secure ssh tunnel to their server is bulletproof you can tell them they can have their 256-bit aes and 4096-bit rsa too or a vpn depending upon implementation

93313
32-bit	64bit
i m porting a c++ 32-bit application to 64bit on windows

93313
websphere	ibm
the application is a client of ibm websphere mq

93331
portable-executable	coff
ntcore is a useful site for exploring portable-executable pe files which is what coff is now called

93334
nvidia	ati
a pci nvidia geforce 5200 or ati radeon 7000 is still pretty easy to find

93341
value	field
the access value just tells it how to access the field and field.camelcase just tells it the naming strategy

93353
contains	elements
i want to make y lists each contains z elements

93353
contains	elements
the rules are that no list may contains the same elements twice and that over all the lists the number of times each elementss is used is the same or as close as possible

93361
external	host
we re testing our clickonce deployed application internally on iis internet information services but we re wondering if we can deploy it to the wider internet using apache on linux so we can make use of our existing external website host

93363
internet-explorer	firefox
safari internet-explorer and firefox all have different max lengths that it accepts

93373
duplicates	contains
if it s no longer being used and the information it contains is duplicates elsewhere in better more efficient services and how would you test for that

93415
frame	width
when maximizing an emacs frame the frame expands to fill the width of both monitors and the height of the larger monitor

93465
duplicates	elements
plus you have very little tests for duplicates elements

93482
selected	checkbox
now i would like to persist the state of these checkbox for a particular tab when another tab is selected

93489
any	set
the best you can do is compare the 2 query outputs based on a given set of inputs looking for any difference

93492
any	set
you just need to set up which bits of your news feed to scour and voila instant rss without having to touch any code.

93499
json	csv
the back end can communicate with the javascript using either simple csv json xml web service etc

93505
scheme	let
in general i tend to embed derby into even my small applications use hibernate annotations to define my model classes and let hibernate deal with caching scheme to keep everything fast

93512
global-assembly-cache	gac
assemblies can coexist in the gac global-assembly-cache even if they have the same name given that the versioning is different

93515
contains	elements
each list has the same z number of elementss so it will be impossible to make lists where z is greater than x and still fulfill the rule that no list may contains the same elements twice

93518
png	gif
the biggest advantage to doing this is that any browser which could display a png or gif would be able to display your frame

93549
global-assembly-cache	gac
if your assembly commonutils.dll is strong-named signed you can think about installing it in the gac global-assembly-cache - you can install different versionings of the same assembly side-by-side in the gac therefore the calling application automatically gets the proper versioning from there because .net types include assembly versioning information

93550
rewrite	rule
this operation is relevant in programming language theory because it allows the implementation of recursion in the form of a rewrite rule without explicit support from the language s runtime engine

93579
contains	set
a materialized view is a table on disk that contains the result set of a query

93581
security	owasp
while there are a few good commercial applications for black box testing of applications holodeck cenzic hailstorm the only open source applications that i know about only test network security spike owasp webscarab and nikto

93587
hosts-file	hosts
you can use compgen and complete to create a bash-function that reads your etc hosts for results so all you have to type then is

93589
bufferedreader	urlconnection
spawn a java.util.timertask where you will check if you have finished the process otherwise close the bufferedreader and the outputstream of the urlconnection

93590
hash	md5
q are the bytes read from disk when i create the filestream object or when the object consuming the stream in this case an md5 hash algorithm actually reads it

93598
multiplication	addition
instructions such as addition and multiplication are non-jumping

93672
switching	screens
is there a 7-zip command-line switching that prevents the filenames from echoing to the screens as they are added to the archive

93673
punctuation	tokenize
for example you could tokenize your document into a list of words by stripping out punctuation capitalization and stemming words running runs both - run to increase semantic matches

93673
python	c++
then just build a hash map such as hash_map in c++ a dictionary in python etc of each adjacent pair of words to its number of occurrences so far

93675
constructor	private
it uses asm to dynamically redefine the class bytecode so it can mock out all methods including static private constructor and static initializers

93692
javascript	dom
note just to make it clear i m not interested in dom scripting or writing javascript in a browser

93696
aes	rsa
as i said above the key bit of knowledge is that the cert doesn t matter so long as it s generated with an algorithm that supports aes 256-bit encryption rsa

93711
environment	execution
a server is a runtime environment a process of execution

93714
linux	unix
in linux and unix systems

93771
account	api
i have a program that creates a windows user account using the netuseradd api which is suggested by microsoft

93773
activerecord	datamapper
i was looking at datamapper which appeared at first glance to use the activerecord orm pattern

93790
triggers	insert
now i have a stored procedure not function which is called by a triggers on an insert

93791
cakephp	symfony
i ve been using it for over a year now and i ve very much enjoyed working with it however i notice that throughout stack overflow it doesn t seem to rate a mention when symfony or cakephp are being talked about as potential candidates for a framework

93799
selected	listbox
before i set the value the listbox s selected value might be hello and the alert box which pops up after i ve assigned this value to text is also hello

93803
sql-server	oracle
from there you can either come up with your own search algorithm for the spatial data or make use of one of a spatial databases such as microsoft sql-server postgis oracle spatial arcsde etc

93825
hide	show
use the username as a reg_dword and a value of 1 to show the user and 0 to hide

93846
perl	ruby
how can i allow others to create java .net ruby php perl web user interface components that interact with each other

93846
ruby	php
for example one web ui component written in .net selects a customer and the other web user interface components are written in java ruby or php are able to refresh showing information about the selected customer from different systems

93854
code-generation	mygeneration
i see code-generation harmfull as well but only if you use 3rd party tools like codesmith and mygeneration

93896
printf	scanf
the s behaves differently on scanf and printf

93934
communication	messages
there s no way to explicitly clear the session if you don t communication in some way between the client and the server at the point of windows closing so i would expect sending a special uri request to clear the session at the point of receiving a windows close messages

93945
contains	any
actually your problem is even worse your string contains byte sequences that do not represent characters in any character encoding

93967
sql-server	oracle
if you re feeling particularly keen you can use a recursive query oracle connect by or sql-server common table expressions to build a complete object dependency graph

93967
sql-server	oracle
note that this is sql-server specific and the question owner has since made it clear that he s using oracle

93975
linux	bsd
it runs on linux windows bsd and other platforms and you can write a python script if you want to use it with python

93988
configuration	environment
in the directory with the configuration file with variables i have a directory with a file for each environment

94024
implements	abstract
adauth.activedirectoryroleprovider does not implements inherited abstract member system.web.security.roleprovider.applicationname.get

94024
base-class	inherited
do i have to create them all in my inherited class or is there a way to tell it to just use the ones from the base-class

94025
python	c++
most python gui apis will be wrappers around the most common c c++ gui apis

94035
triggers	insert
on the slave the insert will be executed and then the triggers will be re-run on the slave

94042
sniffing	traffic
i unfortunately haven t been sniffing network traffic when this has happened to me or i would ve checked if the asp.net session cookie has stuck around or not

94053
configuration	environment
if you re not using it how are you managing environment specific configuration settings that may change for each environment

94054
configuration	environment
for highly scalability systems in production environment i would seriously recommend a scheme in which configuration files are kept in templates and as part of the build script these templates are used to render final configuration files all environment should use the same process

94069
instance-variables	subclass
the way i have implemented something like this in the past is to implement a shutdown methods in my runnable subclass which sets an instance-variables called should_shutdown to true

94070
activerecord	datamapper
datamapper is potentially more complex then activerecord but it s a lot easier to develop your domain model and database asynchronous then with activerecord

94081
environment	building
we use properties files specific to the environment and have the ant building selected the correct set when buildinging the jars wars

94099
activerecord	datamapper
activerecord is very heavy datamapper and domain object are separating those concerns out so you have a more defined set of code doing various aspects for you domain or entity objects

94100
hosts-file	hosts
hardcode thier ip-address in your hosts

94102
required	checked
required the use ofthe freedesktop shared-mime-info library but does both filename extension checked as well as magic checked.

94113
http	ssl
http ssl tls options for wget

94119
easymock	unitils
it is a bit more advanced than the code samples in fowler s article especially when you use the unitils library to wrap easymock so the syntax will be much simpler than that in the article

94125
.when	ready
.when you are ready to give up do it in c++

94141
internet-explorer	firefox
firefox and chrome will display before during and after while internet-explorer first shows during and only then does it show before and after

94148
callback	methods
then i tried a plain old parsing methods that never returns and just fires events to registered listener callback

94148
callback	methods
i ve tried both a single callback regardless of event type and a callback methods specific to each event type

94148
callback	methods
i ve tried to avoid the new event call since there can be a huge number of events and the event objects are generally short lived and having the callback methods per type with primitive property arguments

94148
callback	methods
i am not sure i like this and its really similar to the callbacks per type approach just code is inside an execute function in the type subclasses versus the callback methods per type

94154
children	nodes
the menu also needs to display all the children of the root nodes

94161
automake	gnu
i m working on a project that will be distributed with gnu autoconf automake and i have a set of bash scripting which call awk scripting

94167
configuration	environment
then any configuration element that is environment-specific gets the environment appended like so

94172
frame	width
i m not sure if there s a way to compute the max height width of a frame in the current windows environment

94184
keyboard	mouse
my biggest increase in typing when coding was to really learn my ide s keyboard shortcuts since that eliminated the relatively slow process of using the mouse

94195
easymock	jmock
easymock or jmock are definitely the winners

94195
easymock	jmock
i haven t used jmock but i know with easymock you can setup the mock object according to a testing script and it will return certain values in certain situations or points during your test

94202
constructor	object
i recommend just passing in cmanager as a parameter in your gui object constructor but don t maintain a reference to it java code here but you get the idea

94211
webserver	host
the firewalls mapped external facing addresses to the webserver so by swapping host files on your pc the same url could be used - would go to either staging or production depending on which hosts file you had swapped in

94216
internet-explorer	firefox
if your problem happens in internet-explorer but it renders the way you d expect in firefox or safari this link was extraordinarily helpful for me with a similar problem

94224
reliability	scalability
some of the key reasons to use oo are to structure code in a similar way to how we humans like to perceive and relate to things and exploit the benefits of economy maintainability reliability and scalability

94226
revision	svn
i don t want to use svn update -r 2 a.txt because this will delete all the revision after r2 namely r3 and r4

94226
revision	svn
put it another way i want to still be able to see all 4 revision by using svn log a.txt after doing the update

94286
linux	osx
anyway my criteria were 9 on ease of use 10 on maturity of documentation widgets 10 on installed base 5 on gui code generators 10 on native look and feel for both windows linux and 1 and 5 for the last two i m not big into mac osx even with a 10 here it suggests wxpython

94289
revision	svn
i don t want to use svn update -r 2 a.txt because this will delete all the revision after r2 namely r3 and r4.

94291
revision	updates
updates won t delete any revision on the server

94304
deprecated	javadoc
this used to be possible by calling thread.stop but that methods has been permanently deprecated for the following reason copy-paste from the javadoc

94351
revision	svn
the command svn up -r 4 only updates your local copy to revision 4

94419
superclass	subclass
a methods in a subclass that used to override the superclass methods will no longer do so due the changed methods signature

94442
revision	svn
after doing this update you will still be able to do svn log and see all the revision

94484
sql-server	oracle
this isn t real deep or thorough but i think that if you re using ms sql-server or oracle perhaps nigel can help with a pl-sql sample ...nigel is on to something

94507
version-control	git
it has built in milestones and releases and its subversion and git integration are pretty great we can log comments on and resolve tasks with version-control messages

94511
attributes	properties
if you used a default constructor and exposed the two custom members with getter setter properties you could get away with just setting the attributes

94526
instances	self
self most likely refers to the rokbox instances again so assuming you instantiate it with something like

94528
contains	elements
in other words may one use regex to match the tag html elements which does not contains nested tag elementss

94572
binaries	install
the live cd will make things a bit quicker by having a few precompiled binaries available but besides that you still have to choose what you want to install

94581
profiling	trace
how do you trace profiling your .net applications

94599
sqlcompare	redgate
redgate makers of sqlcompare above have many great tools

94610
callback	methods
as such it uses asynchronous callback for all the calls to the methods of the service

94610
exception-handling	try-catch
because it is an asynchronous call i can t wrap my begin call with a try-catch block and have it pick up an exception-handling that happens after the program has moved on from that point

94610
exception-handling	try-catch
because the service proxy is automatically generated i can t put a try-catch block on each and every generated function that calls endinvoke where the exception-handling actually shows up

94610
exception-handling	try-catch
i can t put the try-catch in my callback functions because the exception-handling occurs before they would get called

94625
constructor	object
exception is already serializable but you need to override the getobjectdata method to store your variables and provide a constructor which can be called when re-hydrating your object

94631
attributes	properties
i use this in combination with properties files to pull in customized attributes in my spring-based projects

94634
checkbox	textbox
the user are to respond using free form textbox checkbox or pre-defined drop downlist

94644
oracle	mysql
depending on your database you might have the option of either using a sequenser oracle or a autoincrement mysql ms sql etc

94685
lgpl	gpl
this question is a follow up on one of my other questions can i legally incorporating gpl lgpl open-sourced software in a proprietary closed-source project

94705
json	xml
in fact even when you are talking about fetching or sending data asynchronously the term ajax isn t entirely correct - it was originally coined to mean asynchronous javascript and xml but most modern implementations use json in place of xml

94705
javascript	dom
the dom is actually rather complicated in comparison to the javascript language and is likely to be the place where you have the most trouble not least because the dom provided by different browsers tends to be subtly different

94705
javascript	dom
notice i haven t mentioned ajax or any frameworks yet - you will find it much easier if you have a basic grounding in javascript and the dom before you start looking at a framework

94706
hotmail	gmail
and be sure to test this using a wide variety of email clients eg thunderbird outlook outlook express gmail yahoo msn hotmail .

94716
contains	elements
returns a jquery object that contains all the selected elements

94724
midp	cldc
midp 2.1 cldc 1.1 and jsr-75 fileconnection are available

94728
msbuild	nant
either can be integrated into your build environment if you re using msbuild or nant

94733
google-docs	spreadsheet
it requires some javascript knowledge and include google-docs integration spreadsheet integration

94744
google-chrome	firefox
if you attach scripts dynamically ie firefox and google-chrome will all download the scripts in an asynchronous manner

94744
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome will wait till all of the async requests return and then will execute the scripts in the order that they are attached in the dom but ie executes the scripts in the order that they are returned over the wire

94772
perl	awk
we use awk and perl scripts to parse the log files and create summary reports and databases technically databases in that each row corresponds to a unique event with many columns of data about that event but not stored in a traditional database format

94792
emacs	vim
please don t say use emacs as i ve already ramped up on vim and i m really enjoying it as an editor

94824
value	field
some properties are read statically at class loading time and others might cache the value in some object field

94835
pointers	stack
a function call is simply a shift of the frame pointers in memory onto stack and addition of a new frame on top of that

94835
pointers	stack
the function parameters are shifted into local registers for use and stack pointers is advanced to the new top of stack for execution of the function

94838
iteration	elements
just a note iteration over all elements in a map is o n so it would be guaranteed o n not worse to look up the way you are thinking of doing it

94850
directory	folder
so make the sub folder a virtual directory on your site and then in the properties of the virtual directory choose the option for a redirection to a url .

94862
emacs	vim
you can give emacs with vim emulation a try is not perfect but it may be somewhat familiar

94869
any	set
first the documentation flat out lies where it reads in any style command the first row index may be set to one of the special strings splitlast or splitfirst to indicate that the style should be used only for the last row of a split table or the first row of a continuation. in the current release the splitlast and splitfirst row indices break with the aforementioned typeerrors on the textcolor and background commnds

94873
function-call	inline
0 of course being what you would have gotten by not having a function-call ie inline it yourself

94876
decimal	hex
just take any decent calculator and type in 7fffffff in hex mode then switch to decimal

94894
toolbar	tabs
local bookmarks - i store bookmarks on the browser toolbar in folders so i can middle-click and open all in tabs

94896
handler	service
i check the error property of the eventargs in the service methods completed event handler

94901
firefox	opera
firefox 3 and opera 9.5 do

94908
ip-address	proxy
the only real way to it is with a reverse proxy or a webserver acting as a reverse proxy between you and the outside world that knows what ip-address each folder is in

94910
type-safety	generics
going forward you should still consider using generics due to the compile-time type-safety

94950
type-safety	generics
generics whether java or .net should be used for design and type-safety not for performance

94961
.when	ready
there will be some degree of refactoring to attach to the real object .when you are ready but that is why your developers should at least know enough xaml to know how to modify the bindings properly

94974
safari	opera
but it tries as best it can to put a firebug console in ie safari and opera

94975
dijkstra	a-star
i ve read in one of my ai books that popular algorithms a-star dijkstra for path-finding in simulation or games is also used to solve the well-known 15-puzzle

94979
contains	lookup
add a member variables to the object that contains the current key allowing o 1 lookup

95001
double	int
since an int uses 31 bits + 1 bit for the sign just double 2 30 to get approximately 2 billion

95001
double	int
for an unsigned int using 32-bit double again for 4 billion

95030
exception-handling	try-catch
but try-catch is an exception-handling no pun intended

95033
hide	show
my understanding is that this simple jquery plugins just show and hide content

95033
thickbox	jquery
i had the exact same problem with the jquery thickbox plugin that the item marked as hidden the dialog box will always show up in my mvc view page

95033
hide	show
i can understand some of the mvc+jquery+json articles but i don t understand why the hide show doesn t work

95046
joomla	drupal
under the hood joomla runs on mostly an oo architecture whereas drupal is almost entirely procedural with oo paradigms

95046
joomla	drupal
joomla has no form builder that i am aware of so you are forced to hand-code entire blocks of html for the form whereas with drupal you create forms as structured arrays

95046
joomla	drupal
in general joomla s admin gui is considered prettier and more user-friendly than drupal s but joomla is in my opinion a less intuitive system at the programming level and makes certain tasks more difficult than necessary

95046
joomla	drupal
2 areas where drupal truly outshines joomla in my opinion is in the ability to create various content types - with various fields - on the fly to easily segment data and the ability to create pretty seo-friendly urls with path or even better with pathauto

95046
joomla	drupal
bottom line joomla tends to look pretty from an administration perspective but drupal tends to outperform joomla and be a more easily customizable system to achieve many of the things you really want out of a cms

95083
newlib	glib
pspsdk uses newlib which lacks some of glib s features and headers

95106
put	get
it would be great if i could just hit a for example and instantly get put into insert mode at the end beginning of the argument list

95114
groovy	java
groovy is extremely useful for quick reference within a java context.

95121
64bit	x86
x86 is considerably slower a few clocks plus a clock or so per function argument while 64bit is much less because most function arguments are passed in registers instead of on the stack

95199
value	field
another advantage of it over hidden field is that it is harder for users to hack into it and alter your value i believe in fact that you can encrypt your viewstate

95208
value	field
keep in mind that when you deserialize an object with a transient field that field s value will always be it s default usually null.

95210
tcp-ip	udp
udp and tcp-ip

95218
triggers	insert
the triggers causes insert to fail

95242
persistent	transient
you can start by looking into the transient keyword which marks fields as not part of the persistent state of an object

95286
any	set
i have the following configuration but i have not able to find any documentation on how to set a maximum backup files on date rolling style

95297
python	ruby
others such as python and ruby make you download third-party modules to do strong encryption

95317
put	get
you ll have to put up with remembering to get it right

95339
contains	any
this file also contains a startup target which sets up some runtime settings like assembly version information and any dependent paths

95373
python	java
also python and perl are older than java and c# from the days when it was illegal to export cryptographic software from the us

95442
http	ssl
i m used to using fiddler to sniff transactions between http clients and servers and it works great as long as you re using plain text or xml http requests and responses including those over ssl but it isn t much help for binary protocols like amf over http

95443
controller	routes
the problem is that i need to modify the path to an absolute path to the view page because the relative path doesn t work with the asp.net-mvc routes controller action id

95522
superclass	inherited
you could make an annotations enforceauthor with inherited on the superclass and use compiler annotationss since java 1.6 to catch up at compile time

95604
contains	elements
alternativly localtime and gmtime will convert an epoch into an arrays contains day month and year and timelocal and timegm from the time local module will do the opposite converting an arrays of time elements seconds minutes ... days months etc. into an epoch

95620
exception-handling	try-catch
if that s the only thing it does i think is better to remove the try-catch s from those classes and let the exception-handling be raised to the class that is responsible on handling them

95722
exception-handling	try-catch
with wcf you can intercept and log an exception-handling using an ierrorhandler attached to your channeldispatcher another subject entirely - so you don t need the try-catch throw pattern

95729
.when	ready
if you classify threads along the lines of these threads fill the audio buffering these threads make my app responsive to systemd events these threads make my app responsive to the user these threads are getting on with some business and will report .when they re good and ready then the threads ought to be prioritised accordingly

95743
constructor	object
within the java language the only way to create an object is by calling its constructor be it explicitly or implicitly

95787
interpreter	runtime
a just-in-time jit compiler is a feature of the runtime interpreter that instead of interpreting bytecode every time a methods is invoked will compile the bytecode into the machine code instructions of the running machine and then invoke this object code instead

95800
sftp	ssh
what would be the easiest way to access a file or maybe create a remote project trough ftp and maybe ssh and sftp

95809
triggers	insert
one piece of evidence that would be in favor does insert use a stack style scope nested triggers have their own inserts

95821
eruby	erb
i see that it supposedly beats erb and eruby now.

95824
comma	words
so i could call the command with replace file replace file new replace file options user etc. wrap the words with bold formatting and replace any comma with the right arrow command

95833
value	field
form methods state is again similar -- it s useful for hiding field that tie a given form to some bit of data on the back end this user is editing record #512 so the form will contains a hidden input with the value 512

95858
document	element
but is there a better way to get the id of the element and set the src or data parameter for the object embed and have it instantly load up a new document

95880
value	field
value in the query string or form field can be trivially changed by the user

95880
value	field
keeping track of value passed in a form as a user completes a process like a site sign-up well that can probably be kept in hidden form field

95896
compile-time-constant	constants
unfortunately the above does not provide a compile time answer even if the compiler does inline optimize it to be a constants under the hood so cannot be used as a compile-time-constants expression

95910
attributes	properties
i have done this with properties where i have looked for an attributes but never a private member field

95927
pointers	stack
it is a very fast operation to create these variables simply increment stack pointers by the size

95937
instances	private
yes however you will need to set your binding flags to search for private fields if your looking for the member outside of the class instances

95944
sftp	ssh
i believe you re talking about ftp with ssl when you say sftp and not the sftp protocol that goes along with ssh

95944
sftp	ssh
use sftp the ssh version as it doesn t require an encrypted control channel and will work fine over nat

95950
32-bit	64bit
my desktop is 32-bit xp the oracle installation on the server is also 64bit

95955
any	set
i think the best you can do is set a threshold for visiting a page. have an automated task run every 60 120 300 or some number of seconds that clears out any entry that is older than a specified amount of time

95956
command-prompt	cmd
if i use them to iterate through the folder c windows system32 drivers they only find a handful of files although there are 185 when i issue a dir cmd in a cmd-prompt

95978
sftp	ftp
yah i meant ssl ftp not sftp

95992
return-type	arguments
one can think of delegates as an interface for a methods which defines what arguments and return-type a methods must have to fit the delegate

96020
private-members	instances
one thing that you need to be aware of when reflecting on private-members is that if your application is running in medium trust as for instances when you are running on a shared hosting environment it won t find them -- the bindingflags.nonpublic option will simply be ignored

96021
triggers	insert
if you always want this behavior you could put an after insert triggers on tablea that will update table b

96028
ref	out
.net has out and ref parameters

96028
constructor	object
there are other language differences but most of them are not expressed at the byte code level for example if memory serves java s non- static inner classes which do not exist in .net are not a bytecode feature the compiler generates an additional argument to the inner class s constructor and passes the outer object

96041
swing	swt
some ui frameworks are layers over swing or swt for example a framework could read a description of a screen in xml and instantiate the corresponding swing components

96042
delphi	vb6
i m working on the creation of an activex exe using vb6 and the only example i got is all written in delphi

96048
order	add
this is possible because since it s an identity it will just increment as you add items which will be in the order that you are selected them

96055
associations	model
using an associations model might solve your issue

96109
subclassing	superclass
for a methods name you get the hierarchy showing superclass and subclassing with implementation of that methods distinguished from abstract mentions or classes that don t mention the methods

96133
solaris	aix
i have uncovered another problem in the effort that we are making to port several hundreds of ksh scripts from aix solaris and hpux to linux

96150
directory	folder
i believe that there is some kind of permissions issue but can t seem to find any difference between the permissions on the noted folders and the folder directory where the excel file is uploaded

96153
textbox	button
this fills the userid and password textbox fine but i am not having any success getting that darned button to click

96155
32-bit	64bit
if you are writing a 32-bit application to list all the files in a directory and the application may be run on a 64bit computer you should call the wow64disablewow64fsredirectionfunction before calling findfirstfile and call wow64revertwow64fsredirection after the last call to findnextfile

96157
attributes	properties
set the existing totallogins properties as either private or protected and remove the readonly attributes

96163
packets	ping
it is possible for iptables i guess your suse has iptables firewall to be setup to let trough only ping icmp packets

96179
32-bit	64bit
when a 32-bit application reads from one of these folders on a 64bit os

96201
windows-vista	windows
if you are building on top of windows server 2003 r2 windows-vista or windows server 2008 and doing internal network transfers another option is to leverage the new remote differential compression feature

96213
joomla	drupal
moving to a content manager like drupal joomla wordpress or the like will be much easier if you re already organized with semantic markup too

96217
exception-handling	try-catch
this reserves the try-catch for exception-handling that you want to recover from

96217
exception-handling	try-catch
to deal with unexpected or unrecoverable exception-handling you may want a try-catch near the outermost layer of the program to log diagnostic information

96220
contains	any
any files that are dependent on a particular module will be rebuilt any time the module class structure contains in the .h file is modified

96245
json	xml
parsererror - when an xml json response is

96257
32-bit	64bit
for example if you want your 64bit and 32-bit builds to use different icons you could include the appropriate resource file for each build as follows

96313
directory	folder
i ve got a couple large checkouts where the .svn folder has become damaged so i m getting and error cleanup failed to process the following path.. and i can no longer commit or update files in that directory

96316
python	c++
for example when wrapping c++ code to be used with other interfaces .net com python etc... i need to catch different types of exceptions

96340
configuration	environment
we would also like to have separate configurations for each environment so when deploying you don t have to manually change certain configuration values that are environment specific such as conenction strings but at the same time don t want to maintain multiple large configuration files one for each environment as keeping this in sync when adding new configuration keys will prove troublesome

96372
directory	folder
if you know which folder has the damaged .svn directory you can just delete that one directory and run an svn update again

96372
directory	folder
of course if the folder with the damaged .svn directory is the one containing a gigabyte then you re back where you started

96376
command-line	cmd
it is a cmd-line directory replication cmd

96376
windows-vista	windows
it was available as part of the windows resource kit and is introduced as a standard feature of windows-vista and windows server 2008

96395
constructor	object
from an api user perspective another alternative to constructors are static factory methods like biginteger.valueof though for the api author and technically for real the object are still created using a constructor

96401
persistent	transient
you can tie the cart to some form of credentials rather than a transient session and persistent the cart long after the user has cleared their cookies

96419
getter	setter
other times you need to generate code using the # and ## concatenation operators like generating getter and setter for a property this is for quite a limited cases through

96429
scp	ssh
setting up password-less publickey authentication with ssh would allow you to scp your files to any of your servers very quickly or be automated by a shell script

96432
order	add
however you will have to add back the namespace in order for it to work

96454
configuration-files	app-config
you can split app-config into multiple configuration-files

96462
ssl-certificate	ssl
if you can t see anything that isn t using ssl then this is usually down to a broken ssl-certificate somewhere

96466
configuration	environment
during a build we generate all the configuration for the different environment by just looping through each environment in a nant script changing the value of the nant properties dbconnstring and webserviceuri for each environment in fact these are all set in a single file with sections for each environment and doing a nant copy with the option to expand properties turned on

96472
profiling	trace
you can use the profiling tool to trace all existing and opening and closing connections

96481
32-bit	64bit
to get a number from 0..n-1 you multiply the full value by n 32-bit by 32-bit giving 64bit and use the high 32-bit

96486
firefox	safari
ie firefox opera safari compatible

96490
vbscript	jscript
any comparison to jscript vbscript or dynamic typing is total bunk

96528
svg	vml
raphael is pretty cool for that and works across browsers since it uses vml for msie and svg for everything else

96531
spring	grails
i think grails and groovy hold promise but the user experience of working with them is cumbersome at present present being last spring

96569
vmware	esx
we use vmware esx 3.5.x exclusively

96574
svg	vml
however native vml can do text on a path and such things much like svg

96574
svg	vml
i think theoretically if you want complex text handling you d want svg and vml like the raphael library that dan mentioned

96576
debian	rpm
if you re running on redhat or debian consider packaging up your code into rpm s or debs

96595
pascal	basic
if you are really and truly stuck understanding pointers in c then your best option might be to obtain a copy a a pascal compiler and try writing some basic pointer code in it pascal is near enough to c you ll get the basic in a few hours

96628
value	field
i m assuming you mean by turned off that a field doesn t have a value

96630
constructor	object
the resize effectively calls the default constructor of the object inside the vector but if the default constructor does nothing then nothing is initialized.

96665
copy-constructor	temporary
but if the copy-constructor is user supplied then i don t see how the compiler can optimize out the temporary variables

96676
code-coverage	jscoverage
i am also going to use jscoverage to get code-coverage analysis of the tests

96682
fontfamily	font-size
if you are defining your own context menu via a contextmenu in wpf use the various fontxxx properties such as fontfamily and font-size

96686
privileges	sid
you should regenerate the sid whenever a users privileges changes though

96690
xtend	xpand
but despise those limitations the generation itself is quite easy with oaw you can navigate your models like a charm in xtend and xpand and by combining several workflows into bigger workflows you can also do very complex things

96722
expression	evaluation
| does not do short-circuit evaluation in boolean expression

96743
code-coverage	jscoverage
i am also going to use jscoverage to get code-coverage analysis of the tests

96750
compact-framework	.net
i ve installed the latest version 3.5 of the microsoft.net compact-framework but whenever i run the apps i get an error message which states this application application name requires a newer version of the microsoft .net compact-framework than the version installed on this device.

96750
compact-framework	.net
given i ve supposedly successfully installed the latest version this doesn t make sense leading me to believe i need to remove the .net compact-framework and start again

96835
safari	opera
then move on to the other standards-based browsers namely safari and opera

96837
dialog	pop-up
it uses a custom control that simply adds code before and after the content to format it as a pop-up dialog

96837
hide	show
the yes button is a hyperlink because it executes javascript to hide the dialog and show a different one

96837
linkbutton	onclick
i do not have an onclick event registered with the linkbutton because i simply check if ispostback is true

96850
midl	idl
we work with several separate idl files hand-build for different parts of our framework making use of the #include construct to include them into the idl of the actual application then generate the single tlb using midl and tlibimp it

96856
copy-constructor	constructor
to get this to 0 cost you need to write your own default constructor and your own copy-constructor as empty functions

96864
copy-constructor	constructor
this way the default constructor is not called for each element but rather the copy-constructor

96873
put	get
9 25 08 edit -- i just put up a blog posting on how to patch monodevelop 1.0 and get it working with astyle

96875
difference	count
what are the difference between the front end calling ejbs using toplink vs adf business components through rmi in terms of scalability as the migration from struts to adf will also encompass pl sql and oracle forms thus increasing the user count drastically

96877
comma	words
your problem is that is a magic comma that automatically quotes the words in front of it

96877
punctuation	words
or you can add various punctuation so that you no longer have a simple words in front of the

96924
git-rebase	git-merge
git git-rebase is only a rough equivalent to git-merge

96935
python	java
in addition you can use existing python libraries in a java application

96950
value	field
well you can return non-null value by passing as the parameter for field you don t wish to use in the current filtering

96952
value	field
field with value 00345abc would need to return 345abc

96982
freebsd	debian
runs on centos although debian fedora core freebsd are options if necessary

97025
revision	svn
you can put the original dmg dmg templates even under version-control svn so if you ever accidentally change destroy it you can just go back to a revision where it was still okay

97069
python	java
thus it is sometimes easier to write the code in python and integrate it via jython that to attempt to write the code in java

97096
grouping	sorting
without experiencing any speed penalties as the sorting will be performed on the grouping field anyway

97114
constructor	object
however we ve now added a dynamic dispatch call where static would suffice the object is larger even in the production version and we ve added a new failure path for foo s constructor allocation can fail

97142
ubuntu	debian
others on debian or ubuntu seem to be able to get rid of this by installing libopenssl-ruby which is not available for redhat

97187
shell	bash
when a login shell exits bash reads

97187
shell	bash
a login shell is started bash reads

97197
having	select
select n+1 is generally stated as a problem in object-relational mapping orm discussions and i understand that it has something do to with having to make a lot of database queries for something that seems simple in the object world

97224
shell	bash
when using bash the first of .bash_profile .bash_login and .profile will be run for an interactive login shell

97224
shell	bash
i believe .profile is generally run by unix shell besides bash

97224
shell	bash
bash will run .bashrc for a non-login interactive shell

97253
persistence	hibernate
reference java persistence with hibernate chapter 13

97259
vmware	esx
vmware s esx has a similar tool i believe its called esxtop

97260
nagios	munin
try nagios or munin

97276
linux	unix
if i ve got a time_t value from gettimeofday or compatible in a unix environment linux bsd is there a compact algorithm available that would be able to tell me the corresponding week number within the month

97276
contains	any
however if we re counting the number of mondays that have occurred so far then we want to count the number of integral weeks including today then consider if the fractional week left over also contains any mondays

97277
ip-address	hostname
some spam filtering unfortunately also reject mail from hostname containing strings that imply they are in dynamic address pools dynamic dsl or a dash-separated ip-address as is common with many isps

97299
execution	exit
somehow and i m not familiar with the specifics of how .bat files exit but either jsmin or the batch file execution is exiting with a non-zero return code

97348
triggers	insert
first avoid cursors at all costs especially in insert deletes updates or triggers

97350
where-clause	sql
on the other hand if you re doing something in code just write the sql on the fly and use the literal value of the form control for constructing your where-clause

97359
python	java
if i had to parse some file i d choose python over java in a blink

97373
getter	setter
both languages provide it but c# properties provides a better design for it in regards to setter and getter

97375
continuous-integration	code-coverage
a continuous-integration with a high code-coverage is better

97401
arrays	loops
if you are just doing a straight loops through your collection you won t see much difference between storing it as an arrays or as a linked list

97401
linked-list	arrays
someone with more knowledge of the underlying arrays vs linked-list implementation and how it ends up looking in the byte code could probably tell you whether appending to a linked-list with a tail pointer or inserting into an arrays is faster my guess would be the arrays

97414
linux	unix
i know you asked for windows but thought i d add this anyway in unix linux you could do

97431
google-chrome	safari
so you should be asking for webkit rendering engine google-chrome use developed by safari s guys control

97435
comma	words
any amount of white spaces on either side of a comma or the words and should be considered part of the delimiter.

97435
comma	words
dan s answer was the most robust it even handles white sand tall waves and warm sun and reasonably with that odd comma placement after the words waves so i ve marked his as the accepted answer

97440
getter	setter
instead consider creating an class that has public setter and getter that populate a hash visible only to the object

97445
deployment	install
a deployment project from visual-studio allows you to install a sql-server express instance with ease

97459
selected	textbox
clicking in the textbox should selected all the text if the textbox wasn t previously focused

97459
selected	textbox
mouse down and drag in the textbox should selected only the text i ve highlighted with the mouse

97459
selected	textbox
if the textbox is already focused clicking does not selected all text

97459
selected	textbox
focusing the textbox programmatically or via keyboard tabbing should selected all text

97459
click	mouse
calling .selectedall during the click event won t work because the user won t be able to selected any text with the mouse

97466
groovy	java
if working with java jython is an option for this groovy is another

97476
.when	ready
.when the feature is ready to be brought into main review the combined changes

97510
sqlplus	prompt
for querying the db directly such as at a sqlplus prompt or through a db administration tool selected is generally fine--it saves you the trouble of writing out all the columns

97513
restart	reload
i would like to use komodo as my python editor but i haven t found a replacement for pywin s ability to restart the shell and reload the current module

97515
highlight	selected
this selected all the text on entry but allowed me to highlight part of the text afterwards or allow you to highlight on the first click

97528
httphandler	httpmodule
i do not have access to iis 6.0 so i cannot map requests to asp.net and handle with a httphandler httpmodule

97536
copy-constructor	constructor
std vector must initialize the values in the arrays somehow which means some constructor or copy-constructor must be called

97540
python	java
jython allows you to use the java robustness and when needed the python clarity

97578
contains	any
my problem is that the item name can contains any character including single and double quotes

97586
look-and-feel	swt
can anyone provide an example of an swt application still being able to edit the gui in eclipse but having the aerith look-and-feel

97595
web-config	app-config
the linq designer ads the connection string to the app-config of the class library but the web site needed to see it in the web-config of the web project

97623
constructor	private
represents whatever parameters you need to create the end iterator which might use a private constructor

97630
getter	setter
assuming you want to serialization the state of the non-serializable field in myclass2 that field must be accessible to myclass either directly or through getter and setter

97630
implements	extends
per item 74 of effective-java myclass2 must have a no-arg constructor accessible to myclass otherwise it is impossible for myclass to extends myclass2 and implements serialization

97642
implements	abstract
it s not the same as not adding these properties but the last time i saw this the engineer addressed it by implementing concrete nhibernate classes and deriving them from a common abstract base-class myauditable that implements the properties you dislike

97666
user-permissions	account
i thought maybe i needed to set user-permissions in the visual-studio remote-debugging monitor but my admin account was already there

97708
python	php
as i didn t want to install python just to run this script i ported it to php

97742
wxwidgets	mfc
wxwidgets has all the mfc has in early wx versions a lot of classes were clones of mfc classes and a lot more

97757
web-services	security
naturally you can also change the security for the wcf windows service to allow access remotely with a password if you want to allow multiple web-services to use the same service host for the purpose of improved resource usage

97762
click	mouse
what is the best way to find the contains rectangle for a mouse click

97778
python	java
the good deployment issue -- for python -- doesn t have the deep significance that it has for java

97788
32-bit	16-bit
to boil down your problem you want to be able to have a class that has a ushort pixels field 16-bit per pixel sometimes and a uint32 pixels field 32-bit per pixel some other times

97788
32-bit	16-bit
you could create replacements for ushort uint32 by making a pixel class with 32-bit and 16-bit sub-classes overriding various operators up the wazoo but this incurs a lot of overhead is tricky to get right and even trickier to determine if its right

97788
32-bit	16-bit
the downside there is that you would likely end up with a lot of special case code in the imagedata class which executed one way or the other depending on some 16-bit 32-bit mode flag

97788
32-bit	16-bit
the better solution i think would be to sub-class imagedata into 16-bit and 32-bit classes and use a factory methods to create instances

97788
subclassing	base-class
imagedata is the base-class imagedata16bpp and imagedata32bpp are subclassing static methods imagedata.create string imagefilename is the factory methods which creates either imagedata16bpp or imagedata32bpp depending on the header data

97790
sql-server	firebird
however if you need to ever do anything with data which is beyond simple read write then go with firebird as it is a full sql-server with all the enterprise features like triggers views stored procedures temporary tables etc

97804
double-quotes	single-quotes
in javascript you can encode single-quotes as x27 and double-quotes as x22

97830
.net	wcf
i m working on a project using windows 2008 .net 3.5 and wcf for some internal services and the question of how to host the services has arisen

97850
put	get
i have a 2gb drive to put this on but i can get a bigger one if necessary

97885
bazaar	git
the best answer for you is some sort of dvcs popular ones being git mercurial darcs bazaar ...

97885
compatibility	platform
i haven t used these systems personally so others will be best at recommending a dvcs with a small footprint and good cross platform compatibility

97890
show	next
show some kind of message right next to the field and updates it as he types

97917
curly-braces	macros
was a macros expansion but that s a problem w macross not curly-braces w ifs.

97922
push	pull
once you set this up you can use git pull to fetch the changes only you don t need to clone anymore just the first time and git push to push the changes the other way

97934
web-applications	enterprise
in most enterprise web-applications you ll need a servlet container and most of the stress in a web application will be at the tier that handles httprequests or database access

97937
subtract	add
convert your system.drawing.color to an hslcolor add subtract values against the luminosity and convert back to system.drawing.color for use in your app

97944
rollback	commit
if you are then you want to create a savepoint and at the end you can just pass through the end of the function believing a commit or rollback will happen later or else rollback to your savepoint

97979
terracotta	jgroups
jgroups treecache from jboss support this so does ehcache i think and i know it definitely works if you use ehcache with terracotta which is a very slick integration

97983
forwarding	port
i would like to put another server that would listen to an http port accessible from outside and forwarding the requests to that httpserver and send back the response via http

97994
emacs	vim
an editor like emacs or vim can really focus on being a good editor first and foremost

98016
ftp	ssh
unless someone gains access to your server via ftp or ssh in which case you re already buggered i wouldn t worry about storing passwords in plaintext in php files

98032
solaris	linux
you can consult their source code to see how this is accomplished on linux solaris windows and mac platforms

98044
webmethods	websphere
would it be using a websphere adaptor for sap or webmethods or something else

98048
put	get
obfuscate the password even rot13 will do it won t put up much defense if some does get access to the file but at least it will prevent casual viewing of it

98058
contains	sorted
has_header is set to true if the first row contains header values that you don t want sorted

98074
contains	elements
the strange thing is that if i pass false indicating invalid certificates are acceptable the collection contains one elements mdash

98116
python	java
you can also port the python implementation to java -- i doubt it s very complex

98127
internet-explorer	opera
on every browser firefox opera camino safari etc... except for internet-explorer i can access my own cookie

98134
command-line	cmd
i know windows has the runas cmd but this won t work for an automated script as there is no way to enter the password via the cmd-line

98151
getter	setter
there s also a nice bag of tricks directly available in the menus like generating getter setter extracting interfaces and the like

98159
web-applications	security
web-applications designed for use inside a corporate firewall are often fairly lax about security

98162
compatibility	deprecated
there are potential compatibility issues now that getyear has been deprecated in favour of getfullyear - from quirks-mode

98162
internet-explorer	firefox
there are also implementation differences between internet-explorer and firefox as ie s implementation of getyear was changed to behave like getfullyear - from ibm

98163
administration	account
i need to be able to install things without booting into the administration account

98174
webserver	host
both webserver serve website using apache and one of them has an additional virtual host that serves simple html maintenance page

98224
command-prompt	cmd
minimal you will get information similar to dir s cmd in windows cmd-prompt

98225
emacs	vim
addendum the main reason i don t just use vim is that i love how emacs lets you open a file in two different frames added sorry this was confusing i mean separate windows which emacs calls frames

98230
jquery	dojo
jquery prototype ext javascript dojo mootools yui mochikit the list goes on

98234
linux	unix
sadly this was written for unix linux users

98234
binaries	install
personally i would install cygwin just to get linux binaries of lftp rsync to work on windows as there appears not to be anything that competes with it

98237
methods	extend
javascript prototype can be used to extend existing objects much like c# extension methods

98238
configuration-management	puppet
it did cause some challenges for software install from non-red hat or centos packages but we managed to get around that with the configuration-management tool puppet

98244
getter	setter
i m fairly surprised at how unanimous the sentiment is that getter and setter are fine and good

98244
getter	setter
i suggest the incendiary article by allen holub getter and setter are evil

98244
getter	setter
essentially if you have getter and setter for each and every private field you are making those fields as good as public

98244
getter	setter
the vast majority of getter and setter don t make sense for their constituent objects

98244
getter	setter
getter and setter also encourage users of the class to ask the object for some data perform a calculation and then set some other value in the object better known as procedural programming

98244
getter	setter
getter and setter however are necessary evils at the boundary of layers -- user-interface persistence and so forth

98244
getter	setter
restricted access to a class s internals such as c++ s friend keyword java s package protected access .net s internal access and the friend class pattern can help you reduce the visibility of getter and setter to only those who need them

98267
arguments	undefined
the order-of-evaluation for arguments to a function is undefined

98270
bmp	gif
it is in c++ not c but you should be able to easily extract the bmp and gif load code

98288
jquery	dojo
a good place to start is with wikipedia s comparison of javascript frameworks which covers dojo ext javascript jquery midori mochikit mootools prototype script.aculo.us qooxdoo yui and sweetdev ria

98291
ruby-on-rails	django
it just happens that the hottest ones are django and ruby on ruby-on-rails

98331
command-line	cmd
you can do it for terminal.app by issuing the following cmd at the cmd-line

98363
windows-xp	windows
is there a way to emulate the unix cut command on windows-xp without resorting to cygwin or other non-standard windows capabilities

98366
one-to-many	entity
for example last i looked hibernate has issues with an entity having multiple one-to-many eager relationships

98405
rhino-mocks	moq
there s a good comparison between moq and rhino-mocks here at phil haack s blog that i ve found useful and might be useful to you

98409
moss	wss
if you don t have moss but wss mr

98430
haskell	erlang
so if the team want to choose erlang or haskell then management has the responsibility to the company to say no

98430
haskell	erlang
sorry to pick on erlang and haskell devs but there aren t that many of you about

98445
perl	ruby
yaml used in ruby on rails for database configuration and has gained in popularity in other languages python java perl and others

98448
environment	building
in an environment like linux with a good package manager and periodic and or random updates never expect the same source code to building the same program on the same computer either

98475
postback	ajax
selenium will test your overall site with the output from the server its postback ajax calls all of that

98476
midp	cldc
i ve made sure to build it using the correct cldc and midp versioning

98477
environment	execution
supported kernel execution environment for tasks and did not support

98477
environment	execution
processes which is the traditional application execution environment

98500
32-bit	x86
the chuck api reference uses the c int type so the maximum value would depend on your local machine 2 31-1 around two billion on standard 32-bit x86

98501
contains	any
this contains any build settings scripting and tools that this specific developer chooses to store in the source control system they can do whatever they want here

98533
identity-column	sql-server
in sql-server you can just have an identity-column that starts at 100000000

98536
having	select
select is o n sort is o nlogn grouping by is o n having is o n -- worse case

98544
configuration	environment
generally this is a good thing because it means that any errors in the configuration or in the surrounding environment will be discovered immediately as opposed to possibly hours or even days down the line

98547
keyboard	mouse
it s great for allowing you to keep your hands on the keyboard and away from the mouse

98561
git-clone	git-svn
i d say the better way to do this would be instead of requiring that your coworkers do a git-clone just give them a a tarball of your existing git-svn checkout

98576
hardware	monitor
however making such a program that would work across all systems and monitor would likely be much more work than simply going to each station and recording it unless all the systems have the same hardware

98586
perl	tcl
our current best is derived from the best of perl + tcl s atof implementation and outperforms msvcrt.dll s atof by an order of magnitude

98586
perl	tcl
the bcd related x86 instructions seemed promising but i couldn t get it to outperform the perl tcl c code

98606
keyboard	mouse
i m always up for leaving my hands on the keyboard and away from the mouse

98640
web-services	api
maps web-services - geocoding api

98644
revision	svn
that is to say you have to track the correct start revision somehow unless you have svn 1.5 merge history

98653
tetris	pong
i ve been quite used to working on small projects which i coded with 1 000 lines or less pong tetris simple 3d games etc

98669
versioning	upgrade
however when i upgrade to prototype 1.6.0.2 the latest versioning from prototypejs.org everything breaks

98707
decrement	increment
for jumping just pick a significant negative vertical velocity apply that to the character at the instant they jump and decrement it by your per-frame gravity increment

98710
solid-principles	principles
principles of object oriented class-design the solid-principles

98751
scheme	lisp
i would never want to program in scheme or lisp again if i didn t have to but i am glad that i at least did a little in them just to learn the different way to program

98761
physics-engine	bullet
for more resources you can go to sourceforge and search for the bullet dynamics engine which is an open source collision-detection and physics-engine or you could check out which has plenty of resources on copious game development topics

98813
methods	extend
one way to handle this might be to extend the xmlhttprequest object with an explicit timeout methods then use that to determine if you re working in offline mode that is for browsers that don t support navigator.online

98843
repository	entity
this is the spreadsheet conundrum do you write repository.store entity or entity.storein repository

98861
void	main
in my intro course we are taught java and i see lots of my friends struggling with public static void main even though that s not the point of the program and how the profs have no choice but to handwave it until they re more advanced

98869
put	get
for example if you need to put some chars in a 2gb file you can use split -b bytecount put the ouptut in to a file append the new text to it and get the rest of the content and add to it

98881
base-class	inherited
a c# class can only inherited from one base-class but can implement n amount of interfaces

98915
javascript	dom
it is based on the mozilla engine so scripts are written with javascript and you have complete access to the dom on the server-side

98915
ruby	php
it also can be used to process documents that are generated in another language php ruby which i imagine is not practical except to help in transitioning existing applications to use jaxer

98915
ruby	php
technology php pearl ruby etc.

98918
design-principles	ocp
as mentioned above some of the fundamental object oriented design-principles are ocp lsp dip and isp

98934
unsigned	integer
for standard notation convert the aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd netmask into an unsigned 4 byte integer many networking libraries have this function and subtract that from 2 32 - 2

98938
getter	setter
it seems that many people understand information hiding in principle but then also think that getter and setter for everything properties for everything is an example of it

98938
getter	setter
the incendiary article by allen holub called why getter and setter are evil can be an eye-opener on the topic

98938
getter	setter
in short private-members with direct getter and setter are little more than dressed-up public members

98938
getter	setter
it is true that getter and setter are needed at layer boundaries user-interface persistence etc but their visibility should be restricted to those classes that have a legitimate need to call them

98946
value	field
if you put all the variables in a class you can use reflection to iterate over its field getting their names and value and plugging them into a string

98952
put	get
i haven t used this code for a put so i m not exactly sure if it s right for you but it might get you close

98991
parentheses	braces
ctrl + for matching braces and parentheses

99007
javascript	dom
if your 3rd party does some javascript that attempts to modify their dom a bit too early.

99014
getter	setter
if everything is done with getter and setter and no other behavior you re writing procedural code

99014
getter	setter
there are plenty of patterns to deal with this problem and they don t involve reducing everything to bags of getter and setter

99056
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms + asp.net ajax

99056
webforms	asp.net
are there any limitations that asp.net webforms asp.net ajax has vis-a-vis mvc

99060
any	set
akin to not providing any client user-interface to set the price on an item being placed in a shopping-cart but posting a a bogus price on the url

99065
webforms	asp.net
i love webforms but asp.net ajax is a pile of crap

99065
callback	methods
asp.net ajax is a pile of crap because a callback requires the entire page class to be reinstantiated you aren t calling a single methods you are rebuilding the entire page on the server everytime

99066
ethernet	packets
as your packets size decreases the overhead for spacing synchronized ethernet headers ip headers and udp headers increases in relation to the payload and therefore degrades your maximum throughput even more

99071
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i can t say anything against asp.net-mvc because i haven t had a chance to use it but i want to make sure you know you are not limited to just ajax.net if you chose webforms

99081
nagios	munin
both nagios and munin seem to have plugins support for xen data collection

99086
getter	setter
this is why getter and setter are common .

99086
getter	setter
i think you re usually better off maintaining state in private variables and providing getter and setter as a public interface to them when outside objects need to access them mostly because you ll always have the option to provide some kind of validation or transformation if it becomes necessary down the line without breaking your interface

99113
sql-server	oracle
i would recommend you download a copy of reflector and compare the codebases for the sql-server and oracle providers they shouldn t be that complicated.

99121
scheme	lisp
languages like lisp and the very closely related scheme are to programming what latin is to english

99124
player	movie
flex is basically a language that compiles down to a flash movie or applet that will run in the adobe flash player plugins

99127
google-chrome	firefox
other than that i would suggest running your tests in firefox using google-chrome as it produces much more reliable results but sometimes it is simply not possible due to business requirements

99168
perl	ruby
while this is not considered to be a huge drawback by some those people are using python ruby or perl and not java

99194
while-loop	loops
the while-loop is appropriate for polling or where the number of loops to meet exit condition will change based on activity inside the loop

99221
powerpc	arm
personally i think x86 x64 popular in pcs directly applicable if you write c++ or c# on pc powerpc gaining popularity used in game consoles and also exposes you to risc or arm used in a lot of embedded devices such as mobile-phones might be better choices to learn

99228
for-loop	loops
i agree that the for-loop should be used whenever possible but sometimes there s more complex logic that controls the iterator in the body of loops

99239
scheme	lisp
though it s not blazingly fast like a compiled language nor is it particularly useful at serving websites or parsing text i ve found that scheme and other lisp by extension has no parallel when it comes to simplicity elegance and powerful functional manipulation of complex data-structures

99241
javascript	dom
this is a third party page so i can t really include any custom javascript to do so...unless i can modify the dom somehow

99247
postback	ajax
i really dislike the implementation of the asp.net ajax controls i ve run into a lot of issues with timing events and debugging postback issues

99254
webforms	asp.net
imo asp.net mvc is much more dry than webforms

99254
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have recently made the move from webforms to asp.net-mvc and i hope i never have to go back

99260
shipping	tax
it may require things like sales tax shipping costs customer discounts

99282
append	input
by default cpp takes the name of the main input file deletes any directory components and any file suffix such as .c and append the platform s usual object suffix

99304
.net	wcf
.net 3.5 may be used in a lot of hosted web apps but it is just starting to show up in distributed apps and with it wcf wpf etc

99331
ruby	php
the janrain libraries are good for php python and ruby

99337
getter	setter
this is somewhat more nuanced than simply not exposing internal data - merely placing accessor methods or property getter setter between internal data and the cold outside world is no more information hiding than launching into a conversation about this friend of mine and his herpes problem.

99341
abstract-class	base-class
note that an abstract-class can define an implementation for a pure virtual function but that function can only be called with a qualified-id syntax ie. fully specifying the class in the methods name similar to calling a base-class methods from a derived class

99341
derived-class	base-class
however there is an additional spaces overhead for the class associated with defining another vtable for the derived-class vs the base-class

99386
push	pull
if you have control over the content or can gain control through mirroring or scraping you should consider using ajax or server-side include to pull external data onto and push it off of the page - it ll end up being more flexible more robust and easier to manage in the end

99395
directory	folder
how to check if a folder directory exists in cocoa using objective-c

99456
javadoc	doxygen
javadoc or doxygen is more suitable if you want distributable code documentation

99462
javadoc	doxygen
generally speaking if you use a language that has good documentation generation tools javadoc doxygen ms s c# stuff you should write your documentation above your methods and have your tools generate the pages

99468
populate	row
given that i need to retrieve the last row to get the number of rows and populate the end buffering is there a better way of doing it

99485
printf	strtok
this library contains your printf your malloc your strtok etcetera

99488
widget	button
ideally this would also include a solution solution that allows me to tint the widget s existing colors and identify the average colors of any images in use by the theme so that i can programmatically compensate for any color choices which might make text unreadable or otherwise clashing - but i would be happy if i could just turn a button red

99507
abstract-class	base-class
note that an abstract-class can define an implementation for a pure virtual function but that function can only be called with a qualified-id syntax ie. fully specifying the class in the methods name similar to calling a base-class methods from a derived class

99508
bazaar	git
it integrate with your source countrol system including git subversion mercurial bazaar tla and monotone so all your docs track with your project

99520
contains	any
the basic problem here as i see it is that an interop assembly doesn t actually contains any il that can be instrumented except for maybe a few delegates

99520
put	get
so although i can put together a test project that exercises the interop layer i can t get a sense for how many of those methods and properties i m actually calling

99522
function-pointers	virtual-functions
if there are then there is a performance impact in calling the virtual-functions as these are called via function-pointers or other indirect methods depends on the situation

99528
webserver	upload
i am looking to use a php library for upload pictures to a webserver so that i can use something that has been tested and hopefully not have to design one myself

99540
derived-class	inherited
deep inherited hierarchies greatly increases the maintenance burden by adding unnecessary complexity forcing users to learn the interfaces of many classes even when all they want to do is use a specific derived-class

99549
selectedindex	selecteditem
instead of trying to bind the selectedindex why don t you just bind the selecteditem in the combobox to the value in the record

99553
ruby	php
ruby encoder - may be the best option as their php encoder looks alright i haven t tried it however but it s not available yet

99565
stateless	stateful
connection pools are simply a bridge between the post-web era of stateless applications http-protocols and the pre-web era of stateful long-lived batch processing applications

99568
put	get
now for a rectangle vertex put the x value in the line equation get the y value and see if the y value lies in the rectangle bounds shown below

99575
constructor	object
since you can t make a virtual function call from a constructor or destructor the derived class object hasn t been constructed or has already been destroyed it calls the base class version which in the case of a pure virtual function doesn t exist

99578
postback	ajax
using ajax where necessary will improve performance especially if the alternative is a complete full-page round-trip to the server a postback in asp.net terminology

99579
dictionary	arrays
i ran a quick test loading in half of usr share dictionary words to an arrays 25000 words then looking for eleven words selected from across the whole dictionaryionary every 5000th word in the arrays using both the arrays-to-hash method and the any function from list moreutils

99591
instances	destroy
usually when you call a virtual function through a dangling pointer--most likely the instances has already been destroy

99591
instances	destroy
but usually it s just that the instances has already been destroy

99605
msbuild	nant
nant for builds but msbuild rake almost anything would be fine and cruisecontrol.net for deployment

99608
webforms	asp.net
webforms with asp.net ajax is heaven

99608
asp.net-mvc	webforms
using webforms instead of asp.net-mvc will give you the ability to utilize the lifecycle to develop very good and re-usable controls

99616
directory	folder
with weborb you can simply deploy your dlls into the bin folder of the virtual directory and it will take care of enabling your classes as flex remoting services

99627
autotools	gnu
the gnu autotools definitely

99628
select	union
can you not define a view on the db server that does the union query for you so from the client code it just looks like a single select

99628
select	union
if you can t can you just issue the union operation as part of your select

99633
virtual-functions	member-functions
see lippman s inside the c++ object model chapter 4.2 - virtual member-functions virtual-functions under mi

99659
click	mouse
the action of click is broken into its two parts mouse down and mouse up

99683
exception-handling	error-handling
my question is what do most developers prefer for error-handling exception-handling or error return codes

99684
environment	execution
the most basic task in an object oriented environment is execution a methods on an object

99684
constructor	object
is the proper way to establish this reference to pass the object as a parameter to the constructor or initializer method of the calling object

99693
default	reset
i think by normal behavior you mean the default for my favorite browser. your building up css rules for these elements is a part of the reset exercise

99702
double	int
say you want two hashtables one that maps objects of type string to type int and one that maps objects of type string to type double

99702
type-safety	generics
without generics you d have to use the object type which in addition to having to be cast to be meaningful gives up type-safety

99723
python	c++
my preference in c++ and python is to use exceptions

99724
put	get
if you are developing a site that accepts passwords don t put a silly password limit unless you want to get tarred with the same brush

99729
getter	setter
i could have getter and setter for the x and y coordinates or i could just make them both public and allow free read write access to the data

99734
value	field
at some point in the future someone is going to inherit from your class because maybe an extra action needs to be taken when the value of a field changes so there has to be a setter

99742
exception-handling	error-handling
i prefer to use exception-handling for error-handling and return values or parameters as the normal result of a function

99745
getter	setter
working with dependency-injection a lot you often have setter but no getter as clients should be able to configure the object but others not get to know what s acutally configured as this is an implementation detail

99751
getter	setter
public getter and setter is pretty much equivalent to public fields.

99756
internationalization	localization
use errorcodes when you need localization internationalization -- in .net you could use these errorcodes to reference a resource file which will then display the error in the appropriate language

99766
textbox	button
if you go to the tools customise menu option and press the keyboard button it gives you a list of commands you can search to see if a shortcut is available or you can select the press shortcut keys textbox and test shortcut keys you want to assign to see if they conflict

99769
shell	bash
the default shell in solaris has command history but you can also use bash instead it s more user friendly

99769
shell	bash
you can also edit etc passwd to make bash your default shell

99771
exception-handling	error-handling
exception-handling allows more easilly to separate error-handling of normal behaviour

99785
perl	ruby
for instance perl has cpan php has pear ruby has rubygems and so on

99789
spring	guice
dependency injection frameworks like spring and guice provide a solution to cyclical dependencies in java by using proxies which can resolve the receiver of a message the first time it is required

99793
32-bit	64bit
my first thought was that it would just run as a 32-bit app without making use of the 64bit power

99796
quadtree	octree
i have also briefly perused material relating to quadtree and octree

99802
contains	any
the idea is to parsing the output of phpinfo and write any setup values it contains into a local php.ini

99817
quadtree	octree
i don t have much experience with bsps but i can say that you should go with octree over quadtree when you the scene you re rendering is tall

99817
quadtree	octree
generally octree won t bring a huge cost over quadtree and they have the potential to speed things up a decent bit

99848
google-chrome	firefox
but it works in firefox safari and google-chrome

99897
export	csv
i have been given a set of cobol dat idx and key files and i need to read the data in them and export it into access xls csv etc

99908
mac-address	ethernet
maybe cheating a little but the mac-address of a machines ethernet adapter rarely changes without the motherboard changing these days

99926
quadtree	octree
two dimensions means a quadtree four an octree

99926
quadtree	octree
as stated as quadtree can work in three-space but if you want each dimension given a proper treatment an octree is the way to go

99929
keyword	term
the term itself is stolen from software languages -- for example c has the auto keyword for declaring variabless as being allocated on the stack when the scope it s in is executed and deallocated afterwards so that multiple invocations of the same scope do not see persistent value of that variables

99948
difference	zero
draw the two images to the screen full screen quad with two textures set up with a fragment shader that computes abs texel1-texel2 and kills the pixel discard in glsl if the pixels are the same difference is zero or below some threshold

99954
bison	yacc
lex flex and yacc bison provide easy-to-use well-understood lexer- and parser-generators and i d really recommend doing something like that as opposed to doing it procedurally in perl

99954
parentheses	keyword
imagine dealing with all possible interleavings of keyword identifiers operators extraneous parentheses extraneous semicolons and comments that are allowed in something like verilog ams with regular expressions and procedural code alone

99954
verilog	vhdl
also if you re lazy check out the eclipse plugins that do syntax-highlighting and basic refactoring for verilog and vhdl

99965
selenium-ide	selenium
if you are using selenium-ide to generates code then you just get a list of every action that selenium will executes

99980
message-queue	messaging
nservicebus and masstransit are two tools that can be used to implement messaging with msmq and other message-queue

99999
binary	hex
the methods you are allowed to use might be restricted by the author - no patching no disassembling - or involve anything you can do with a binary objdump and a hex editor
