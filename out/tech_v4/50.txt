500001
binary-search-tree	tree
essentially it s a check to see if a binary tree is a binary-search-tree

500064
calling-convention	dllimport
the default calling-convention for dllimport is winapi

500070
arrays	loops
if it s the former my guess would be that there s some run away loops recursion that s building up a bunch of objects arrays somethings and you re hitting php s default memory ceiling

500104
contains	elements
in that feed is an elements that contains the path to an image

500116
pixels	line
second i d check the pixels on the middle line to quickly determine the edges

500134
authentication	login
we are required to login to windows obviously and that then authentication us some how

500134
authentication	login
without worrying about security too much how would i go about authentication a user to a web application utilizing the windows login information

500155
credentials	ntlm
once upon a time internet-explorer supported ntlm authentication similar to basic auth but it sent cached credentials to the server which could be verified with the domain controller

500166
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
the more complcated way to do this is to use touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended to keep tracking of the user s fingers and adjust your view s transform property appropriately

500182
defined	declare
vector3d is declare and defined in a header file vector3d .h

500183
sigint	exit
the article is mostly c++ but there is a useful c example in the 2nd section which show how to use sigint to exit your program gracefully

500183
buffering	streaming
all other streaming are line buffering if they refer to a terminal device

500183
buffering	streaming
the four platforms discussed in this book follow these conventions for standard i o buffering standard error is unbuffered streaming open to terminal devices are line buffered and all other streaming are fully buffered

500185
url-rewriting	rewrite
also that will allow you to implement url-rewriting a little easier so it would look like widget edit 2 once you get an index.php and some rewrite rules in place

500189
member-functions	inline
it works without exlicitly putting inline for member-functions of a class because member-functions that are defined inside the class definition are implicitly inline

500194
controller	routes
do you want to use a front controller that routes requests to specific controllers

500215
gedit	kate
i d suggest using a good text editor like kate or i guess gedit since you re gnomey

500223
methods	extend
extend functionality of classes when its undesirable to add methods to the classes themselves

500233
anjuta	gnome
there s also anjuta devstudio written for the gnome desktop environment and it works pretty well with c++ projects

500233
emacs	vim
if you just want stuff like go to definition etc. vim and emacs have that too with help from ctags

500238
binary-tree	nodes
we first compute the total number of nodes m in a perfect binary-tree of height h ceil log2 n +1 - 1 which is m 2 h +1 - 1

500258
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
in all cases you ll need to implements touchesbegan touchesmoved and the like to determine what the user is trying to do zoom pan etc.

500263
logout	login
if i just put say usleep 3000000 before the login and logout codes is that ok or are there better wiser ways of achieving what i want to achieve

500302
arguments	undefined
so in your handler sans library you need to check if the arguments is undefined

500343
contains	elements
in a program such a permutation would be represented by an arrays of 48 elements contains numbers 0 to 47

500370
sql-server	oracle
sql-server gives you row_id function which can be used similar to oracle s rownum

500390
subtract	time
to calculate the timing just subtract the start time from the button press time

500402
opacity	shadow
use a shadow with color white opacity 50 or so blur 0 offset 1 pt down

500407
binary-tree	tree
for a binary heap stored in a tree structure this information is not as obvious but because it s a complete binary-tree it can be calculated

500407
binary-tree	nodes
for example in a complete binary-tree with 4 elements the point of insertion will always be the right child of the left child of the root nodes

500407
binary-tree	tree
because the tree is a complete binary-tree with a specific structure for any given size it is very possible to calculate the location of insertion deletion in o 1 time

500407
binary-tree	nodes
the implementation which seems to me to be the easiest to understand with low memory and extra coding overhead is to just use a normal simple binary-tree structure using a proot and nodes defined as data pparent pleftchild prightchild and add two additional pointers pinsert and plastnodes

500432
ruby	php
anyways this dissatisfaction began in late 2004 and ruby on rails was brand-new stable and addressed every limitation iâ d confronted with my old homegrown php mvc framework

500447
abstract	extends
if you re looking to make this bi-directional referencing automatic you could always extends your igraphnode interface and make an abstract base-class that has some code in your from and to properties which sets the other s value when modified

500470
ruby	php
i have experience with php ruby + ruby on rails earned money using both but not a lot

500470
ruby	php
i had to look up a lot of things when using php but not when using ruby

500470
ruby	php
another php s vs while in ruby it s just anything.length

500470
ruby	php
ruby the language is better than php

500486
perl	php
also scripting languages such as php python or perl would allow you to do something like this easily and possibly give you much greater flexibility than a shell script

500495
subclassing	base-class
typical workarounds is putting the special behaviour for the class you are checking for into a virtual function on the base-class or perhaps introducing something like a visitor where you can introduce specific behaviour for subclassing without changing the interface except for adding the visitor acceptance interface of course

500506
integer	modulus
to answer the title question just as in c the operator is an integer modulus but there s a library routine fmod that s a floating point modulus

500532
for-loop	arrays
and since you can never be sure that nothing will be added to the prototype chain just use a for-loop to enumerate the arrays

500534
header-files	makefile
currently i m using a sorry handmade shell script for configure that creates the makefile from scratch and determines which header-files to include based on your os architecture compiler

500534
autotools	gnu
i d like a more efficient approach and i d like to use a more standard build system using gnu autotools

500534
autotools	gnu
1 how do i go about switching from a homebrew build system to gnu autotools

500534
autotools	gnu
2 what good tutorials are there for getting started with gnu autotools

500543
autotools	gnu
i suggest you look up this process especially autoscan in the gnu autotools manual for the details

500549
associations	model
i would consider making an explicit model using associations to different classes instead of putting everything in the road or pipe class using interfaces

500551
streamreader	writer
what about streamreader writer

500551
networkstream	streamreader
then what happens when streamreader then networkstream then tcpclient each go through their disposals

500551
streamreader	streamwriter
with both streamreader and streamwriter composed of the same stream who owns it

500557
glib	gtk
this is best gtk book i found it has a chapter on glib but reference manual is the best place to learn and the most up to date book you will find

500565
for-loop	arrays
an alternative way of iterating through an arrays is using a for-loop

500571
any	set
as you can see when zooming in on labels below toolbar items in any app or for instance the bookmarks bar in safari control+scroll up control+option+ to toggle smoothing of the zoomed in image the text is rendered with sub-pixel anti-aliasing at least when font smoothing style in the appearance system preferences is set to medium which it will be by default on macs with a built-in or external apple flat-panel display

500571
rendering	redraw
nsshadow can not be used with sub-pixel anti-aliasing so if you simply set an nsshadowattributename in the attributes dictionary you redraw your string with you will notice sub-pixel anti-aliasing is mia when you zoom in on your rendering text.â due to the way nsshadow is designed no matter what color you set your nsshadow instance to â even if it is opaqueâ it will always be drawn with an alpha channel making sub-pixel antialiasing impossible

500576
json	xml
but even in the first i have difficulties i can send a json string but it will always be surrounded with xml information

500592
jquery	.post
i also did a .post - which looks at doing client-side templating with jquery and ms ajax

500598
authentication	login
an example would be restful_authentication which provides you with both some basic forms for login and user registration as well as an authentication module and a active-record model

500601
windows-server	windows
i have a site developed in asp.net and hosted on a windows-server using shared windows hosting account at godaddy

500602
shell	bash
it appears that i can set alt as a meta key and then add these kind of settings in inputrc e2 this works in the bash shell but it still won t work with emacs though so no good

500614
ruby	php
i maintain that ruby offers significant advantages over php and rails is a better framework than anything in the php world

500614
ruby	php
a lot of this has to do with the language itself - ruby can do things that php just simply cannot

500622
notepad++	komodo
if i had to choose between notepad++ and komodo i would choose pyscripter

500627
instance-variables	local-variables
so what java does instead is to put copies of those local-variables as hidden instance-variables into the anonymous-class you can see them if you examine the byte code

500641
compile-time	hardcode
if you hardcode the inserted class you need that class be available at compile-time

500666
any	set
i don t know what secret switch i need to flip or what trip wire i accidentally tripped over but the last form i created in my project is misbehaving very seriously the codebehind is apparently unable to find any of the controls that i have set up on the form

500694
arrays	loops
you ll need to select the data as you are already doing and then loops over it getting it into the format required and because the fields have the same names its easiest to use aliases or they ll just overwrite each other in the returned data but you could use mysql_fetch_row instead which returns a numerically indexed arrays

500698
callback	methods
if you are using one of jquery s ajax methods you can specify a callback and then put into your callback

500698
.when	ready
this would be a more reliable way of handling the issue since you could be sure that the methods execute .when the data was ready even if it took longer than 300 ms

500722
linked-list	arrays
also looping over all the elements of an arrays is likely to be faster in wall time than looping over a linked-list due to caching effects unless you allocate the links in big chunks and don t mess around with them too much

500728
webforms	asp.net
i am building a asp.net webforms 3.5 sp1 application using jquery where i can to animate the ui change its state

500730
selected	button
all i want to happen is when the submit button is clicked the selected file is uploaded to the database

500732
testdriven.net	gallio
for me it was a conflict between gallio and testdriven.net i think

500738
any	set
since you haven t include any information on how precisely you re including your flash file i can t really tell you what methods you ll need to use to set the wmode

500745
.when	ready
then .when the user visits the page the next time either fetch the settings and populate as many controls server side as you can or use the jquery ready methods to make a call to another webmethods that fetches the user-interface settings from the database passes them back to jquery allowing you to populate the controls

500799
data-structures	dictionary
most if not all of these are documented on the nist dictionary of algorithms and data-structures

500805
positioning	embed
apply margin width and height to your iframe or embed or object to positioning it within the div that has the ipod background image

500805
any	set
you can set the iframe to the size you need and make it hide any overflow if necessary but i don t think you re going to be able to hide parts of the flash if you don t have control of the embed code

500814
deployment	install
yes however if you use the setup deployment project in visual-studio you can create a setup.exe that will bootstrap and install the .net for you

500831
handler	service
when a menu expands or a filtering is shown the click handler will fire an ajax event to a web service that will record the state of the menu or filtering visibility in the user s session

500837
parsing	comma
you can then use a specific culture which does understand comma to parsing it

500847
openoffice.org	uno
hm i ve seen that openoffice.org does a good job on translating word to whatever so how about installing openoffice.org and maybe using it s uno model from c++ to solve that problem

500860
project-management	project
if you normally fall asleep while reading books about project-management give this one a try - i found the story simply fun to read yet learned a lot of solid basic while reading it and if you ever had to do a project on an impossible timeline you ll feel right at home with this book

500873
return-type	arguments
if you override a methods it s methods signature it s return-type name and arguments should remain the same well there are cases where it can be different but for now assume they should be the same

500878
arrays	loops
for..in will loops over all own and inherited properties of the arrays object which aren t dontenum

500914
silverlight	wpf
it s not in silverlight for some reason although it is in wpf

500919
pixels	line
a 2d car is probably going to be represented in its own object spaces -- maybe as a set of 2d line segments or 2d pixels or something

500926
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
is there a way to add buttons to applications uinavigationcontroller in the other uiviewcontroller s xibs

500930
order	add
if you were testing equality it would be worth looking at hashset etc but this won t help with partial matches unless you split it into fragments and add an order of complexity

500933
contains	lookup
edit this would be even faster using the hashset idea marc gravell mentions since you could change contains to containskey and the lookup would be o 1 instead of o n

500959
authentication	login
a basic solution is to create a new actionfilter attribute behaving similar to authentication with the difference it would store the model in session before redirecting the users login then redirects back to the data form

500980
mips	x86
one thing you might consider is taking an assembly class mips x86

500980
implements	abstract
other than that k r is a great book as several people have mentioned and also implements some abstract data types like linked-lists can be useful especially if you draw diagrams showing the memory layout it can help to clarify the idea

500981
testdriven.net	gallio
at first i thought it was the spark-view-engine add-in because it crashed opening views but after christian s comment about gallio and testdriven.net i have both i uninstaller gallio and now it works

500986
quirks-mode	doctype
using a doctype to prevent quirks-mode

500989
parentheses	operators
vim operators jumps to matching parentheses comment ends and a few other things

500999
itextsharp	itext
paulo soares one of the main devs of itext and current maintainer of itextsharp says

501034
itextsharp	itext
html css support in itext itextsharp is very basic

501063
smalltalk	scheme
see smalltalk and scheme

501064
contains	elements
catalina_home conf context.xml contains the global default context elements

501070
nmake	qmake
the opensource version of qt does not provide profiling mkspecs in qt terms so qmake can generate nmake msvc compatible makefiles

501086
edmx	dbml
updates resharper wasn t the issue but rather the plugins huagati dbml edmx tools. it seems some pluginss might be conflicting and i encourage people to disable all pluginss as a preliminary step in debugging the crashes

501087
python	c++
now assuming i am comfortable with c++ how easy is it to say use the adobe xmp toolkit directly in python

501099
common-lisp	lisp
however please be noted that chaitin s version of lisp is not the common-lisp used by programmers nowadays to do more practical things

501099
common-lisp	lisp
for the more practical aspects of lisp programming see practical common-lisp by peter seibel

501123
any	set
if for some other reason you really need to know if the component has been initialized before you do this you need it to dispatch some kind of event for this flex s uicomponents dispatch flexevent.initialize events but i assume you re not using flex or alternatively set an initialized property which i m not so sure the standard flash components do i m looking at the button documentation for reference here. you could of course make a custom subclass of whichever component you re using for yourself where you implement an initialized property but i m not sure how you could implement this for any of the standard flash components

501137
versioning	upgrade
for each change i usually create one scripting named dbverxxxx.sql that contains all necessary upgrade xxxx is versioning number

501137
versioning	upgrade
create scripting that will upgrade your user s database to new versioning

501137
versioning	upgrade
scripting should check current versioning of database and then execute database upgrade scriptinging that will convert schema to required level

501191
dfa	nfa
then convert the nfa into a dfa

501191
dfa	nfa
there are know procedure for converting a regular expression to a dfa and converting an nfa to a dfa

501194
contains	elements
what would be the best way to look in a to see if it contains a elements

501212
exception-handling	try-catch
if you do checked exception-handling you must understand that bad programmers will just try-catch it and ignore exception

501227
firefox	safari
here it is in the safari firefox browsers

501257
associations	model
so add a column to your contact model that is user_id or whatever key you need to pass to your user.find activeresource model and you could part of the associations contract like this

501262
highlight	selected
highlight selected text shift + roll trackball

501262
highlight	selected
cut text menu + x or highlight text press hold trackball selected cut

501262
highlight	selected
selected all text in field menu + a or highlight text press hold

501263
python	c++
i believe that doxygen a c++ c python objective-c

501290
command-prompt	cmd
basically the cmd needs to open a file from the cmd-prompt as if it were double-clicked on in explorer

501321
contains	elements
this shows us each line of data is a tuples contains two elements

501343
remote-server	vpn
i have a remote-server on a 1mbps upstream pipe which i rdp to over a vpn and it works just fine

501362
instance-variables	class-variables
the essence of your question is how come these class-variables which i assign field objects to suddenly become instance-variables which i assign data to in django s orm

501362
subclassing	metaclass
django s model object and thus also your models which are subclassing has a modelbase metaclass

501367
shell	tcsh
using the tcsh shell on free bsd is there a way to recursively list all files and directories including the owner group and relative path to the file

501390
temporary	copy
if a smart pointer is already copyable it s easy to support transfer-of-ownership semantic that then is just an atomic copy reset-of-original operation restricting that to smart pointers of certain kinds e.g only temporary smart pointers

501393
decrement	increment
removing an item is impossible but you can implement counting bloom filtering represented by arrays of ints and increment decrement

501399
constructor	object
since there is no way for a constructor to fail in c++ an object either

501399
constructor	object
if a constructor throws an exception the object effectively does not exist at the point the exception is caught

501413
constructor	object
first code in the catch block of the constructor is executed then the exception is automatically propagated to the code that created the b object and its catch blocks are considered

501420
dictionary	arrays
lookups in a dictionary are o 1 constant-time while searching through the arrays is o n takes time proportional to the length of the arrays

501420
dictionary	arrays
even if the arrays is only 200 items at most if you do a lot of these searches the dictionary will likely be faster

501423
global-asax	web-config
all you need is to add the assemblies to bin folder and edit web-config and global-asax files

501433
parentheses	braces
the accordion function is all lowercase you have also one missing parentheses and one curly braces

501443
dom4j	jdom
i d suggest using an xml library like jdom or dom4j for manipulating xml instead of using regular expression

501444
controllers	routes
the solution is to get rid of that default route entirely and ensure you re adding routes for all the controllers in the right place

501457
expression	brackets
you should first try to simply remove your brackets since you re replacing the entire expression and not extracting anything

501466
culture	locale
if you want to display a date in a specific locale culture then there is an overload of the tostring methods that takes an iformatprovider

501477
textile	bbcode
html textile wiki syntax markdown bbcode or even your own markup system can be easily implements

501508
hosts-file	hosts
i added an entry for my development system.in the etc hosts and was able to connect instantaneously from that as well

501508
ip-address	hostname
apparently the mysql server was attempting to perform a reverse dns lookup to resolve the hostname associated with the ip-address as is listed in the mysql manual and was timing out

501515
python	java
its similar to the idea in java of having fully qualified imports of com.whatever.app.more or how in python all of an apps imports should be absolute with respect to that app

501535
e-commerce	product
for example if you wrote an e-commerce site you might identify a work-flow of search for a product put product in shopping-cart and purchase product

501580
.when	ready
.when i get to work and everybody is loading up their projects and opening their programs i just rdp in and i m ready to go

501624
installation	packaging
for the installation of files which are not application data files like images user-interface files etc but provide integration into the operating system you are better off with using a real packaging format like rpm or deb

501626
any	set
is there any way to set this up so that emacs uses the correct version of python depending on which language i am using

501645
32-bit	64bit
so a 32-bit processor s single-precision would be 32-bit long and its double-precision would be double that - 64bit long

501647
gnome	kde
the standard windowss-like os x gnome kde etc set of windows management metaphors really break down when you have more than one windows you want to see at the same time

501654
extends	final
this is my final code in my component that is a richtexteditor extends it

501668
primitive-types	reference-type
casting is when you want one type to be treated as another type between primitive-types and reference-type this means an implicit or explicit boxing operation

501673
primitive	int
boxing is wrapping a value inside a container such as an int primitive value inside an int object

501675
contains	any
i installed a filtering to delete any feedback contains asdf qwer etc.

501675
contains	any
i filtering out any messages contains letters not being used in my language - 400 per day

501684
feedback	account
a slightly different approach would be to set up a systemd to email the feedback messages to an account and use standard spam filtering

501686
contains	any
any answer contains the word no letting through no i m not nope and not at all too just for fun... permitted the user to post.

501687
primitive	boolean
boxing and unboxing is a type of cast in java where you cast from a primitive to its wrapper class or the inverse boolean to boolean box or boolean to boolean unbox

501689
superscript	subscript
honestly i don t see the point in doing superscript subscript in css only

501689
superscript	subscript
beware css for superscript subcript on why you arguably shouldn t style superscript subscript with css at all

501689
superscript	subscript
typically superscript subscript is not actually a styling issue but is indicative of meaning

501689
superscript	subscript
side note it s worth mentioning this list of entities for common mathematical superscript and subscript expression even though this question doesn t relate to that

501697
postgresql	mysql
depending on your actual data usage mysql or postgresql should be able to handle a couple of billion records on the right hardware

501725
shutdown	exit
for a normal exit of your server use normal shutdown is used when the server is asked to exit by its supervisor

501741
gnome	kde
if you only need some dialog to improve your scripting you can use kde kdialog or gnome zenity

501752
couchdb	hbase
a word of warning about hbase and other projects of that nature don t know anything about couchdb -- i think it s not really a db at all just a key-value store

501752
postgresql	mysql
a single mysql machine can deal with a few million rows postgresql can probably scale to a larger number of rows but might work a little slower

501752
greenplum	vertica
if your organization has deep pockets check out what vertica asterdata and greenplum have to offer

501762
.when	ready
you should have a high res 512x512 versioning of your logo or promo image ready .when you submit your app

501770
superclass	subclass
casting can be done when there s a superclass subclass or interface implementor relationship meaning 1 above or when the two types are primitive numeric types meaning 2

501770
primitive	int
as of java5 when you write an expression that uses a primitive value where the corresponding wrapper type would be required such as putting an int into a collection the compiler automagically slips in the code that actually wraps that primitive value

501775
udp	tcp
do you think c# tcp udp socket use in the managed application can handle roughly same amount of data as native c++ version

501778
contains	elements
your enumerator ienum contains only elements the elements

501787
any	set
i thought it referred to any organized set of rules for solving a particular domain problem

501795
functional-programming	imperative
e.g. functional-programming in an imperative language does not work

501803
bazaar	git
in addition to scott s comment of just doing it paraphrased if you start with a distributed system such as git or bazaar instead of subversion you can start with having it running locally without even impacting others and then spread it amongst the other developers over-time

501832
notepad++	komodo
i use both komodo edit and notepad++

501854
value	field
i prefer to initialize all the field manually to ensure i get the value i want

501862
moss	wss
expert wss 3.0 and moss 2007 programming

501867
checkbox	button
for flags and options you can simply use checkbox combo boxes radio button and file selectors filenames

501870
writetofile	nsdata
once you have the nsdata you could write it to your documents directory using writetofile atomically and then i believe you can pass it in as a local url although i ve not tried this

501882
scripting	shebang
on unixlike platforms your scripting should start with a shebang -- that is a line like the following

501891
any	set
can i set the escape key in .screenrc to null so that the user can t access any of screen s functionality themselves

501894
authentication	login
i m making a website in c# .net and using the windows live id web authentication sdk for my login

501894
http-method	post
http status 405 - http-method post is not supported by this url

501894
http-method	post
descriptionthe specified http-method is not allowed for the requested resource http-method post is not supported by this url

501928
asp.net-mvc	webforms
personally in the current incarnations i would always choose asp.net-mvc over webforms

501928
webforms	asp.net
that said microsoft will probably continue to support the webforms model for some time and eventually the two models will probably become easier and easier to plug and play or interchange with one another based on conversations i have had with a couple of the asp.net team s program managers

501929
vb.net	vba
btw i noticed you tagged this as vb.net unfortunately vb.net is not vba - they re not related at all

501949
32-bit	64bit
on a typical 32-bit 64bit system the first would allocate 32 bytes and the second 24 bytes

501949
arguments	undefined
calloc where the second arguments is not sizeof atype is undefined

501949
32-bit	64bit
on a typical 32bit 64bit system a structure is likely to be padded and aligned to a multiple of 32-bit

501963
macros	vba
writing excel macros with vba 2nd edition by steven roman ch

501963
excel-vba	basic
the excel-vba editor the macro recorder and the f1 key are probably all you need plus the basic help on specific syntax for control structures etc

501967
tcp-ip	udp
i would also pick up a copy of the tcp-ip illustrated as well since understanding things like how ip routing works how tcp and udp both work as well as how they differ are the most important practical things to know about networks

501970
parentheses	operators
in our app we use our own simple query language for the user input just operands words or phrases with optional wildcards operators and or not and parentheses

501980
kdevelop	kde
kdevelop followed typical kde style and exposed everything to the user

501992
select	union
select store_id store_accountname store_postalcode store_address store_suburb store_phone store_state code_distance from store select code_to as code_to code_distance from code where code_from postalcode union all select code_from as code_to code_distance from code where code_to postalcode union all select postalcode as code_to 0 as code_distance as code where store_postalcode code_to and code_distance distance order by code_distance

502005
directory	folder
this should be recorded separately for each user the position should not be recorded in the file because if the file is shared with a different user or edited in a different context the other user may move the windows to an undesirable position so for windowss i put this in the users s local settings folder do not put it in the registry for unix i put this in a home .app directory

502011
rfc	iri
it will be a fully compliant uri parsing and it will also suppor iri rfc 3987 parsing as well

502013
binary	hex
don t forget that this is a text file so convert binary to hex n 0a

502024
stdin	pipe
indeed i have researched the air 1.5 documentation and looks like they have omitted any access to stdin stdout stderr file pipe - despite they are available on all the platforms that air supports

502024
stdin	pipe
the merapi bridge library implemented via the interprocess pipe of stdin stdout stderr would grant to air a shade of microsoft powershell ability which can marshal .net objects over std interprocess pipe

502037
required	checked
executable on each run asks this component to checked existance validity of settings and only prompt the user when required

502038
put	get
to get it to accept the mouse moved events i simply put in it s awakefromnib

502075
selected	checkbox
when you selected the checkbox control and hover the pointer over the option grouping it will change color to indicate that the checkbox will become a part of the grouping when placed

502129
arrays	loops
the code does indeed compile after the fix suggested but if you loops through your arrays i m curious to see if you re getting the correct values

502143
scientific-notation	digits
the simplified explanation of it is that computers store floating point numbers in something like base-2 scientific-notation with a fixed number of digits bits for the exponent and for the mantissa

502180
where-clause	sql
the where-clause of the docmd.openreport is a string that uses the same format as the where-clause in a sql statement

502196
firefox	safari
this works great on firefox safari but not on ie6 which doesn t understand the display inline-block

502206
object-reference	instances
however it gives me the ol object-reference not set to an instances of an object. error

502209
exception-handling	try-catch
in this particular case there is nowhere to put a try-catch block because the exception-handling is thrown internally from the asp.net lifecycle before your own code is called

502277
shell	bash
write a pre-scripted network client using shell scripts netcat and a lot of bash

502277
python	ruby
write a server in python ruby or another rad language you re familiar with

502305
postgresql	mysql
craigslist uses sphinx and it can connect to both mysql and postgresql

502331
hosts-file	hosts
you could try changing the entry in the hosts to point to the actual ip-address of the server as opposed to the special localhost loop back address

502343
ubuntu	debian
a debootstrapped copy of debian or ubuntu makes a great starting point to create the former

502362
digits	zero
does one zero file to three digits on the imaginary

502399
emacs	vim
i guess you don t use emacs as you d use for example vim

502428
versioning	upgrade
as an example i have a ruby-on-rails app running in our company right now that was coded about 2.5 years ago that only needed to have some work done to it once this year to upgrade it to a new versioning to be compatible with apache mod_ruby-on-rails it was originally written against ruby-on-rails 1.2 i believe

502447
any	set
i want to join these lists together to get a path keeping only the top tail of each overlap - but i don t need to do a set because i know that i don t have any other duplicates

502470
contains	elements
will fix the problem because you are trying to read from a potentially uninitialized elements of the arrays which probably contains garbage

502482
selected	cell
and it works better but if i selected a cell and then scroll while it is higlighted it poops out on that cell

502486
elisp	lisp
a key-concept to proper use emacs is to learn the very easy elisp a simple derivate of lisp and write your own little helpers own commenting style underlining templates and to know where to look to change values tab-size compiler email

502488
emacs	vim
although he s a vim guy he wrote it you might get some ideas about how best to go about becoming more proficient with your text editor that ll apply to emacs

502493
restart	reload
yeah when asp.net web-config gets updates the whole application gets restart which means the web-config gets reload

502580
directory	folder
if i add the root image folder as directory i receive this error

502593
any	set
to set things straight off-loading computations to the gpu won t necessarily fix any problems

502593
processor	cpu
the gpu is just like the cpu except it s less general purpose and more a data paralleled processor

502593
required	checked
in contrast to wm_paint which tells a win32 windows to repaint itself a wpf app would checked what parts of that windows required repainting and only repaint the smallest change

502597
executable	jar
i can t remember the exact code that i used to get this to work but you have to pass java.exe or the equivalent as the executable and then the class or jar to run as the parameter with the correct working directory

502613
expression	brackets
so if the attributes closing square brackets is not followed by a double quote but rather by another known expression you just update the lookahead part

502613
expression	brackets
of course any kind of greedy expression would not work since it would not match the second closing square brackets but the last one

502614
superclass	subclass
subclass must override a superclass methods

502614
environment	building
java tm 2 runtime environment standard edition building 1.5.0_16-b06-284

502641
perl	c++
my experience has been mainly in c c++ perl and some cgi programming

502658
jedit	vim
personally i would recommend jedit rather than vim

502673
buffering	streaming
this uses a moderate buffering to pump data between the two as a streaming

502684
attributes	properties
my project is an extension of boo that will allow the developer to tag his properties with a set of attributes

502716
revision	svn
show automatically updated revision numbers inside the text documents maybe with svn keywords

502721
configuration	logging
error tracing and logging via editing php s ini configuration file is a good way as well specially if you can manage it to log information

502727
shutdown	exit
i am trying to estimate if not freeing memory at exit would speed up application shutdown significantly

502731
textbox	button
ex build web form with one textbox and submit button 2 hours

502748
entity-relationship	diagram
so use uml finite state machines entity-relationship diagram plain english whateventity-relationship you want but be sure to include a logical path that your readentity-relationships can follow to undentity-relationshipstand what s going on

502758
directory	folder
the data directory where we create delete files and folder is located at c projectx data

502761
disposable	dispose
my control has a private member which is disposable and i would like to ensure that its dispose methods will always get called once the contains windows application is closed

502764
country-codes	nslocale
i have used nslocale to generate an arrays of countries but it s only the country-codes unfortunately and not the human readable equivalent

502770
superclass	subclass
now that we have established the fact that your subclass methods doesn t override the superclass methods according to the jls let s look at the runtime implications when type erasure has occured

502770
superclass	subclass
so the type system here will decide that the subclass methods does override the superclass one they are identical after type erasure and we can never have a conflict

502776
put	get
we now want to be able to put all these projects and their various versions in a continuous-integration tool - i like hudson but this is just a matter of taste - which essentially means that we need to get an automatic way to check out the projects to a fresh workspace and compile the source folders as described in the project-files in each project

502776
cvs	git
also the team projectset facility which ant4eclipse use to locate the projects which works well for cvs based repositories but not after we migrated to git which is a big thing in itself

502815
javascript	dom
but if you can t do this and want to include the text file in the html you could grab the file with an xmlhttprequest object and insert it into the dom with javascript

502818
cursor	row
can this be done just within the sql query or will it require looping row by row through the result set using cursor

502827
oracle	mysql
what are the datastructure used in dbms like oracle mysql sqlite for storing and retrieving records

502847
boolean	int
then you can use the ispointer boolean to decide if you should treat the union as an int or pointer

502850
children	nodes
a b-tree of order m the maximum number of children for each nodes is a tree which satisfies the following properties

502850
children	nodes
every nodes has at most m children

502850
children	nodes
every nodes except root and leaves has at least mâ 2 children

502850
children	nodes
the root has at least two children if it is not a leaf nodes

502850
children	nodes
a non-leaf nodes with k children contains kâ 1 keys

502863
credentials	ntlm
i am receiving the following error from the php script the requested credentials workstation is not defined i am using the smtp class and sasl class from phpclasses.org for the ntlm authentication

502878
debugging	trace
the only way to get line numbers in a stack trace is if you built you code in debugging mode with the pdb files available

502884
host	dns
contact the host server company you have your dns host service name resolution with and ask them to redirect the dns calls to another server of your choice with the notice you wish to have people see when they try to access your page

502892
sql-server	oracle
can t tell for oracle ms sql-server or other proprietary database systems since they keep storage information secret

502903
textmate	vim
i get by with vi vim textmate editors and what they provide or what i ve so far found in each of these editors

502912
contains	any
as i have not been able to find a suitable log viewer capable of visualizing event information instead of just presenting all events in a table i have for now decided to create a very terse xml layout contains machine parsable information based on the above which can then be postprocessed by the microsoft logparser to any format i need

502917
.net	wcf
wcf is supposed to be replacing both .net remoting and bog standard web services or rather wcf can also do web services

502919
web-config	app-config
however the calling website must have the information the and nodes in it s web-config even though this information is also in the dll s app-config file

502943
32-bit	64bit
an int is signed by default and even though its size is also platform dependant it will be a fixed 32-bit on most modern machine and though size_t is 64 bits on 64bit architecture int remain 32-bit long on those architectures

502960
executable-jar	jar
i am trying to build an executable-jar program which depends on external jar downloaded

502963
32-bit	64bit
usually sizeof void depends on memory bus width although not necessarily - pre-risc as 400 had 48-bit address bus but 64bit pointers and int usually is as big as cpu s general-purpose register there are also exception-handling - sgi c used 32-bit ints on 64bit mips

502969
versioning	upgrade
those scripting contains the sql statements which are necessary to upgrade the db to a certain versioning

502969
versioning	upgrade
next to that i ve a small application which upgrade the db to the latest versioning by executing those scripting files in the correct order from current versioningnr of the db to the last scripting-file

502970
calloc	malloc
to the excellent response posted i want to add one more point of difference between using calloc nelem elsize versus quality implementations of calloc will ensure that if your nelem and elsize were big enough to cause an integer overflow when multiplied together it will fail rather than cause an undersized allocation as a naive malloc invocation would

502970
calloc	malloc
just this feature alone would be enough for me to prefer calloc to malloc

502974
listbox	textbox
the problem is if i want to add a textbox filtering on tob of all of the listbox say a person has over 1000 aliases and i want to be able to filtering them to choose 1

502998
linked-list	nodes
you could also make nodes a private subclass of the linked-list class to avoid users or yourself messing with your pointers

502998
copy-constructor	constructor
you ve made a mistake in the recursion in your implementation as well the copy-constructor contains one level of a deep-copy and calls the normal constructor which takes pointers making it shallow

503008
solaris	osx
used secure copy to transfer them from osx to the solaris vm

503026
message	alert
all i got was a different error message but i still have to close a lot of alert messages

503044
silverlight	wpf
however silverlight 4 has a richtextarea control which when readonly supports this kind of display of flow layout with inline hyperlinks and so acts like a cut-down version of flowdocument and related classes from wpf

503061
directory	folder
basically there s a sites folder which has a directory for every site you re hosting

503099
value	field
the database can generate the unique value for you guid or uniqueidentifier or even just an integer identity field if you do the insert and read the inserted value back in a transaction

503101
having	select
i m having trouble getting any of the drop down menu input select s to appear with size 18 font in safari

503111
background-color	font-size
if you need to set an exact font-size you can turn off aqua by giving the item a background-color then set the size

503135
subnet	ping
in addition is there a way of making the software ask for the mac representation for all ips in the current subnet without sending ping the anyone

503139
contains	any
it s also that any class which contains a paragraph now also needs to become generic with a tfont parameter

503139
dictionary	map
another answer is to use a map or dictionary in the user class

503144
raw-sockets	packets
you could use the openvpn tap to send arbitrary packets as if you where using raw-sockets

503169
uiscrollview	subviews
one of the subviews of uiwebview should be a uiscrollview

503171
subnet	ping
is there a command-line based way to send ping to each computer in a subnet

503187
shell	bash
in bash shell

503232
forms-authentication	ntlm
if you are authenticating against the ad either via ntlm logins or an ad connected forms-authentication setup then the thread identity will contain the grouping the user belongs to and the role based parts of the sitemap control will work

503233
font-size	display
so what how do you tell textbox to display default sizes for the font-size being used

503238
negative-number	numeric
this might be a negative-number as a 32-bit numeric ip-address and -1024 as a mask

503244
scheme	let
you should be aware that some parts of scheme notably let and lambda have implicit begins around their body

503250
icmp	arp
arp is layer 2 protocol so it s packets are not forwarded by routers but it s much more reliable then icmp echo ping

503267
scrollable	panels
the controls can be many so the panels has to be scrollable

503285
hide	show
i would only make the show and hide methods when needed that is if

503287
sql-server	sqlcommand
in .net if my db is sql-server then in datalayer we have statements sqlconnection sqlcommand sqldatareader.

503300
order	add
follow this ibm technote if clearcase is installed before vs .net 2005 2003 in order to add ibm rational clearcase client for vs .net in the custom setup windows step

503312
delphi	basic
i looked this up at delphi basic and it s expecting a string

503319
sql-server	oracle
one way would be to use the oledbconnection etc classes defined in the system.data.oledb namespace - you should then be able to point your app at either an oracle or a sql-server database by changing the connection string

503339
contains	set
however when i set the ultracombo to that value it modifies the drop-down list to contains only that single value

503418
javascript	dom
the rest of the functionality is typically provided by javascript accessing the dom and manipulating the html

503430
silverlight	wpf
the challenge with xaml and the wpf silverlight controls is that they a very flexible so you ve got to get a handle on all the options and how they affect layout

503452
javascript	dom
2 modify the html dom after the fact using javascript

503468
silverlight	wpf
should you build out your dal as a wcf service to begin with and use that service from a wpf client asp.net client silverlight client any other consumer etc

503486
triggers	insert
cdc is an ability to record changes to table data into another table without writing triggers or some other mechanism change data capture records the changes like insert update and delete to a table in sql-server thus making the details of the changes available in relational format

503494
authentication	login
edit i forgot the most basic http authentication using login password

503526
pixels	line
then to take the lowest and highest pixels coordinates of each object to find where the row starts and ends on the y axis so that i can use ocr to read each line

503539
required	checked
the post page or handler can simply checked for the required credentials - if missing or incorrect you can then just return a permission error

503540
put	get
the data context is created fine but when i instantiate an object of this type the only item i get showing on the intellisense for it is the class based on the table i dragged onto the designer and even on this i get no intellisense if i put a dot after it

503540
submitchanges	datacontext
has anyone any idea why i am not seeing all the methods for this datacontext submitchanges etc

503560
value	field
the reason i do not know which column will say boss is because there are other value that could be in any of the four so the data entry person has to pick an open field and put in the code - it is an old database application i inherited

503566
any	set
edit could a stored procedure be more efficient than any set based query in that case

503569
driver	kernel
for ce 6.0 kerneliocontrol is very restricted for apps and it s unlikely that you can call it without a kernel or driver wrapper api from the oem

503577
temporary	copy
zach is potentially right in that a temporary copy of the matrix may be made to perform the first operation although i would hazard a guess that there is some internal optimization within matlab that attempts to avoid this

503577
for-loop	loops
when doing vector operations at some level within the internal code there is likely a for-loop which loops over the indices you are swapping

503607
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
there s also common-lisp which is a case-sensitive language that many people mistakenly believe is case-insensitive

503612
scriptaculous	jquery
i recommend the javascript route -- using a framework like jquery or scriptaculous

503619
debugging	trace
inherit from this class to implement a custom listener for the debugging and trace classes

503630
getter	setter
how could i setup my getter setter using the child controls in the parent class

503633
command-line	cmd
i m trying to execute a linux cmd through a php cmd-line script which is no problem using the exec cmd

503636
32-bit	64bit
specifically how do i open a 64bit cpl when running as 32-bit application

503648
udp	tcp
a simple example if your processes runs on three different machines how could the proxy machine step aside without involving traffic redirection at tcp udp whatever level

503651
order	add
when they add a section to the parent they have to assign what grouping it belongs to lets say grouping1 grouping2 grouping3 and in what order it will be displayed

503658
stderr	stdout
you need to redirect stderr to stdout so you can capture it

503658
stderr	stdout
this example routes stdout to dev-null thus ignoreing it and routes stderr to you

503671
stderr	stdout
2 1 means re-route stderr messages to the same place as stdout and thus will be loaded into the output arrays

503677
checkbox	textbox
textbox dropdowns checkbox radiobuttons listboxes can be accessed by request collection

503690
event-log	logfile
you could write an entry in to some sort of logfile event-log sql table etc during the permissionsvalid function

503691
removeclass	addclass
i know my test function is working since the addclass removeclass functions are working

503715
windows-xp	windows
the windows embedded for point of service operating system is fully compatible with technology built for windows-xp professional including existing windows-xp drivers

503731
integer	digits
if you are looking to do some truncation of precision for calculation reasons i tend to multiply by 10 n where n is the digits i want to keep take an integer from that and then divide again by the same

503737
implements	extends
some network filesystems do not implements file locks on regions that extends past a certain positioning often 230 or 231

503751
any	set
set up the output path before you run any test in the solution as suggested by paulius maruå ka

503751
directory	folder
close the solution delete the directory testresults under your solution folder and then open the solution and run all tests test - run - all...

503778
directory	folder
you should also delete the .svn directory that s kicking around in the folder that you re removing or you ll end up confusing svn tortoise

503778
directory	folder
you can also do an export for step 1 which will remove any .svn directories for you if you re doing this for a whole directory tree rather than a single directory this is a lot more convenient than cleaning the folder out by hand

503814
textbox	button
then all you have to do is go to designer select all textbox you wish to cycle through with enterkey select them by holding down ctrl and clicking on textbox with the mouse then go to events thunder like button search keydown event and type inside general_keydown

503814
selected	textbox
now all your selected textbox will have the same keydown event this makes everything muuuuch much easier cause imagine a form with 100 textbox and you want to cycle through all with enter..

503819
contains	any
but then again if you want to declare an instance of genclass that can contains any type i m not sure why you d want to use generics at all - you could just use the raw class

503820
packaging	building
this project is responsible for the traditional building steps compile packaging etc. it is required to spit out the installable artifacts unit test reports etc to the hudson artifacts directory

503820
environment	building
getting all of this setup for our environment took quite a bit of effort primarily in setting up the ivy repository and ant building files but it has paid for itself many times over in saved headaches in manually managing the dependencies and decreased troubleshooting effort

503831
buffering	streaming
this allows it to work with any streaming of the caller s choosing for example straight into a file without any buffering

503847
.when	ready
you should only create that branch .when you are ready to deliver to your customer by creating a packaging branch

503849
versioning	staging
the service has a staging and production versioning

503849
versioning	staging
using the staging versioning is free and could easily serve the needs of a play project. the production versioning costs money and can serve info to a large application with many users

503870
attributes	properties
but htmlfor is the dom properties name associated with the for attributes

503900
sql-server	oracle
many times i develop applications that have a database backed - sql-server or oracle

503921
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you absolutely must have them though there are ways to mix asp.net-mvc with traditional webforms in the same site

503943
bazaar	git
as an alternative to git which has already been mentioned i would highly recommend bazaar

503980
order	add
searching backwards in the arrays will not help for finding the most specialized frobber unless you add them in the correct order least specialized first

503981
internet-explorer	quirks-mode
i know i should use a doctype and not rely on quirks-mode in internet-explorer to ensure future compatibility

503982
constructor	object
so i d like to write 1 chunk of code that parsing the string into some middle tier object that i can pass to the constructor of each specific wiki table object

503985
json	xml
omar alzaber write a nice article for create rest api using asp.net-mvc that speaks both json and plain xml

503996
pointers	stack
is it at all possible in the middle of a function execution to set a pointers to the current stack to be picked up later and then release the current thread without unwinding the call stack and give it back to the thread pool

504022
bazaar	git
the major choices for a distributed vcs are git mercurial also referred to as hg and bazaar or bzr

504025
virtual-machine	virtualbox
you can run a linux host in a virtual-machine within your windows desktop using free software like sun s virtualbox or microsoft s virtual pc

504058
xlib	sdl
sdl is not a hardware interface in its own right but rather a portability layer that works well on top of many other display layers including directx opengl directfb and xlib so you get very good portability and its a very thin layer on top of those technologies so you pay very little performance overhead on top of those

504080
email-address	bcc
also if you add say 300 email-address to a to or bcc field where does the work happen that splits the single email into seperate email

504088
constructor	object
this can be done manually simply passing it to the constructor of an object that needs db access or it can to some extent be automated with an ioc container

504093
frame-rate	fps
setting a fixed frame-rate of 50 60 fps should be more than enough for a flash game

504122
32-bit	64bit
the data gathered from the 32-bit process needs to be passed back to the 64bit application

504122
32-bit	64bit
the 64bit app should wait until the 32-bit process completes before continuing

504122
.when	ready
.when data is ready in the 32-bit process send an nsnotifications to the distribute notification centering and inlude a dictionary in the event with all of the pertinent data

504125
constructor	object
when you create the cmfcribbonbutton object you have to specify the associated command id see the documentation for the cmfcribbonbutton constructor here

504156
contains	any
you could try to produce a solution at the win32 level that works with any browser but that will be specific to windows and probably contains a lot of code to deal with difference between the different browsers

i also read some posts about adding an xslt schema to visual studios schemas for intellisense does anyone know of a current xslt-fo schema for this purpose

504434
hash	md5
often a hash digest is stored as the ascii representation of hex digits for example md5 of the word hash is

504434
hash	md5
but md5 really produces a 128-bit binary hash value

504434
binary	hex
this should require only 16 bytes to be stored as binary values instead of hex digits

504434
binary	hex
that is a given amount of cache memory can store twice as many rows worth of binary data if the string is half the size of the char needed to store the same value in hex

504434

portaudio	juce
i ve had excellent luck with portaudio and juce both

504905
identity-column	sql-server
for sql-server is it better to use an uniqueidentifier guid or a bigint for an identity-column

504907
exponent	modulo
export the public key as rsaparameters and write the modulo and exponent value to disk

504907
exponent	modulo
on the c++ side you ll need to read the modulo and exponent value from disk convert them into bignum value

504909
continuous-integration	code-coverage
currently we have a fairly decent way of deploying our source we have unit code-coverage continuous-integration and rollback procedures

504920
contains	any
i need a query which will retrieve return one row for any foo_id that the table bar contains with the latest timestamp

504935
implements	extends
the most important thing in java is that you can implements multiple interfaces but you can only extends one class

504945
slimdx	xna
if you don t like xna you can use slimdx

504945
slimdx	xna
unlike xna slimdx supports directx 10

504950
versioning	upgrade
i d suggest having a baseline scripting and upgrade scriptinging so that you can always run a sequences of scriptinging to get a database from it s current versioning to the new state that is needed

504951
msbuild	nant
you should consider using a build tool like msbuild or nant

504951
environment	building
the nant db building task calls sqlcmd.exe to updates scripting in our dev and staging environment after they re checked into fortress

504977
implements	abstract
as such i did what i would have done has i wanted to force them to implements a methods i made an abstract one

504977
constructor	private
that does what some folks are saying default is private and the class needs to implement a constructor

504977
constructor	private
i should be clear to work around this i made my default constructor private and my other constructor protected

504981
ruby	php
get and post methods have nothing to do with the server technology you are using it works the same in php asp.net or ruby

505000
malloc	free
systems might choose to give free memory to other processes for re-use immediately while other systems especially if you use the rather private lib functions such as malloc might just use memory that is only available to this one process of yours so nothing will happen to free memory because no other parts of the system will know about it

505002
physics-engine	box2d
box2d is a feature rich 2d rigid body physics-engine written in c++ by erin catto

505004

505038
selected	checkbox
you can read out the name of the selected checkbox like this

505071
any	set
finally create any user-interface you might requser-interfacere...all set

505077
perl	tcl
vim has a native scripting language and can also be built with embedded python tcl or perl interepreters that can operate on selections buffers etc through the plugin mechanism

505077
emacs	vim
i used to use xemacs a major code-fork of emacs that goes back a number of years back in the 1990s but went to vim later on

505077
emacs	vim
if you find the user-interface of vim or emacs a bit too much there are a variety of other text editors available many of which offer scripting

505077
python	lua
examples of these are scite which has a built in lua interpreter nedit which has a homebrew macro language of its own or gedit which is substantially written in python which can also be used for scripting it and has a plugin api

505077
python	tcl
historically there wasn t a popular open-source javascript interpreter that got widespread acceptance in the way that python or tcl tk did

505085
perl	ruby
you can also use python ruby perl scheme.

505101
versioning	migrate
i ve recently migrate my codeigniter server from an old versioning of cruisecontrol to hudson

505131
hide	show
i think you would want to grouping your associated controls together in panelss align them to the top bottom of your form and then programmatically show hide the appropriate panels when the user click more detail less detail

505131
hide	show
edit i don t know of a helper control for this specific functionality aside from panels used to grouping controls and show hide them all at once

505135
hide	show
if the panelss are docked for example top - then just hide show the panels and everything should fall into place automatically

505163
subclassing	superclass
all subclassing always can specify their own constructor as long as they call a constructor of the superclass - so there is no way of forcing the a class to have a specific constructor at least that is the way it works in java

505172
json	xml
return xml or json instead

505189
webserver	security
the other security implication of get has to do with get variables being logged to most webserver access log as part of the requesting url

505189
webserver	upload
post supports advanced functionality such as support for multi-part binary input used for file upload to webserver

505197
attributes	properties
i think you ll have to stick them in your poco class but you can hide them away in a region labeled something like extra serialization markup properties and use other attributes to make them mostly invisible to consumers of your class

505235
selected	checkbox
for example if i selected checkbox user2 i would want the javascript function to pop up saying you are not user 1... all input checkbox are under same form name

505265
pseudo-element	clearfix
update in 2014 you should use a clearfix technique that utilized pseudo-element like the one mentioned by rodrigomanguinho

505284
vmware	esx
we have experimented successfully with vmware esx to get better usage out of our data center

505292
xsl-fo	xslt
you still need to write the xslt file and as far as i know there is no intellisense for xsl-fo under visual-studio

505295
animation	rotation
the scrolling text view rotation that occurs next outside of the animation block will be performed instantly

505295
animation	rotation
if you want to animate the rotation of the text in the same way as the contentoffset move that line of code to within the animation block

505295
animation	rotation
if you want to have the rotation occur after the offset change animation has completed set up a callback delegate method

505300
compatibility	platform
so if you don t care that much about platform compatibility you might as well cut the foreplay and use createthread

505321
richtextbox	textblock
if you want one paragraph per element you should probably do as suggested and use a read-only richtextbox or do what this person did and derive from textblock so that the inlines property can be bound

505326
decrement	increment
crockford is very good but some of his opinions are anal retentive at best like the underscore.js rule or the use of the increment decrement operators

505335
font-size	display
main gripe can t seem to be able to change font-size for table display and the default is a little too small

505338
rewrite	rule
if i use a rewrite rule that converts the url to will still work as expected

505353
selected	checkbox
i have multiple dropdownlist in a page and would like to disable all if user selected a checkbox which reads disable all

505354
silverlight	wpf
when i began working with wpf which is much the same as silverlight i ended up spending a lot of time figuring out how to do things

505354
silverlight	wpf
my point is that if you have no experience with wpf silverlight i suspect it is going to take a lot of time for you to wrap your mind around

505354
bots	api
start out with a very simple api for the bots say two functions with no events input or knowledge of the world

505354
bots	api
in the run method the bots can call the couple of move actions you have defined in the api

505374
gridview	datalist
i am using the link button in the datalist to filtering the territories and display them in a gridview

505377
synchronous	.when
i was also surprised .when i saw for the first time that dodragdrop is called synchronous and it somehow doesn t froze the user-interface

505378
rewrite	rule
when the client requests the server uses the rewrite rule to serve them instead

505387
annotations	mapping
according to the hibernate annotations reference guide chapter bidirectional associations with indexed collections the mapping should look like this

505401
strtok	atoi
since the list of integers is variables i d be tempted to use strtok to split the string up into individual strings separate by spaces and then atoi to convert each number and sum or find minimum on the fly

505434
show	next
what i d like is to use a jquery animation to show each of the alert boxes sequentially once one animation ends the next one begins

505439
json	xml
i understand xml is better suited for this but i read that json is faster and preferred

505448
innodb	myisam
it may depend upon whether you are using myisam or innodb tables but i would run the optimize after truncation the table

505452
json	xml
json is a perfectly valid way of storing structured data and simpler and more concise than xml

505461
sql-server	mysql
having xml fields in your sql database are at least queryable sql-server 2000 or later mysql and others but more often than not is a last resort for metadata

505461
json	xml
not to say i don t agree with using json as a simple that is not serializing references data serializer over xml but i won t go into a json vs xml rant just for the sake of it

505465
any	set
is there any gcc option i can set that will give me the line number of the segmentation fault

505467
directory	folder
to keep things clean i don t want to have a .git directory in the myfiles folder so i thought i could create . backup git_repos myfiles

505468
json	xml
json is just a markup language like xml and due to its more restrictive specification is is smaller in size and faster to generate and parse

505470
json	xml
they initially stored that info as xml then switched to json

505472
reflection	runtime
you could also use reflection to map strings representing the objects functions and resolve them at runtime but you may want to make some experiments to assess performance

505474
json	xml
just remember that json has all of the same problems that xml has as a back-end data store

505474
json	xml
if you have millions of rows and need random access you will run into all the same fundamental performance issues with json that you would with xml

505491
arrays	loops
then do a loops on the arrays to get the sum of to find the smallest value

505505
exception-handling	try-catch
you should only use the catch part of try-catch finally to swallow an exception-handling when you know how to handle the exception-handling when you know how to recover from it and when you re sure you can do so without leaving the application in an inconsistent or invalid state

505507
exception-handling	try-catch
to do this you have to make sure that every line of code is either enclosed in a try-catch block or only called by code that its exception-handling can bubble up into

505521
haskell	python
bonus points for bindings with haskell or python

505534
python	perl
you can write cgi scripts in perl python c bash whatever

505545
unique	words
i ve been trying to calculate all the unique permutations for a very long word antidisestablishmentarianism and although i can calculate the permutations for the words i am having problems with stopping the production of duplications

505556
serialization	marshalling
the best way to handle this particular problem serialization and protocols cleanly is to use an idl and generate the marshalling code with switch statements

505567
return-value	arguments
for example if i passed a sqrt 100 then the dll parsing function would find the function call to sqrt and within the dll would be a corresponding sqrt function which would calculate the square root of the arguments passed to it and then it would take the return-value from that function and put it into variables a.

505567
contains	set
but if you want to add a command into the scripting which suits the purpose of your program you could say set a boolean value in the dll telling it that you are adding functions to its language and then create a function in your code which would list the functions you are adding the dll would call it with the name of the function it wants if that function is a user-defined one contains within your code the function would call the corresponding function with the argument passed to it by the dll the return the return value of the user-defined function back to the dll and if it didn t exist it would return an error code or null or something

505578
keyboard	mouse
you could use this to globally listen for messages that bring a windows to the foreground and or messages for user interaction mouse keyboard

505594
put	get
you want to put global get at the beginning of every function except get itself

505606
administration	account
however that account was deleted prior to adding another user as the administration

our software is a native 64bit c++ app but we d like to access the hardware via a 32-bit process

505647
32-bit	64bit
what is an efficient elegant way for 32-bit and 64bit applications to communicate with each other that ideally doesn t involve inventing a new protocol

505658
constructor	object
re yossi dahan s comment i see the ambiguity in the wikipedia article but if you read carefully it does say that the component being decorated is a field in the decorator object and that the component is passed as an argument to the decorator constructor

505663
linked-list	dictionary
usually the cache is a dictionary instead of a linked-list of closures

505672
driver	kernel
if this is a real driver kernel mode you re sol

505706
bugzilla	mantis
mantis definitely wins on usability grounds over bugzilla

505706

505708
build-process	ant
i ve created a partial ant script for the build-process

505709
32-bit	64bit
in c where if you take a 32-bit product you can overflow fairly quickly unless you resort to using 64bit integers.

505715
webserver	host
we run our db en webserver on the same host and it s surprising how many db-heavy sites you can run on a single machine

505717
contains	set
my sample is fairly simplistic it doesn t include page sizing and orientation which contains a whole different set of issues that don t work as you would expect

505717
contains	any
nor does it contains any save functionality as ms seem to have forgotten to include a save button with the document viewer

505721
value	field
this would allow you to pass in a string representing the field name and you could dynamically look up the field name and update the value

505728
python	ruby
the things i love most in ruby in contrast to python are blocks and the retry command

505736
acceptance-testing	bdd
the benefit of either approach bdd or acceptance-testing frameworks is that the results the user sees are more human-readable and understandable

505778
debugging	exit
if you start a debugging session but don t run the program or if it exit then when you ask for a backtrace gdb will say no stack -- because there s no running program at all

505778
pointers	stack
difficult if your program is was really running but your gdb is saying no stack perhaps your stack pointers is badly smashed

505786
affinity	cpu
context switch use a multi-processor core chip on a lightly loaded system and set the process s affinity to a specific cpu preferably not cpu 0

505795
affinity	cpu
it may help to set the cpu affinity in order to bind the process to a single cpu

505797
getter	setter
if you have a set of fields are simply read and written via the getter and setter you could probably get away with a single lock for these fields

505798
average	median
if an absolute number is important calculate the median not the average

505799
cursor	row
before you loop to the next row ie the cursor moves to the next row you copy the value of col3 into lastcol3 and then you get the new value for col3

505800
subclipse	aptana
eclipse with the aptana plugins allows me to develop html javascript php and css in a mostly seemless environment and subclipse plugins for integration with subversion

505817
low-level	hardware
most modern processor support a remarkable set of low-level hardware performance counters

505823
url-encoding	url
this may lead to in encoding problem where one url-encoding system may use standard percent encoding where as another would use rfc 1738 url encoding

505838
basic	vba
this is basic stuff but i m somewhat unfamiliar with vba and the word access object models

505839
display	width
my fixed document xps has its page orientation set to landscape the page media size has a width that is longer that its height and it display correctly in the viewer as landscape

505841
element	dynamic
i went with this approach because my child element height was dynamic and thus i couldn t set it

505863
subdirectories	multiple-files
how do i zip a directory of multiple-files including subdirectories

505863
iostream	boost
is there a standard way to combine bytestreams from multiple files into a zipped archive or maybe there is a convenience function or method that would be available in the boost iostream library

505863
environment	building
updates 2 after completing this task on my linux building environment i discovered that quazip doesn t work at all with the visual-studio compiler

505867
python	java
code is much shorter and compact than the conventional c java and python mantras

505870
mechanize	selenium
you could also use test www mechanize and test www selenium -- would be useful in your case to have selenium tests defined to make sure you don t break any end-user functionality

505877
contains	any
the php manual says it returns an arrays contains all the values from arrays1 that are not present in any of the other arrayss and gives the following example

505896
profiling	debugging
if you need a tool to debugging this look at .net memory profiling or windbg with the sos extension both will allow you to sniff through your your managed heaps

505901
vb.net	vb6
if you want to learn more about tdd and unit testing you should apply it to functions or procedures in vb6 -- although i d recommend vb.net or c# and doing object-oriented development

505904
adplus	dump
you could also setup adplus to capture a memory dump on crash - i believe the syntax is adplus -crash -iis

505905
linux	unix
open source does not equal linux unix - lots of good stuff for .net out there too

505925
macros	vba
vba macros from inside word to create csv and then upload to the db

505925
macros	vba
vba macros in word with connection to db how does one connect to mysql from vba

i guess i m authorized because the defaultcredentials sent my credentials that its password is saved in the stored username and password control panel user account tab advanced manage passwords

505942
set	bag
what you want is a bag - which is like a set but also counts the number of occurances

505946
ruby	php
the ide is great for coding on projects like python php ruby on rails html etc

505950
settimeout	fadein
you can use settimeout to call the fadein function after a specified amount of time after the document has loaded fadein accepts a callback parameter so you can set another function to animate the background-color

505951
factors	matrix
usually the management uses more sophisticated matrix and all to make their decision but more or less these are the factors they usually put in

gethashcode	equals
fortunately you can tell it to use different criteria by specifying an iequalsitycomparerâ ¹xelementâ º basically an object that has an equalss methods that returns true iff two xelements are equals according to your definition and false otherwise and a gethashcode methods that takes an xelement and returns a hash code based on your equalsity criteria

505973
value	field
in a nutshell the portal sends custom header value to any application that is behind the portal for field like the username user profiling data and some access rights

505987
revision	updates
the changelog describes the major revision since the last updates including syntax changes enhancements and bugfixes

505996
tuples	set
consider a udf that takes a set of inputs and returns a result based on complex logic but for the set of inputs over 5m rows there are only 100 000 distinct inputs say and so it will only produce 100 000 distinct result tuples my particular cases vary from interest rates to complex code assignments but they are all discrete - the fundamental point with this technique is that you can simply determine if the trick will work by running the selected distinct

506012
contains	elements
and then will be an arrays of length 2 that contains the text between the quotes in elements 1

506012
contains	set
it ll still contains the full text matched in element 0 in general you can have more than one set of these parentheses

506022
.net	wcf
we are hoping to use wcf netmsmq or msmqintegration on the .net side

506033
coalesce	isnull
i just had a look at the linked article and can confirm short-circuiting can fail for both coalesce and isnull

506035
hashtable	sorted
if you are using a hashtable the hash in the table should be in a sorted manner

506052
duplex	was
i was thinking that i could have a static global duplex connection to one of the chat servers and i could use that for all requests to that asp.net server

506067
internet-explorer	firefox
and yeah i did follow the apple article too who put the blame on simply internet-explorer while my firefox shows the same result

506087
silverlight	wpf
wpf clients connect to the wsdualhttpbinding endpoint and silverlight clients connect to the pollingduplexhttpbinding endpoint of the same wcf service

506087
silverlight	wpf
clients silverlight or wpf can add notes against a stock in their ui and these notes propagate back to the server to be pushed to all other clients

506088
promise	future
i thank the commenters for pointing this out and promise in the future to never-ever- ever try to write a sarcastic comment on the internet

506106
configuration	environment
this allows external resource mail database etc configuration to be defined outside of your web application avoiding the need to repackage your war when you database configuration changes or you move to a different environment with a different database for instance

506142
postgresql	oracle
the database can be one of sql server oracle sybase and postgresql

506163
http	ssl
https http over ssl can help prevent hackers spoofing requests allowing you to securely exchange messages between the client and server

506163
required	checked
to use the services from your site users will there after be required to submit a valid credentials username password which you could checked against a database

506167
data-structures	tree
from my data-structures class at college i know basic building blocks like bfs and dfs backtracking dp tree graphs etc

506227
void	main
static void main

506241
multiplication	division
division is per se slower than multiplication however i don t know the details

506241
sqrt	sin
the basic reason is that similar to functions such as sin or sqrt it s just mathematically more complex

506241
multiplication	division
iirc a multiplication takes about 10 cycles on an average cpu while a division takes about 50 or more

506252
multiplication	division
both operations are done down at the floating point unit fpu level and even in the world of integral alus the division circuit is a far busier place than a multiplication circuit

506261
data-structures	map
if what you want is in fact a map you may want to look into persistent data-structures

506263
handler	service
the run-time will service the first request with unique instances of the required handler and modules

506291
filehandle	pipe
you should check out io pipe and filehandle

506317
csv	xml
i am writing a simple csv to xml processor in java

506317
csv	xml
i need to process the csv format into this model and then marshall it into the xml that complies to the dtd

506321
rounding	currency
calculations with currency value is a complex subject but you cant go far wrong is you always aim to have a rounded answer to the nearest currency unit cent for example and always make sure that rounding errors are calculated for example to divide 1 dollar three ways you should end up with 33+33+34 or 33+33+33+1

506339
positioning	embed
the code i m working on calls a lot of javascripting and some of that code requires the scripting to know the id of the flash object embed for example to find the positioning on the page and to resize the object embed

506343
default	reset
you could try to reset the installation of teamcity by removing teamcity data directory directory by default

506361
constructor	object
an immutable object will be initialized in its constructor and all of its inner fields will be final

506372
value	field
after entercriticalsection the return-value of getcurrentthreadid was written and before leavecriticalsection the field value was reset

506376
transient	entity
i d use the entity itself or a working copy as a transient unit of work along with a short-lived context

506378
typedef	struct
you can define the typedef and forward declare the struct first in one statment and then define the struct in a subsequent definition

506378
typedef	struct
edit as others have mentioned without the forward declaratation the struct name is still valid inside the struct definition you can used struct a but the typedef is not available until after the typedef definition is complete so using just a wouldn t be valid

506380
stderr	stdout
you may need to read stdout stderr of a java program

506380
environment	execution
you may have to set updates environment variables and path before execution your java command

506394
contains	set
when looking at the problem this way you quickly realize that most applications only contains a very limited set of component roles

506462
dependency-injection	inject
with dependency-injection unit tests become very simple to set up because you can inject mocks instead of real objects in your object under test

506463
vb.net	vb6
the reason why microsoft designed vb.net to size arrayss based on upper bound rather than arrays length is to make it easier to port code from vb6 to vb.net

506463
arrays	loops
it was common to loops through an arrays of size n using

506463
vb.net	vb6
by designing vb.net to interpret an arrays s sizing argument as an upper bound rather than the number of elements in the arrays old vb6 code that looped from 1 to n could be ported directly to vb.net

506463
vb.net	vb6
the arrays in vb.net will have one extra element compared to what the arrays had in vb6 the element at index 0 but otherwise behaves as it did in vb6

506475
.when	ready
ie .when you click a button you may want it to perform some action in which case you need to call the server but nearly all the other events need to only change the state inside the gui and do nothing to the server - not until you re ready or the user wants some response or you have enough idle time to make the calls in the background

506490
webforms	asp.net
i ve not got my head fully around it yet but you can plug it into webforms or asp.net mvc they have some sample sites for both platforms

506528
java-me	midlet
to draw an image on a java-me midlet you need a canvas to paint it on to

506528
implements	extends
secondly you need to create a class extends canvas and implements the paint methods

506530
put	get
what s the best caching system daemon that supports get put delete and list memcached i think doesn t support list

506543
csv	xml
if you have a straightforard mapping you could use a thirdparty tool to directly map csv to xml csv2xml converter

506546
csv	xml
it is quite simple to use and use xml mappings to handle the csv to model projection thus not inducing thight coupling between your csv and your java objects

506557
sql-server	oracle
giving the amount of data being moved about if using sql-server i would look at using ssis or dts â oracle will have something along the same line

506560
irrlicht	ogre
it includes gui elements is much smaller than most full-blown engines like irrlicht or ogre optionally makes use of 3d hardware acceleration and has been tested by popcap on millions on computers

506584
opensolaris	linux
now both linux and opensolaris are open source and free to use but i m not sure about using opensolaris in commercial deployments

506584
opensolaris	linux
note i ve never used opensolaris and i use mostly linux

506586
shell	bash
if you have a windows pc and you can install software on it try cygwin this gives you a unix environment and a bash shell

506591
directory	folder
as you ve added the c xpressmp lib folder to the library search path in vc++ directory check that only the library file name is specified under additional dependencies and this does not include the path i.e xprm_rt.lib not .. .. xpressmp lib xprm_rt.lib

506599
freebsd	linux
freebsd is a nice in-between linux solaris though

506603
constructor	object
but it depends on your code-behind object you have to set a constructor to initialise public properties within your object which are observablecollection preferably there is some restriction rules with object instance in xaml

506611
wxruby	shoes
shoes and wxruby are interesting

506611
python	perl
i prefer it to python and perl at least in part because of its fundamentally object-oriented design

506614
.net	wcf
nav 2009 is indeed using generated .net assemblies but it is wcf based

506633
versioning	upgrade
this file is used to upgrade the database from 1 versioning to 2

506642
direct2d	gdi
have you had a look at direct2d which is kinda the replacement for gdi

506652
constructor	object
you might be thinking of the object initializer in c# where you can construct an object by setting the properties of the class rather than using a parameterized constructor

506687
attributes	properties
trying to add a defineconstants element does not work because defineconstants needs to be expressed within the properties attributes

506692
webforms	asp.net
one think it could not not test was asp.net webforms

506702
assign	add
however when i give this user-controls a name so i can assign this property at runtime i get an error could not create instance of type myuser-controls if i remove the name the user-controls works - i can add as many as i want at design time and they all work but as soon as i assign a name or x name it breaks and i cannot figure out why

506705
classname	inherited
all i need is methods in the action class only in it because there will be a lot of inherited classes and i donâ t want to implements this methods in all of them which will return classname from a static call

506708
document	element
also it s best to avoid referring to element names directly off document - use the document.forms collection or getelmentbyid

506714
strtol	atoi
use atoi strtol and atof strtod library functions to convert from string

506743
internationalization	localization
so what are they key difference between localization and internationalization

506752
culture	locale
internationalization i18n the process of changing your software so that it isn t hardwired to one language locale culture

506754
.when	ready
and .when i m ready to reset it

506786
internationalization	localization
internationalization prepares your application for localization

506793
httplistener	http.sys
httplistener should be fine but it s just wrapper around http.sys and this library is available only on windows-xp and higher

506806
web-services	api
it would be possible to reverse engineer this api to obtain the web-services that it is actually using but i am guessing that they didn t provide the sources for a reason which means that those web-services aren t meant for direct access

506821
triggers	insert
the triggers update delete and insert are fired whenever an update delete or insert respectably is performed on the table

506828
where-clause	sql
not a complete solver or optimizer or anything just a few symbolic manipulations of any sql where-clause possible

506834
sendmessage	message
if the components you use do anything with sendmessage or postmessage you will have to create a standard message loop in the background thread

506848
value	field
i would create your primary key as a composite on user_id and department and have another field in that table that is an identity autoincrement field also with a unique index on it and use that value as your fk reference to other fields

506851
authentication	login
if an authentication is required to verify user s membership in a role then the authentication method specified in login config in your web.xml will be used

506855
triggers	insert
offcourse then in your instead of triggers you also have to write the update or insert statement that should do the actual update or insert into the table next to the additional logic

506860
value	field
left join the record s new version from old version if the joined table inserted has null value it means the field you want to detect changes has changed

506863
methods	extend
or have the concrete data classes extend some abstract data class and pass that to the process methods and then have the methods check the type and act accordingly

506874
telnet	ssh
you can then login to the device through ssh or telnet and transfer your data through an ip socket

506881
axis2c	gsoap
but what if another ws client implements in c++ with gsoap or axis2c uses this definition

506894
multicast	packets
you just send your udp packets to a multicast address that is 224 4 and the router decide whether to route it to a subscriber

506894
multicast	packets
if you want to limit destinations where your multicast packets go you do it on router

506894
multicast	packets
you should understand though that the word routes above means that the router emits the packets into appripriate interface with a multicast destination address in ethernet header and multicast destination address in ip header

506894
ethernet	packets
an ethernet switching attached to the interface if any will distribute the packets over all active ports

506909
any	set
i don t think there is any one product that will provide the same feature set but some alternatives are

506929
multiplication	division
for example the compiler can replace integer division between 3 with a multiplication and a binary shift

506929
multiplication	division
also it can replace float division between 2.0 with a multipliation by 0.5 but it cannot replace division between 3.0 with a multiplication by 1 3.0 as 1 3.0 cannot be represented exactly using binary numbers therefore rounding errors may change the result of the division

506944
font-size	display
for me the best way is to use font-size that makes my monitor display at most one 30-40 line methods this way i need to create smaller methodss

506955
carbon	cocoa
when your application is not cocoa but carbon plain-c you may have to directly process the apple event i m not familiar with carbon but in cocoa apple already catches the most important apple events for you and converts them into delegate calls or notifications your application can listen to

506986
credentials	security
i guess it has some security credentials issue

506995
order	join
and join it into your query then order by tid_count

506999
python	java
i use eclipse for java python c ++ and so on

507005
any	set
first of all you can set any content of your choice into a scrolling view not that this is typical for user-interface design on mac to do that but you can if you insist

507005
radio-button	selected
second you can of course add several radio-buttons that all belong to a single radio-button grouping so selecting one deselects the previous selected one and give them no text you are not forced to give them a label and just place a webview next to each of these buttons

507012
value	field
you can generalise this approach by looking for sets of nullable field that either null together of have value together and significantly likely to be null

507025
wordpress	blogs
it could be a good idea to use wordpress depending on the features you want in your blogs

507033
environment	execution
selected the execution environment instead of the jre to use

507033
buildpath	libs
to do so got to your project - properties - java buildpath - libs

507033
environment	execution
selected the jre system library element click edit... and selected the execution environment of your choice probably javase-1.6 for your example

507044
carbon	cocoa
i m looking for application-wide access to raw keyboard events in os x either using the cocoa or carbon frameworks or any of the underlying apis for that matter

507058
joomla	drupal
both drupal and joomla can handle all of the requirements you describe

507064
appdata	temp
c users cconway appdata local temp tmp25e3.tmp

507066
quirks-mode	doctype
check your setting a doctype and not running into quirks-mode next use a reset stylesheet to make sure that all your elements start of on the same foot

507068
base-class	inherited
class a inherited from a base-class that has no default constructor

507068
constructor	object
class a contains object of types that have no default constructor

507074
short	base
but in short the base object isnt yet an instances of the derived type therefor cant call any overloaded functions on the derived object

507093
binary	hex
where can i find more information on handling binary file formats and are there useful tools for these kind of jobs besides regular hex editors

507109
buffering	streaming
i am guessing that there is a buffering associated with the streaming which holds the data of the file

507136
any	set
is there any way to define the set of tables to be able to handle this situation

507139
sql-server	oracle
problem i have to pull data from a sql-server database and an oracle and put it together in one dataset

507139
sql-server	oracle
the problem i have is the sql-server query requires an id that is only found from the return of the oracle query

507154
arrays	loops
why not create a new arrays of the same size and initialise each element seperately in a loops

507156
filesystems	fat
the windows filesystems fat ntfs do not care about the case of file names case-insensitive

507156
linux	unix
you usually notice this mistakes not until you deploy the website onto case-sensitive file systems as default on linux unix ...

507157
put	get
first put an id on the element so you can easily get a reference

507203
expression-blend	designer
the xaml designer built into visual-studio 2008 is junk expression-blend is better but it is very designer oriented

507205
mac-address	ethernet
one thing that is unique per computer is the mac-address of the ethernet card that is almost ubiquitous on every rather modern and not so modern computer

507208
show	next
there are many examples out there of extrmely simple asp.net-mvc applications that show you a list of these items with an edit button next to each and an add button at the bottom

507208
textbox	button
i m after a single page containing the items names and prices in textbox that can all be edited in one go and then a single save button pressed to update the data

507243
constructor	object
since the reference must be initialized on construction you can not use set to modify it so pass the reference to the constructor of your object and save it there

507251
any	set
if the app is set to any other mode like test or prod it will email and store the information in a database

507300
macros	vba
i m assuming vba is needed or the macros builder

507303
selected	button
using the project explorer under lv8 you can save the file information of all vis for the current project project menu selected file information then click on the export file information button but this will just list all vis in the project

507310
if-statement	loops
no if-statement or any other kind of flow control other than while loops

507324
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.0.5 gecko 2008120122 firefox 3.0.5

507324
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.0.5 gecko 2008120122 firefox 3.0.5

507354
selected	listbox
i am writing a winforms app in which a user selected an item from a listbox and edits some data that forms part of an associated object

507359
operators	keyword
as you don t have a marker as such in this case i imagine a solution could involve the following-sibling keyword and the mod operators

507367
cassini	iis
i m sure installing iis or cassini on the client would work but i was hoping for a simpler solution

507377
constructor	object
if your code assumes that object instance is always added to game objects container directly after creation for example in constructor

507383
textbox	button
i was wondering how would it be possible to add the functionality to wpf common controls like button textbox listbox items etc

507387
arguments	default
both -r and the directory arguments are optional directory default to .

507404
webserver	host
this is a webserver that acts as a host for the asp.net runtime

507413
any	set
so to check for any permission you should see if that bit is set

507432
credentials	security
if you think that it s related to security credentials you can use this code to solve this problem

507437
sql-server	oracle
for instance if the set of oracle ids is small but the sql-server set is large you make a linked server to the oracle side and execute this on the sql-server side

507437
sql-server	oracle
in this case if the oracle side is large or cannot be prefiltered before the need to join with the sql-server side the performance will normally be pretty poor - and will improve a lot by pulling the entire table or the minimal subset you can determine into a sql-server table instead and do the join all on the sql-server side

507465
put	get
make the static versions of xml s you get over xmlhttprequest and put then into a folder on disk

507472
sql-server	oracle
i do not know much about sql-server but in case of oracle having a foreign key column reduces the performance of data-loading

507490
selected	button
what they have to do is just selected the list of workers and click on a button and it will automate the mailmerge using the field of those workers data from db

507493
constructor	object
when you create your delphi automation server make sure that you use cisingleinstance for the 4th parameter in the constructor of the automaton object

507510
superclass	inherited
it allows you to add new data structure and process logic without modifying the existing code as long as the new class inherited the same superclass

507526
pixels	line
almost solves this problem -- but the line that previously would have wrapped are now about 3 pixels further left than those above them again only in ie

507528
value	field
i have been trying to use decimal value as params for a field attributes but i get a compiler error

507541
javascript	dom
i send html and javascript code back from the server to the client and the client will inject the html into a div - and inject the javascript into the dom using this

507555
contains	elements
its rule is that if an elements contains only a single textnode no extra whitespace will be added

507564
value	field
if a boolean value is true false i want it to enable disable other model field

507564
radio-button	selected
so is_absolute_time and is_relative_time would be radio-buttons in the same grouping in the gui and their two corresponding fields would only be editable when their radio-button is selected

507574
margins	padding
you may use padding on the containers but no margins

507631
document	element
the only element that can go in the document object s child list is the single root documentelement html

507631
document	element
instead append the scripting to an element inside the document such as the body

507641
linux	uname
where the target syst is defined the variable uname is defined and is usually linux but might also by cygwin or osf1 and the variables difort and err_arch are also defined

507669
reflection	runtime
i am looking for a way to dynamically load assembles for reflection instantiation and invocation from an unknown network share at runtime

507671
show	next
i need to be aware of how each methods will affect the way i program the site using ruby-on-rails since if i do consolidate there will be essentially 4 levels of categories in a single table but that definitely seems more manageable than separate tables for each level since apart from subclass which directly links to product blocks they don t do anything except show the next level of category under them

507678
contains	elements
i s basically an old trick used in games programming where you load a single bitmap contains all the states of some item you need to draw the advantage is that this way the image get s preloaded and there s no delay when you need to actually use it in the case of css it s normally implemented by using the image as background to the elements and applying different offsets and bounds on hover active and normal classes

507696
display	width
to the li tell ie6 to make the a 100 in width and tell all browsers to display the a as a block instead

507708
margins	padding
a solution i ve used in the past involves setting up a fake margins padding for one of the columns

507729
visual-studio	release-mode
while in debug configuration there is a debug defined constant automatically defined by visual-studio while there is no such constant defined for release-mode

507731
enterprise	licensing
filemaker is certainly cheaper than some enterprise solutions in licensing costs

507731
licensing	platform
the development life-cycle is typically order of magnitude lower than other enterprise platform whatever the licensing costs of those platform

507731
oracle	mysql
while filemaker is non-standard it does support live connection to mysql ms sql server and oracle

507745
arrays	loops
you could either loops over the rows or just load it all into an arrays and sort it

507754
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following javascript that works perfectly under ie google-chrome safari and opera but dies in firefox by forcing the page to reload client side it redraws all elements

507761
sql-server	oracle
- tight data integration with sql-server but it handles anything .net can oracle odbc etc... just fine

507761
csv	xml
- export to a variety of formats xml csv excel pdf etc...

507761
webserver	security
it runs it s own webserver based off the iis core but is closer to a stand alone app - so the security issues aren t a problem

507770
constructor	object
when you create your delphi automation server make sure that you use cisingleinstance for the 4th parameter in the constructor of the automaton object

507774
.net	wcf
i am interested to know if it is possible to use wcf on the server but consume it with .net remoting on the client side

507778
put	get
you don t care what a bag is made of or what it does when you put your stuff in it as long as the bag performs the job of being a bag and you can get your stuff back out

507812
buffering	streaming
the streaming handles the buffering management end-of-data conditions and connection management

507815
playstation	xbox
i am placing a bounty and will award it if you can point me to some sample code that i can use to server photos and or video content to a media client like xbox 360 playstation 3 media centering or media centering extenders

507820
32-bit	64bit
possibly better suited for rack overflow but from a developer s point of view what are the advantages and disadvantages of running iis serving both legacy classic asp and .net as a 32-bit process instead of a 64bit process on a 64bit windows host

507821
any	set
is there a way i can set a url domain blacklist for any content inside an iframe

507854
configuration	installation
having a config.py module which is responsible for parsing this configuration file and which other code in your application imports and queries for settings is appropriate -- but having the user edit this config.py on installation really isn t

507857
put	get
i ve found bigger impacts can usually be made by adjusting the way pages are put together particularly in reducing how much images get cut up into little pieces to reduce the number of requests

507859
keyboard	mouse
you can use the quartz events system to install application-specific or system-wide event taps which let you monitor and inject keyboard and mouse events at a pretty low level

507862
.net	wcf
anyone willing to help me out with pros cons on .net remoting web services and wcf

507866
constructor	object
when initializing object from xaml first the default constructor is called then the properties are set on the object

507867
groovy	java
java will work but it gets the juices going when you see how less verbose the code is in groovy

code-coverage	ncover
emma is a free java code-coverage tool and there s ncover for .net

507899
click	mouse
a series of two click of the mouse

507907
any	set
this quick example won t use any binding because the value isn t set up until after the default constructor is called but here s how you can get the text to show up

507913
any	set
is there any way to set the payload of an http-post within flex

507937
put	get
so it s generally best to just go get a resource as if you know for sure it exists and put your development time in to making sure your exception-handling handler does a nice job with the failures

507957
.net	wcf
i actually switched our software from traditional .net remoting to wcf

507957
.net	wcf
before moving to wcf i thought about using just a traditional .net webservice but the interfaces we implimented for our remoting calls would require to much modification we had used some out and ref parameters which an asp.net webservice cant do if i am not mistaken

507957
json	xml
i like my wcf service because with one service i can either serve up json or soap xml and all the protocols are supported ipc tcp and http

507968
internet-explorer	firefox
i have it working in firefox but internet-explorer returns the following error

507986
nvidia	ati
if your gpus are all the same brand you might be able to get gpgpu support from the vendor either through nvidia s cuda or ati s stream

507992
arrays	loops
using a for-in loops means dealing with anything that might bubble up the prototype chain and trying to figure out if it s part of this arrays

508004
png	gif
object oriented handling of multimedia files mp3 jpg gif png flv wmv without writing my own wrappers for everything

508004
perl	php
when answering don t just say php perl can do all this and more but please provide a little recommendation for each of these points

508021
internet-explorer	firefox
it s not happening in internet-explorer - just firefox

508053
selected	button
when the user clicks the button depending on the value they ve selected i d like to either let the button cause a normal postback or trigger a modalpopupextender and cancel the button postback

508054
constructor	object
i am creating an object that has a constructor like this.

508054
callback	methods
i am doing this because i want businesslogicsubclass to callback to varying methodss within businesslogic when it completes one methods or another

508059
any	set
yes there is a way to set the payload of an http-post within flex and to upload files of any format to your server

508066
display	width
what differs is the way software displays them typically this is the equivalent width of four spaces characters and this also assumes that the display is using a fixed width font such as courier new

508070
enterprise	platform
if you re on a windows platform and you have the visual-studio enterprise edition you can use the application center test tool as well

508072
inherited	subclass
it s not really clear why you re creating a subclass within the class itself though - i suspect your inherited hierarchy might not be ideal

508089
constructor	object
use lazy instantiation to prevent passing this in the original constructor which is not a good idea for a not properly constructed object - although could be ok depending on what else is going on

508113
constructor	object
so the constructor is marked private so the only way to construct the object is via a call to the static method like this.

508120
preventdefault	onsubmit
the problem with onsubmit still continues when i even use preventdefault option

508122
value	field
the coalesce statement does exactly what you are wanting to do in your example it tests for null in the field and then provides a different value if it is null

508126
gethashcode	equals
given this implementation of equals how do you correctly implement gethashcode

508135
put	get
basically some other people who have control over the repository and therefore get to decide what goes in there put a directory in there that really didn t need to be in there

508172
directory	folder
if you rename the .svn directory in the bad folder and then run an update svn will skip over the directory and say it was deleted even though it s still there

508182
compatibility	platform
we just test all our stuff on multiple platform browsers to ensure compatibility across the board

508188
seam	jsf
seam is a superset of jsf and introduces a new conversation scope for

508190
latex	tex
the tex language is really alien to programming but it s easy to write a python scripting that generates the needed latex layout and processes it

508192
arrays	loops
using your sample data doing a loops on the outer arrays then using array_diff_assoc on the users each time through

508199
linux	unix
i couldn t agree more freetds does exactly what you want to do here is a brief description of the product freetds is a set of libraries for unix and linux that allows your programs to natively talk to microsoft sql-server and sybase databases.

508205
linux	unix
on most unix linux systems you simply add aliases to your etc aliases file

508221
priority-queue	heap
personal note a friend of mine and i once wrote a paper explaining a new priority-queue which attempted to replicate the theoretical running time of fibonacci heap without their complexity

508221
data-structures	priority-queue
the paper was never published but my coauthor did implement binary heaps fibonacci heaps and our own priority-queue to compare the data-structures

508229
value	field
i m trying to work out a way to display the contents of the version column from sharepoint the value that changes every time a file is checked in as a field or something similar inside of a word document

508230
versioning	upgrade
before 1.5.x releases your repository was automatically upgrade to the latest versioning when you access them with a later versioning

508272
configuration	environment
to answer point 3 the setting that causes all the assemblies in the bin folder to be loaded on first access can be found in the file c winnt microsoft.net framework v2.0.50727 configuration web.configuration depending on your environment

508273
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome uses dep data execution protection but firefox does not

508276
any	set
i have my editor setup to be textmate but when i do a git diff it uses vi to show me the diff output is there any way to set it to show the diff in textmate

508290
hide	show
additionally you will need to hide the form until a user action requests it to be show

508311
linux	osx
that s true for windows osx linux and any other os you can think of

508314
value	field
if all you want is to gray out or disable a certain field based on the value of another field this is purely a presentation user-interface issue so the templates and or javascript is the appropriate place to handle it

508314
value	field
then your model save code or your form clean code or your templates could use this dictionary to determine which field should be enabled disabled depending on the value of which other one

508319
internet-explorer	google-chrome
firefox opera internet-explorer safari google-chrome etc

508319
double	int
you can log arrays strings int double etc

508372
binary-search	quicksort
quicksort is o n 2 worst case and o n log n average case binary-search is o log n etc

508378
nested-loops	loops
for code i ask myself if there is a way to turn nested-loopss into a single loops or from a loops to using a divide and conquer approach

508385
queue	fifo
they re the same for practical purposes with the difference that a queue is fifo

508386
callback	methods
and more specifically what is the methods to force the callback to marshalled back to the calling thread

508393
put	get
also don t put sensitive information in the query string only option with get because it shows up in the address bar bookmarks and server logs

508436
any	set
not sure if you re set on using t4 for any particular reason but i ended up using codesmith for code generation because there are several templates already available

508441
ubuntu	linux
i ve been trying to move a project over from xcode to linux ubuntu x86 for now but hopefully the statically-linked executable will run on an x86 centos machine

508446
put	get
had to pull out some sensitive lines so i wouldn t get canned and put them back in the wrong order

508450
perl	php
i think php would easily be able to cope with such a project like leon said its support for multimedia might not be quite as good as perl but for the rest of the stuff it should definitely be good

508457
interpreter	runtime
look at the larger number of commercial enterprises writing javascript interpreter compiler runtime as well as the advancements of the language itself

508460
configuration	installation
auto-props affect the svn add and svn import actions and are set using the runtime configuration which are specified through either command line options or in the config file for subversion found in the subversion installation conf directory

508473
python	lua
at least python and lua have this problem

508473
communication	messages
it s usually much better to refactor in several separate processes that communication via small messages

508475
order	add
and then you have to add oledbparameters in the correct order

508478
adplus	dump
either attach windbg to the process or use adplus to get a hang dump of the process

508478
adplus	dump
if you choose adplus you then load the dump in windbg

508489
linked-list	tree
the linked-list structure makes ui and business layer programming easier and more maintainable in most cases since linked-lists and tree are the natural way to represent this data in languages that the ui and business layers would typically be implemented in

508507
inline-assembly	assembly
try producing a listing with c code that has an uses a label as a goto target for example with some inline-assembly in the same function - but don t try to access the label from the assembly

508507
inline-assembly	assembly
look at the assembly listing and see if the generated assembly decorates the label name in a way that you might be able to replicate in the inline-assembly

508508
ruby	php
i don t think it will be java too heavy hard to modify vm php too leaky ruby hard to modify vm c++ can t be sandboxed that i know of

508516
logout	login
the actual setting can be made using tools like microsofts shared computer toolkit or similar not so sure how the normal registry auto-login behaves at manual logout but i ve had an xp kiosk that would automatically log on instantly even if you logged out manually - you had to override it using some key like shift+logoff to be able to manually specify the login again so somehow it can be made

508516
credentials	security
this will anyhow require that the user credentials are available to your script which kind of makes it redundant as you compromise the security of that account - defying the purpose of having that second account in the first place for whatever purpose it exists

508537
mousedown	mouseup
please allow me to call these events mouseup and mousedown

508537
click	mouse
short story you don t simply want to know about mouse click

508537
mousedown	mouseup
most often you ll want to perform some processing on mousedown and do some further processing on mouseup

508537
mousedown	mouseup
the trick is that simply tracking mouseup messages is not enough mousedown may not have happened in your windows

508537
mousedown	mouseup
going further up the reasoning you should not rely on receiving a mouse up after you processed mousedown user may have moved the mouse and release the button somewhere else think drag n drop in which case you don t receive the mouseup event.

508537
mousedown	mouseup
unless you capture the mouse on mousedown to make sure you get mouse event up to mouseup even if the mouse left your windows

508537
mousedown	mouseup
all in all you end up tracking mousedown capture the mouse and when you receive mouseup just check if you own the capture

508537
mousedown	mouseup
if not the mouse was either double-clicked no 2nd mousedown or mousedown happened somewhere else hence you most likely don t care about this mouseup

508630
unsigned-integer	int
in c++ i enjoyed having access to a 64 bit unsigned-integer via unsigned long long int or via uint64_t

508639
constructor	private
private static constructor helper methods

508657
python	java
i have a little java problem i want to translate to python

508657
arrays	loops
further values will be created bei loops and written into the arrays

508658
base-class	inherited
it seems inefficient to populate a collection of bo s that size but the only other ways would seem to be to return partially populate bo s with just the fields you need for a particular user-interface which would be hard to manage if you have alot of similar user-interface requser-interfacerements or make a base-class like mybusinessobjectheader that contains the fields then make mybusinessobject inherited it and implement the rest of the fields but this would tie it your user-interface too much it seems

508661
getter	setter
the record class has setter getter i feel like i need a helper function somewhere to help it serialization the whole class

508666
any	set
you can give it a 864k vector full of zeros and just set any one point to 1 and it will plot correctly in real-time with zooms and pans

508668
constructor	object
my guess is that until a constructor has been called for every level of the heierarchy the object is in an invalid state

508686
primitive	int
parseint returns primitive int

508687
constructor	object
you can gain access to arguments and local variables if you allocated the constructor stack frames in reverse order from derived classes to base classes but this would require all frames to be active at the same time wasting memory for every object construction to allow for the rare case of code that wants to touch local variables before base classes are constructed

508688
primitive	int
the difference is valueof returns an int and parseint returns an int a primitive type

508694
cos	sin
y1 sin x +.02 cos 200 x +0.001 sin 2000 x +0.0001 cos 20000 x

508700
dictionary	arrays
if you are ok using sparse arrays you could use a dictionary to store your values

508700
dictionary	arrays
python dictionarys allow you to use tuples as keys as such you could assign to and access elements of the sparse arrays which is really a dictionary here like this

508701
primitive	int
however valueof string returns a new int object whereas parseint string returns a primitive int

508701
double	int
now if what you want is the object and not the primitive then using valueof string may be more attractive than making a new object out of parseint string because the former is consistently present across int long double etc

508726
build-process	nant
i do asp.net so i use cruisecontrol.net with nant for my build-process

508736
webforms	asp.net
i use several user controls along with standard asp.net controls to build my webforms

508737
linux	osx
tls is implemented very differently on windows than on linux and will be very different again on osx

508747
constructor	object
retrieval of a full object can be used by passing a digest object to a type conversion or factory or constructor - whatever techniques you are using

508758
getter	setter
intellij can generate all the getter setter for me

508768
updatepanel	gridview
i don t konw of anything that lets you do that with the gridview out of the box except the updatepanel but that doesn t really count

508776
getter	setter
the bloat in java code is caused by other things than getter and setter

508796
any	set
i don t see any easy yui replacement for this feature set

508810
telnet	tcp
my first thoughts are using a virtual com port driver to redirect to a telnet or other tcp session - i could then have a tcp server that pretends to go through the fax motions

508816
conditional	operators
the key to this solution is using the conditional operators a

508861
updating	updates
as the number of clients is potentially large updating needs to be easy preferably so that all instances can be updates in one go

508879
base-class	inherited
borrowing from the code in the other question and assuming that all your user-controls can be made to inherited from the same base-class you could do this

508879
base-class	inherited
then update your user-controls to inherited from your base-class instead of user-controls

508897
driver	kernel
developing a virtual com driver means developing a kernel driver unless you can buy one off the shelf which is doable i did it but i d guess it s far more trouble than it s worth i d be surprised if it s worth your while

508897
telnet	tcp
which means that redirecting this traffic via telnet with the tcp timers and buffers either breaks the fax session at worst faxman will time out or at best mean that your testing isn t representative of what the real-world non-emulated performance will be

508910
constructor	private
alternatively you could cheat by calling a private static method to do the computations for your constructor

508972
version-control	cvs
in many version-control systems including cvs perforce accurev mercurial and team foundation server the command is annotate

508979
authentication	login
this is working for me using forms-authentication the user gets redirected to the default login page if not authentication

508982
.when	ready
.when each stage of the computation on the clusters is done it will some how notify the cs that a specific file is ready

508990
typedef	struct
if you really must typedef a struct and most programmers that i work with would notâ¹ do this

508992
scriptmanager	updatepanel
there is nested listviews and i want to register a button in the second listview to scriptmanager for updateing the updatepanel inside the masterpage

508994
google-chrome	opera
all works fine in all major browsers opera safari ie6 ie7 ff3 but not in google-chrome

508994
scriptmanager	updatepanel
after a few attempts i discover that it isn t a problem of the updatepanel but it seems that the autopostback of dropdowns doesn t work properly even in pages without scriptmanager and updatepanel..

508995
lightbox	jquery
i am working on a web-site where i use the slimbox2 plug-in similar to lightbox for jquery to generate photo enlargements

509003
getter	setter
although you can override the methods in setter and getter few ever do

509003
getter	setter
i still average one setter getter every class or two but not enough to make me feel that a new programming structure is justified

509026
perl	php
supports perl + php by default

509026
httpserver	webserver
httpserver on usb is a fully configured webserver that runs from your usb-key

509026
windows-xp	windows
windows 2000 windows-xp or windows 2003

509032
savepoints	rollback
if you issued a savepoints changed data and rollback to the savepoints the transaction still lives

509046
attributes	properties
is there an attributes i need to add to the properties

509049
any	set
so is there any configuration setting that i can set to allow this to happen or should manually enter each and every urlpattern-to-servlet mapping in the web.xml

509053
constructor	object
my guess is that until a constructor has been called for every level of the heierarchy the object is in an invalid state

509053
constructor	object
actually it is possible to construct object in java without calling every constructor in the hierarchy although not with the new keyword

509053
constructor	object
for example when java s serialization constructs an object during deserialization it calls the constructor of the first non-serializable class in the hierarchy

509053
constructor	object
you can also use the objenesis library to instantiate object without calling the constructor

509057
implements	extends
another reason is that it makes refactoring so much easier especially in cases where you want to implements or extends a generic framework through inherited or delegation

509095
configuration	logging
if i have a process that is reading from a configuration db logging to a logging db and moving transactions in and out of various dbs based on type how do i partition the cpu usage

509096
python	java
for the cluster infrastructure you re probably better off using python or another scripting language than java

509103
hide	show
you can then show and hide them get messages from them about selection changes etc

509104
polynomials	algebra
i recommend the book modern computer algebra by zur gathen and gerhard although it is really more concerned with arithmetic in special forms polynomials integers matrices than general symbolic manipulation

509104
scheme	lisp
when you re starting out you may actually be better helped by looking at some lisp or scheme tutorial because symbolic math is conceptually very straightforward to do in lisp and to build a symbolic engine in python you ll more or less have to implement a mini-lisp as a foundation

509107
any	set
in fact i can t imagine any reason to set the type of a variables to hashmap instead of map

509116
profiling	trace
turn on xdebug in your development and enjoy profiling stack trace and if your ide supports it breakpoints

509120
uninstaller	inno-setup
if you use wise you will generate default scriptinging that you can then add windows-installer conditional to and control the events to a finer degree install repair modify uninstaller so that they call equivalent actions on your inno-setup install scripting which would need to be install into and kept in a temporary folder

509122
getter	setter
when defining a property with non-trivial setter and getter or how to disambiguate foo if the the declaring type also contains a property called foo

509128
updating	updates
it generally works fine if you re querying and updating in the same scope but if you get an object cache it and then try to updates it later you can t

509168
xsl-fo	xslt
ok i downloaded the syntext xsd and put it in the same directory that has my xslt which generates xslt-fo in it and its working using the visual-studio editor

509170
for-loop	loops
using a java 5 for-loops you can rewrite your loops as follows

509189
put	get
unless i get another really good idea today i want to turn this into a stored procedure and also put together a version as a table-valued function using a temp table to put all the results in one resultset for selected queries only

509217
webserver	host
i m assuming you have a host and are not running your own webserver domain name registration lol

509218
subtract	time
subtract t1 from current time

509219
implements	extends
i want to add support for http authentication password protected directory on the server but i don t know how to implements this - i assume i need to extends the class somehow but on how to i m a little lost

509238
put	get
to get the definition you can run this hit ctrl-t first to put the results pane into text mode

509257
listbox	textbox
i ve done this many times with a textbox but it took awhile to figure it out for a listbox

509260
environment	building
i wish i only had to know the nuts and bolts of setting up my development and building environment

509266
administration	sysadmin
system administration being a full on sysadmin

509266
debugging	trace
networking principles and techniques you d be amazed how handy a packet trace can be when debugging something...

509291
python	java
the python folks may be able to get away with breaking old code but that s not java s way.

509293
16-bit	8bit
however if it doesn t you can encode your 16-bit values as two 8bit pairs with gl_luminance_alpha and decode it again inside a shader

509295
contains	elements
for example if you ask for and a only contains one elements you get an empty list instead of an error

509310
physics-engine	box2d
while the game is basically a wrapper for the popular box2d physics-engine it does have one feature that i m curious about how it is implemented

509311
low-level	hardware
if you re doing low-level device drivers it s vital that you understand the underlying hardware

509319
updating	updates
it takes more work to set it up if you haven t from the start but if you re doing the proper mvp thing that child add form should triggers an updates in your model which your controllers observes which reacts by updating that portion of the view

509366
jquery	.post
you ll need ajax since the jquery tabs don t .post back to the server

509400
administration	account
technically if you want to see if the member is the local administration account then you can get the security identifier sid of the current user through the user property on the windowsidentity class like so the static getcurrent methods gets the current windows user

509400
administration	account
then you would check to see if the sid has the following pattern indicating it is the local administration account which is a well-known sid

509405
postback	ajax
however you can use something like the updatepanel to make asynchronous ajax postback behind the scenes and the updatepanel will handle fixing the control state each time

509407
updatepanel	gridview
its definately doable using jquery and ajax and could be very nice it will take some significant work since you can t really use the gridview unless you use an updatepanel

509407
jquery	.post
.post a comment if your interested in doing the jquery ajax route i can provide a sample

509428
cvs	git
i d check git svn cvs logs for the few most recent changes you made and look for anything that might be slowing down queries

509433
placeholder	required
that s why many of the examples you see out there including mine attach name john+doe -- it s just a placeholder for some data that urlrequest seems to required when setting any custom http-headers

509435
enumerator	any
when we get data from the web service any property that uses this enumerator is null instead of admin or 1

509440
arguments	default
by default on the jconsole the arguments are display as p1 p2 p3 etc

509440
textbox	button
i have registered the above mxbean and when i launch the panel for this operation i get a button with getinput as the text and 2 textbox with names as p1 and p2 instead of input one and input two

509454
any	set
if it is set to true you can just draw your image any way you want

509493
versioning	packaging
i m convinced jpeglib is used in a lot more places on this system and it s simply the versioning from the repositories so i m hesitant to say that this is a bug in jpeglib or the ubuntu packaging

509494
python	ruby
when microsoft gets around to releasing the dlr and related languages are you planning on utilising those languages such as iron ruby or iron python

509522
aspect-ratio	scale
sometimes when i have to scale the video down on the client size height or width less then videoheight or videowidth keeping the aspect-ratio flash player makes text look blurry

509524
python	ruby
main motivation is to reuse existing code and libraries already implemented in ruby and python with easier interaction with other code written in c#

509526
tcp-ip	tcp
this says that all requests for http uris over tcp-ip should be addressed to tcp port 80 on the hostname www.example.com

509526
xmpp	sip
the srv record is a required part of sip and is commonly used for jabber xmpp

509527
python	ruby
portability or is it still python ruby etc

509529
margins	padding
i ve now made sure padding margins border on both elements are set the same

509553
google-chrome	safari
this happens because microsoftajax.js does browser detection and it s incorrectly detecting google-chrome as safari

509553
google-chrome	safari
be sure to put the google-chrome check before safari

509579
primitive	int
i suspect that javascript treats primitive such as strings and int differently to hash

509596
firefox	safari
only works in firefox 3.1 and above though i think safari is heading in the same direction

509598
base-class	subclass
when defining my expression class i want some degree of type-safety and therefore don t want to use object for the operand object type so i am considering defining an abstract operand base-class with nothing in it and creating a subclass for each type of operand

509616
contains	any
it says that access to protected members can be made via this or any object of the same type as the class that contains the methods

509619
positioning	embed
one way this could be done is to embed the positioning of the program counter in the parsing tree

509640
host	dns
for the host and target the dns server won t like that

509685
punctuation	comma
british american punctuation style are comma inside the quotes or outside

509689
perl	c++
background recently while looking at a structured text editor i noticed they used a trick to change python perl c++ java et al

509691
parsing	comma
of course the csv parsing saw the comma and took the value as 1

509700
embedded-database	hsqldb
you could use an embedded-database hsqldb or h2 database and

509700
annotations	mapping
test if the annotations mapping is correct as in the sessionfactory can be started

509723
document	editing
i am using client-side vbscript functions to handle some of the editing functions including saving the document to a folder on the server

509729
methods	extend
sending methods from one place to another include extend etc...

509764
multiplying	modulo
note that i multiplying the result of the modulo operation by 1.0 to ensure that a floating point division operation is done rather than integer division which will result in 0

509767
any	set
sounds like a memory leak but when we shut down the application fastmm is set with reportmemoryleakonshutdown true and it doesn t report any abnormal memory-leaks

509769
markup	xhtml
this horror interposes valid xhtml html and pre-html3.2 tagsoup hiding markup with css comments

509780
primitive	boolean
strings numbers and boolean as well as null and undefined are primitive objects are everything which can have properties

509825
any	set
a width for the table must be set but any extra width is simply taken by the fluid cell s

509834
python	ruby
while i ve never used ruby or rubycocoa for that matter my understanding is that cocoa is written with objective-c as the primary language and the bridges python and ruby come in second

509836
division	modulo
you ve confused division and modulo

509836
integer	modulus
modulus is the remainder left over after integer division

509842
contains	any
so making a system call that contains any user data at all requires a lot of sanity-checking and it s easy to make a mistake

509845
malloc	free
it can be much easier to deal with than malloc free but it doesn t allow the laziness that java and scripting languages engender

509854
debugging	trace
we have a very high-performance multithreading .net http handler application and want to enable trace logging for debugging

509858
perl	php
you are going to have a much easier time implementing it with an mvc perl app than with php

509874
children	nodes
this is similar to a depth-first tree traversal where the children of a tree nodes are the vertices larger than the largest vertex in the current clique.

509875
attributes	properties
yep you ll find the insert and update properties on a few ar attributes

509922
seam	jsf
i am expecting to use jms with mdbs session beans stateful and stateless jpa and i am really excited about using jsf with seam

509938
sql-server	ms-access
ideally whatever it is would work in both sql-server and ms-access so querying for the last identity might not work...

509943
pppoe	ppp
i was stuck in determining whether state machine is hadle by ppp stack means i have design base-class for pppstack in which fsm encode decode etc is there or pppoe which is derived from my ppp base-class pppstack

509943
pppoe	ppp
ppp frame encoding in done in ppp itself and pppoe of which ppp frame is add after discovery and start of session

509971
ruby	php
i also love the php ruby subversion and git plugins.

509976
deployment	install
it s when i run create a setup deployment project run the install and then try to run the program that it still crashes

509989
32-bit	64bit
allows to specify explicitly through path only which version of the app to launch if there is a 32-bit and 64bit version

509989
32-bit	64bit
user will need to provide seperate information about whether this is a 64bit app or 32-bit

509991
administration	account
by default account that have local administrator rights on the server will also be ssas admins so such an account should be able to access the server in management studio and add other users as ssas administration

509991
ssas	olap
if this option is turned off a server admin can always navigate to .. program files microsoft sql-server mssql.x olap configuration and change the builtinadminsareserveradmins setting from 0 to 1 in the msmdsrv.ini file and restart the ssas service and then add other admins in management studio

510006
tuples	set
i then replaced the closingperiod call with tail existing time . year - week - date . date 1 .item 0 .item 0 what this does is to get the set of date members that exist in the current context the tail call then gets the last on of these as a single member set and the .item 0 .item 0 calls get the first member from the first tuples of that set

510031
variables	boolean
are boolean variables thread-safe for reading and writing from any thread

510032
gstreamer	vlc
i m not sure for vlc but banshee a c# gtk multimedia app uses gstreamer to embed videos in its interface

510044
any	set
if i set that to say 1000 pixels and tell flex to only show a single data tip that sometimes works but frequently the nearest data point is not one in the series on which the user is hovering and in any case it starts acting odd with such a high mousesensitivity

510076
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m pretty sure that these rely on the postback model in webforms and wouldn t be compatible with asp.net-mvc views

510076
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you can mix match webforms with asp.net-mvc views in the same web site if needed but i wouldn t recommend it

510097
value	field
therefore you may end up actually validating the first email field s value when submitting the second form

510149
checkbox	button
however maybe you should just check all checkbox after a submit button click then it may be simpler

510156
command-line	cmd
create a new shell using cmd k java com.example.myapp this is the best solution i found so far but leaves an extra shell environment when invoked from the command-line so that calling exit doesn t actually close the shell

510165
selected	checkbox
i want to make this dynamic so the user will be able to selected column1 etc by using checkbox

510165
value	field
cause i know that the table report item you have to set the value of field that is going to be display

510193
put	get
why do i get the following error when i try to put the same figure into the a0poster document

510194
sharing	share
i prefer phone or skype in order to make things clearly for sharing data if you want to easily share screen with a tool you might already have use netmeeting

510198
ethernet	packets
i am building an ethernet application in which i will be sending packets from one side and receiving it on the other side

510216
default-value	default
i can set default values in my root.plist file using the default-value property but these only get used the first time the user opens the settings app

510224
version-control	git
or both sides working against a version-control repository subversion or git like was mentioned here already and keep updating that on the server

510225
administration	account
this account is far more limited than local system or even administration but still has the right to access the network as the machine see caveat above

510225
administration	account
completely trusted account more so than the administration account

510225
any	set
the general issue with running as a standard out of the box account is that if you modify any of the default permissions you re expanding the set of things everything running as that account can do

510225
activation	account
in your specific case the issue that you are probably seeing is that the the dcom or com+ activation is limited to a given set of account

510225
windows-xp	windows
in windows-xp sp2 windows server 2003 and above the activation permission was restricted significantly

510225
windows-vista	windows
that capability only was added with task scheduler 2.0 which only exists in windows-vista windows server 2008 and newer

510244
pipe	tail
pipe the output of tail -f into sed and add in some ansi escape codes

510261
python	lua
on top of this are the plethora of api s that often have many different ways of doing the same thing std library boost .net wxwidgets cocoa carbon native script libraries for python lua etc opengl direct3d gdi aqua augh

510261
python	c++
especially outside the realm of c++ and python i find myself programming more by looking at manuals that from memory

510261
c++	lua
good ways to remember when you switch from lua to c++ you need to start using semi-colons again

510265
cgpoint	cgrect
i ve found nsstringfrom helpful when logging struct like cgrect cgpoint etc

510272
mousedown	mouseup
i want to enable controls in my next button mousedown and then disable them at my next button mouseup

510317
breadth-first-search	depth-first-search
you can use any depth-first-search or breadth-first-search algorithm and continue searching till you have visited every vertex in the graph

510322
decrement	increment
without locking no operation is thread-safe that involves loading a value then changing it then writing it back increment or decrement a number clearing or setting an element in a set - they are all not thread-safe

510322
interlocked	atomicity
there is a number of functions that allow for atomicity operations interlocked increment interlocked decrement and interlocked exchange

510322
decrement	increment
the functions operate on integers so you can have atomicity increment decrement and exchange of integers 32-bit with them

510329
default-value	default
if i understood you correctly you want to avoid having default values specified twice once as default-value keys in your settings.bundle root.plist file and once in your app initialization code so you do not have to keep them in sync

510342
activerecord	datamapper
propel uses the activerecord pattern not the datamapper pattern so your domain objects end up with a lot more persistence responsibility and afaik it does not include a unit of work facility

510360
subclassing	base-class
i don t think you can force any subclassing to override any of the base-class s virtual methods unless those methods are abstract

510364
linux	osx
here s a link to a site that says how you can read a single character in windows linux and osx

510377
c++	lua
the extern c specification is needed when you want to use a library that has been compiled as c code for example the pre-compiled lua binaries from a c++ project

510377
c++	lua
can you simply compile lua yourself either within your vc solution or as a separate project as c++ code

510378
highlight	selected
how to check whether user has pressed control key in javascript and highlight all the selected rows

510425
communication	messages
communication treating messages to be

510446
any	set
if your view controllers is retaining any subviews of the top-level view then you may want to override the view controllers s setview methods check if the view is being set to nil and if so release subviews that you were retaining

510448
installation	building
in general i check in the most minimal set of whatever i d need -- given a clean flexbuildinger installation or none at all -- for example if i were compiling instead with mxmlc or compc and an empty project -- to building the project successfully

510462
processor	cpu
now in a multi-core system it could be that after measuring time1 the thread is scheduled to a different processor whose counter is less than that of the previous cpu

510485
updating	updates
the database should use an update triggers to decide if a row can be updates - this would prevent any one updating the row from the back tables accidentally

510497
put	get
if i set the function to static when i try and put this.errormsg.text error i get this error an object reference is required for the non-static field methods or property

510539
msbuild	nant
if you move to delphi 2007 msbuild has a bigger advantage over nant since the delphi projects are in the msbuild format

510550
firefox	opera
firefox and opera and i m sure the newest ie display new windows as a new tab unless otherwise specified by user preference

510581
keyboard	mouse
the input can come from different sources mouse keyboard prepared for multi-touch

510590
perl	tcl
for instance i use the man command for perl tcl tk and various flavours of unix and linux the online language reference manual for ada apple developer resources for objective-c and cocoa

510600
contains	set
when a form is posted back to the server is it possible to manipulate change set the values contains in http-post in the controllers action

510600
value	field
i would like to remove certain textbox value entered by the user so that these value always have to be re-entered password field

510609
actionscript	mxml
my problem is that i dont know how to access the methods in the actionscript section of my main mxml class from my actionscript class any ideas

510625
search-engine	seo
note that i didn t use response.redirect this is done for the sake of seo as response.redirect always returns status 302 which means the object was moved temporary while status 301 means the object was moved permanently this will keep the pagerank of your pages from being divided between the www and the non-www versions if search-engine crawlers can access the page using both the www and the non-www urls they will divide your pagerank between the two hence is the use of 301 which search-engine crawlers understand and will keep your pagerank to only the www version of your site

510630
uilabel	uiview
one way to do it which i used recently is to create a uiview subclass which simply draws a rounded rectangle and then make the uilabel or in my case uitextview a subview inside of it

510632
dictionary	map
from what i understand hashtable is an old implementation extending the obsolete dictionary class which has been adapted later to fit the map interface

510657
nsstring	nsdata
on mac os x and probably also on iphone os the defaults database can only contains property list objects nsstring nsnumber nsarray nsdictionary and nsdata

510664
children	nodes
each knowledge nodes can have any number of knowledge nodess as children 1 sorted parent child relation

510664
groovy	java
still this simple application takes several weeks if not months to code in any language which i ve encountered so far groovy java python tcl tk grails openoffice ms access treeline turbogears 10 enthought traits 11 .net

510664
python	java
python got almost all what it needs but for some reason it never really became as mainstream as say java

510665
put	get
collections.synchronizedmap map synchronizes all operations get put size etc

510675
concurrenthashmap	hashmap
however don t think that concurrenthashmap is a simple alternative for a hashmap with a typical synchronized block as shown above

510677
uitableview	uitextview
this might have something to do with the fact that uitextview and uitableview are both subclasses of uiscrollview

510677
uitableview	uitextview
if you absolutely have to have a uitextview inside a uitableview perhaps disabling scrolling on one of them might also fix the problem

510695
iteration	elements
the concurrenthashmap uses very sophisticated techniques to reduce the need for synchronization and allow parallel read access by multiple threads without synchronization and more importantly provides an iterator that requires no synchronization and even allows the map to be modified during interation though it makes no guarantees whether or not elements that were inserted during iteration will be returned

510714
multiplication	division
actually the opposite is often suggested as a performance optimization using shifts to implements multiplication division by a power of 2

510714
multiplication	division
but any half-decent compiler will do that for you so you should absolutely not do it manually keeping your code clear is the most important thing so use multiplication and division if you re doing math and use bit shifts if you re manipulating bits

510715
multiplying	division
if you did use the multiplication or division option you would clearly need to comment why you are suddenly multiplying value by seemingly random numbers

510721
subtract	add
you can use normal relative positioning and use + or - to add to or subtract from properties

510765
hide	show
once the application has completed loading i want the splashform to hide or me sent to the back and the main from to be show

510781
multiplication	division
as others have said a modern compiler will probably produce the same output whether you use shifts or multiplication division

510796
arguments	default
you have to call the constructor of the base class explicitly if the base class doesn t have a default constructor one with no arguments

510796
instance-variables	subclass
and don t redefine customer as an instance-variables of the subclass

510816
superclass	subclass
you have to invoke the superclass constructor otherwise java won t know what constructor you are calling to build the superclass on the subclass

510817
python	java
if you want something easier to maintain go with java or python or ruby or you name it

510830
pascal	delphi
delphi rad studio and lazarus ide for pascal delphi language

510839
classname	inherited
is it acceptable to use the word base in a classname which is a the bottom of the inherited tree

510839
base-class	inherited
for example if i am refactoring certain elements from myclassa and myclassb into a common base-class i d be tempted to create a mybaseclass from which the two inherited

510842
command-line	cmd
you are mixing two totally different things the cmd to be executed and its representation in the cmd-line

510842
command-line	cmd
by default scons prints the command-line but if you split the command-line you are changing the cmd executed

510852
windows-vista	windows
where can i get the default dsn folder in windows-vista and or windows 2008

510854
png	gif
developer notes this tests the case where gif input is automagically converted to png

510888
32-bit	x86
using i386 is rather compiler dependant and won t detect non x86 32-bit archs

510888
cross-compiling	scons
assuming the python interpreter used by scons runs on the cpu you are interested in not always the case - think cross-compiling you can just use python itself

510903
firefox	safari
the following css works great in firefox and safari but doesn t in ie6

510907
hide	show
your javascript will need to be waiting for the reply in order to handle it in your example show or hide an error message

510953
double	int
you haven t said what you re trying to parsing int double etc or what options you want allow hex thousands separators etc which makes it harder to give a good list of things to check

510957
javascript	dom
most often the javascript client will use the received information to update small portions of the browser s document using the dom

510968
pascal	delphi
which tool approach would you suggest to convert of a large 16bit windows gui application written in old borland pascal 7 owl to delphi

510968
pascal	delphi
understanding the pretty heavy differences between owl and vcl as well as the differences between the pointer manipulations in 16bit pascal and the state-of-art using of strings and objects in delphi - are there any ways tools which could help to avoid almost complete rewrite of the application

510974
logfile	tail
you would use it against a tail of a logfile and it will print the rate of lines being outputed

510976
subclassing	superclass
and let me explain why i want this say i have a class which has methods test and it can be overriden by subclassing in some cases i want the overriden test and in some cases i want the test of superclass itself there are many ways to do this best suggestions will be helpful

510985
exception-handling	try-catch
if you want to see the exception-handling then why not use the standard parsing methods in a try-catch block which will allow you to view any formatexception-handling etc thrown

510990
value	field
if a field is a value type a bit-by-bit copy of the field is performed

511003
subclassing	superclass
from class sub you can call super.anothermethods bla but you cannot access the methods of the superclass in your main methods - that would be against the whole idea of using subclassing

511012
firefox	gecko
this solution works using css in firefox and the other gecko browsers and css expressions in ie

511012
google-chrome	opera
the header and footer do not stay fixed in opera or safari google-chrome but the whole table is scrollable so it is usable

511012
google-chrome	opera
if you want to experiment with opera safari google-chrome support look at giving the tbody display block and go from there

511051
.when	ready
i personally work locally development adding fixing features and .when i think it s ready i commit to trunk production

511052
subtract	time
so if you were to subtract two datetime objects you would get a timespan object that specifies how much time there is between them

511055
radio-button	selected
another example is a radio button with a label allows you to click on the label and the radio-button will selected if the associatedcontrolid property is set

511071
pointers	stack
with std calling the most common convention for win32 popping stack will reveal the pointers to the address to return to after the function has been called some place in the calling function

511094
actionscript	mxml
im calling an actionscript class from my main mxml file

511098
button	popup
when i click the button it should popup my module when i click outside it will hide or remove it

511103
shared-objects	.so
in your case you can try to upload libmysqlclient_r..so.14 to the host and set ld_library_path accordingly .so tell the dynamic linker which directory to search additionally to the systemd directory when re.solving shared-objects

511109
python	java
if you really want to embed your java app within your python process have a look at jpype

511111
required	checked
granted the built-in voter implementation always only return one of the three constants you mentioned and these are what the standard access decision managers checked for but then they don t really have anything extra to return - the rolevoter for instances will deny access if and only if the principal doesn t have the required role

511127
execute	declare
this declare an anonymous-function in the first parens block which will be a returned object from that paren block execute by the second paren block

511130
execute	declare
syntax declare an anonymous-function and then execute it immediately

511148
xsd	xml
i m trying to do some specific stuff in an xsd xml schema

511153
inherited	subclass
if your subclass overrides test then it overrides test - this is the whole point of object inherited

511153
subclassing	superclass
that s the beauty of polymorphism typing in fact the caller doesn t have to know about any of this at all and the subclassing determine how their behaviour differs from the superclass

511153
superclass	subclass
if you sometimes want it to act as its superclass methods and sometimes want it to act as its subclass methods then you need to provide the context required to do this

511153
subclassing	superclass
one which is never overridden and so always returns the superclass behaviour you can even mark the definition with final to ensure it s not overridden and your normal one which is overridden as appropriate by the subclassing

511153
subclassing	superclass
which one you choose depends on conceptually whether your main methods the caller or the subclassing objects themselves are going to be in the best positioning to judge whether the superclass methods should be called or not

511155
exponentiation	multiplying
also i have avoided any use of the exponentiation operators which is slower than just writing the squaring out and hoisting the divide out of the inner loop and replaced it with a multiplying

511155
subtract	time
i haven t looked at all at their implementation in python but from my last time tuning an inner loop for pure speed using raw x87 assembly i seem to remember that adds subtract or multiplies take about 4 cpu cycles each divides about 36 and exponentiation about 200

511166
python	java
just in case there is no language constraint you could consider using other languages like java python ruby and the like

511181
pascal	delphi
delphi prism is an add on for visual-studio which allows you to code to linux and mac from vs albeit in the object pascal language though

511202
javafx	swing
swing is good in many ways then why do we need javafx

511209
solaris	linux
it supports cpython 2.3+ several jres sun jdk 1.4+ apple jre 1.4+ and openjdk 1.7 on os x linux solaris and windows

511209
python	c++
jcc generates cpython types that make these c++ classes accessible from a python interpreter

511223
conditional	operators
there s a change shown on the page made in july 2008 which moved the conditional operators - but apparently incorrectly

511239
javafx	swing
swing code can get very verbose while the same javafx code will be smaller and easier to maintain

511253
variables	boolean
just use a boolean variables ie sysclose with false default value

511263
application-pool	was
i already used the methods of directoryservices namespace but the application-pool name isn t retrieved correctly unless it was explicitly set by using the same code

511263
application-pool	iis-manager
which means if u add a website manually using the iis-manager and set an application-pool those codes won t work it will always return defaultapppool more over when i create an application using sharepoint and set a different apppool those methods dont work

511281
put	get
we ve got an api right now where all operations either retrieve from a list resource ie get user or on a single instance put user 1 delete user 22 etc

511293
any	set
one that immediately springs to mind is that whilst what i have done is all well and good for my thread it will not apply from what i understand from reading on here and around to any threads which are created either by my app unless i set the currentuiculture on those too or worse by any components which i use which may create their own threads

511295
any	set
i do not want to have any impact on the current media set

511314
pascal	delphi
c how much of the code is using stuff that you know can be done differently in delphi but that would work as it stands in pascal right now

511314
delphi	basic
get something that runs and that you check basic behaviour with and then embark on a process of refactoring refining to make the most of delphi as and when the resources allow it

511325
instances	destroy
and by the way free doesn t care if the instances to be freed is nil so this will work if but only if inherited destroy sets the properties to nil

511335
selected	button
i would like to know is there any way to selected click on cancel button on alert windows

511364
checkbox	button
in this case the sender is the clear button not a checkbox

511379
constructor	object
yes sorry i should have mentioned that the set of object i will be processing will have a constructor that accepts an int and a string

511380
transfer-encoding	chunked
cgi you could return a response body with transfer-encoding chunked to spit out a few bytes every so often and keep the connection alive

511385
hide	show
you can prompt the user with the columns and have a show hide or something similar

511389
command-line	cmd
you define the model run two cmd from the command-line and you re set with a simple crud user-interface where you can edit your model in a web browser

511390
innodb	myisam
just remember that you need to use the innodb storage engine the default myisam storage engine doesn t support foreign keys

511399
restart	reload
changes in the model need a restart of the development server everything else happens at the next reload in the web browser tg will let you knew when you need to restart

511418
dbix-class	dbi
dbix-class even include a class dbi compatibility layer

511419
export	csv
depending on the size of the tables how many records you could either do a selected of all of the data into memory and then roll over them inserting them into a copy of the table you create first or you could export the data out as a csv file or some other text based file and then roll over that to insert the data into the other table

511420
external	host
but since the host is different this will cause an external redirect

511459
contains	set
not sure if this helps but as i expected when i stepped through the code the table has generated all the columns expected but all cells datacontrolfieldcells contains no controls when the headertext is set yet all expected controls when it isnt set

511478
firefox	safari
when we moved it to a load balanced environment the images stop working only in mac safari but still works in all other browsers including windows safari and firefox on the mac that had the original problem

511499
invoices	product
if you want to know if an order requires a fitting i m guessing that s why you have the checkbox. you can create a query to see if fitting is one of the product on your reports invoices

511506
administration	credentials
when logging in with the same credentials 10.0.1.255 administration password

511526
.when	ready
.when a new versioning is ready for deployment it is tagged from trunk then a branch is created from that tag

511557
display	width
in the xaml below the textblock will display the width of the rectangle

511565
.when	ready
a lot of the time you will see it .when trying to access user-interface components that have not yet been created its good to rely on the creationcomplete event for these sort of things but in this case it looks like you are using the webservice before it is completely ready the wsdl hasnt been loaded yet

511581
sql-server	mysql
i can t say for sure about mysql but i know in sql-server that primary keys create an index automatically but foreign keys do not

511617
put	get
instead of providing a function that must be called to convert the utc times to local times put this logic inside each datetime property s get function

511623
extends	super
allowing code to not call the super constructor first breaks encapsulation - the idea that you can write code and be able to prove that no matter what someone else does - extends it invoke it instansiate it - it will always be in a valid state

511623
instances	private
to solve your problem incidentally you make use of private static-methods - they don t depend on any instances

511623
constructor	private
if you don t like having separate methods a lot of common logic you only want to execute once for instance have one method that returns a private little static inner class which is used to invoke a private constructor

511638
profiling	trace
overall the best advice is to trace and profiling to see what is really taking up time

511658
.when	ready
inside each you could create a new data context and attach the entity to that context .when you are ready to perform the action

511667
value	field
i need to set the readonly property of a boundfield in a gridview to the value of a bit field in the recordset that is being display by the same gridview

511676
contains	set
the object that gets passed in is an instance of the jquery object which contains a set of elements in this case with only one element in it

511685
environment	building
unfortunatly some of the c++ environment variables are per user and will not be carried over to the default building environment

511692
buffering	streaming
looking at the code above it looks as if you re expecting to receive in the socket s input streaming the data that you write into its output buffering

511694
contains	any
is it possible to get the same with an arbitrary pattern get all the names of the variables whose name contains an x in any positioning

511697
asp.net-mvc	webforms
use webforms or switch over to asp.net-mvc framework for everything

511717
any	set
essentially you can run any custom logic on an object before the value is set of a property by the binding

511718
element	dynamic
so i need to bind a dynamic number of radiobuttonlist to the asp table element controls and i need to create a dynamic number of listitems to each radiobuttonlist created

511747
wamp	php
using grep gnu32 package for windows or some other text filter get a list of every line in your php file that has the word extension in it and make sure you know exactly which packages are being used for your wamp stack

511747
profiling	debugging
the loss of performance between engine and normal extensions is that profiling isn t nearly as accurate editor - server debugging isn t reliable and doesn t appear to work on anything but explicit xdebug_break statements

511753
exception-handling	error-handling
why does throwing the exception-handling from the user control only result in the javascript dialog and not the global.asax error-handling kicking in

511759
cross-join	inner-join
selectmany performs a monadic bind that generally results in either an inner-join or cross-join

511762
mstest	nunit
fwiw we run the crappy visual-studio testing via mstest on our hudson box and i ve got an xslt that hudson uses to convert the results to the nunit format so hudson can decipher them

511771
interpreter	lexer
interpreter typically utilize traditional parsing components lexer parsing and abstract syntax tree ast

511777
configuration	logging
i need to fix this logging issue if possible i do not wish to yank out or modify the log4j configuration in the 3rd party jar

511781
filesystems	fat
i don t mean fat or ntfs or a particular type of filesystems i mean the filesystem structure as a whole

511789

when that request postback finishes the page instances used for that request is destroy

511797
export	report
we receive multiple thousands of flat files per week currently and i have a system that runs report on these and export them to pdf for our people to process and reference

511797
archive	backup
either in the form of daily sql backup or zipped archive or whatever so i always had the ability to reload old data for trouble shooting

511806
configuration	logging
if they are using log4j or another commonly used logging framework you can override its configuration by providing another lo4j.properties earlier on the classpath

511818
windows-vista	windows
microsoft had originally planned to introduce a new file-system for windows-vista winfs - windows future storage

511819
file-access	filesystems
traditional filesystems are optimized for fast file-access if you know the name of the file you want including its path

511820
difference	count
yes i ve already tried selected count change_event_id but there s no performance difference

511825
derived-class	base-class
yes but you need to decorate the base-class with the knowntypeattribute constructing it with the derived-class s type

511839
unmanaged	c++-cli
rewrite some logic into c++-cli and mix managed code with unmanaged

511843
promise	future
which one is in early development but shows great promise for the future

511858
directory-structure	filesystems
i spent a while trying to come up with an automagically versioning filesystems that would maintain versions and version history of any specific file and or directory-structure

511871
python	ruby
the library itself independent on python ruby

511871
python	ruby
that s probably the cleanest solution albeit it requires a bit more work when doing releases but it has the advantage that you can release a new version of the ruby bindings without having to ship a new library python bindings version

511894
object-reference	instances
at this point i get an object-reference not set to an instances of an object error because address is null

511899
sql-server	mysql
we use sql-server 2005 ill look for a script that can check this on mysql

511902
initializer	setter
an instances of my custom componet calls the actionscript class so i dont want to initializer the custom class again inside the actionscript i just want to call a setter method.

511921
double	int
official javadoc says that math.floor returns a double that is equal to a mathematical int but then why shouldn t it return an int

511928
zero	nan
if the arguments is nan or an infinity or positive zero or negative zero then the result is the same as the arguments

511928
double	int
the largest double value is also larger than the largest int so it would have to be a long

511929
triggers	insert
the triggers should increase decrease count values on counters table on every insert delete so you won t need to compute them every time you need them

511935
global-variables	call
was a global-variables and i didn t call it like i usually do to prevent this sort of problem

511940
filtering	grouping
how about grouping by category id then using the having statement to filtering out specific categories like

511948
double	int
returning the int as a double is the right thing to do here because it offers a much wider usefull number-range than a int could

511951
double	int
what would you want it to return if you gave it a double bigger than the largest int or long

511956
directory	folder
you can right click on the folder in vs and remove it from the project or you can make sure any of the files contained in the folder have their build action set to none and copy to output directory set to do not copy

511963
unsigned	zero
you also probably want to make the change_event_id column bigint unsigned if it s incrementing from zero

511966
unsigned	bigint
change the column from a bigint to an int unsigned

511966
value	field
you might also consider partitioning your table according to the id field especially if older records with lower id value become less relevant over time

511966
innodb	myisam
if that s true then you might not need all the transactional safety provided by the innodb storage engine and you might be able to get away with switching to myisam which is considerably more efficient on aggregate queries

511967
.when	ready
.when your underlying framework has a security bug have a plan ready to upgrade

511971
solaris	linux
the java tutorial has a trail on the subject here pick the windows or solaris linux section

512040
active-directory	adfs
does anyone know of any good screenscasts or documentation covering the integration active-directory federation services adfs with authentication manager azman

512076
directory	folder
in modern linux systems this folder is managed largely by udev which helps with the automatic configuration and population of this directory

512076
configuration	installation
when compiling software the default installation will scatter libraries binaries and configuration files across the directory so by telling the installer to put everything in opt you can still install the program but you can leave it in a place that you can delete everything at once

512076
gedit	kde
gnome or kde are usually installed in this folder and you will find many of the programs you fire up in daily usage like firefox or evolution or gedit located here

512076
directory	folder
the reason for this is that the programs can be installed to a root-like set of folder like the installer is expecting without actually muddling up the directory with a plethora of files

512087
firefox	opera
can i check if host page for a javascript is active by the browser s tab in ie7 firefox opera

512100
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know whether there is an equivalent in firefox google-chrome though

512129
actionscript	mxml
the right way to do this would really be to figure out some way to pass a reference to your custom component to the actionscript class that requires access to it -- for example in your mxml

512131
.when	ready
not trivial - in particular you will need to use control.invoke to ask the splash-screen to close itself .when ready thread affinity .

512135
hide	show
i was able to show wait message but i am not able to hide the same when the execution is complete

512145
versioning	upgrade
recently i upgrade a couple of cruisecontrol.net server from versioning 1.3 to versioning 1.4.2.14

512145
configuration	upgrade
it seems that there is some configuration setting that didn t get enabled when i upgrade the second server

contains	any
i have a list of variables count and i want to query via linq a table to find any items that contains any of those strings in the text column

512293

512296
textbox	button
i ve read elsewhere on here that to capture enter key stroke in a textbox and use it as if pushing a button i should set the keypreview property of the form to true and check the value of keydown

512296
textbox	button
i want to be able to use this functionality on several textbox controls which each are associated with a different button

512336
textbox	button
you can change the default button as each control gets the focus you can have one got focus event hander per button and share it with a set of textbox

512336
textbox	button
have you asked yourself what should the default button be if it s not one of thse textbox

512337
xml-serialization	ixmlserializable
is there a way to customize xml-serialization in jaxb in the same way that it s possible using ixmlserializable in .net

512346
order	join
mysql isnâ t necessarilly good at choosing the join order in complex queries

512346
order	join
by specifying a complex query as a straight_join the query executes the join in the order theyâ re specified

512356
value	field
if a single measurement has all of the values time voltage current temp then you d use a field for each value in one table

512382
driver	kernel
i m developing an os x kernel extension kext that will be used as an i o kit driver

512384
document	element
relative uris are always resolved from the base uri which is the uri of the document if not explicitly declared otherwise see the base element

512421
void	main
in your case you should have typed the standard int main rather than the incorrect void main void or the clumsier

512431
entity-framework	nhibernate
if you want to avoid writting sql use an orm such as nhibernate or one of the microsoft offerings linq to sql entity-framework

512449
put	get
it really depends on how big a shop you are and whether you will get back the resources you put into writing one

512458

512467
sql-server	oracle
added bonus it supports sql-server oracle informix

512480
data-access	nhibernate
the repositories use nhibernate for data-access and my data-access needs are pretty simple in this particular app

512480
structuremap	mvp
n the client side i utilize mvp with structuremap for ioc and some very simple event aggregation strategies for cross-class communications

512497
web-config	app-config
when it comes to our asp.net control s app-config and web site s web-config this has worked good because we could use initial catalog mydb

512497
web-config	app-config
is there an easy way to do this without needing to edit the web-config and app-config each time we deploy or compile

512526
rollback	commit
particularly since i can t see a commit or rollback in your code

512527
base-class	inherited
i have a base-class that inherited list which has multiple classes derived from it

512527
base-class	inherited
i want to create a methods that can add items to any class that has inherited from this base-class is this possible

512542
firefox	opera
tested on ie6 and up firefox 2 opera 8 netscape 9 seamonkey and safari

512559
contains	set
so our products table has a few common fields that all products share an xml which contains whatever a particular product needs additionally and a few computed fields that grab into the xml and surface some of the frequently queried fields as virtual fields on the products table style would be set to whatever the current product defines or null if the product doesn t have a style property

512559
xsd	xml
so far we ve been quite flexible with that approach - if you create some decent xsd schemas for your xml you can even create c# proxy classes for these fields

512569
xsl-fo	xslt
all in all t4 to me is more of a inside vs code-generation tool to quickly create c# or other files while xslt is more of a data-processing data-transformation tool to turn data from xml into another format typically html or pdf using xsl-fo

512595
persistence	hibernate
persistence is provided by something like hibernate or openjpa

512607
dictionary	arrays
just walking the arrays and keeping counts in a hash dictionary and returning true once n k is found else false would be o n

512663
linux	unix
i ll presume that it s the linux unix windows version

512665
decimal	hex
since you won t be needing hexidecimal values with a length of more than 2 hex characters for each color you won t be needing a fancy algorithm to convert decimal to hexidecimal and back

512704
static-class	nested-class
public static-class in java means that you define a static nested-class

512704
constructor	private
there is no direct language-level equivalent to this construct in java but you can easily prevent instantiation of a java class by providing only a private constructor

512711
constructor	private
i think you can achieve pretty much the same effect if you create builder as a top level class for that s exactly what it is in java and create a factory method to receive the builder in order to keep the constructor private which in turn would let you return subclasses instances if needed

512711
constructor	private
that s why build method in builder calls the private property constructor

512738
perl	php
what is the perl equivalent of php s

512738
perl	php
i ve got some software that sends log files to a web server and i need to retrieve them using perl instead of php

512746
json	xml
if you don t have control over the client side then a simple xml or json over http kind of service would be my choice since xml provides the interoperability

ftp	scp
svn2web will ftp or scp files from a subversion repository to a webserver on every commit

512760

it s in a multithreading application hence the choice to use concurrenthashmap instead of just hashmap

512876
derivative	ode
however in this case the derivative is a primary part of the ode equation you re solving - get the derivative wrong and you ll just get the wrong answer

512876
derivative	ode
as another answer has suggested if you set up your ode as applied f x + g x where g x is an error term you should be able to relate errors in your derivative to errors in your inputs

512931
csv	xml
check out this blog post that talks about handling large csv and xml files

512933
dynamic-reports	report
then near the end of the project after most of the work on report had been done he said he had always wanted dynamic-report

512969
integration	bpm
good luck to built-in integration to web-based consoles or even bpm system

512984
aggregate	grouping
the largest problem i am having is understanding how linq works especially with grouping aggregate data extensions subqueries etc

512987
execute	declare
the rules for static say that the methods defined in the declare type of variables must be execute

512995
reflection	runtime
no the specific overload of a methods that is called is determined at compile-time not at runtime unless you re using reflection thus if you ve cast your int to an object the object overload will be called

513001
subclassing	superclass
if a superclass and a subclassing both have an entry in their tables for the same methods signature the subclassing s versioning is encountered first and the superclass s versioning is never used mdash

513082
profiling	debugging
xdebug can both do profiling and interactive debugging

513087
linux	unix
take that give it all the power of a unix linux system and interoperability with unix linux and you get a pretty darn great platform for programming

513095
hash	md5
to meet the requirement you could simply use a hash such as sha-1 or md5 on your indexes

513107
margins	padding
give the wrapper div a left padding of 50 and the inner div a negative left margins equal to half of its width

513121
sequences	unique
not as pretty as xml but at least every element starts with a unique sequences

513124
filtering	grouping
what would the filtering need to look like if i only wanted everyone in the manager read only ad grouping

513132
business-objects	microstrategy
cognos sap business-objects oracle bi suite microstrategy and reporting services are all basically comparable in performance on rendering to excel and pdf from their respective report builders

513132
oracle	mysql
if you are running only oracle mysql or other non-microsoft database back-ends then purchasing a sql server just for reports will probably be cheaper from a licensing perspective

513141
union-all	union
union will remove duplicates and union-all will not

513145
any	set
the way you have it set up any error that may occur in the ajax call will get silently swallowed

513150
click	mouse
does the mouse wheel up and down events also allow for mouse wheel click events

513157
value	field
i m working on an application that will be implementing a hex value as a business key in addition to an auto increment field as primary key similar to the url id seen in gmail

513157
value	field
i will be adding a unique constraint to the column and was originally thinking of storing the value as a bigint to get away from searching a varchar field but was wondering if that s necessary if the field is unique

513157
value	field
internal joins would be done using the auto increment field and the hex value would be used in the where-clause for filtering

513169
versioning	upgrade
there are several things that need to be done to get upgrade to work with msi s if you want to automatically remove the previous versioning

513169
versioning	upgrade

meta-inf	jar
sax implementations may be configured through the system property org.xml.sax.driver or contained in a file within a jar of the name meta-inf services org.xml.sax.driver

513637
string.format	stringbuilder
see this related question is string.format as efficient as stringbuilder

513638
shell	bash
although it involves starting bash for each file returned by find you could write a small shell script thus

513648
any	set
now any outside assembly can check the isdirty property but only classes within the same assembly can set it

513656
any	set
i have a set of options some orthogonal can be combined in any combination some exclusive only one from the set is allowed and need to pick a set of enum values so that they can be combined with bit-wise or and extracted with bit-wise and

513661
deterministic	theory
conditional 2 is true in theory because the order of the rows returned is not deterministic

513667
show	next
then based on the multiple choice option selected i want to show a result and then allow the user to continue to the next question

513689
json	xml
the example loads the details from a json object which in my opinion is much better suited for this task than a text file or xml

513706
contains	elements
and that would actually make that arrays contains 5 elements

513735
internet-explorer	firefox
the following code is running on firefox but not internet-explorer

513763
versioning	upgrade
major upgrade which will uninstaller the old versioning so you need to be aware of this

513768
deployment	install
i know i can use a setup and deployment project and create an install but i d prefer to use clickonce

513787
string.format	stringbuilder
stringbuilder is 33 times faster than string.format using jdk 1.6.0_10 client on xp

513787
string.format	stringbuilder
the correct speed-up factors from string.format . to stringbuilder is 23 on my machine 16 with the -server switching

513797
active-directory	adam
adam isn t really a complete replacement for active-directory

513797
active-directory	adam
if however you are building an application that simply needs an ldap directory and isn t going to be using active-directory than adam may work out just fine

513798
object-reference	instances
thus at runtime i get object-reference not set to an instances of an object. because the designer never generates the line

513825
deployment	install
if you wanted to get tricky then you could look at parsing the activation uri for the deployment and have a uri parameter which specifies whether the program should run when it s first install or just close silently

513843
required	checked
there may be a better way but sometimes you do need to checked a conditional especially with columns i hate working with listviews but they are necessary and often required this kind of code.

513899
python	php
svn is available over http so writing a client that is able to sync your code is really easy in python or php

513903
key-value	key
as others have noted you might choose a set a special type of dictionary instead if you only have key rather than key-value pairs

513952
reflection	runtime
i want to return a generic collection from the database of a type that i discover at runtime using reflection

513954
bazaar	git
i agree with most of what s been said here but i d add the obvious point that it s less important to do frequent check-ins to the central repo if you re using a distributed vcs like bazaar or git

513968
solaris	debian
i am sshing into a solaris computer in the computer lab from my own debian box via

513981
command-line	cmd
the cmd command-line in windows does not recognize ruby-on-rails

513982
any	set
to represent an orthogonal set of n options any combination of size 0 1 ... n can be chosen we require at least n bits

i ve got a wpf tab control that contains several duplicates controls as tab page content

514046
delphi	c++
borland c++ builder or borland delphi

514053
python	php
i thinks python is the most natural way when i had to do same thing in php the only was to wrap return into an array

514067
any	set
understand the intent of the solid principles or any other set of principles or methodology

514070
nvidia	ati
my advice would be to get the best machine you can afford with a top-end ati or nvidia card ideally an ati mobility radeon hd 4850x2 or 48xx or nvidia 98xx xxx card

514074
innodb	myisam
afaik the innodb engine still doesn t handle full text indexing so you need to use myisam

514104
click	mouse
load the file into the swf modify it and save it back it requires user interaction a mouse click and again it pops up a save file native dialog

514110
client-server	webserver
so the normal client-server interaction is a user pulls up a web browser types in a url and a http request is sent to the server requesting the page and resources css pics from the webserver

514110
put	get
once we do a request.send null the object basically attempts to â œgetâ the url via http and once we get the data back from the server it is put in the responsetext argument

514110
synchronous	.when
.when i think of synchronous i think of steps having to be followed in order

514124
content-management	publishing
if you are going to be doing any publishing with sharepoint andrew connell s book professional sharepoint content-management is a must read

514128
callback	methods
with async calls you register a callback the xmlhttprequest object calls your methods when the async request completes

514143
json	xml
your first point though is not entirely correct you can request html from the server using ajax is doesn t have to text json or xml like most examples show

514147
cos	sin
also consider standard mathematical functions sin cos and tan would only work for half their input value you couldn t find the log of value 1 you couldn t solve quadratic equations x -b + - root b.b - 4.a.c 2.a and so on

514161
arrays	loops
as an alternative example which may make it easier to understand imagine you have an arrays of items you wish to loops over and add 1 to them each time.

514161
for-loop	loops
ordinarily you might use a for-loops and loops around 100 times

514180
perl	php
a download of shttpd on source forge had separate interpreter exe for perl and php cgi but not sure if that means i need one in c.

514192
order	join
in order to retrieve the results you want to join the tables and perform an aggregate concatenation so you can end up with data looking like for example

514248
order	add
once the user is logged in how would i get their id from the user table from within the add controllers in order to add their id to that table

514263
mousedown	mouseup
mousedown mouseup approach to click pushbuttons

514268
bugzilla	mantis
i ve tryed mylyn but i cant find that feature if anyone have test mantis or bugzilla please tell me if one of those have that option

514277
sqlcompare	redgate
as someone who s used redgate s sqlcompare sqldatacompare and their respective apis to do this before much of the gdr functionality seems a bit half-baked to me

514277
export	csv
what i will probably do this time round is sync the data with a ssis package export to csv at build time import from csv at install time but i d far rather be using the sqldatacompare api or sqlpackager right now

514282
selected	cell
this is pretty rough and old-fashioned but if you have the data in standard list format - column headers in the first row of your range and then one record of data in each row below - then selected a cell within the range and going will give you a crude input form with roughly the functionality you need

514282
selected	cell
just selected a cell within whichever range you need first

514295
selected	checkbox
selected the code you pasted go to tools - language or in the latest version of word the equivalent on the ribbon and selected the checkbox don t check.

514298
contains	elements
the best way to not get other side effects would be to make your canvas the same size as the elements it contains otherwise you could get weird sizing behavior from your stackpanel

514302
innodb	myisam
don t use myisam tables use innodb for everything except fulltext search

514320
where-clause	sql
i need to parse it and convert to the sql where-clause

514325
required	checked
the video.php can then perform whatever security checkeds you d like for example required logins checked the referrer etc

514347
combinations	permutation
on the few occasions when i have worked on a web application i felt that web-applications are relatively more non-deterministic and unpredictable for example due to the event driven multithreading model of web-applications there are several permutation and combinations of events and actions one needs to take care of

514352
32-bit	64bit
basically the gwt long emulation uses a tuple of two numbers the first holding the high 32-bit and the second the low 32-bit of the 64bit long

514361
spacing	layout
it has helped me with things such as colors spacing layout and more

514372
value	field
how do you validate a field value in javascript

514377
hide	show
i d like to show or hide a few fields in a form in ruby-on-rails depending on the state of a selected field in the form

514377
hide	show
what s the accepted practice for conditional show hide forms in ruby-on-rails

514402
reflection	runtime
if you are trying to change tables or joins of a linq to sql query at runtime you need to do that with reflection

514403
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
you could potentially stop your animation in viewwilldisappear or viewdiddisappear and then restart it in viewwillappear or viewdidappear

514408
webforms	asp.net
its pretty fantastic there are others you could use like asp.net webforms but you won t learn anything by dragging and dropping things onto a designer

514412
webserver	host
you can either host it on your own webserver or if you have ruby installed on all the computers you plan to use it from you can run it from a flash drive

514424
element	dynamic
use a dynamic element to load the jqu3ry libray into the allowed browsers any which has not failed your careful tests

514428
scala	java
i m using scala implicits to define a rich wrapper for a java interface

514428
scala	java
i could create a scala companion object for the java implementation

514428
scala	java
for instance to create scala companion objects for the java implementations on the fly based on the implicit conversion in the richthing object

514428
scala	java
or to create the scala companion object from the java side maybe in an abstract class

514440
logout	login
i ve noticed the returnurl url parameter on the stackoverflow login logout links are not escaped but when i try to add path as a parameter to a route it gets escaped

514449
where-clause	sql
the sql generated nests the second notexists join salestable into the where-clause of the first notexists join custtable

514476
consistency	acid
3 acid sort of a corollary to #1 if atomicity consistency integrity and durability are not challenges with a flat-file then go with a flat-file

514483
python	c++
complementing on what johan said i ve used a couple c c++ support libraries in python thanks to swig

514483
ruby	php
this is definitely a useful tool as it makes your code a lot cleaner while still providing robust bindings to multiple languages php python ruby and i believe c#

514487
configuration	environment
these programs have configuration that are sourced at runtime and are different depending on the machine environment the program s running one

514487
arguments	default
if so then the program could startup with some default jvm arguments then adjust itself based on the retrieved configuration

514494
dependency-injection	service-locator
service-locator is a design pattern similiar to dependency-injection

514504
windows-xp	windows
windows powershell is easy to adopt learn and use because it works with your existing it infrastructure and existing script investments and because it runs on windows-xp windows vista and windows server 2003

514504
windows-server	windows
windows powershell is now included as part of windows-server 2008 and can be evaluated in windows-server 2008 beta 3

514518
qooxdoo	extjs
and interface to this api using a framework such as qooxdoo or extjs

514530
file-access	filesystems
a lot of times direct text file binary files access can be extremely fast efficient as well as providing you all the file-access capabilities of your os s filesystems

514531
keyboard	mouse
plus the user with inputs of mouse and keyboard has a variety of ways to break what you produce

514545
innodb	myisam
for starters use innodb instead of myisam

514586
value	field
or demonstrate exactly what parameters could be passed to the code in how to return the value in one field based on lookup value in another field that would be damaging rather than just breaking the code

514597
push	pull
push the changes to a central location that others can pull from

514603
key-value	key
replacing the key varchar with an integer lookup into another table seems to alleviate this problem and make it significantly more efficient to enumerate all of the active keys but sticks me with the problem of maintaining that lookup table upserting into it whenever i want to define a property and potentially removing the entry any time a key-value is cleared

514621
contains	any
instead of wading through each page to try to figure out where each incorrect request is coming from i m writing some apache redirect rules to change a request for any url contains favicon to redirect to favicon

514634
web-applications	web-services
i have been building web-services and web-applications for over a decade now and have more recently been focusing on providing as restful a service as possible eg

514634
value	field
when these types are include in a form the browser will send the value along with the request to the form uri as an http authentication field rather than as post or get value

514634
authentication	login
this can mean that we can have both restful user authentication but without the standard browser login boxes

514637
unsigned	short
i am trying to optimize a small highly used function which uses the high bits in an unsigned short int to indicate the values of an arrays to sum together

514637
multiplication	addition
although this second approach eliminates the if-statement from this section of the code the second solution needs to run a multiplication of 0 or 1 on every iteration in addition to the rest of the equation

514644
python	ruby
is metaprogramming the ability to generate code on the fly or is it the ability to inject methods and attributes into existing objects at runtime like what some dynamic languages like python ruby and groovy allow

514656
command-line	cmd
cmd-line usage can be quick while scripts can be readable thanks to the combination of aliases and smart cmd argument processing

514659
hide	show
on some parts of the site i would like to implement a jquery toggle effect where some content is placed in a hidden div and that content will show or hide depending on a user s onclick event

514660
integer	short
also look at the assembly version of the code which the compiler emits because there you might see things in it that surprise you and which hint at further optimizations for example using short as you are using can need more instructions that using the machine s natural integer size

514676
implements	extends
realbasic also implements them as extends methods and they have been of similar use there simplifying development

514677
processor	cpu
that processor has two levels of branch predictors baked into the cpu

514679
contains	any
like any mechanism multiple return values can be abused but i don t think it is any more unreasonable to have a function return multiple values than it is to have a struct contains multiple values

514695
scheme	lisp
it is much easier to do in a language that supports real macros not c++ macros but rather ones that can manipulate the code they output such as ruby lisp scheme etc

514703
glut	sdl
if you re using glut sdl sfml or any of the other windows toolkits you ll get your input from them

514704
reflection	runtime
dynamically typed languages have powerful runtime reflection features made possible by the interpreted nature of these languages.

514726
webserver	upload
both posters are correct but on different points -- air can do it under certain restrictions with flash.filesystem.file and you can browse to with a native os file-selection dialog with flash.net.filereference select and upload one or more files to a webserver -- but in a web browser working within the confines of the flash player plug-in it s just not possible to enumerate the contents of a local directory and display thumbnail imagery in this way

514736
revision	svn
git svn clone will grab your svn repository and import the revision into a new git repo

514741
twitter-bootstrap	zurb-foundation
zurb-foundation - responsive grid type ui widget prototyping framework similar in scope to twitter-bootstrap but feels cleaner in some ways

514743
put	get
there are several companies like keynote who have bots that will hit your site from all around the world analyze the performance and give you recommendations about changes you can make to get the output of your app to the browser and rendered as quickly as possible use gzip compression and put your javascript at the end of the page instead of the head etc.

514778
put	get
the workaround as described in more detail in the blog post is to get the sources with git i specified release-1.0 branch for repo command which i hope corresponds with sdk 1.0-r2 collect all the java source files and put them in the correct directory structure under sources directory which goes right next to your android.jar from the sdk and refresh the jar in eclipse at which point you can browse the sdk class sources

514778
python	java
the blog link above has a small python script that can collect all the java files and create the correct directory structure out of them

514801
signals	sigint
basically ctrl c sends the sigint interrupt signals while kill sends the sigterm termination signals by default unless you specify the signals to send

514804
signals	sigint
ctrl c just sends a sigint signal but there is some other signals that is a little more soft

514814
delphi	c++
if you have usability guidelines for desktop applications then since air provides resources allowing a flex application to run on a desktop the principle of least surprise would dictate that it should follow the same guidelines as apps written in .net vb6 c++ delphi etc

514819
contains	any
to the kernel module source but the headers do not contains any functions

514822
vrml	x3d
i ve been hearing about vrml and x3d for at least 10 years and .

514840
configuration	installation
for old versions of eclipse you will need to edit the org.eclipse.ui.ide.prefs file in the configuration .settings directory under your installation directory or in .eclipse on unix iirc

514874
println	output
perhaps it s because println only adds a single linefeed lf to the output whereas the http spec expects each line to end with a crlf

514877
animation	rotation
for example the animation constructor instead of requiring a from and to value for the angle simply rotates the cube an an additional 130 degrees based on whatever the current rotation angle is

514902
constructor	object
if however it contains objects themselves it does call the default constructor of each contained object and thus initialises them

514908
python	c++
it s been a while since i programmed in c++ and after coming from python i feel soooo in a straight jacket ok i m not gonna rant

514908
python	c++
so far it s all ok the project size is small and this doesn t seem to affect performance but i still want to get some input advice on this because i feel like i m writing python in c++

514917
base-class	inherited
if your types were polymorphism inherited classes of a base-class then you d need a vector of pointers and you d need to remember to delete all the allocated objects before throwing away your vector

514940
e-commerce	product
this include e-commerce websites selling product

514947
order	add
default sorting is ascending you need to add the keyword desc to both your order

514953
getter	setter
the only test i can do is for getter and setter those boring test

514959
click	mouse
the idea is to get the text that is under the mouse that the user points to and click on

514960
easymock	jmock
if you re facing difficulties setting up a particular area of code for testing it might be worth investigating a mocking framework like jmock or easymock

514967
highlight	selected
now i want to be able to either hit enter to input the selected element or enter more letters to filtering the completion menu even more possibly highlight a new item in the completion menu and then hit enter to insert

514977
virtual-functions	base-class
will i have some problems if introduce some virtual-functions in the base-class

514993
constructor	object
i would simply move the factory out of the constructor of the various specific object creators and introduce a method on the iobjectcreator interface instead responsible for initialising the creators

515011
device-driver	hardware
so ignoring all that information you are either looking at a buggy device-driver - step 1 - find and install any updates for drivers on the system or the hardware is beginning to fail

515011
driver	kernel
win32k.sys is the kernel driver side of the win32 subsystem not specifically a display driver at all

515028
attributes	properties
the way you would do this is according to the msdn documentation by adding an attributes to the properties

515032
managed-code	unmanaged
directx is unmanaged only where xna is managed-code

515035
content-length	http-headers
as jrockway says it s probably the content-length header - i m not sure whether firefox provides easy access by default but the live http-headers plugins gives you access and if you aren t using firefox you could use wireshark instead but it s a lot heavier and could take some messing around to be able to find the headers amongst the rest of your network traffic

515037
directory	folder
is the save folder you re using outside of the websites root directory hidden from the internet

515040
version-control	git
version-control software is geared towards this kind of problem and git has a good reputation for speed

515069
put	get
how to get average of a column in terms of another column and put this value in a third column and this value will be evaluated for each retrieved record

515077
pylons	django
django and pylons are well documented and can easily handle this kind of project but they will also have a lot of stuff you won t need

515080
oracle-ucm	documentum
have heard of solutions from emc documentum artesia oracle-ucm and the like but not sure if they handle file sizes this large

515081
webserver	nginx
make sure you have a separate machine for serving static content and use a very lightweight webserver such as lighttpd or nginx which should help increase throughput

515085
loading	gif
let s say that in the html with the help of an updatepanel i have the loading animated gif running while asp.net is processing data from a webservice

515087
constructor	private
you will need a proper copy constructor that increases some reference count on the class members that you do not want to destroy early -- or make it private to force yourself on the pointer solution

515088
c++	lua
many full price games use c++ for some but something like lua for actual game logic.

515097
installation	building
2 building a variant that doesn t require msi installation and can be executed directly

515099
tao-framework	opentk
i suggest using the opentk framework based on tao-framework see is the tao-framework dead

515104
value	field
for example have it respond to head requests and or set the lifetime of the image to some large value in the header field cache-control

515192
turbogears	django
it seems to be the framework of choice for turbogears but i personally haven t seen any django projects using it

515195
firefox	opera
additionally we specify the browser string firefox iexplore opera or whatever as a system property on the mvn command line which we pick up when we initialize the selenium client libraries in our code

515196
constructor	object
another problem with returning a list of object opposed to working on one or two lists in place as bigsandwich pointed out is if your object have complex copy constructor those will called for each element in the container

515201
python	c++
that being said taking lists and returning other lists is indeed python programming in c++

515203
schema	rdbms
the real benefit of using a rdbms during development is the flexibility with which you can modify your data schema and the ease with which you can access your data via queries

515214
children	nodes
to do this i think i need to know what percentage of the nodes that will have children

515228
subtract	add
if there s only 1 root node subtract 1 from l and add 1 to the total nodes count

515260
any	set
is there any way to set the hidden-field so that is passes the new value through or perhaps pass a value to the server via another mechanism

515269
constructor	object
in order to achieve this i will need to perform some check before creating an object probably in its constructor

515280
webserver	upload
when deployment is due the changed files are copied over to a staging server and then a sync script upload the files to our main webserver from where it is distributed over to the other 9 servers

515282
any	set
this should however not have any effect on the progress bar in the browser that is more likely due to that for instance youtube does not set the content-length in the header

515288
constructor	private
you can make the constructor private and the factory a nested type

515297
children	nodes
if your tree is approximately full that is every level has its full complement of children except for the last two then you have between n l-2 and n l-1 leaf nodes and between n l-1 and n l nodes total

515297
children	nodes
if you are able to find the ratio of leaves to internal nodes and you know the average number of children you can approximate this as n ratio n n

515301
abstract-class	subclassing
use an abstract-class if you want to share logic across all subclassing if all classes will have the same implementation of getid and any other methods that will be the same

515307
base-class	subclass
if i implement an interface on a base-class will it be inherited by its sub classes i know the functions procedures will be but i am more interested in whether i will be able to cast the subclass to the interface and then back to its original class

515316
command-line	cmd
you can get all the cmd command-line switches by typing cmd

515325
qt-designer	wxpython
as far as i can tell qt-designer is more powerful than any wxpython counterpart like boa constructor and pyglade

515326
constructor	private
then have the constructor private and everyone else will be forced to use the static method

515331
constructor	private
yet another lightweight option is to make a static factory method in the businessobject class and keep the constructor private

515333
inherited	subclass
yes the interface is inherited by the subclass

515333
subclassing	inherited
there is some essential difference between subclassing that inherited the interface

515342
updating	updates
and then we have a scripting that anyone with access to do a release can run that takes two parameters -- which system is going to be updates the datacenter and if we re updating the test or the production server and then the versioning number the tag

515342
environment	restart
it does a checkout of the relevant versioning minimizes javascript and css 1 pushes the code to the relevant servers for the environment and then restart what needs to be restart

515345
ruby	php
you can probably use capistrano even though is more for ruby there are some articles that describe how to use it for php

515397
.net	wcf
we are thinking about combining .net technology with java technology wcf jboss esb mom wpf wf and i need to have a high-level idea of what are the apples and oranges in the .net 3.5 and java worlds

515398
web-config	app-config
to add a custom trace listener you would either modify your app-config web-config or you would add it in code using trace.listeners.add new log4nettracelistener

515416
notepad++	scite
my own alternative to notepad++ is scite

515425
document	editing
xml notepad 2007 provides a simple intuitive user-interface for browsing and editing xml document

515429
triggers	insert
can a triggers be used on insert and update to do a round on the column

515429
python	java
you should really consider using some type of fixed point arbitrary-precision number package java bignum python decimal module otherwise you ll be in for a world of hurt

515462
fckeditor	wysiwyg
i d like to be able to edit some static pages using a wysiwyg editor such as fckeditor or tinymce

515465
constructor	object
maybe i could do it in a simple way just make a constructor method in the object class first call the logic class to check the input

515476
click	mouse
it doesnt allow mouse to click in between and curor jumps to the end always

515497
perl	ruby
you can find netcat implemented in three languages python ruby perl

515501
select	union
so there is no need to use select distinct combined with a union

515514
configuration	installation
at the end i managed that in firefox by editing some configuration files from firefox installation folder and we don t want to do that right

515522
any	set
i am trying to set up form widget for adding some objects to the database but i m getting stuck because it seems impossible to pass any arguments to widget contained within a widgetlist

515532
postgresql	oracle
we have an application well 3 which uses oracle 9i however this is being end-of-life-ed shortly and we need to move to another platform - oracle 11 or postgresql being the obvious ones

515540
directory	folder
directory machineipaddress s spbr00df does not exist or the sql-server service account and the bi_web administrator service account do not have permission to read or write to the backup folder

515546
scheme	lisp
i have a nagging feeling that i already know most of this stuff and would probably have an easier time understanding it if it was presented in terms of lisp scheme rather than math

515555
shell	bash
see the read command under shell builtin commands in the bash manpage for more info

515562
for-loop	arrays
i use the for-loop when i have a collection with ordinal sequence as arrays or with a special rule for the step declared generally as a simple increment counter++

515562
while-loop	loops
i use the while-loops when the loops finishes with i have nt this constraints but only a logic condition for exit

515575
type-parameter	return-type
i can t figure out why this does not work the annotatedfieldvalidator has a single type-parameter a which is used both as the return-type of getsupportedannotationclass and as a parameter of validate

515579
double-quotes	single-quotes
a string of text will be treated just like a single line of input from a file the string must be enclosed in double-quotes or single-quotes with usebackq

515582
double	int
i doubt scripting is setup to turn that into a real value and it would have to be something like a double not an int

515589
for-loop	loops
with the for-loops the scope is limited to the loops itself in the case of the while loops however the scope extends to the end of the enclosing block no big surprise since the declaration is outside the loops

515591
show	next
what i need is a dynamic solution that only show the previous 5 pages and next 5 pages if they exist along with a or something to move ahead 5 or so pages

515601
carbon	cocoa
the programmatic equivalent of the above can be achieved in plain c carbon or objective-c cocoa

515603
versioning	upgrade
then you have a core schema that you ve dumped from your database and when the versioning number is too low you upgrade your database using the migrations from the migration schema directory

515604
google-chrome	firefox
it breaks in both firefox and google-chrome

515612
integer	digits
i am trying to convert an integer number in c into an arrays containing each of that number s digits

515622
ports	dmz
set up a tunnel on the dmz machine on whatever publicly open ports your can and connect the other end of the tunnel to the appropriate ports on the db server

515648
webforms	asp.net
look into asp.net mvc - it is an alternative to webforms and tends to have less clutter

515659
conditional	operators
it s actually called conditional operators and is referred to as

515668
versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade to jquery core versioning 1.3.1

515670
subclassing	inherited
the interface is inherited by the subclassing and you can cast the objects to the interface but it is not safe or recommended to cast the interface to class

515679
carbon	cocoa
xcode s help system includes documentation for all the cocoa and carbon apis

515684
contains	elements
one arrays for each row contains elements such as id title etc

515696
arrays	loops
to loops through an arrays i usually use jquery.each

515697
http-headers	content-type
as for the question make sure you clear the output stream before writing out xml and ensure that http-headers specifically content-type are correct

515726
scp	ssh
however in my case there may be thousands of small files that need to transferred and scp is opening a new ssh connection for each of them which has quite some overhead

515740
sftp	scp
it might work to use sftp instead of scp and to place it into batch mode

515747
required	checked
for example required ssl certificate-based authentication on the transport level clients must present a cert that the server checked or ip-based access

515757
kdevelop	kde
if eclipse doesn t provide you with some wizard initial project setup for a kde program i would recommend you to install kdevelop and start such a project there just write a little hello world

515757
qmake	cmake
and it works-you should think about using one of the common established ways to build your software like qmake for qt cmake

515773
getter	setter
don t test the compiler getter and setter

515792
type-safety	generics
it looks to me like you are trying to use generics for run-time type-safety

515808
unsigned-integer	int
the warning is there to catch comparisons between a signed int with a negative value and an unsigned-int -- if the magnitudes of both numbers are small the former will incorrectly be deemed larger than the latter

515830
httpwebrequest	webrequest
webrequest itself doesn t have such a property but httpwebrequest does

515842
height	frame
i have made the height 3 font lines high so in my case the frame height is 47 so i can have 3 lines of text

515847
markup	xhtml
standard xhtml markup and sites with

515862
web-config	app-config
as far as i know the webservice reference logic states that if there is a certain key in the app-config or web-config it will pick that.

515871
folder	dir
one way to discover it is to open a console windows and to run dir x in the folder your file is stored

515887
lookup	any
and what i want to do is do quick and efficient lookup using any of the 3 fields

515887
dictionary	arrays
this requires 2 lookups in 2 dictionary and another traverse of an arrays which usually holds 1 or 2 elements.

515916
adplus	dump
when this happens you can use tools such as windbg and adplus in order to work with memory dump

515928
subclassing	base-class
or for subclassing of a base-class

515930
contains	any
i was wondering if there are any sites out there that contains a community of developers that would be happy to help review how i m approaching my unit-testing discuss with me what i could be doing better or how my approach could be improved changed complete revised from scratch

515940
put	get
when i put this into a shared class library and call the serialization function i get the following error

515953
derived-class	base-class
just add xmlinclude attributes for the type of each derived-class to your base-class and you re done

515981
buffering	streaming
for outputstreamings you could lose an buffering data so you should at least flush the streaming before exiting the program

515994
stream	send
closing a stream also makes sure that data is fflush through the stream if there is any data left to send

515998
testng	junit
if you aren t happy with the output you get from this it could be because testng organises its junit xml output oddly

516007
key-value	key
but what will happen if i add some more elements to this map with other unique key or remove some other key wonâ t it reallocate this string key-value pair so the p will become invalid

516022
constructor	object
looks like you just want to run some business logic before creating the object - so why dont you just create a static method inside the businessclass that does all the dirty myproperty checking work and make the constructor private

516023
integer	digits
you could calculate the number of digits in an integer with logarithm rather than a loop

516042
web-testing	selenium
consider a web-testing framework like selenium

516043
virtual-machine	virtualbox
a program called virtualbox can let you run x86 operating systems in a contained environment and if things go wrong just delete the virtual-machine and reinstall

516055
websphere	ibm
websphere 7 xml feature pack by ibm

516056
hash	md5
seed a randomizer with the md5 hash value and start retrieving random numbers

516102
capacity	storage
this effectively increases the vector size which causes an automatic reallocation of the allocated storage spaces if and only if the new vector size surpases the current vector capacity

516127
perl	lua
the language on the server is currently php but it could be ruby python perl or lua

516144
dictionary	map
you could use map dictionary instead of list

516145
ip-address	hostname
installing a ssl-certificate doesn t technically require a fixed ip-address - the ssl-certificate is tied to the hostname common name

516148
protected	public
i can t see much of a case for private or internal modifiers in interfaces but supporting both public and protected modifiers seems perfectly reasonable

516154
32-bit	64bit
dtrace zones switch between 32-bit and 64bit mode with a single grub switch zfs stable libraries i can t really emphasize that one enough

516154
opensolaris	solaris
solaris 7 software generally runs on opensolaris otherwise known as solaris 11

516154
solaris	linux
a lot of developers assume you re running linux and don t prepend -m64 for solaris among other things

516186
wpf-controls	avalondock
other than avalondock there s sand dock and infragistics wpf-controls

516188
arrays	loops
the data returned is an arrays of objects that i loops through and add to a dataset

516200
carbon	cocoa
i am not using objective-c nor any cocoa carbon frameworks just pure c++

516201
windows-server	windows
i have a c# 2.0 windows service 100 managed code and occasionally when it is started restarted it causes the entire machine windows-server 2003 to hang indefinitely

516234
sigaction	signals
if you control the long-running remote process you could install a signals handler for sigterm see man signals and man sigaction and the many so questions on this topic to cleanup nicely before dieing

516248
session-cookies	cookies
as we log information about errors when they occur including the cookies i saw that the session-cookies were simply not present anymore

516271
firefox	opera
however here is the javascript that works in any browser ie 6+ safari opera firefox etc

516280
switching	screens
i do not worry much about old screens these days and whenever 800px is not enough i easily switching to 1000px

516289
subclassing	base-class
what you are essentially proposing is another construct in the language through which we can switching subclassing from one base-class to another without breaking the build

516289
base-class	subclass
if you are creating a subclass of a class the subclass is a specialization of the base-class

516289
base-class	subclass
but if you suddenly want to switch the base-class out it makes no sense that the subclass should work with any other iorange

516294
jax-ws	cxf
the j2ee equivalent would be apache cxf which uses annotations available in the jax-ws 2.0 spec to simplify the creation of web-services

516294
wicket	spring
you can use spring asp.net-mvc or struts 2.0 or wicket

516299
local-variables	class-members
containers typedef i usually use where the containers variablesiables is declared - locally for a local-variables as class-members when the actual containers instance is a class member

516303
archive	backup
this command copies the archive logs to the specified directory where you safely can back it up with the backup software of your choice

516303
archive	backup
what those commands do is putting a marker in the archive logs where the backup started so in a restore it knows from where it needs to start reading from in there

516310
function-parameter	local-variables
if you don t write this.variables in your constructor and if you have a local-variables including the function-parameter with the same name as your field variables in the constructor then the local-variables will be considered

516310
local-variables	class-variables
the local-variables shadows the field aka class-variables

516319
gethashcode	equals
also note that the gethashcode and equals implementations must agree

516330
updating	updates
i believe this could be to do with the viewstate being returned from the partial updates and that viewstate not updating in the page before the full postback fires - or it getting corrupted

516340
postback	ajax
because there is a page error during an asynchronous postback here s a good article on error handling in asp.net ajax applications

516364
value	field
the engine put the value on the right field

516364
value	field
recently i ve had a quite good experience with django wich in order to update create and filtering the table you just need to call .save .create field1 field field2 213 and filteringing filteringfield value

516364
implements	extends
i have had the idea to the extends class write an enum implements an interface

516364
value	field
so the super class get those field along with a private hashmap the key is the enum and keep the value so the client just calls

516382
expression	evaluation
the compiler can t figure out at compile-time when certain expression get evaluated so some runtime gets stuffed into the executable to handle this to call upon the evaluation of the so-called thunks

516385
zend-debugger	xdebug
i am aware of xdebug and use it as well as zend-debugger and other debugging scripting i ve written my own widget for this already

516398
http	ssl
tls ssl the s in http guarantees that there are no eavesdroppers between you and the server you are contacting no proxies

516404
selected	textbox
what i did is the front-end gives you a textbox to type your terms and it has a drop-down to selected between a few options like so

516406
mathml	latex
i think that the wikipedia solution generating png images from latex sourcecode is good enough until we get support for mathml in webbrowsers

516406
http-get	get
however i am already aware of several tools to generate png images from latex source code both online and from my command-line but what i was looking for was a simple way to get the image via an http-get request

516439
typedef	struct
the other big advantage with the typedef d version is that you can refer to the struct the same way in both c and c++ whereas in the second version they are refered to differently in c than in c++

516448
any	set
they have a phenomenal set of reports that you can view at any time to see where you re spending your time

516455
any	set
you must also reference system.web and system.configuration and any dlls containing configuration handler that are set up in your web.config

516462
global-variables	call
either you can shove that bound parameter into a global-variables and create a static function that can pick up the value and call the function on it or you re going to have to generate per-instance functions on the fly - this will involve some kind of on the fly code-gen to generate a stubs function on the heap that has a static local variables set to the value you want and then call the function on it

516469
firefox	opera
the results are pretty good too - it s fully useable on ie7 firefox opera safari

516474
annotations	mapping
seeing as javax.persistence already defines annotations that can be used for mapping properties to a database i d suggest instead that you let the users make pojos for their model objects with annotated properties

516479
derived-class	base-class
if that s not the case change the delegate to create an appropriate instance of derived-class based on the given base-class

516481
perl	ruby
i would like the solution to be a shell script if possible but perl without added modules is also acceptable this is for solairs machines that don t have ruby python etc

516484
python	ruby
also you can just run arbitrary javascript commands in the firebug console a la python ruby console

516487
haskell	c++
well haskell is only 1.8 times slower than gcc s c++ which is faster than gcc s c implementation for typical benchmark tasks

516487
haskell	lua
for the record i use lua for games on the iphone thus you could easily use haskell or lisp if you prefer since they are faster

516532
drools	jess
there are two choices that i ve seen jess and drools

516537
callback	methods
if implements idelegate you could have a collection of idelegates and therefore have callback to methods in different class types

516574
latitude-longitude	location
i m working with a large set of points represented by latitude-longitude pairs the points are not necessarily unique there could be several points in the set that are at the same location

516574
where-clause	sql
doing this with sql is possible by using a query with some trigonometry in the where-clause to filter points by their distance to a reference point

516587
erlang	python
say as a thought-experiment i wanted to port the erlang ejabberd to a combination of python and c in a way that gave me the same speed and scalability

516589
json	xml
and how is to say xml wont be replaced by json which will then be replaced by something else

516596
erlang	python
getting the functional style can be done in python easily enough although you wouldn t get the internal dispatching features of erlang for free

516596
erlang	python
stackless python can replicate much of erlang s concurrency features although i can t speak to details as i haven t used it much

516600
easymock	jmock
not sure what language technology you are working with but in the java world you can use jmock easymock etc for this purpose

516601
typedef	struct
we have a struct with no name which has been typedef to tagmystruct in the default namespace

516603
latitude-longitude	great-circle
if you re doing proper great-circle calculation based on taking the sine and cosine of the reference point and the other data points then a very substantial optimisation could be made by actually storing those sin cos values in the database in addition to the latitude-longitude values

516609
arrays	loops
the problem i am having is first with my columns arrays and the subsequent foreach loops

516612
arrays	loops
when it arrives the the client the loops s body just says which of course puts the same string into every element of the arrays

516629
triggers	insert
one methods is to use insert update triggers to set the created_at and updated_at columns to the current time

516629
triggers	insert
the insert triggers would look something like this

516664
nsstring	nsurl
it s easy to convert an nsurl to an nsstring and that to an nsdata

516666
configuration	environment
you have to do special things to your environment such as editing configuration files to run it

516669
packaging	building
in the long run you re much better off not entrusting your building and packaging process to dev studio and instead just using say nant and explicit command lines

516678
arrays	loops
also note that you should move that constant arrays declaration outside of your while loops for performance reasons

516689
derived-class	base-class
i would like to declare a constructor in the derived-class that will call the non-generic base-class but i do not know the syntax

516692
enterprise	legacy
there are many good mappers available and many legacy and enterprise apps come with them built in

516693
bitwise-operators	operators
this page describes delphi operators including bitwise-operators

516697
triggers	insert
you can add an instead-of triggers on that table for insert and updates

516697
triggers	insert
the triggers will check each record before insert it and make sure it won t cause a primary key violation

516697
triggers	insert
you can even create a second table to catch violations and have a different primary key like an identity field on that one and the triggers will insert the rows into your error-catching table

516740
32-bit	64bit
an anycpu assembly will jit to 64bit code when loaded into 64bit process and 32-bit when loaded into a 32-bit process

516740
32-bit	64bit
by limiting the cpu you would be saying there is something being used by the assembly something likely unmanaged that requires 32-bit or 64bit

516741
linux	unix
on unix linux you may use the top command

516742
any	set
any pair the deduction leads to more than one possible set of deduced values or if different pairs yield different

516742
templates	enable-if
both of these cases can be deduced so you could then use some other templates trickery possibly via enable-if to create a new type which represents the version you want ie

516744
32-bit	64bit
any cpu means that when the program is started the .net will figure out based on the os bitness whether to run your program in 32-bit or 64bit

516744
32-bit	x86
there is a difference between x86 and any cpu on a x64 system your executable compiled for x86 will run as a 32-bit executable

516747
32-bit	64bit
as 64bit on a 64bit machine and 32-bit on a 32-bit machine

516754
show	next
i d like to show the first one but have a next button to view the second and so on

516764
click	mouse
this is compounded with the fact that the menu appearing in the first place is delayed as well so right before they mouse over the link on the page they actually want to click the menu will suddenly appear and intercept their click when they weren t meaning to

516784
postgresql	mysql
if you are serious about porting the application over to postgresql or mysql i would recommend you to not use global variables at all since they are bad practice when coding according to me at least

516790
instance-variables	local-variables
differentiating between a local-variables and an instance-variables whether in the constructor or any other methods

516798
perl	php
we are running a large project with several different languages java python php sql and perl

516798
python	java
how well does python perl java cope with a common directory layout

516819
sql-server	oracle
this is the usual pattern it might be a bit different for different databases sql-server does not require you to specify the parameters in the command text but oracle does and in oracle parameters are prefixed with not with

516821
required	checked
although it is possible to required updatess using the other updates strategies checked before the application starts is the only way to guarantee that an older versioning cannot be run

516821
revision	updates
to mark an updates as required click specify a minimum required version for this application in the application updatess dialog box then specify the publish version major minor build revision which specifies the lowest version number of the application that can be installed

516827
packaging	building
stage is where you copy things during the building to prepare them for packaging

516836
webforms	asp.net
the future of webforms and asp.net mvc

516836
webforms	asp.net
coupled with that there are things that have been built as part of asp.net mvc that have already been released for webforms like the routing module which is going to be great help in some of my projects even without using mvc

516836
asp.net-mvc	webforms
on top of those there are also a number of changes coming in vs2010 that should help web developers using either webforms or asp.net-mvc which would be good

516836
silverlight	wpf
the same could be said of wpf silverlight - are they winforms webforms killers

516837
order	add
i suppose the ideal solution would be to add my errorprovider to me.components but in order to do this you need to initialize a new instance which you can t because me.components is nothing

516841
convention	standards
the library-project uses the standards companyname.tool convention

516849
javascript	dom
premise i ve started to study javascript and the dom and i have this html fragment

516855
transfer-encoding	chunked
is this correct transfer-encoding chunked

516861
click	mouse
another way would be to subclass jpanel and catch mouse click overriding paintcomponent to draw the correct image

516863
ref	out
when i read online help it said a volatile field should not normally be passed using a ref or out parameter

516882
ref	out
difference between ref and out parameters in .net

516884
interpreter	runtime
think of it as being compiled to a byte code that is interpreter by the .net at runtime

516886
32-bit	64bit
this is fine for a 32-bit platform but it will be unlikely that your application will be functional on a 64bit platform

516886
32-bit	64bit
i would change the return types to longs 64bit as this will behave correctly on both 64 and 32-bit systems you ll only need to recompile the dll

516891
ref	out
ref and out parameter-passing modes are used to allow a methods to alter variables passed in by the caller

516891
ref	out
the difference between ref and out is subtle but important

516891
ref	out
the important difference between out and ref parameters is the definite assignment rules used by each

516910
select	union
i am trying to create a view for a union of 2 select statements that i have created

516911
derived-class	base-class
making the chained constructor execute first guarantees that all base-class elements are at least as available in the derived-class as they are in the base

516915
configuration	environment
or in charge to create the test environment and configurationure the interaction between your class and your external dependency like editing configuration files of your application

516922
ref	out
so to sum up inside the methods you can consider ref parameters to be set but not out parameters - you must set these

516934
contains	elements
collectedtypegroup contains collectedtype s elements and elementss for types that extend collectedtype

516934
contains	elements
mytype will contains an elements called mytype.propertyone

516934
contains	elements
mytype will contains an elements called mytype.propertytwo

516939
any	set
how often you run any set of tests in going to depend on how long it takes all the tests to run and how disruptive the test runs will be to shorter-running tests including unit tests

516953
versioning	upgrade
this way i can upgrade individual applications from one versioning to another independently

516958
click	mouse
the problem that i am facing is that when double buffering is enabled the image seems to jerk towards the top left corner and then zooms properly to the point where the mouse was click

516964
defined	declare
tfruit is an so tfoodgroup must be defined if tfruit is provided even though i haven t explicit declare it

516965
subtyping	generics
subtyping specialization of ada style generics functions in an accretive environment

516993
internet-explorer	firefox
in firefox this works without a problem displays the alert once and runs my code but in internet-explorer 7 it results in an infinite loop displaying the alert forever

517002
hide	show
i want to hide the selected item from the opened wpf combo box basically to show instead of this

517050
onchange	onclick
those interfaces would contain all of the basic stuff that is obvious at first glance id name value list style onchange onclick etc

517050
webforms	asp.net
the yuiasp.net stuff is interesting but is more oriented to webforms and user controls than the direction that asp.net mvc and even moreso with fubu mvc recently are going

517057
any	set
besides promoting count to a field and setting a breakpoint on the set methods of the field is there any other way to do this

517078
stream	send
all the samples i found use the response to send the image back out to the browser with a stream

517114
webforms	asp.net
i m trying out asp.net mvc coming from asp.net webforms projects so i m used to just having the one code file with each asp.net markup file .aspx .ascx etc.

517118
directx	gdi
services can use most gdi functions but no advanced graphics functions such as directx or opengl

517130
interlocked	atomicity
edit writes and reads are atomicity if they re in a lock or an interlocked

517134
value	field
this knowledge allows the compiler to lift the value from the field into a register once before a loop or similar block of code and never re-read the value from the field for that particular code

517134
value	field
so when you flag a field as volatile you re basically telling the compiler that it shouldn t assume that it has the current value of this at any point except for grabbing snapshots every time it needs the value

value	field
locks solve multiple-step operations volatility handles how the compiler caches the field value in a register and together they will solve more problems

517134
32-bit	64bit
for instance if you re on a 32-bit cpu and writing a 64bit value that write-operation will require two steps to complete and if another thread on another cpu manages to read the 64bit value before step 2 has completed it will get half of the previous value and half of the new nicely mixed together which can be even worse than getting an outdated one

517134
32-bit	64bit
edit to answer the comment that volatile guarantees the atomicity of the read write operation that s well true in a way because the volatile keyword cannot be applied to fields that are larger than 32-bit in effect making the field single-cpu-instruction read writeable on both 32 and 64bit cpu s

517137
droppable	draggable
i am working on a proof of concept that makes use of the jquery user-interface draggable droppable

517138
32-bit	64bit
it seems to me that the arrays would be faster because all common computer architectures natively work at the word level 32-bit 64bit etc. processed in parallel and accessing the sub-word bits takes extra work

517144
where-clause	sql
i have seen this frequently in sql injection attempts in which the where-clause is set to

517202
.when	ready
.when the counter reaches zero the object is ready for garbage-collection

517233
any	set
the problem with the wizard you are describing is that after they ve made all their choices they may want to go back to #2 and change one thing to see how it changes the price - but the way you re building your wizard it may affect whether later choices can be made at all and result in a rather complex set of code you have to customize for each product - instead of storing everything nicely in a database such that the code can do everything needed and any product changes go into the database not code changes

517233
show	next
if you do go this route make sure you keep a lot of state around so that the choices they ve made previously show up as the default next time through

517233
order	add
since binding is listed per bound item then you might add binding to the above order and you might be binding 50 pages together for a total of 6 bound items 300 pages

517236
recursive-descent	lalr
this won t work exactly as is in yacc because yacc generates and lalr parsing while antlr is a modified recursive-descent

517237
json	xml
clarification what i m looking to do is write a python client to interact with a web service -- something to construct http requests and parse xml json responses all wrapped up in python objects

517240
contains	any
when the list is destroyed it destroys note the subtle difference betweens destroy and delete the object it contains a pointer but a pointer has no destructor so nothing happens any you will leak memory

517245
checkbox	button
you could give it a text file description of the protocol and it had a gui supporting checkbox for setting single bits radio button for choosing between the valid combinations of bits and drop-down lists when there were a lot of choices

517245
binary	hex
you could edit the hex view of the data the binary view of each field or even point and click at the fields and all the other views would update

517261
any	set
is there any way registry hack custom driver anything on windows to prevent this flag from being set

517273
any	set
one thing that you can do is set up a bounceback address that receives any mail that is undeliverable

517292
cpu-architecture	32-bit
the size of an atomic read write operation dependeds on cpu-architecture but is typically 1 2 or 4 bytes on a 32-bit architecture

517308
skinning	skin
you ll find a lot of skinning projects use xml to describe the various faces of the skin it playing music or organizing the library for an mp3 player skin and then where each control is located and what data and methods it should be attached to in the program

517314
sequences	subset
if the goal is to parsing a subset of lisp then the program text is a sequences of sexprs

517321
instance-variables	local-variables
a lot of people use this.x to visually differentiate instance-variables from local-variables and parameters

517321
instance-variables	local-variables
sure the compiler will catch it if you try to put this.x when x is a local-variables but there is nothing that is going to stop you from forgetting to tag an instance-variables with this. and if you forget to tag just one or if someone else works on your code and you are relying on the pattern then the pattern may be more damaging than good

517327
forms-authentication	security
for my asp.net website with forms-authentication i will use windows integrated security to access a sql database

517344
put	get
can t figure out how to put a loop around it that doesn t get optimized away i ll vote bool

517375
put	get
if you put your on off images into an arrays and assign that as the animationimages property you should be able to control the repeat and duration to get the desired effect

517377
jsonp	ajax
following ian s answer you can get ajax to cross the domain barrier presented by sop using jsonp

517377
jsonp	ajax
jquery supports jsonp ajax calls using the getjson method

517397
updatepanel	gridview
i have a gridview inside of an updatepanel and would like to allow the user to selected a row which would generate a call to a class that outputs a stream back to the client

517405
endpoint	uri
you can get the endpoint currently targeted and the uri for it by doing

517421
nyromodal	jquery
i regularly use jquery s nyromodal plugin for in-page popups generally more user-friendly than full browser popups

517428
value	field
it is a bad idea to worry about gaps in you identity field value

517429
nhibernate	ado.net
i ve run into this before using a combination of nhibernate + ado.net if nhibernate has cached something it may ignore ado.net changes

517451
sip	rtp
the problem with the sip spec and rtp is that it s very complicated especially is you consider all of the optional additions that have been made to it over the years

517469
contains	set
in this case you don t have to have one animal table which containss a lot of nullable columns to hold the bird and fish-properties where all columns that contains fish-data are set to null when the record represents a bird

517488
any	set
if results is a set or a hash then you re not guaranteed that any two traversals of results will be in the same order

517492
postgresql	mysql
i m assuming if you were writing raw sql you d be using a postgresql bytea or a mysql varbinary

517492
postgresql	mysql
there s a ticket with a patch marked needs testing that purportedly makes a field like this ticket 2417 support for binary type fields aka bytea in postgresql and varbinary in mysql

517495
firefox	opera
the w3c arrays firefox opera safari for accessing css rules is cssrules whereas microsoft s arrays is rules

517498
put	get
since this guy seems to put in so much effort to get around this problem wouldn t he be better off looking at better solutions

517517
javascript	dom
firebug allows for example to examine dom tree while javascript modifies it

517556
click	mouse
i want to close a tab in my tab control when the mouse wheel is click

517562
put	get
in version 1 i can t wait for r2 then i get to put it on production machines

517604
windows-server	windows
we re migrating our .net 2.0 websites from a windows 2003 server 32 bit with iis6 to a windows-server 2008 64 bit box with iis7

517615
graphviz	doxygen
doxygen combined with graphviz can generate call graphs

517619
export	csv
so after doing a bit more digging if 1 open the csv file in excel on mac and export it as csv file and 2 then open it in textmate copy the text and save it again it works

517621
ostringstream	std
the simplest thing to do is use a std ostringstream

517633
licensing	gpl
because they are required by the linux kernel licensing to gpl their work

517639
cherokee	apache
i d give you my code but i m using cherokee instead of apache

517643
lazy-evaluation	maybe
how dependency-injection makes you lazy-evaluation is maybe it forces someone else to deal with dependencies

517647
subdirectories	file-rename
edit 2 never mind i think i figured out the obvious solution start with an empty tree and just use sequential output of a pseudorandom generator to deterministically based on the generated number and the state of the tree generated so far do one of n actions make a new subdirectories add a new file-rename a file delete a file etc

517652
variables	boolean
i have a boolean variables declared at the top of a class and when a radio button is selected on a page the variables gets set to true but when the page is reloaded the variables gets reset back to false

517660
youtube	vimeo
many video players like youtube s and vimeo s use this

517662
internet-explorer	firefox
i am not a designer but i have noticed many chnages between firefox and internet-explorer

517662
margins	padding
i have been told that it is a good idea to set the universal selector s padding and margins to 0 and the body s margins and padding to 0 as well

517662
margins	padding
is setting both and body s padding and or margins necessary

517665
variables	boolean
your boolean is an instance variables so it will get the default value which is false for boolean every time you create a new instance of your class

517678
margins	padding
using the universal selector to reset margins and padding to 0 removes any cross-browser inconsistencies that may result from the different default css value

517691
margins	padding
setting the body s margins and padding is there to avoid the default spaces between windows edges and the html body

517700
32-bit	64bit
vmware runs as a 32-bit task but can still run 64bit applications if you are running on hardware the supports the vt extensions

517702
sql-server	mysql
since you re using rails i assume you re using mysql as your database so this may not be useful to you but sql answers mail for sql-server sends bulk email directly from sql-server

517708
couchdb-python	couchapp
i m used to simply proxying through something like couchdb-python and a normals webserver but would like to know any best practices with respect to authentication users in these kinds of couchapp

517726
export	report
a locale would map their data - their bi solution to the reporting portal - and be able to use the reporting portal to view execute and export report resuts with the same look and feel as everyone else in the organization

517736
shell	bash
and then i noticed that this simply isn t how you work there and i threw everything out spent a few days reading manuals set up my shell bash set up a gvim environment learned the gcc binutils toolchain make and gdb and lived happily ever after

517794
firefox	safari
need it to show up the same in the latest version of firefox and safari

517816
firefox	safari
also keep in mind that firefox and safari are most likely rendering your page correctly

517825
google-chrome	firefox
this works in ie google-chrome etc. but of course not in firefox as it doesn t have event.returnvalue

517829
getter	setter
example we don t require pure getter and setter to be tested

517836
silverlight	wpf
in wpf one might use functions like addvisualchild removevisualchild addlogicalchild removelogicchild to manage parent child relationships but these functions are not available in silverlight

517844
command-line	findstr
alternatively if i wanted to simply take a text file that included comments and produce an exact duplicate without the comment lines i could use a simple but effective combination of the type and findstr command-line tools

517861
value	field
a shipment has a field named products which is a java.util.map where they key is the product being shipped and the value is the number of instances of that product being shipped

517862
for-loop	loops
converted for-loops to while loops usually faster

517871
hide	show
for the basic of show hide in jquery there is a tutorial here

517884
g++	gcc
you need to manually set cflags cxxflags and ldflags if you want gcc g++ to look in non-standard locations

517920
firefox	gecko
the equivalent code in firefox according to the gecko dom reference is

517936
textwrangler	textmate
edit2 textwrangler and textmate seem to have features that allow you to open hidden files which partly answers my question

517937
configuration	environment
my current test environment is about 20 vms with varying os s 2000 xp vista vista64 server 2008 server 2003 in different configuration on a dual quad core xeon machine with 8gb ram looking to upgrade to 16gb soon and the slowest machines of all are vista primarily due to heavy disk access this is even with windows defender disabled

517939
dhcp	ntp
i think you can consider options like dhcp options ntp server but i am not aware of exact solution to this problem

517962
macros	vba
a macros vba something similar

517975
vb.net	vb6
if using vb.net vb6 or vba you can use createobject as follows

517993
textmate	bbedit
textmate a really nice text editor for os x open dialog has a show hidden files option and textwrangler and its big brother bbedit has it has a menu item

517998
hierarchical-data	nested-set-model
i m trying to save this structure into a db using the nested-set-model where each side of each node is numbered to define the hierarchy as in managing hierarchical-data in mysql

518015
value	field
or you can hide the original value inside a hidden-field with each form section although i don t recommend this as too many field forms will bloat your page

518043
reflection	runtime
but at runtime castle windsor looks up a concrete classes to service requests for an interface by using reflection

518050
getter	setter
i don t bother testing simple things like a getter or a setter

518060
value	field
i guess your problem is the fact that ad can store multiple value in a single field quite contrary to the very first normalization rule in relational databases

518079
having	select
if you re right about only about 5 of your row actually having additional image binary data then i d definitely say use the one table approach combined with the hint murthy gave - make sure not to do select on this table but only request those columns that you really need - leave out the blob columns as often as possible

518091
getter	setter
it does not step through any of the getter or setter

518092
function-prototypes	calling-convention
the function-prototypes as given cannot be easily called directly from c# as long as it is in delphi s register calling-convention

518094
udp	tcp
it s a fully functioning tcp udp client-server amazing for debugging sockets

518104
python	java
it s a simple abstraction layer for python akin to what the servlet spec is for java

518104
enterprise	legacy
the web scripting community is coming at the problem from a different direction shared-hosting cgi legacy privilege separation concerns than java folks had the luxury of starting with running a single enterprise containers in a dedicated environment against statically compiled and deployed code

518111
primitive	boolean
strings symbols numbers boolean nulls and undefineds are primitive

518113
getter	setter
you need both a getter and a setter or the property will not be serialization

518118
value	field
the value is encoded because the browser would concatenation multiple field with an ampersand character like

518123
getter	setter
i had to look it up and couldn t quickly find an authoritative source but it looks like the xmlserializer does use getter and setter while the binaryformatter does not use getter or setter

518123
getter	setter
my first point showed that you don t really want to use getter setter

518123
getter	setter
the binary formatter can just take the exact in-memory representation of the object so it skips the getter setter

518126
ftp	ssh
i m always a big fan of the .filepart protocol so that no matter what transfer protocol you use ftp ssh rsync etc you have the same understanding

518139
lookup	any
if the reason for the lookup is the user s convenience here s an alternate approach that doesn t require licensing any third-party databases

518161
json	xml
and to be honest even that would just expose some tables as a webservice whereas the power of xml json is that they are more like views that can contain multiple objects optimized for your application

518172
buffering	streaming
creating a bitmap with the streaming constructor will generate a fair amount of garbage as it copies data from one buffering to the other

518186
user-interface	look-and-feel
how do you plan non-programming aspects like windows layouts user-interface flow of game and look-and-feel

518190
webserver	upload
sounds like what you want the end result is something that will take n files and stitch the content into a static html page that gets upload to what i m assuming is a webserver

518216
getter	setter
to answer your question yes it does use the getter durning serialization and it does use the setter during deserialization

518239
put	get
how do i get the changes that were made by the datagrid to the datatable and put them back into a datatable or dataset so i can send them to the .mdb file

518252
getter	setter
i m using the class designer in visual-studio 2008 and when i add properties to my classes they are created with an empty setter and a getter that throws a notimplementedexception

518255
google-chrome	safari
webkit browsers safari google-chrome can use the -webkit-box-shadow css3 property

518267
one-to-many	entity
i have a hibernate entity with a getter that is mapped as a one-to-many

518272
paint.net	photoshop
i usually use paint.net for these sort of stuff but if you feel more comfortable using photoshop go ahead

518279
traffic	packets
could you not throw a packets sniffer like wireshark on the network and watch the traffic between one user and the host machine

518283
google-chrome	firefox
i can use this jquery code to dynamically change the rss link in the dom in firefox google-chrome

518294
command-line	cmd
the answer to the second part is -c which will execute a cmd supplied on the cmd-line

518294
shell	bash
it s much less comprehensive than cygwin but is mature and stable and has a good cross-section of the basic unix commands sed etc. it will play nicely with windows command files you can do piping and redirection and there is a port of zsh with it so it will also run shell scripts although zsh is not totally compatible with bash

518309
exception-handling	try-catch
if you need to catch and handle exception-handling then you ll need to expand it into a full try-catch finally or put a containing try-catch around the whole thing

518314
exception-handling	try-catch
if you want to catch exception-handling there you probably should go back to using try-catch finally

518318
selected	button
selected the start tracing now button

518318
selected	button
selected the stop tracing now button

518319
protected-mode	real-mode
edit this holds true for 16-bit real-mode for protected-mode see the other answers.

518323
constructor	object
update control.designmode isn t set to true when called within the constructor msdn of the object

518330
jquery	.post
what is simple way to handle this on a jquery .post in asp.net mvc

518333
json	xml
you could also use xstream and write them as xml or json

518359
python	java
here is an interesting comparison for return in finally block among - java c# python javascript

518368
postgresql	mysql
the limit offset clause from mysql and postgresql is a good solution that no-one else appears to do

518377
any	set
third you can set high cache-expiration times so the client doesn t keep checking for updates any time soon

518381
void	main
private static void main string arguments

518382
order	add
i want to add small images-arrows for moving up and down on tablerow in javascript maybe jquery and save the reordered table only the order in cookie for further use

518393
throttling	throttle
you can do some kind of throttling to limit it to x click per y seconds etc but then the adversary can also throttle his click rate

518413
arrays	loops
the basic idea is that you store all the parent nodes tracked by the depth value in an arrays and only write the left values in your loops

518445
stdin	eof
-w 1 specifies a timeout of 1 second and -q 0 says that when connected close the connection as soon as stdin gives eof which dev null will do straight away

518445
udp	tcp
bash also has its own built-in tcp udp services but they are a compile-time option and i don t have a bash compiled with them p

518447
selected	cell
the lowest item is a modify list entry when i selected it a new windows should automatically appear and the qcombobox should vanish and the cell return to a qt displayrole state

518455
textbox	button
the bottom-line is you use the user-interface concepts that make sense for your application whether they be textbox labels combos menus toolbars images button lists trees ribbons or some other concept

518458
sql-server	oracle
yes this is starting to sound like i want all the oracle features in sql-server without all the complexity and cost

518469
qtablewidget	qwidget
qtablewidget inherited 19 public slots from qwidget

518486
dynamic-reports	report
if there is any documentation saying dynamic-report then the client would be right and i would have to develop the report at no cost

518493
any	set
a lot of people seem to be deathly afraid of this idea but a good set of build scripting should be able to automate away any pain

518506
value	field
but there are times where you want to force the user to make a selection actively -- when the value of the field is somehow optional or additive

518535
entity-framework	ado.net
i have added the ado.net entity-framework

518535
entity-framework	ado.net
i do not want to have to use a second database connection for the one page that is going to use the ado.net entity-framework and i donâ t want to change the entire site to use the new entity-framework connection string

518556
administration	account
if you cannot access the network with this account i would check with your system administration to what other issues may be preventing this

518557
processor	cpu
how do i see the cpu usage of the individual processor

518561
parentheses	macros
another solution more a hotfix may be to put parentheses around the function to prevent it from being seen as a macros invocation

518564
solaris	linux
try mpstat if you re in solaris or linux

518647
haskell	scala
f# scala haskell - lots to pick

518659
profiling	trace
i think using sql profiling here is overkill in this situation particularly as it can create a substantial load on the server depending on what you trace

518672
click	mouse
in order to set the value of the jslider to the nearest value to where the user click on the track you d need to do some fancy pants translation between the mouse coordinates from getmousepositioning to a valid track value taking into account the positioning of the component it s orientation size and distance between ticks etc

518677
textmate	emacs
i m 21 and started using emacs at 15 only moving away for textmate e in recent years

518678
contains	set
if the user object really does contains an ordered collection of fielddata then use a set instead

518678
value	field
then the fielddata class doesn t need to map the field column and won t have that as a member it ll just have the value and any other fields from this table - of course if there really is only one column left to map you might just end up with a map of strings to strings

518697
perl	awk
i routinely use vi m x emacs eclipse sed awk perl yeah

518711
host	dns
the simplest way would be to just copy the web app and host two instances of it but that will be a maintenance hassle i really just want to setup a dns alias to the same site

518746
python	java
for instance java has its java.net.url python has its urlparse module and ruby has its uri module

518748
32-bit	x86
my live db is sql2008 x64bit and my dev box is x86 32-bit so i m not sure if that s an issue

518751
buffering	streaming
keep in mind though that all main streaming operating system use the so called flat memory modell which means that all segment selectors point to address 0x00000000 with the limit set to 0xffffffff which is the reason why you can cast between all segments and ultimately leads to easy exploitation of buffering overflows

518757
emacs	vim
all my team mates use either vim or emacs 50 vs 50 we have great flames from time to time our lead is also using vim

518774
ftp	ssh
eclipse provides ftp and ssh services and i ve been familiar with the interface for longer than any other ide and that is why i use it

518777
pointers	stack
you can always declare an com ptr on stack and assign your member pointers to it in any given methods if you really need it

518803
solaris	linux
running in both linux and solaris

518803
solaris	linux
i would like a solution that s mostly platform agnostic at least between linux and solaris

518818
checkbox	button
depending on the question you asked the best you can do is right click the folder you re interested in go to differences and click the recursive button and uncheck the same files checkbox

518839
select	union
i am trying to create a view for a union of 2 select statements that i have created

518842
boost-spirit	boost-regex
you could write a bnf using boost-spirit or create a regular expression to find the ip addresses using boost-regex

518848
debugging	trace
i also highly recommend you compile a c program and trace single-step debugging through it in assembly language

518856
any	set
besides promoting count to a field and setting a breakpoint on the set methods of the field is there any other way to do this

518862
communication	messages
encapsulation of data + behavior into objects communication via messages alone

518862
reflection	runtime
runtime reflection from object to properties of object

518893
emacs	vim
i am capable of using vim in a pinch but i really prefer emacs

518896
emacs	nano
prior to my introduction to emacs i was using gedit and nano to do all my coding

518902
textmate	emacs
textmate works like emacs but

518915
configuration	environment
move your settings to a different configuration for each environment you deploy to such as

518917
sharing	share
i m not sharing any code with this question simply because i d have to share the entire application and unfortunately i can t do that

518944
any	set
in fact if you can set an upper bound to your word count and you don t need any of the fancy list operations i d opt for a normal native arrays of string objects with an integer holding the actual number

518952
udp	tcp
the dns protocol is not that complex - can t you just do the dns accesses using raw sockets either tcp or udp

518970
selected	checkbox
you d want to use checkbox in the case where you can have more than one value selected or only care to get the value when selected

518992
stdin	pipe
i m assuming that if there are no arguments then input is being pipe via stdin

518994
any	set
make the updateshareddata methods a delegate property have any derived class set

518994
constructor	private
the property to a private method in its constructor and only obtain the lock if the delegate isn t null

518998
perl	php
like others i rarely work in compiled languages anymore so i ve setup shortcuts that run my perl php paste the interpreters to find syntax errors

519036
implements	abstract
what if you defined an abstract task and a ihasshareddata interface then in methods you check if the derived task implements ihasshareddata before doing the lock

519048
selected	textbox
ideally i would like each item to contain a textblock and then when selected it should contain a textbox instead

519048
hierarchicaldatatemplate	binding
i know that my binding for the data are correct because if i set one hierarchicaldatatemplate for the treeview the data is displayed correctly

519068
select	union
i am trying to create a view for a union of 2 select statements that i have created

519071
emacs	vim
my guess is that vim or emacs are two great editor...it s better than most of the ide i know

519080
firefox	opera
i tried the applet with firefox 3.0.6 safari 3.2.1 and opera 9.6.3

519083
union-all	union
hint the only difference here is that i used union-all instead of just union

519090
cvs	git

a 4 byte integer may be overkill especially as it is unsigned but space is cheap and its very unlikely you will ever run out of ids

521019
rewrite	rule
i need to have a .htaccess rewrite rule redirect to a scripting in the root of a subdirectories but only for any files directory in that sub directory.

521030
font-size	display
however ie5 also poses a problem when your font-size is specified by keyword relative to other browsers ie5 display the text about one step larger

521034
abstract-class	subclassing
for instance if the contract of the dosomething methods above required sometype to have populate x y and z fields when they were accessed via getters and setters your subclassing would blow up regardless if you used the concrete class that returned null as your base class or an abstract-class

521034
superclass	subclass
do i need the behavior of my proposed superclass in my subclass

521034
superclass	subclass
do i need the state of my proposed superclass in my subclass

521034
superclass	subclass
if the subclass was created from the proposed superclass would it truly be an is-a relation or is it just a shortcut to inherit behavior and state

521034
superclass	subclass
if it is just a shortcut and you cannot qualify your proposed subclass as-a superclass then inheritance should be avoided

521034
superclass	subclass
only if a class needs the behavior state and can be considered that the subclass is-a n instance of the superclass should it be considered to inherit from a superclass

521040
firefox	opera
i ve made myself a bookmarklet and it functions just fine but when added to a toolbar in opera or firefox it just takes on the default bookmark icon for the browser a globe and a star respectively

core components library components module components templates and configuration environment bootstrap

521069
pointers	stack
in my defense however i ll say that stack trace i got was a bit unclear and made it look like it was an el issue rather than a simple null pointers in my code

521080
value	field
i have a text field which uses the javascript onkeyup event to do some quiet validation with a tick or cross if the value is valid

521080
firefox	opera
this definitely happens in opera safari and firefox

521083
constructor	object
i was hoping that the compiler would tell me where the function is called from because the parameter type is wrong but the object has a constructor that takes an integer so rather than failing the compiler creates a temporary object passing it the integer and passes a reference to that to the routine

521083
constructor	object
how can i keep the thing int constructor but disallow the temporary object

521089
selected	button
users selected an item from the dropdown and click the button to go to the new url

521089
selected	button
i d like to be able to able to support when users hit the enter key when a dropdown list item is selected so that it replicates the behavior as if they ve clicked the button

521097
perl	php
i have progressed from basic to fortran then java and currently mainly using combinations of php and perl

521111
arguments	undefined
but i don t know how get the arguments passed to the undefined call caught by _ _ getattr _ _ to the function retrieved by getattr

521117
build-process	ant
i am trying to revamp our build-process which is currently a gigantic ant build.xml that calls into other ant build files and executes several java classes to perform more complex logic that would be impossible scary to attemp in ant

521117
groovy	java
experience in java and ant some groovy

521134
contains	any
nested types can access private and protected members of the contains type including any inherited private or protected members.

521135
instances	private
this information is private to this instances of mycounter - if we were to create another counter it would use a different spot to store the internal count

521137
selected	button
on shabdkosh.com home page there is a link key with the search button click on the link and then selected romanized hindi from the combobox given next to the key link

521139
selected	cell
what this does is if it s in columnheaderselected mode it flips it to cell selected and vice versa

521147
click	mouse
after a while of debugging i discovered that if i set a breakpoint on cmainframe onnclbuttondown click the caption bar but keep the mouse button held down let the debugger break in the function hit f5 to continue debugging then release the mouse button - magically wm_nclbuttonup is sent

521148
margins	padding
being able to see an element s computed style in the style tab and its padding margins offset in the layout tab were and still are a tremendous asset

521177
vb.net	vb6
vb.net arrays is padded with extra element so legacy vb6 code migration is easier

521179
boolean	double
the reason it works is that a boolean value is convertible to a double using the following essentially

521200
getter	setter
add a getter for the virtual attributes that returns this value and a setter that updates both the boolean and the underlying char

521204
ienumerator	ienumerable
debugging with powershell ise i see that strings has been set to ienumerator rather than the expected ienumerable xelement

521213
rewrite	rule
just do a simple rewrite rule like

521261
expression	brackets
i can get the square brackets without spaces inside with the regular expression

521272

all controls from the site inherited form a base-class

521291
slidedown	slideup
i extended the jquery effects called sliderightshow and slidelefthide with a couple functions that work similarly to slideup and slidedown as seen below

he goes on to show how to use loops with dictionaries but never really addresses a python solution in regards to how for-loop counters are typically used in other languages

521324
default-value	default
i use create type and create rule to set default constraints but not a default-value

521342
.net	wcf
the application is broken into a client c# mainly .net 2.0 mainly a wcf based server made to run on iis web services at this layer and a data back end that is nhibernate based with an ms sql-server database backend

521354
value	field
if you are designing your own custom extension field you may use base64 or quoted-printable to escape and unescape the value

521355
plugins	add-on
if this is some add-on you created you could stick with url-encoding since it s pretty tried and true and lots of languages have encoding decoding methods built in so your web app would encode it and your plugins or whatever you re working on would decode it

521379
contains	elements
bear in mind that collections are designed to contains elements of a single type

521383
triggers	insert
create an insert triggers on the source table to copy columns to the destination table just after they re inserted

521400
constructor	object
cloning an object is in general more expensive than copying a struct as it involves allocating the memory running the constructor and deallocating garbage collection when done with it

521402
profiling	debugging
i had the idea to run profiling collect the dml statements then replay them on the test server while debugging the app .

521403
video-streaming	streaming
most mobile-phones support video-streaminging via rtsp and the cheapest methods is the darwin streaming server and it integrates with the real video player

521431
python	ruby
microsoft can run a few a dozen languages on it s vm none as impressive as c# although ruby and python could be good--are they fully available yet

521440
base-class	inherited
the relationship between the two is that the c# type enum inherited the base-class library bcl type enum

521473
python	java
you need to output .png images and you need to manage threading maybe java or python are better alternatives to c .png output is a few lines in both languages while i think you need external libraries and such in c

521478
jms	jta
you can use jms and jta java transaction api together - see here

521478
jms	jta
all handled for you by your jms and jta provider

521478
jms	jta
you need to be using a jms implementation that supports jta

521497
subtraction	multiplying
then you left shift or multiplying by 2 do an and with 127 or do a subtraction of 256 if the last bit was set and do it again

521542
m2crypto	openssl
i was happy with m2crypto an openssl wrapper for blowfish

521567
arguments	default
then you call headtitle with the first arguments and no second arguments which makes it default to append resulting in the following stack

521573
order	add
if you have a clustered index on your table then add an order by to your selected statement to ensure it is inserted into your new table in the same sequence as the clustered index

521579
conditional	operators
i tend not to break a simple path across lines but will break the greater path at operators or conditional

521583
nsstring	nsdata
of nsdata nsstring nsnumber

521583
nsarray	nsdate
nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary

521614

you can enable croos-database ownership without having to give select permissions on the table that your sproc is calling

521615
xsl-fo	xslt
i wanted to take on the challenge of having a pdf option that would be a menu choice and do a tranform to xslt to xsl-fo to pdf

521630
windows-xp	windows
when in windowss-xp if i open the properties windows for the file and click the second tab i will find a windows where to add attributes or remove them

521640
having	select
what i don t want to do is to retrieve all order items from storage and filtering later too expensive so i want to end up having a db query of the type select

521665
javascript	dom
since i usually use the jquery adapter with ext javascript i ll use jquery s selectors to locate the specific dom element and jquery s bind functions .click fn while using ext internal to the function itself

521668
selected	textbox
at the moment when i selected an item from the combobox the textbox bit of the combobox just changes to say testwpf.result which is the name of the class which i have populated the combobox with

521668
value	field
how do i change it so that it display the value of one of the field there eg

521668
value	field
so it shows the value of the name field rather than the name of the class

521668
selected	textbox
i ve also added in a separate contentcontrol which i ve got to show the details of the selected item in the combobox but i want to get that to replace the textbox in the combobox

521668
selected	textbox
also is it possible to replace the textbox bit of the combobox control with a mixture of the contentcontrol and a textbox so that i can still type in the textbox to help selected items from the combobox but then when i close the dropdown the rest contentcontrol bit will be populated with the rest of the text and the icon

521669
rollback	commit
the problem i recently discovered is that it doesn t support nested transactions if a transaction is started inside an another transaction then every sqls running in the context of the inner transaction will be executed using the same db connection and when it s commited or rolled back it will automatically commit or rollback all the changes starting from the outer transaction

521669
savepoints	rollback
afterward if the nested transaction is rollback i will just rollback to this savepoints

521687
python	ruby
is there a c# equivalent of python enumerate and ruby s each_with_index

521694
order	add
the main difference when adding a tree item is that you might need to add the parent nodes in order to add the node being requested which makes it a bit recursive

521702
windows-mobile	windows-ce
does anyone know how to disable the windows-ce console on a windows-mobile v5.0 handheld device

521703
keyvaluepair	key
for purposes of enumeration each item in the dictionary is treated as a keyvaluepair of tkey tvalue structure representing a value and its key

521719
export	report
is there a way to export to excel from an ssrs report so that the header that displays on the first page of the report is omitted only in the excel export

521723
jquery	dojo
allowing users to choose javascript libraries prototype jquery dojo extjs etc.

521723
.when	ready
also .when i feel this is ready for beta testers i will certainly release it for free for everyone on this site

521725
value	field
first the extjs javascript combobox should automatically apply the value and display when an item is selected barring you ve assigned a store and told extjs the field requires a value

521737
rollback	commit
in oracle if you start a transaction you can rollback to savepoints within the transaction but you can t commit using savepoints

521737
rollback	commit
i can proceed happily forwarding and rollback to a b or c but once you commit you have started a new transaction and now a b and c are no longer valid

521750
ruby	php
ruby on rails python django php cakephp etc

521751
double	int
clojure already has a reader that knows how to distinguish int and double so if you re sure your string only has numbers in it you can use it

521758
treeview	listview
i use them a lot putting in treeview and listview tags where common static attributes can be accessed very quickly

521758
put	get
i create and populate my struct put it in the tag pull it out get the data of the selection and so forth

521767
positioning	slider
if you do not want objects to be slider up to be positioninged behind a translucent navigationbar in ib set the simulated metrics for the navbar to none and positioning the view elements as desired

521777
cvs	git
if my main requirement is to simply keep a versioned copy so there is always a backup then you can use git or cvs or subversion whatever you like

521777
oracle	mysql
i m not too familiar with mysql but in my oracle experience there is a lot less guessing when i store large business documents in a blob column

521782
reliability	robustness
it has the right combinations of system-level access cross-platform portability simplicity reliability power robustness and maturity

521782
build-process	scons
scons buildbot setuptools easyinstall and base python are my current target platform for the build-process

521793
mta	sta
be mindful of sta and mta for wpf though as only powershell v2 has full support for wpf full support for thread affinity

521798
business-objects	data-access
the advantage to this would be that you could quickly change your implementation of the data-access layer without having to change the business-objects as well

521798
business-objects	data-access
you would program your business-objects off of the interface then and you might be able to use dynamic assembly loading or some other methods to dynamically determine the implementation of your data-access

521802
arguments	default
agree with ryan and i d add that i ve sometimes found it helpful when handling keyboard events in general to wire up my listeners to the event s capture phase rather than the target or bubbling phases note the third arguments false by default

521808
web-config	app-config
you can put the username password in a web-config app-config file

521815
linux	unix
but i was hoping to build the lfs project outside of the modern operating systems unix linux os-x windows etc. and in something like dos

521815
linux	unix
by operating system i mean unix linux os-x windows and every other gui capable modern-ish os

521832
google-chrome	firefox
font-family helvetica lucida grande in my css but the text looks different in firefox ie google-chrome and safari and this is not even on different platforms

521847
triggers	insert
you can capture insert rows without a triggers by using either database change notification or change data capture

521859
gentoo	linux
i think the closest you re going to come is a gentoo linux stage 1 install

521867
build-process	ant
i solved some very complex parts of our build-process by simply extending ant to do exactly what i needed ex

521874
hide	show
this means your only alternative is to provide a parameter to the report that will hide or show the header

521887
contains	set
the inserts will occur at random ie whenever a set of users decide to upload a file contains the data about a 20 times a month

521892
javascript	dom
you can set the innertext or innerhtml property in javascript for most dom elements including divs and tables

521897
firefox	safari
i have a web page that renders the same in ie7 firefox and safari - except when printing

521927
debugging	trace
i can t debugging on the machine but i got a stack trace that narrowed the problem down to a single line of code

521961
macros	vba
i should have expected it given that it was part of a vba macros in an excel workbook

521974
environment	execution
by the time that javascript is execution it s in an environment where server-side code isn t visible

521985
json	xml
if you are planning to do any kind of xml ajax stuff make sure that your language of choice on the server side has robust xml and json libraries

521992
constructor	private
i d especially like it if you had a static readonly property for the empty list and perhaps make the constructor private so you always have to build from the empty list

522001
javascript	dom
from the web side not sure why you would serialize the form using the dom javascript as opposed to just submitting it via a normal post

522006
json	xml
use a standardized data serialization format xml or json being the most popular forms

522007
webforms	asp.net
in asp.net webforms the viewstate automatically handles this so that you can have multiple independent controls posting back and firing events without messing up anything else on the page

522009
selected	cell
if you want to position the picture to a specific cell then selected that cell as a range and use that ranges top left with to position the picture

522016
worksheet	excel
i would use the macro below to create a new worksheet in excel and then manipulate it or paste it into word as necessary

522019
sniffing	packets
it should be safe from packets sniffing off the network because the traffic never goes on the wire or airwaves

522023
contains	any
ms-access was chosen because it does not need any additional installation on the target machine s and the whole database is contains in one file which can be easily copied

522024
constructor	private
a concrete instance would be a class factory where you want one class to only be created through another factory class so you make the constructor private and the factory class a friend of the produced class

522033
constructor	object
you can make the constructor of the type private and thus make sure that only the factory can create type object

522043
associations	model
i m saying associations rather than relationship because i want to stress that this is a domain decision not an infrastructure one - i m designing the system from the model first

522046
udp	tcp
this is a very common case in systems to use a protocol like tcp or udp for local ipc over the lo interface

522051
sftp	ftp
but it was to prepare any current ftp script to be run via sftp when needed

522051
sftp	ftp
i made a wrapper object around .net sftp which looks and acts like a .net ftp object

522077
panels	grid
clicking a row in a grid calls the same page again with the addition of a details panels

522077
populate	row
click a row does javascript json call to a controllers action that returns details and populate a panels

522077
highlight	selected
i would like the selected row to be highlight

522124
aggregate	grouping
you need to include user.firstname and users.lastname in your grouping by clause - as they are not aggregate value note that mysql does actually support the syntax you ve used in your query but it is not standard

522139
callback	methods
i would create a methods which will take the callback you would normally pass to a thread and then have that called inside some wrapper code which you would use to track exception-handling in the thread something like this

522158
versioning	upgrade
as part of the upgrade we d like to be able to serve a web page to people using out-of-date vms telling them which versioning we now support and where they can download them from

522172
any	set
i know i can use parameters to default values but is there any way to just tell linqdatasource to not even set a property

522178
put	get
the way to do this with the least leftover space is to put the centers of the circles on a hexagonal grid like the pattern you d get if you were making a pyramid of coins

522202
json	xml
for the purposes of this question i am not interested in xml json etc

522203
firefox	safari
html5 s contenteditable is modelled after the existing property from ie which is also supported by at least firefox and safari so you don t have to wait for html5 to be â supportedâ

522229
selenium-ide	selenium
i found storehtmlsource method description in selenium reference but can t figure out how to use it in python code i generated by exporting recording of my actions from the selenium-ide

522244
click	mouse
when the user is trying to click it interprets is as a drag even if the mouse has only moved 1 pixel

522249
json	xml
i recommend xml because that is easy to parse from as3 but json and plain text should work as well

522251
iso	rfc
iso 8601 and rfc 3339 seem to be two formats that are common the web

522260
constructor	object
but then i m repeating the class parameter already given in the enummap constructor as well as creating throwaway keyset and enumset object

522261
shell	bash
i am writing a shell bash script and i m trying to figure out an easy way to accomplish a simple task

522265
iso	rfc
rfc 3339 according to itself is a set of standards derived from iso 8601

522276
linux	unix
having release debug version is the same as linux unix though

522280
value	field
is there a way to assign value to the backing field or the properties themselves or do i have to implement properties the old-fashioned way with my own explicit backing field

522281
iso	rfc
pretty much yes - rfc 3339 is listed as a profiling of iso 8601

522281
decimal-point	digits
for example truncated representations of years with only two digits are not allowed -- rfc 3339 requires 4-digit years and the rfc only allows a period character to be used as the decimal-point for fractional seconds

522311
hide	show
either the finished html menus hide and show as needed or in a big javascripton object in the javascript part

522328
value	field
this page discusses one way of checking if you are getting a bad distribution plotting the pseudo-random value in a field and then just looking at them

522334
vb.net	vb6
lastly since a couple people have asked...the legacy code was originally written in vb6 and then ported to vb.net with minimal architecture changes

522352
having	select
what is the best pattern for having a select all or deselect all checkboxes

522368
ref	out
out and ref is unreadable compared to returning tuples

522370
dependency-injection	inject
dependency-injection seems to state that external dependencies should be inject from the outside constructor or property setters so should i take an ilog instance in the constructor and use in the class

522382
value	field
there would be no unvalidated free-text field on that form -- date field would have input masks which would restrict input to valid dates and field that have a limited number of valid value would have control types that restrict the choices to valid data

522382
filtering	grouping
never accept free-form input from users when filtering data -- instead use controls that pre-validate input textboxes with input masks dropdown lists options grouping and limit it to values that you know are valid

522395
any	set
i ve set up a soap webserviceprovider in jax-ws but i m having trouble figuring out how to get the raw xml from a soapmessage or any node object

522400
selected	checkbox
just bring the selected all checkbox closer to the left border

522403
selected	checkbox
i ll be honest i ve never liked the idea of using a checkbox for the selected all option even though you see it a lot

522403
selected	checkbox
and if you selected all and then start unselecteding individual items in the list the checked state of the selected all checkbox becomes inherently confusing

522403
selected	button
i prefer to use a simple but obvious link button that toggles between selected all and unselected all as it is clicked

522421
build-server	nant
i checked the nant scripting into svn and the build-server zipped up my files without a problem

522444
checkbox	button
if you do not want to use a list i think a button or a hyperlink that toggles from select all to select none would work better than yet another checkbox which is hard to make out among all the other checkbox

522466
duplicates	contains
doesn t the friendly url contains duplicates identifying information about the blog post in question

522470
value	field
clustered indexes on the contrary contains the table data itself it each leaf you get the non-indexed field value right on scan

522492
margins	padding
as far as i know it s neither part of the table or the div table has no borders padding or spacing and the div has no margins or padding

522495
web-crawler	seo
there seems to be a lot of conflicting information about precisely what effect querystring have on web-crawler but the consensus is that having more than a couple parameters harms your seo because a long querystring variables indicates dynamic content and so most search engines will be a lot less aggressive indexing your page

522502
search-engine	web-crawler
first off they re friendly to search-engine web-crawler

522509
debian	linux
the server runs a linux debian

522509
perl	php
best would be perl and or php

522525
keyboard	mouse
since you have to have a place to put the mouse to move it and let s face it little point in the middle of the keyboard just isn t it

522531
search-engine	seo
search-engine technology has been reducing the effectiveness of seo hacks for some time

522546
uitableview	uiview
i have a nib file with a uiview a couple of uiimageview s including a logo and a uitableview inset within the uiview below the logo where i allow users to input a username password to login to my application

522546
uitableview	uiview
here it doesn t scroll at all and i m going to guess because the uitableview is inset within the uiview

522558
webforms	asp.net
the new system.web.routing dll is part of asp.net 3.5 sp1 and is bin deployable on asp.net 3.5 so you could use the features of that on a classic asp.net webforms site

522563
for-loop	loops
when i loops through it using a for-loops how do i access the loops index from 1 to 5 in this case

522568
forms-authentication	security
if you are using asp.net forms-authentication it already provides the mechanisms for a user to reset a password by using a security question

522568
password-recovery	login
this can be configured in the web.config and used with a password-recovery control part of asp.net login controls

522568
password-recovery	reset-password
as far as not sending the email you can cancel the email by adding onsendingmail cancelemail in the password-recovery control and then add code behind like below and then just display the new reset-password on the screen

522571
worksheet	excel
i would like to know the best way to transfer data from a web service to an excel worksheet office 2007

522571
worksheet	excel
in our scenario a user will be using excel with a number of macros and such and will request about 11000 rows of data from the server to a worksheet

522572
actionscript	mxml
one thing i do recommend however is keep actionscript out of your mxml files as much as possible

522572
actionscript	mxml
mxml is a layout language and in my experience it pays in the end to use it where it makes sense and drop into actionscript whenever heavier lifting is required

522574
.net	wcf
this is a .net 2.0 console application so wcf doesn t seem like a viable option

522599
.net	wcf
but you could use others - like webservice wcf messaging system msmq .net remoting even

522622
processor	cpu
incidentally i think the current trend of cpus with multiple identical cpu cores will eventually subside as well and the real processor of the future will have a single master core a collection of general purpose cores and a collection of special purpose coprocessor like a graphics card but on-die with the cpu and caches

522626
terminate	timeout
if a query in the database hits the maximum query timeout in sql-server the database query terminate and the web service returns an error to the client

522627
subtraction	addition
plussign and minussign are used for the mathematical addition and subtraction operators

522640
jmock	junit
i had some similar sounding problems with jmock junit eclipse recently although admittedly not with plugins tests

522645
process-explorer	perfmon
you can see how many gdi objects are live in your app by using task manager process-explorer perfmon etc

lisp	lua
learning c# because it may or may not have features that java doesn t have seems like a very odd reason in opinion it does have a number of features that java doesn t but so does f# lisp haskel ruby lua and even cobol

522701
updating	updates
in general i d say it is very unintuitive for an updates function to delete the object it is updating

522720
python	ruby
therefor i try to implement the algorithms given in python from the book programming collective intelligence ruby

522720
python	ruby
this seems to work in python but not in ruby

522766
python	perl
your sub-scripting notation wants to treat it like a python dictionary or perl hash with two indexes combined

522771
arguments	default
just note that you can t set a default arguments in a block declaration like that

522812
python	ruby
a pure ruby search engine would be even slower than a pure python one

522813
arrays	map
quartz use font data provided by apple type services ats to map each byte of the arrays through the encoding vector of the current font to obtain the glyph to display

522818
annotations	mapping
when you have the mappedby property in the onetomany annotations it means your going to have a bidirectional mapping

522820
subtyping	generics
i think java would have been way better off if 1 it had not added generics but 2 instead had allowed implicit casting from a supertype to a subtyping

522823
put	get
but regardless of where i put the and in relation to the footnote text i get the following error

522827
32-bit	16-bit
unicode strings in python are stored internally either as ucs-2 fixed-length 16-bit representation almost the same as utf-16 or ucs-4 utf-32 fixed-length 32-bit representation

522846
droppable	draggable
i can tell the droppable target is accepting the element being dragged via the thumbnail class but the draggable item won t drop

522885
latex	tex
i think the best solution would be to use enumitem package from ctan it is present in tetex and latex and should also be present in most other tex distribution

522897
firefox	gecko
which is supported in firefox and other gecko browsers

522912
firefox	safari
i don t have any problems with your code on either mac safari or mac firefox using jquery 1.2.6 and jquery user-interface 1.5.3

522914
decision-tree	weka
your best bet would probably be a support vector machine smo in weka or a random forest yes it s a silly name but it helped random forest catch on. if you want the advantage of easy interpretability of your classifier even at the expense of some accuracy maybe a straight up j48 decision-tree would work

522928
margins	padding
flexible allow reasonably precise control over positioning padding and or margins and styling

522948
margins	padding
do you have any padding margins restrictions

522964
png	gif
other than that it s up to the uses of the images quality compression etc. in terms of whether you choose png gif jpeg tiff etc

522966
png	gif
if you were it usually doesn t matter between png gif and jpg other than jpg being a lossy format the other two are lsosless which is ok for photos and the like but not say for icons or text

522974
addition	division
i need basic mathematical operations such as addition and division for arrays

522974
addition	division
what about the addition and division between a and b

522984
webserver	upload
if you want the fastest speed then you should write them to disk when they are upload modified and let the webserver serve static files

522993
perl	tcl
after occasional exposure to tcl and perl i was really wishy-washy on the value of these kinds of tools

522995
hyperlink	external
you should be parsing the document into a dom tree and then you can pull out any hyperlink stylesheets script files images or other external links that you want and traverse them accordingly

522995
python	php
many scripting languages have packages for getting web pages eg curl for php and for parsing html eg beautiful soup for python

522998
ubuntu	debian
sudo apt-get install libdirectfb-extra # for debian and ubuntu anyhow

522998
sdl	x11
also directfb has a sdl backend and sdl has a x11 backend

523008
enumerator	any
i had a project with wide usage of visitor pattern without any enumerator at all

523008
enumerator	any
enumerator in this case if any was done outside of visited structure and visitor

523027
triggers	insert
in other words we don t do any complex joins or filtering so insert updates triggers from save work just fine

523031
alignment	wrap
if you want true vertical alignment in the middle ie if the text wrap the button is still middle-aligned with respect to both lines of text then you either need to do a table or work something with position absolute and margins

523031
order	add
you can add positioning relative to your drop-down menu or more likely its parent in order to pull it into the same order level as the button allowing you to bump it above them with z-index if it comes to that

523106
freebsd	linux
also needs to run under freebsd linux

523109
order	join
the bit in the middle is working out the id of the third-lowest-id article for each category by trying to join three copies of the same table in ascending id order

523111
order	join
since i only needed three articles per category i can repeat the query three times instead of repeating it for each category one for the first article in all categories one for the second article and one for the third article in all categories and the join them all and order by the category

523112
document	element
put a base element in the head of your document

523121
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the bottom line is that you still need to make sure that you are handling the data securely whether you are using asp.net-mvc or webforms

523127
extends	final
one final suggestion when a request for your main page comes in put it in a queue and respond to the requests in order in a separate process you may have to hack extends the webserver to do this but it will likely be worthwhile

523154
postgresql	mysql
on mysql and postgresql the two databases i ve used the syntax would be

523154
lookup	any
lookup any tutorial on sql for more information on how it works

523163
pie-chart	charts
i was perusing the asp.net charts control s sample website and came across something in the pie-charts gallery

523171
dialog	pop-up
the pop-up windows are very easy to implement and the modal dialog boxes are even easier

523195
dialog	pop-up
i have a strange encoding situation whereby the html page itself displays as it should with all the accã nted chã racters properly displayed but all the pop-up dojo dialog fail to use the correct encoding

523200
linqdatasource	databound
one control in the form is a dropdownbox that is databound to a linqdatasource whose context is a linqtosql data class

523223
authentication	login
if you require a login you probably want to have controllers and actions which require authentication

523258
c++	lua
it can generate lua wrappers for existing c c++ header-files

523289
highlight	tooltip
if a field contains invalid data it is immediately highlight in red and its tooltip text is changed to display an error message if you are entering a person query and you enter a date of birth in the future for example the date of birth field will immediately turn red

523289
required	checked
this second validation pass is required in order to run validation checked that involve multiple fields

523289
required	checked
this way the validation rules can be tailored to each field but the queryfield class can handle all the common field-related stuff field name field length required not required checked etc.

523291
private-members	private
one example would be region creation - i always like my classes to be divided into the following regions - private-members public properties public methods and private methods

523298
overlap	padding
as mentioned above vertical padding on an inline element doesn t behave the way you would expect it increases the element s height but because the padding doesn t interact with other page elements the inline element often overlap things in odd ways

523298
background-color	display
the logic behind this markup styling is that you need padding on the for the border background-color to work which means it has to have display block

523352
webforms	asp.net
i think asp.net mvc should be a lot easier for you to simply jump into compared to webforms

523353
webforms	asp.net
you do not need to worry about asp.net webforms or asp.net ajax which is only for webforms mvc contains its own ajax stuff including jquery in the main mvc download

523360
hide	show
i need to crawl a web board which uses ajax for dynamic update hide show of comments without reloading the corresponding post

the point is any xaml element can be used as the root of a xaml document

523382
populate	row
i populate the tables with a row each see below and ran the code you ve listed above

523391
affinity	cpu
you could set the cpu affinity of your program

523393
processor	cpu
or since the other dll will be loaded in your process you might be able to set your process or threads processor affinity to just one cpu

523397
conditional	operators
i use ternary operators when i need to call some function with conditional arguments - in this case it is better then if

523411
visitor-pattern	visitor
this is still called the visitor-pattern in fact design pattern s first sample of visitor does it this way

523427
processor	cpu
you can then set the processor affinity for that job object to include only one of the available cpu cores

523427
processor	affinity
the child process is not able to change the affinity mask to anything that is not a subset of the processor affinity for the job object

523434
required	checked
aside from the provided solution you should also checked whether the required arguments are there move the last if block to before the assignment to to x and y before trying to pass them to atoi or you will get run-time issues

523442
alignment	spacing
as far as the aesthetics is concerned i have discovered that focusing on things like fonts icons spacing between and alignment of controls selective use of color i love using gradients etc

523472
processor	affinity
setting processor affinity is the wrong approach

523483
lighttpd	apache
apache lighttpd etc are all great for being flexible but you run a single purpose website and you really need to be able to both do more than the current servers are capable of doing both in handling traffic and in appropriately combating bots

523509
click	mouse
i have re-written classes from a printout originally written in eclipse using both ides and i used about 40 less key strokes mouse click to write the same classes in intellij than eclipse

523530
graphicsmagick	imagemagick
graphicsmagick and imagemagick are two different libraries

523535
payment	billing
i d focus on the billing shipment parts - you can find bots by either finding multiple deliveries to same address or by multiple charges to a single payment methods

523542
cos	sin
on my labtop sin and cos takes about 144 ns

523544
json	xml
json javascript object notation it works much like xml but it uses about 70 less data

523544
getjson	post
getjson also works but lacks http request type post get

523550
pointers	stack
call pushes the current instruction pointers on stack rather one after the current instruction and then jmps to the location

523560
compatibility	legacy
if you can t port your iis 6 configuration to iis 7 s model for legacy reasons be sure to install the iis 6 metabase compatibility layer feature

523563
jquery	dojo
while i prefer jquery for almost everything i know some people whio swear by dojo or extjs

523569
windows-vista	windows
windows-vista has the bcd which is a file in the same format as the windows registry

523570
cos	sin
you could pre-store your sin and cos in an arrays if you only need some approximate value

523570
double	int
you then use this arrays using degrees int instead of radians double

523583
communication	messages
no matter how secure the nazi s thought their communication were the allies would often break their messages

523595
i2c	spi
ethernet serial ports uart spi i2c and gpio s support are all in one

523596
internet-explorer	firefox
i wrote down all the steps for firefox and internet-explorer below

523597
selected	listbox
i have some say 9 no not definite unique strings from database a b c d e f g h and i want to create unique combination of these fields to populate the listbox so that user can selected single or different combination of these string fields

523625
environment	building
although not exactly an answer to your question some build environment like ant also support parallelization of building so if your dependency graph permits you can have multiple javac s running at the same time

523671
any	set
try to set combobox to any existing value in combo s datastore before doing new setvalue in your datachanged event handler

523674
numerical	matrix
if you are doing a numerical simulation such as a finite-element model you will be basing your simulation on a matrix computation library

523674
mersenne-twister	generator
then you take a pseudo-random number generator with good statistical and geometric properties the mersenne-twister algorithm is widely used for this and write a function to convert the output of this to a random variables with the appropriate distribution

523674
python	java
you could use the output of the python one with the same random number seed to test the correctness of the java one

523675
hide	show
this will show all the divs on page1 and hide them all on page2

523676
entity-framework	ado.net
i want to know if there is way to create a database out of existing classes with the ado.net entity-framework or to map existing classes to a database

523676
entity-framework	ado.net
is there a possibility in the ado.net entity-framework

523679
authentication	login
any site which asks for credentials in a web page rather than the browser s login dialog box is using a custom authentication method

523690
worksheet	excel
i wanna find some text for example joe and remove it from where it is in excel worksheet with c#

523691
value	field
if you set the value of hidden form field linked with combobox then combobox would render the label of that value instead of the value itself

523691
value	field
in your datachangedlistener instead of setting the value of combobox you should set the value hidden form field associated with combobox

523695
postdata	request
the post request from fiddler contains just this query string obviously not containing any of the postdata from the contact us form because thats a completely separate http action

523695
postback	ajax
so of course i need an actionresult to handle the ajax postback

523696
dialog	pop-up
i d use the jquery user-interface dialog plugins to pop-up the dialog

523699
configuration	logging
you can use microsoft s free enterprise library for dataaccess logging caching security and configuration

523701
cos	sin
on the x86 the java.lang.math sin and cos functions do not directly call the hardware functions because intel didn t always do such a good job implimenting them

523708
textmate	emacs
i do almost all my coding in textmate which has been dubbed the emacs of macs

523714
windows-vista	windows
windows-vista startup process applies to windows server 2008 as well

523741
hash	md5
feed that into configured session hash function either md5 or sha1

523762
google-chrome	firefox
download a copy of google-chrome firefox with firebug or ie9+

523773
www-mechanize	lwp
can perl s www-mechanize or lwp issue a head request

523786
required	checked
one thing to remember though is that if you use the second methods be sure to mark your stored procedure as with recompile i can t remember if the parentheses are required or not - checked the syntax

523791
sql-server	mysql
the answer will solve the problem in the scope you set you can ask for or tag as sql or sql-server or mysql

523799
compression	streaming
the question compression for a unique streaming of data suggests several approaches which could help you

523802
groovy	java
you can use junit 4 with grails as long as you re using groovy 1.5+ and java 5+

523809
32-bit	16-bit
maybe you could store the difference between consecutive 32-bit integers as 16-bit integers

523810
solaris	procfs
for solaris you could try the procfs module from cpan

523810
solaris	linux
otherwise although i see you say you don t want to fork a simple solution would probably to crank 20 lines of c to produce a small program that just spits out the environment on solaris as the exact equivalent of the linux environ file

523810
opensolaris	solaris
edit after reading opensolaris pargs.c the environment buffer is reallocated under solaris when the environment changes so the psinfo pointer may be invalid

523817
msbuild	nant
nant msbuild etc.

523818
swing	awt
the answer will vary slightly depending on whether the application or applet is using awt or swing

523818
swing	awt
for swing the method to override is the paintcomponent method of the jcomponent and draw the image as with what was done in awt

523818
swing	awt
painting in awt and swing

523819
javascript-framework	dojo
zend-framework actually has built in support for the dojo javascript-framework which you may find easier

523827
boost	tbb
i know that similar templates exits in intel s tbb besides that i can t find any implementation on google or in boost library

523831
ethernet	lan
wake on lan wol sometimes wol is an ethernet computer networking standard that allows a computer to be turned on or woken up remotely by a network message

523835
combinations	permutation
i also just used a the java code below to generate all permutation but it could easily be used to generate unique combinations s given an index

523836
contains	elements
is there a way to selected elements contains within an embedded iframe

523837
switching	screens
however when i put a default in one of the switching statements that default applies to every other switching statement and so when i use the variables of another switching statement in the url the default case of that other switching statement will appear on screens along with the case of this switching statement

523846
driver	kernel
once a os goes in hibernate sleep the only way to bring it up is through some kind of kernel level hardware driver event

523878
subshell	bash
if this is run the bash subshell running in the background is terminated ok but tail still hangs around

523889
mersenne-twister	generator
if you seed the mersenne-twister with all bits set to zero except one it will initially generator numbers which are anything but random

523890
contains	any
however i needed to get rid of any numbers which might be present in the string so i declared a string contains characters which i wanted to use as separators delimiters as follows

523898
exception-handling	try-catch
probably best to use try-catch in all layers but only silently catch the exception-handling in the user-interface layer

523904
json	xml
i use this with calls to ajax-only actions that i either don t want output or i m using some other output like xml or json

523930
stream	send
after connecting to the socket i don t know how to get the stream response to decompress and send back to context.response.outputstream

523933
macros	basic
ideally virtual so they can be extended in subclasses. a few simple macros will let you to write out different basic types quite quickly in a big little-endian-neutral order

523939
versioning	upgrade
i run into this fairly often when coding in python because my desire to upgrade to a new versioning of the interpreter can easily introduce problems in libraries that worked fine before

523945
filepath	unc
as they are detected the stored procedure calls a .net console app using xp_cmdshell passing the product id unc path report name adobe-reader filepath on the sql-server and a few other parameters

523945
filepath	unc
the filepath and unc path are passed as parameters and voila - automatic printing of ssrs files

523982
children	nodes
in general you should construct a tree in such a way that all the leaf nodes those with no children are operands and the internal nodes everything else are operators

523982
children	nodes
this should be so that the children of an operator nodes are its operands or themselves operators which have operands

523982
postorder	inorder
if you can construct a tree in this way forming the various notations prefix postfix infix are fairly simple -- you just follow the preorder postorder and inorder traversal of the tree for which there are well known algorithms

523982
linked-list	tree
as far as i can tell you re not constructing a tree rather a linked-list and this isn t going to serve you well

523988
contains	elements
here s a recursive approach to count the number of these subsets we define a function count minindex numelements minsum that returns the number of subsets of size numelements whose sum is at least minsum contains elements with indices minindex or greater

523998
expression	evaluation
however a stack might be easier to program for simple expression evaluation

523999
traversal	parent
there is no need for pointers to parent nodes when using recursive traversal

524039
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox seem to be working fine

524039
display	width
also when ie7 doesn t display the image with the proper height width if the browser is refreshed it then displays properly

524055
itextsharp	itext
you could try using itext or itextsharp to build pdf files

524063
button	popup
so your popup could call a function on the parent page to pass the data back when the user clicks the submit button

524069
exception-handling	try-catch
put the try-catch where you are sure you won t just swallow the exception-handling

524077
latitude-longitude	street-address
just found out get street-address at latitude-longitude pair

524079
exception-handling	try-catch
for example a try-catch in the persistence layer that catches an sqlexception-handling does what the persistence layer needs to do like notify an admin for example then throws a new exception-handling that will make sense to some code that calls the persistence layer

524095
fclose	fread
the file functions fopen fclose fread are examples of oo code in c

524104
subprocess	pexpect
if you re familiar with how a href rel nofollow noreferrer expect a allows passthrough to interactive subprocess with specific key sequences from the user or strings received from the child process triggers matches and sending control back to your program the same thing can be done from python with a href rel nofollow noreferrer pexpect a

524104
ncurses	x11
alternately as another post mentioned the a href rel nofollow noreferrer ncurses a module provides full control over the drawing of terminal displays -- which you ll want if this history menu is happening within the windows rather than in a graphical x11 win32 pop-up

524110
iomanip	cout
you might consider #include iomanip and cout hex m_flag dec

524114
put	get
if demand for your random crap is high enough that people are willing to go to these lengths to get it legitimate users aren t going to be put off by a captcha

524147
python	java
or does jython allow you to do everything-python in java including django i m not sure how jython differs from python

524178
observer-pattern	proxy-pattern
you can use the virtual proxy-pattern along with observer-pattern

524193
textile	bbcode
the three common markup i know of for this purpose are markdown used i believe by so textile and bbcode

524201
python	java
python implemented in java

524210
processor	affinity
this is done by setting the processor affinity of the thread

524245
debugging	trace
as far as i know visual-studio defines only debugging and trace constants

524250
qmail	exim
i have no experience with them but i m told that qmail and exim are equally good

524259
stream	send
all you d have to do is intercept the incoming http stream see if it is from the site you want to vandalize yes vandalize and then modify the stream insert html and so forth and then send it back downstream

524266
value	field
write your code to update your field id s daily with a new random value

524283
contains	elements
and if you need to check if your collection contains elements at given index it is more pythonic to write

524286
python	php
scenario i have a php script that executes a python script via popen

524298
meta-inf	jar
signature in the meta-inf and thereby complaining it doesn t match your other jars which have only one corporate signature on each jar

524309
prolog	lisp
try c# lisp prolog and c for example add some toy functionality to a local copy of the linux kernel to see how it ticks

524326
command-line	cmd
what i do when i release cmd-line jars for windows linux is to embed all the jar libraries inside my jar using the ant cmd

524329
32-bit	64bit
note if you use 32-bit and 64bit

524329
32-bit	64bit
need to install both 32-bit and 64bit

524330
having	select
bad api documentation and lacking code completion due to dynamic typing having to import every module i use in every other module gets tedious when having one class per module having to select the correct module to run the program and having to wait 30 seconds for the program to start and obscure the ide before being notified of many obvious typos and other mistakes

524330
groovy	java
this leaves java and jogl as an attractive option but i m also curious about ruby and groovy

524332
buffering	streaming
the out streaming buffering all output in memory then sends the final output when the handler exits

524333
configuration	environment
it takes all environment configuration and other stuff allows you to concentrate on concrete task

524362
export	csv
do you have access to foxpro to export the file as a csv directly from foxpro without using the utility

524372
python	c++
about python although i have few experience with opengl programming with python used c++ for that the python community offers a number of interesting modules for opengl development pyopengl pyglew pygpu

524381
linux	bsd
i ve had long conversations with my sysadmin friend on why why not bsd linux

524386
linux	bsd
one of the big areas that bsd has over linux is licensing

524386
unix	bsd
plus bsd is a bit more mature operating system being directly descendent from at t system v unix

524386
linux	bsd
the commonly cited wisdom is that bsd is more useful for a server os and linux is more useful for a desktop os

524386
linux	bsd
but don t take that as the gospel truth as lots of people have successfully used linux as a server os and lots of people have used bsd as a desktop os

524393
.when	ready
.when lets imagine that you compile 2 router information you are ready to go

524404
qmake	cmake
basic unintrusive support for common buildsystems - straight make cmake qmake autotools

524404
anjuta	gnome
anjuta geany and a bunch of other micro-ides for gnome fail at indentation and misc features

524408
linux	bsd
there are some different philosophies in bsd than in linux

524408
linux	bsd
for example linux prefers gnu commands while bsd opts for either classic bsd commands which are similar but often times have different options or newly written ones falling back to gnu when nothing else is available

524408
manpage	bsd
also i find the bsd manpage to be more comprehensive and contains more examples than gnu manpage since gnu tends to prefer info pages which i despise for examples

524408
linux	bsd
sure you can install most of the same stuff on bsd as linux but you won t find a distro similar to say ubuntu which focuses strictly on the desktop

524420
binary-tree	nodes
my current thinking on how to do this would be to build a binary-tree over the data where each nodes contains the min in the related span

524420
contains	set
to clarify the tree i m talking about would be set up sutch that the root node would contains the min value for the entire row and for each node it s left child would have the min value for the left half of the parent s span and the same for the right

524421
server-side-includes	include
i m a bit reluctant to go down the server-side-include route because i don t yet know what type of server iis apache i ll be hosting the files on and whether include will be turned on or off

524444
codeigniter	cakephp
i ve used codeigniter cakephp and even smarty template engine

524459
virtual-machine	vmware
i ll set up a vm in vmware workstation configure it to my liking and then use vmware importer to import my virtual-machine into an esx environment

524460
configuration	environment
you could use but be aware that it contains the contents of and and that the presence and order for overwriting purposes of variables in this superglobal is subject to configuration in the execution environment

524485
value	field
inorder to use multiple value for a named parameter in arrays in php you have to name your form field like this

524485
value	field
by puting the braces at the end of the name of the field php will be able to store multiple value for that paramter

524485
selected	checkbox
if you are using multiple checkbox or multiple selected you should name your fields like this

524486
subtract	time
if the ap response time is consistent then you should be able to subtract it and hence compute the distance to the ap

524493
cocoa	uikit
if your app using lots of uikit views then you will need to rewrite quite a bit to use the mac standard cocoa views instead

524499
.when	ready
there s nothing wrong with using a backgroundworker for this but the enqueuing dequeuing should really just use a producer consumer queue which blocks .when you try to dequeue .when there s nothing ready

524511
python	java
one advantage this has over pure python is i can use java with all of eclipse s benefits like autocomplete and move it over to python when parts get unwieldy in java

524519
order	join
this will happen irrespective of your join statement order

524548
python	c++
in my python application i need to write a regular expression that matches a c++ for or while loop that has been terminated with a semi-colon

524548
contains	any
i think it breaks because as soon as you put some text between the opening and closing parentheses the balanced grouping matches that contains text and thus the part doesn t work any more since it won t match due to the fact that the text inside the parentheses is different

524565
value	field
look at the html source to figure out the field value to post

524567
duplicates	contains
i m only thinking reuse for when multiple linq queries contains duplicates object initialisation code

524609
having	select
having to select the correct module to run the program

524610
domain-object	repository
your customer domain-object should have no knowledge about how or if it might be persisted to a database and this is what should be returned from your repository

524610
domain-object	repository
in your repository you might have some mapping code - this is quite common - that maps from however you get the data back from its storage location to your domain-object

524624
decrement	increment
now keep incrementing pos reading the characters at the respective positioning and increment openbr when you see an opening bracket and decrement it when you see a closing bracket

524624
decrement	increment
that will increment it once at the beginning for the first opening bracket in for increment and decrement some more for some brackets in between and set it back to 0 when your for bracket closes

524641
buffering	streaming
for educational purposes i want to create a ostreaming and streaming buffering to do

524642
python	java
personally i m mostly a python developer when not doing c or java but couldn t care less about autocompletion.

524659
string-length	digits
edit i m not just asking about generic validations string-length 200 zip code is 5 digits or 5+4 but assume that the rules engine would actually be leveraged

524669
constructor	object
constructor are for initializing the object so

524671
constructor	object
my rule of thumb is that an object should be ready for use after the constructor has finished

524671
constructor	object
constructor should set up basic options for the object

524696
internet-explorer	google-chrome
this works in firefox opera and internet-explorer but not in google-chrome

524721
google-chrome	firefox
this was tested in ie 7-9 firefox opera and google-chrome

524748
contains	elements
the first function takes two lists rows of the triangle and produces a new list of triples each contains and elements plus that elements s left and right child

524748
contains	elements
then a simple map produces a list contains the sum of each elements with its greater child

524754
boolean	int
c didn t have an intrinsic bool type so all boolean were typed as int instead with canonical values of 0 or 1

524754
boolean	int
the not-not syntax converts any non-zero int to 1 the canonical boolean true value

524757
postback	ajax
are you posting back via ajax or a normal postback

524768
expression	brackets
vim can fold in several ways manually by indent by expression by syntax and by markers by default i believe are curved brackets 3 of them

524780
textbox	button
i want to use a combobox with the dropdownlist style the one that makes it look like a button so you can t enter a value to insert a value into a textbox

524780
selected	textbox
i want the combobox to have a text label called wildcards and as i select a wildcard from the list the selected value is inserted in to a textbox and the combobox text remains wildcard

524784
compact-framework	.net
is it possible to draw over a textbox control in .net compact-framework

524786
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
an nslog in viewdidload is being called when the application starts which makes sense. nslogs in viewdidappear and viewwillappear aren t doing anything

524790
constructor	object
if an object does not acquire any external resources members must be initialized in the constructor

524790
tuples	any
x y coordinate or really any other structure that s just a glorified tuples

524790
constructor	object
if an object acquires resources that it can control they may be allocated in the constructor

524790
constructor	object
if the object acquires resources that it can t entirely control they must be allocated outside of the constructor

524791
iprincipal	iidentity
with a totally custom implementation you can still use iprincipal iidentity and formsauth

524800
compression	streaming
since you are sending this over the wire you could 1 write the data to an xml streaming this is very much what the dataset is meant to do then 2 you could compress the xml the compression ratio would be best at this stage then 3 encrypt using one of the .net cryptography scheme and finally 4 decrypt unzip and deserialize your xml into a dataset object or whatever you want to do with it

524800
json	csv
you could send a csv or json style data block

524803
constructor	object
depends on what type of system you re trying to architect but in general i believe constructor are best used for only initializing the state of the object but not perform any state transitions themselves

524814
domain-object	repository
you can do the same to convert your domain-object back to a linq object to pass back into your repository for persistence

524815
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
if you were using a uinavigationcontroller as the containers then viewwillappear viewdidappear would be called whenever you push pop a new viewcontroller

524817
solaris	linux
standard 2 495 win mac linux pc 3 120 for solaris

524818
buffering	streaming
this precludes using streaming based i o because async i o is buffering based

524818
stream	send
it is possible to repackage the data and send it to a stream such as a memory stream but there are issues there as well

524818
any	set
so using apm and since i don t know how long any given data set will be it is likely that blocks of data will cross buffer boundaries requiring multiple reads but those multiple reads will also span multiple blocks of data

524818
streamreader	writer
i m looking for something that has the simplicity of a streamreader writer with the convenience of async i o

524818
buffering	streaming
my next thought was to use a memorystreaming and write the blocks of data to a memory streaming then attach a streamingreader to the streaming and use readline but again i have issues with knowing if a the last read in the buffering is a complete line or not plus it s even harder to remove the stale data from the streaming

524823
subtract	time
subtract these two time the difference is the time interval

524835
any	set
when you create an image with an imaging program you might have the opportunity to set the dpi to any arbitrary value

524837
build-server	teamcity
however our build-server running teamcity is a server 2008 32-bit server

524837
environment	building
should i be concerned about doing the building in a 32-bit environment

524845
contains	any
the http standard contains no methods for http requests to keep or persist any state between individual http requests

524854
shell	bash
however i also use bash as my shell

524869
external	root
in 99 of cases as soon as you know that your site is down external it s relatively easy to find the root cause

524877
put	get
get your main application to put all the files installation details into a low-permission temporary location

524877
.when	ready
.when you re ready startup a smaller application whose only job is to copy over those files to the program files directory and maybe restart your main application with the new updates

524879
macros	basic
such one would contain really basic functions like memcpy basic macros and so on

524895
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is designed to be a compatible subset of wpf at least where it makes sense

524895
silverlight	wpf
this means that porting an app from silverlight to wpf should be relatively straight-forward

524895
silverlight	wpf
going in the other direction wpf - silverlight is likely to be significantly more challenging

524895
silverlight	wpf
the page class that is used in the default wpf project template does not exist in silverlight

524895
silverlight	wpf
so you can copy and paste the xaml and code from your silverlight application which derives from usercontrol into your wpf application without any problem

524895
silverlight	wpf
there are certain parts of silverlight that are not really compatible with wpf for example all of the html dom bridge stuff would not make any sense in a wpf application so it is not there

524897
put	get
put ns to the right of it so it ll only get rewritten once

524919
malloc	free
will malloc free be slower than allocating a big chunk at the beginning of the program and running my own memory manager over it

524924
ethernet	lan
i was able to perform up to 80mbps on 100mbps ethernet lan using this implementation a 1.8ghz opteron including encryption processing

524942
python	ruby
dsls are often written in higher level languages such as ruby or python specifically because the language writer can leverage the garbage collection and other facilities of the language

524945
malloc	free
will malloc free be slower than allocating a big chuck at the begining of the program and running my own memory manager over it

524950
malloc	free
what they will give you is memory allocation libraries which provide malloc free etc

524954
callback	methods
an instance of this class should be created for each networkstream and the process function should be called whenever new data is received in the callback methods for beginread before you call the next beginread i would imagine

524959
absolute-path	realpath
note realpath returns the absolute-path to the given relative path if file exists and false otherwise

524961
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc does not have viewstate like webforms does - this means that you now have the responsibility of maintaining those values

524961
required	checked
this will required that you store whether or not the checkbox was checked and then applying that setting to the checkbox again before the page is rendering to the browser in your view

524966
background-image	background-color
if you want a visual distinction between your background-color and the rest of the document you ll need to use a solid image as your background-image

524975
data-access	nhibernate
if you like pretending that you actually know what s going on at data-access level use nhibernate and sit with xml all day long to get a many to many going.

524996
.when	ready
my previous job they wouldnt even agree to take me unless i signed the papers first so they could have everything ready for me .when i arrived

525018
persistence	hibernate
started with guice added hibernate for persistence along with warp-persist and warp-servlet

525018
httpresponse	httprequest
guice integration was relatively smooth and good using warp-servlet which enabled me to inject into servlets and injects httprequest httpresponse session in other objects without passing them around

525018
spring	guice
unlike others it does not bring a ioc mechanism of its own but rather thinks of ioc as a service that can be provided by spring guice etc

525018
spring	jsf
seam not a framework on its own but a meta-framwwork which normally comines spring jsf

525034
postback	ajax
assuming you understand that asp.net-mvc does not include server functionality to handle asp.net postback if you need to send a message back to the server that informs your application that the check box was checked then it s probably best to do that with javascript and an ajax request

525034
asp.net-mvc	webforms
a lot of asp.net-mvc frameworks assume that you will be using the post - redirect - get pattern for handling user input in your webforms

525051
implements	abstract
or how do i implements my abstract state machine in foo

525051
implements	abstract
how do i implements my abstract state machine in foo

525056
any	set
in a perfect world calls to any functions outside of a pre-defined set would raise exception-handling

525065
lgpl	gpl
it must not be gpl or lgpl

525097
put	get
when i run the mapping i get a identifier type mismatch assuming it is trying to put the formcode into the id of the question

525101
javascript	dom
however if you were manipulating the dom via javascript and moved the elements out of the form by outside of the form i mean that they are no longer child elements of that form not that they are visually outside then they wouldn t be submitted with that form anymore

525122
put	get
in your css file you can apply styles to decorator-panel.using this we can change colour.for image you create one image directory under public directory the directory which is having your css file and put your image there.then in css you can get image

525135
pyflakes	pylint
1 pyflakes pychecker pylint will do static analysis on your code

525221
extjs	gxt
i use extjs gxt gwt on many project and it very easy for develop

525224
extjs	gxt
if you interest to develop extjs with java by gwt you can learn more at this extjs-gwt gxt blog

525224
extjs	gxt
how to setup extjs js-gwt gxt and example on eclipse ganymede 3.4

525236
select	union
do a select on the union and format the date column at the end

525240
inherited	subclass
a potential problem is if you use multiple-inheritance your subclass then inherited two instances of the eve classes .

525247
command-line	cmd
i have a simple script or cmd-line cmd that i d like to keep executing repeatedly forever with a short pause between runs

525262
specifications	w3c
i don t think the w3c html specifications really allow you to do this

525281
triggers	insert
if triggers are fired because of update then it helps to understand that database would implicitly insert a begin tran and end tran surrounding that update

525283
c-preprocessor	macros
what i d like is not a standard c-preprocessor but a variation on it which would accept from somewhere - probably the command-line via -dname1 and -uname2 options - a specification of which macros are defined and would then eliminate dead code

525283
conditional	parentheses
i would much prefer it to include parentheses around the sets of conditional as in the original

525288
financial	banking
can we use ruby-on-rails framework to develop websites for financial transactional banking transcations

525300
windows-server	windows
asp.net runs under w3wp.exe on windows-server 2003 and aspnet_wp.exe under windows 2000

525303
selected	checkbox
the selected property of the checkbox was then bound to the selected property of our entity

525319
convention	standards
i d prefer a standards naming convention that also adheres to microsoft s own naming standardss

525329
external	embed
i m cool with doing it with an external utility rather than py2exe - i ve tried this command-line utility to embed it but it always corrupts my exe and truncates its size for some reason

525333
duplicates	elements
add the commands to print the top elements of the stack without popping to duplicates it and to swap the top

525348
duplicates	elements
commonly provided are dup to duplicates the elements at the top of the stack exch or swap to exchange elementss at the top of the stack the first becomes the second and the second becomes the first roll to cyclically permute elementss in the stack or on part of the stack pop or drop to discard the elements at the top of the stack push is implicit and others

525362
cucumber	testunit
also if i stay with testunit for the moment should i consider using it with cucumber

525376
windows-xp	windows
i am using moveuser.exe which is part of the windows server 2003 resource kit tools to convert the security of local user profiles on a number windows-xp workstations

525376
administration	account
-the account i m using to run moveuser.exe with has full administration rights to the local machine and the domain to which the profiling security is being converted

525404
value	field
seems there is actually a field templates for this called foreignkey.aspx which binds the url to the value of getnavigateurl

525408
authentication	login
the main problem now is that when i attempt to login using form based authentication i get an http 404 error when the login form is submitted to j_spring_security_check

525414
.when	ready
the larger the price of the product and the longer it takes you to make it really work the less chance they will actually buy .when you have it ready

525446
constructor	object
so you could have a cityeditor class whose constructor takes both a city object and the treenode that represents that object

525446
updating	updates
when the city object updates the cityeditor responds to the triggers event by updating the treenode

525451
contains	any
that means that the remote object should not contains any state

525453
any	set
typically the encoding is specified in the xml declaration of a document that is processed but it can be set at any time

525456
administration	account
did you try to use the regini command-line tool to grab registry permissions for the administration account

525483
click	mouse
now you should see the color code for the pixel under the mouse cursor whenever you click somewhere in the app windows

525486
png	ico
it creates an ico file from 1 or more png s and handles multiple sizes etc

525502
firefox	safari
html 5 has support for databases and a couple of browsers have already implemented this part of the spec safari firefox with the gears plugin

525503
appfuse	spring
the best lesson i can recommend is having a good look at the spring asp.net-mvc build of appfuse

525544
itemscontrol	grid
you should put the object you are want to clone in a datatemplates and reference this templates from an itemscontrol then when you need another grid add another item to the items control or even better to the list the control is bound to and the itemscontrol will create a new grid and bind it the new object

525548
superclass	inherited
my question is what is the case with classes which inherited from other classes - if i write a constructor with some parameters in them but don t include a default constructor do they inherited the default constructor of the superclass

525556
constructor	object
the default constructor just invokes the default constructor of the superclass and the default constructor of object is empty

525563
constructor	private
the default constructor doesn t initialize your private variables to default values

525563
constructor	private
the proof is that it s possible to write a class that doesn t have a default constructor and has its private members initialized to default values

525589
cakephp	symfony
symfony cakephp zend etc look much better now and growing fast

525606
shell	bash
bash like other shell is just a tool for coordinating other commands

525606
python	perl
typically you would try to use standard unix commands but you can of course use bash to invoke anything including your own compiled programs other shell scripts python and perl scripts etc

525609
carbon	cocoa
i would like to write applications that use c++ and the cocoa frameworks because apple is not making carbon 64-bit capable

525629
python	java
apologies for putting java syntax in a python answer but

525647
proxy-server	squid
if your get requests are idempotent they can be cached in squid or some other reverse proxy-server

525661
seam	jsf
seam combines jsf and hibernate

525661
spring	seam
i use spring and hibernate but not seam

525661
spring	jsf
you can certainly use spring hibernate and jsf together

525664
silverlight	wpf
however i m developing wpf and silverlight guis on vista x64

525664
expression-blend	wpf
i can run x64 versions of the os under a vm but i m concerned about graphic performance for wpf and especially running expression-blend

525665
pointers	stack
you re missing that stack resides in regular memory which allows random access - just add the appropriate offset to the frame pointers the bottom of the local stack and you get a pointers to the memory cell holding the value

525668
pointers	stack
the local variables on stack are usually accessed relative to the so-called frame pointers which points at the start of your stack frame

525668
pointers	stack
it would also be possible to do this relative to stack pointers but since this moves around during evaluation of expressions it is more difficult to keep track of

525671
constructor	object
the way the question is written the only real difference i can see is whether you pass the foodata instance in through the constructor or call a separate method that constructs it but implicit in the first method is that the wrapper object keeps a reference to the original object whereas in the second approach it seems to me like you avoid this connection

525707
sql-server	mysql
don t know about mysql but in sql-server you do it this way

525713
nsstring	nsdata
you can then remove the processing instruction convert the nsstring to an nsdata and pass it into the nsxmlparser

525714
freebsd	linux
to put it all into practice read the linux or freebsd kernel source to see how the networking stack there is put together

525714
tcp-ip	udp
tcp-ip udp bgp and friends are much more interesting in my view

525714
python	java
if you just want to understand how multi-threaded primitives operate in your language of choice find a tutorial on the net - there are loads for python java and c at least

525722
carbon	cocoa
apple have a full sample cocoa with carbon or cpp

525739
aes	des
unless you have backwards compatibility reasons you should use aes and not des in new production code

525742
sharing	share
i m planning to make an animation with silverlight i want to export the animation to a video format to be able to share it on video sharing website

525744
databound	gridview
i failed to find a sample about how to convert an arrays instances of user defined types into a c# ado.net datatable -- i want to use the datatable to bind to asp.net databound controls gridview

525745
3des	aes
please use aes or at least 3des if aes is not available

525752
pointers	stack
the code emitted simply moves stack pointers the correct number of bytes when entering the function

525752
pointers	stack
assuming an int is 4 bytes the example you gave would move stack pointers 16 bytes

525756
bjam	jam
unfortunately the boost jam documentation doesn t mention such a mode in bjam

525806
extends	sealed
the string class is sealed so you cannot extends it

525812
reflection	runtime
in c# you can modify the code at runtime through reflection

525814
ruby-on-rails	django
with frameworks like ruby-on-rails or django the developer has a much better view of the big picture than ever before so it generally does not make sense to have a large dedicated purely testing team

525816
google-chrome	firefox
the following code shows what i expect in firefox and google-chrome

525829
contains	elements
vs.net this project has gone through all four versions of vs.net must have added the properties app.manifest file i see in solution explorer but this file does not contains the trustinfo elements i would have expected to disable virtualization

525830
parametric-polymorphism	polymorphism
focus on how to solve your problems using basic algebraic datatypes variants tuples records ordinary parametric-polymorphism as opposed to the subtyping you see with polymorphism variants and objects and modules but not functors

525837
performance-monitor	perfmon
use performance-monitor instead which you can start by typing perfmon at the command-line

525884
click	mouse
use an api call to send mouse click events to the system tray

525891
perl	c++
i currently use in no particular order powershell vbscript powerbasic java and c# and sometimes vb .net vb 6 c++ python and perl

525900
contains	any
perhaps iquery would be a better strategy but i have not been able to find any type of hql statment for property contains abc

525920
show	next
2 most editors can show the line numbers next to the code

525926
gnome	kde
does the function definition differ on different wms gnome kde or is it handled on a low-level in the os

525928
linux	unix
the dilemma is about marinating this process if it s script it does not need compilations and i can just drop it into any machine linux unix

525932
gnome	kde
for linux it will depend on the windows manager gnome kde - as you ve already mentioned

525934
dictionary	map
i am doing a report on the various c++ dictionary implementations map dictionary vectors etc

525935
python	perl
i suggest you go with a more full featured â œscriptingâ language such as perl or python

525936
python	php
python or php seem like good candidates

525940
optional-arguments	arguments
is there a way to have default values for el functions arguments optional-arguments

525954
webserver	nginx
i like to use nginx instances as load balances on m1.small s infront of c1.medium webserver instances all the apps i ve built recently are cpu bound and not memory bound

525954
lighttpd	apache
assuming a nix based platform you can use apache nginx or lighttpd

525954
lighttpd	squid
there s a bunch of other ones but they are typically used as app servers tomcat zope mongrel etc and have apache nginx lighttpd squid proxy in front of them

525957
python	ruby
ruby hashes are nice and work almost as well but i d really like to see something like the tuple class in python where you can use

525958
administration	account
first you have to change the owner of all files assembly catalog manifest and their respective directory from system to an administration account adjust the permissions and delete them

525963
authentication	login
as others have mentioned login procedures vary depending on implementation but the basic case simple web app authentication uses something like the following pseudocode

525968
methods	extend
sealed methods you might have liked to extend

525986
redirecttoaction	actionlink
has anybody tried it and is there a strongly typed redirecttoaction and maybe actionlink in rc

525988
authentication	login
for people that would require the authentication functionality of the site they would require to login and be redirected to root login.aspx

525989
aggregate	grouping
you should get a resultset of product grouping amount tuples where amount is the desired aggregate or null

526005
checkbox	button
for checkbox and radio button at least in delphi 6 which is all i have access to there is no transparent property

526008
jquery	.post
they re relatively easy to replace by using the appropriate jquery ajax methods .post .get selector .load etc or the jquery form plugin

526013
cherrypy	web.py
i really like how cherrypy and web.py handle them but the api is pretty simple in any library

526023
ignore-case	indexof
as it happens the indexof methods has a number of overloads one of which is indexof string stringcomparison int32 which can be specified to honor or ignore-case

526031
arrays	loops
this means each element of the arrays can only hold values up to 255 so when your sum exceeds 255 it loops back around 0

526037
ubuntu	linux
other issue - function doesn t work on linux at least on ubuntu 8.10

526057
unsigned	short
malloc allocates bytes and an unsigned short is most likely to be two bytes

526070
double	int
today i noticed that when i cast a double that is greater than the maximum possible int to an int i get -2147483648

526070
double	int
similarly when i cast a double that is less than the minimum possible int i also get -2147483648

also any operations like derived columns or conversions will have a character set which can be altered and will persist down that column s lineage in the data flow

526173
parentheses	let
why can t you wrap the multiple expressions in a set of parentheses like with let

526213
updating	updates
if you think of database 1 getting many many updates it would be wasteful to keep updating the search related indexes over and over

526236
xsd	xml
you can also create an xsd from xml samples with xsd.exe

526236
xsd	xml
start the visual-studio command prompt and use it to create an xsd from an xml sample

any	set
is there any tool that would let me set up these machines as slaves clients and then control them into performing a combined benchmark and get aggregated results

526264
deployment	install
i have been getting the error the required version of the .net is not installed on this computer. event id 4096 in event log when trying to install a vsto application from both a clickonce deployment and a local copy

526274
geocoding	geocode
the usc webgis geocode offers several geocoding api s that can do this

526281
directory	folder
i wrote a nintendo ds application that requires a folder to be copied to the root directory of your memory card and i often get email from people who copied it to the wrong place and don t understand what the root directory is

526281
directory	folder
i don t think they realize that the root directory can be thought of as a directory or folder

526285
common-lisp	scheme
because common-lisp unlike scheme and other lisps requires funcall your proposal is not ambiguous

526290
directory	folder
for them the root directory is the first folder they see when the double click the memory card icon

526294
display	height
even though the two div s have two different sets of data i need them to display with the same height so that the background colors appear to fill a box contains both

526294
display	height
naturally the problem is the response div as its height varies depending on the amount of data currently being display within it

526295
python	php
i suggest you port this php implementation of weighted random to python

526303
margins	padding
the trick is to add bottom padding to all columns to the max amount of size you expect that could be the difference between the shortest and tallest column if you can t work this out then pick a large figure you then need to add a negative bottom margins of the same number

526318
final	super
there is no way to guarantee that anyone subclassing this class would call the super s methodss during processing -- and since such a class likely only contains a few methodss it s better to just make the whole thing final instead of each methods

526334
manpage	bsd
from shutdown s manpage on bsd systems

526337
scheme	lisp
ever since reading what paul graham has to say about lisp i ve been intending to go back and pick scheme up again and see if it ll improve my programming in general

526392
breadth-first-search	depth-first-search
the answer is really breadth-first-search or depth-first-search it doesn t really matter

526399
interpreter	runtime
an interpreter scans each bytecode or ast node at runtime and dispatch to functions calls typically using a switch statement in an infinite loop

526412
iteration	set
well in the first iteration j is set to 9

526416
any	set
you just need to think like a computer and carefully note any change to the state set of variables

526417
forwarding	port
don t forget that even though a port may be open on your router you need to have your router forwarding port 8084 to the destination computer s internal ip otherwise because of network address translation nat the router firewall doesn t know what to do with the traffic once it gets there

526417
forwarding	port
you will need to make sure that you go into the router and forwarding port 8084 tcp to internal address 192.168.1.121 the internal client pc

526417
forwarding	port
depending on the level of your router this terminology will be port forwarding virtual ips or static nat translation there are a few others but you get the idea

526420
innodb	myisam
i m using innodb at the moment but am interested in answers for both innodb and myisam

526424
internet-explorer	google-chrome
it works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but in internet-explorer 7 everything runs really slow and nothing happen

526427
updating	updates
im not sure but imho does innodb not help you very much for solution 1 if you get many hits on the same page innodb locks the row while updating so all other updates to this row will be delayed

526427
updating	updates
depending on whats your program written in you could also batch the updates together by counting in your application and updating the database only every x seconds

526431
slidedown	slideup
have your tried using slideup and slidedown

526438
user-input	output
i m wondering if i should write a function that escapes user-input on output or just use htmlspecialchars

526443
value	field
in my app i have a fair number of entities which have field which are getting their value set via reflection

526456
installation	building
some installation scripting may rely on ruby_platform to determine whether to building the native extensions depending on your os

526471

i m not exactly sure why your adding the extra calls to show hide

526471
hide	show
please explain further as to why you need to do the show hide

526472
sql-server	oracle
most databases that don t have autoincrement fields like sql-server i m thinking oracle specifically have sequences where you ask the sequence for the next number

526476
populate	row
which s populate with one row per table when you create the database

526479
cos	sin
in the sin cos test i was performing for integers zero to one million

526487
gearman	worker
there are a number of other similar queue worker setups out there such as starling gearman amazon s sqs and other more enterprise oriented systems like ibm s mq and rabbitmq

526487
gearman	worker
if you run something like gearman or sqs - how do you start and control the worker pool

526504
hide	show
it should only be used to show hide the submenu

526504
hide	show
even so it should not show hide by add the css property display block|none

526512
url-rewriting	rewrite
i m trying to debugging url-rewriting on a hosted site where i don t have access to vhost.conf and so can t set up a rewrite log

526513
silverlight	wpf
eric gunnerson has code to capture images from an animation its wpf but would probably work in silverlight

526528
minimum	median
so the median gives a local minimum

526528
minimum	median
so the median gives a global minimum

526534
constructor	object
this works because the companion object for case classes assuming that lengthexpression is indeed a case class extend the corresponding function value delegating to their constructor

526537
32-bit	x86
the computation works for x86 80-bit extended precision values aka long double as well but the bit-twiddling must be done byte-wise as there s no integer type large enough to hold the values on 32-bit hardware

526542
execution	jobs
additionally you may do well to see if the difference in execution time correlate with re-indexing jobs by your dbas

526544
constructor	object
i m not sure i fully understand what your goal is but maybe you could do what you want to do programatically inside the no-args constructor of your root object which will be called to instantiate the object when it is unmarshalled

526548
background-image	width
one idea i have is to always have a div around the input with a background-image and all the borders disabled on the input-field and specified width in pixels such as

526550
jar	war
you probably just need the necessary jar files and either include them with your war or add them to your application server many have different ways of doing this

526594
textbox	button
you have to keep the selectionstart property in a variables and then when you press the button shift the focus back to the textbox

526598
header-only	boost
you can see what libraries need to be compiled by boost jam and what libraries don t by looking at this page - if a library does not need a lib file and therefore does not require you to mess with boost jam first it will say build link header-only whereas if a library does require you to precompile a lib file it will say build link automatic linking

526600
gtk#	gdk
according to the documentation for gdk _threads _init g _thread _init has to be called first and the gtk# documentation says the same

526604
chronometer	stopwatch
one somewhat confusing thing about chronometer is that you can t really use it as a stopwatch that gets started stopped and restarted again

526604
chronometer	stopwatch
if you need something like a stopwatch you ll have to subclass chronometer or maybe create your own version using the source

526681
order	add
to do this you need to add an order by clause to specify sorting by client

526682
ostringstream	ostream
using my common sense i would say that for ostringstream this should give 0 for default constructed ostream -1 and for ostream with freshly opened file 0

526684
seam	jsf
the point of seam is that it is a closed -ish technology stack combining jsf and hibernate

526684
spring	jsf
why not then just use spring asp.net-mvc + hibernate + jsf if you really want i m not a big fan of jsf but to each his own

526693
midl	idl
after reviewing the corresponding idl file generated by the midl compiler it was evident that each methods contains in the ievent interface has a unique id

526707
any	set
is there any reason not to set up the install so that major upgrade is always done and productcode changed

526721
perl	ruby
i d go with a python perl ruby implementation with a cron entry to schedule the script to run every 30 minutes

526723
protected	public
scene is protected meaning it can be accessed from any class that derives from the class it resides in which in this case is screens however you haven t declared sceneitem which is the type of scene to be public

526724
linked-list	tree
for a non-self-balancing tree possible but unusual for a search tree worst case is o n which is for the degenerate binary tree a linked-list

526724
linked-list	tree
a degenerate unbalanced tree as already stated is a linked-list

526727
contains	lookup
in general a balanced binary-search-tree has a worst-case lookup of o log n best case of o 1 when the desired value is the root and an average case of o log n the leaves contains exponentially more values than their parents

526727
binary-tree	nodes
the worst case is the most interesting and is easily seen by recognizing that the first level of a binary-tree has 1 nodes the second has 2 the third has 4 and so on

526727
binary-tree	nodes
thus the number of nodes in a binary-tree of depth n is precisely 2 n - 1

526727
exponential	inverse
the mathematical inverse of the exponential function is the logarithm thus o log n

526727
linked-list	tree
an unbalanced tree can be as bad as a linked-list and may have a shape like the following

526736
naming-conventions	conventions
it just seems to me that over time people come up with naming-conventionss for relatively the same thing and so instead of having everything named in a consistent manner you wind up with a code base that has a bit of every conventions

526745
registration	login
if i run under the visual-studio environment it works but if i switch the settings to run under iis instead i get the following exception trying to submit the login or registration

526759
installation	environment
if you are going to be providing export to excel and import paste from excel then does that mean that you re delivering to an environment where your users have a guaranteed installation of excel on their machines

526767
swing	awt
it s using for the ui as far as i can tell swing and awt

526779
instances	destroy
php does not keep state between requests so creating an object instances just to have it immediately destroy does not often make sense

526786
ethernet	packets
in a communicationsmanager the class would handle wiring together classes that handle talking to a port or connection like ethernet or serial and a class that deals with the comms protocols being sent over it so it can transport packets and a class that deals with the messages in those packets

526792
32-bit	64bit
intptr is just a simple integer-based struct that can hold a pointer ie. 32 bit size on 32-bit systems 64bit size on 64bit systems

526797
bison	yacc
preferably these tools would use lex yacc or flex bison for the grammar and not be too complicated

526798
nsstring	nsobject
as a rule of thimb any class starting ns will be present on the desktop - nsstring nsarray and nsobject etc

526801
windows-vista	windows
the latest version of windows-vista was viewed negatively across the usa there are numerous examples of major organizations in europe and africa phasing out their use of ms windows in favor of linux and all of this has come to great benefit of the linux vigilante s

526821
void	main
move the other function definition outside of your class void main specifically you need to move the second last braces before your int main to immediately before int randommove

526843
children	nodes
a branch nodes holds the total probability of its children

526855
textbox	button
i might re-do this app in pure win32 since no other mfc classes are used just a button and a textbox the button fires off the main program all win32

526868
restart	daemon
but you can always start another daemon watchdog scripting that just restart your scripting if necessary

526874
any	set
as at least one other answer has mentioned probably the best way to set an expires header or any other header if you re running apache is to use an .htaccess file or better yet if you have access to the main configuration files of the server put the expires configuration there

526883
httpd.conf	.htaccess
for example you can put the following directives in an apache httpd.conf or .htaccess file

526885
scheme	lisp
that is pretty related to scheme since scheme itself is a dialect of lisp

526894
video-player	flv
there are a few video-player out there for flv videos

526955
.when	ready
is there a way to get input from the console scan it for letter q and quick .when my app is ready to quit

will give an nsobject subclass that must also respond to void myprotocolmethod messages

526973
hosts-file	hosts
to do this i add the hostname to my hosts like this

526977
arrays	loops
all you need to do is make the string lowercase turn it into a char arrays like you have done loops through each letter take the value of each char and subtract the value of a and add one

526986
gethashcode	equals
the cell implements inotifypropertychanged and overrides gethashcode and equals

527003
contains	sorted
on the other side they may have noticed there are more cases where you want not to have a new list which contains the sorted result

527006
unsigned	bigint
mysql has the auto_increment column option or serial pseudo-datatype which is equivalent to bigint unsigned auto_increment

527006
identity-column	sql-server
microsoft sql-server has the identity-column option and newsequentialid which is something between auto-increment and guid

527006
firebird	oracle
interbase firebird has a generator object which is pretty much like a sequence in oracle

527009
credentials	security
also check the application-pool credentials and the security settings on the file folder containing the web service as these could be contributors

527026
32-bit	64bit
assuming they use two 32-bit words 64bit they use 34 bits for the cell number and have 30 bits for other things

527028
children	tree
when i navigate the tree in visual-studio i am seeing three sheets but none of them has any children

527043
markup	xhtml
the basic idea is that we want the server side to render the user-controls as xhtml and dump this updated markup back into the dom in our success methods client side

527043
javascript	dom
then in javascript you can find the parent dom element to your user control remove it and append or innerhtml this new html

527043
asp.net-mvc	webforms
above is the solution i used with webforms but with asp.net-mvc the below will produce the same result with much less work

527043
asp.net-mvc	webforms
now inside my ascx i simply render the html and this is what gets sent back to the browser for the container.innerhtml work again the client side code is the same for both asp.net-mvc and webforms in this scenario

527043
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the reason this works with much less code in asp.net-mvc is that we don t have to work around the page lifecycle that is required with a normal aspx file in webforms

527050
value	field
alternatively you could override the model s save methods to calculate the value of the slug field on save

527065
httpd.conf	hosts
in my case i ve just set up two virtual hosts in my httpd.conf listening on port 80

527066
hosts-file	hosts
did you edit your etc hosts as part of setting up your virtual hosts

527076
webserver	security
granted it still technically violates some security issues because the webserver can contact the app server but having the app server exposed through a single port to a specific ip in the dmz is better than having it exposed to the internet

527092
command-line	cmd
if you are on the command-line you need to separate cmd from data

527107
methods	extend
lpfavreau offers the solution to extend the jquery object with your own methods so that their functionality applies on the actual jquery object context

527117
command-line	cmd
in situations like this where i m relying on third-party products sql-server express i tend to use command-line driven installs either directly in a cmd file or called from a proper install tool

527129
hide	show
i know how to show hide or fadein out in jquery but is there a built in way to toggle between show hide or fadein out or do i have first look if the element is display none if yes then show otherwise hide

527160
lightbox	jquery
write some sort of elaborate iframe ajax lightbox that contains a basic calendar selector that is not reliant on jquery similar to what google does on its mobile calendar site

527163
credentials	account
if i understand your question the application is going to run under the credentials of an account that does not have permission to access the event log perf counters

527174
hide	show
if they are show toggle makes them hidden using the hide methods

527198
invokerequired	begininvoke
firstly if invokerequired true that should mean begininvoke execute the methods is queue to be re-called and invokerequired should equals false

527214
stream	send
however even if this is the one to use unless it can be passed as a property of the stream then my methods for sending email will only be able to send a byte as an excel document.

527220
triggers	insert
the database itself can be made to issue notifications either manually in the code that performs the insert or modifications useful when a large number of updates are made allowing for batch notifications or automatically inside a row update triggers

527220
contains	lookup
alternatively or you can use this in combination with the above you can customize your python dictionary by overriding the __getitem__ has_key contains methods and have them perform lookup as needed allowing you to cache the results using timeouts etc

527238
priority-queue	queue
we are going from a simple queue to a priority-queue

527262
value	field
additionally you will most likely define a primary key on your objects and define a value that signalss to nhibernate that this is a new object that hasn t ever been saved to the database having a 0 in an id field might signals -- this is a new object

527284
version-control	git
look into git for version-control it s built for branching and it s fast

how to prevent non-numeric value from showing up in the text field

527353
moss	wss
wss 3.0 and moss 2007 use

527354
python	c++
you might also get some important information by adding lots of logging calls to your code both python side and your c++ extension

527389
binaries	install
the reason why i hate this idea is that for the small convenience of not getting a prompt for installation or patching i now have the potential risk of malware quietly modifying and the binaries for the apps install into appdata

527413
any	set
i dislike having magic boxes scattered all over my code...how exactly do these two classes work to allow basically any function to be mapped to a function object even if the function has a completely different parameter set to the one im passing to boost bind

527425
directory	folder
this works fine in a firefox browser when i place my trust file at etc flashplayertrust folder with entries for the directory and the swf file i want to trust. according to the flash security guide the global trust file should be at the same level as the directory which contains the mms.cfg file

527428
postback	ajax
you are not supposed to have postback on a page without using something like ajax

527441
entity-framework	ado.net
there are too many features technologies that are tightly integrated with linq ado.net entity-framework linq to sql and what not

527450
order	add
if your data is relatively static and your sort is fixed then you can add your own rownum field that you update when you change the sort order sounds horrible but will be quick for large tables

527457
simplemodal	jquery
i am using simplemodal in jquery and i use ajax for displaying radio buttons

527464
conditional	operators
the following code does approximately the same and might be easier to understand for people not familiar with the conditional operators

value	field
i send the willchangevalueforkey and didchangevalueforkey but the user-interface doesn t update to the new value while that text field is still active

527468
mousemove	mouseup
the first resize works fine mousedown mousemove then mouseup but on subsequent mousedown+mousemove s the browser attempts to drag the whole resizebar div instead of properly resizing its parent containers

edit i know how they work on the surface they are basically function pointers and allow callback methods with certain signatures to be invoked using their address

527489
callback	methods
what exactly happens behind the scenes when you define a delegate and when you invoke a callback methods using the delegate object

527491
file-descriptor	pipe
where is a pipe operator to start a co-process and is file-descriptor of that co-process

527506
selected	textbox
would cause the textbox to be bound to name property of the items currently selected in the treeview

527506
treeview	grid
if you want to bind many ui items as details for the selected treeview item consider setting up a datacontext on the elemtent that contains all the details controls dockpanel grid stackpanel etc

527529
xsd	xml
you may think about some xml format representing a calendar knowing that xsd might transform it into a calendar but for that we ought to know more about your expected output format

527534
children	nodes
is not an attributes - it s a nodes without any children

527538
environment	execution
the new features should be factored into this code base or built on top of this code base with as little change needed in the execution environment of this application as possible

if a feature does not bring any added value for the business an internal coherency task is set to check with every other internal application the cost of their migration not using anymore this feature

527551
ofstream	fopen
functions like fopen or ofstream open take the file name as char but that is interpreted as being in the system code page

527662
value	field
add a timestamp field and do not throw an error if the timestamps are closer than a defined value maybe the process didn t have time to update the cache

527672

hide	show
the visitor can click on a product image and it will basically hide all the divs and then show the one related to the image they have click on

527705
silverlight	wpf
for rich windows guis i d be tempted to look at the xaml variants wpf full desktop and silverlight like flash - this will give you the latest tools etc and a lot of styling power

527706
base-class	inherited
we have an existing base-class written in borland c++ which inherited from tform which is used to give all forms that inherited from it a certain look-and-feel it processes wm_ncpaint and wm_nchittestheavily for example

oracle	mysql
using the limit clause on mysql or rownum on oracle

528473
exception-handling	error-handling
if by more aggressive you mean using assertions for error-handling then you re better off using exception-handling

528476
exception-handling	try-catch
anyway i d argue that throwing an exception-handling from within a try-catch block so the catch block can be executed represents really bad logic flow

528477
exception-handling	try-catch
if you re using 3rd party classes that may throw exception-handling your methods should have a try-catch block if you can actually handle the situation if an exception arises

logging	trace
i m working on an approach to trace logging for my company s vb.net project

529375
double	int

or do you think i could wrap entire c c++ scripts into python code to make use of my existing self-written analysis methods i have no wrapper experience as of yet

529700
internationalization	localization
however at some point typically between internationalization testing and localization linguistic testing internationalization and localization tend to overlap

529700
internationalization	localization
one person mentions l10n feeding back to internationalization but if you are doing quality i18n testing and creating pseudo-localized content then iterating on development issues during localization should be the exception-handling not the rule

529700
internationalization	localization
interface resizing and particularly adapting pages to support bi-directional languages like arabic and hebrew also tend to blend both localization issues and internationalization engineering

529782
ref	out
a property or indexer may not be passed as an out or ref parameter

529782
ref	out
i known what caused this and did the quick solution of creating a local-variables of the correct type calling the function with it as the out ref parameter and then assign it back to the property

529802
ref	out
you can use fields with ref out but not properties

529808
ref	out
on a more technical level ref and out pass the memory address of the object passed into them and to set a property you have to call the setter so there s no guarantee that the property would actually be changed especially when the property type is immutable

529808
ref	out
ref and out don t just set the value upon return of the methods they pass the actual memory reference to the object itself

529813
ref	out
when you pass ref out prepend it means that you are passing a reference-type which is stored in the heap

529815
getter	setter
edit well the simple answer is that the mere fact that a property getter or setter could include far more than just a field read write makes it undesirable not to mention possibly unexpected to allow the sort of sugar you are proposing

529821

on the potentially minus side if you have a heavy investment in asp.net webforms controls and technologies those are not typically out-of-box compatible with the new mvc framework

530188
scheme	forth
it is too bad no one has mentioned forth or scheme so far

530206
shell	bash
also if you use a command line shell like bash and you cat a file

530242
printf	scanf
don t use scanf and printf

530242
fwrite	fread
since you re dealing with binary data you instead want to use the low-level fread and fwrite functions

530243
sql-server	sqlcommand
if so start by looking at sqlconnection and sqlcommand if you re using sql-server otherwise use oledbconnection and oledbcommand

530247
duplicates	contains
every other grouping user in my domain works fine and i ve duplicates the issue on our test domain where renaming the grouping so it doesn t contains a resolves the problem

530249
firefox	gecko
you may find some java applet library or wrapper for gecko engine that s the one firefox uses

530249
google-chrome	safari
javafx also promisses to release a webkit component engine used by safari and google-chrome named jwebpane in a future release

530250
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
i m not sure from your question what you ve got going on but if you just want to learn how to use a sqlconnection sqlcommand and a sqldatareader object to retrieve items from a database check this out

530253
private-members	instances
also consider that achild and bchild should probably be private-members of your instances of visitable

530262
msbuild	nant
i have no idea how to do that in any of the build tools nant msbuild

530262
msbuild	nant
i do not care if i use nant msbuild or both

530262
msbuild	nant
i am aware that this might be rather complex but every idea and nant msbuild snippet will be a great help

530272
updating	updates
i have several updates methods in a javascript file used for updating my ajax application like so

530274
dictionary	arrays
taking byte arrayss out of the picture if i need to resize an arrays wouldn t i just use a list or a dictionary instance as is recommended here

530278
cygwin	gnu
my ta implied cygwin s gcc is a less reliable compiler -allowing for much sloppier code to run- than the one found under gnu linux

530278
cygwin	gnu
would the conclusion that cygwin s gcc is just as good as gnu linux and it s the underlying operating systems sheer luck that my buggy program runs under one and not the other be pretty much correct

530278
execute	declare
the pointers i was trying to return was being declare inside the function and so was being destroyed once the function execute

530289
constructor	object
genset knows explicitly what type of object it contains its constructor was explicitly called with a argument and methods will throw an exception when they are passed arguments that are not of type e

530289
type-safety	erasure
all of this results from a known and deliberate weakness of generics in java it was implemented using erasure so generic classes don t know what type argument they were created with at run time and therefore can not provide type-safety unless some explicit mechanism type-checking is implemented

530296
user-permissions	administration
just remember that for anything you need to run as an administration there are easier ways in windows to make that happen such as run as changing the user-permissions on the items that need to update etc

530298
malloc	free
comment out calls to malloc free around the problem area and any associated areas where those pointers are used

530298
profiling	debugging
on unix check out this guide for debugging memory on unix and the valgrind profiling sol thx for reminding me about this one

530319
any	set
in your case it sounds as if this task has the haltonerror attributes set to on which causes the build to halt if any of the junit tests fail

530330
sftp	ssh
right now i m looking at products such as secureblackbox ipworks ssh wodsftp and rebex sftp

530333
webforms	asp.net
the only reason we ve used the webforms model without is in migrating classic asp apps where we wanted to get a quick port to asp.net and then revise the code to a more natural .net style afterwards

530352
sftp	ftps
but i havent chance to compare it with another sftp ftps component

530354
gridview	listview
especially inside repeaters listview and gridview name your controls something short

530356
any	set
i know this is statistics and maybe related to the poisson distribution but how do i determine the probability that any x consecutive bits in a set of n bits are 1

530364
perl	ruby
rather than compare your java-versus-perl projects as a good example of the procedural-versus-oop debate i would like to see a face-off between perl and a similarly concise language such as ruby which happens to also have the benefits of object orientation

530364
python	java
java may be robust because of its object orientation but as you and your colleague and many others who are converting to dynamic languages such as ruby and python are finding these days there are much more efficient solutions out there whether procedural or oop

530368
printf	strcat
so things like printf s scanf s strcat strncpy strncmp etc aren t really happy with null 0 characters embedded within our binary data arrays

530370
javascript	dom
i would however recommend using a javascript framework like jquery or something else to handle the ajax and dom manipulations

530385
logging	trace
the built in trace listeners seem to keep the file open in-between logging events

530395
setlocale	multibyte
you ll have to set the locale first with setlocale to utf-8 so it chooses this implementation of multibyte support

530419
localization	translation
think localization companies that have to reuse memory translation between versions for rainier we should use the memory from shasta or from whitney

530437
library-project	libs
just make sure the n-th level libs-project is in the same solution and the immediately dependent libs has a dependency on it

530439
extends	final
also as a final note if you continue formatting time the same way everywhere in your views you can extends the time class and make your calls much more succinct

530441
contains	any
how would i go about using a negative lookbehind or any other methods regular expression to ignore strings that contains a specific substring

530520
jquery	dojo
dunno if it s like dojo css3 queries but you could use the first-child pseudo class if jquery supports it

530522
getter	setter
suppose i have an object representing a person with getter and setter methods for the person s email address

530525
pascal	delphi
in delphi or object pascal as we oldies like to call it calling conventions come after the function declaration like this

530563
fortran	pascal
note the fortran calling convention __fortran is the same as the pascal calling convention

530581
getter	setter
i find lots of getter and setter to be a code smell that the structure of the program is not designed well

530581
getter	setter
you should look at the code that uses those getter and setter and look for functionality that really should be part of the class

530581
equals	getter
having both getter and setters is equals to the field being public when the getter and setters are trivial generated automatically

530581
getter	setter
but there are also cases where having getter and setter is a good pattern

530581
value	field
when the user changes the value of field x the view calls setx string on the model which in turn may raise an event that some other part of the model has changed and the view will get the updated values from the model with getters

530581
getter	setter
in one project there is a gui model which has 15 getter and setter of which only 3 get methods are trivial such that the ide could generate them

530585
ruby-on-rails	rspec
i have unit tested ruby-on-rails web apps and standalone ruby apps with rspec and test unit

530592
ordinals	numeric
you could refer to the column by numeric ordinals then which may help

530605
populate	row
if the table is not too large however you could add the populate columns taking the performance hit due to the row migrations and then perform a table move to reorganise it

530612
dynamic-programming	memoization
i believe you might be confusing memoization which is as others have noted an optimization strategy for recursive algorithms with dynamic-programming which simulates a recursive solution but does not actually use recursion

530612
dynamic-programming	memoization
if that was your question i d say it would depend on your priorities high runtime efficiency dynamic-programming or high readability memoization as the recursive solution of the problem is still present in the code

530637
python	perl
g works in python just like perl and is in the docs

530649
python	php
you can do this in python but is it possible in php

530652
meta-inf	jar
especially when using declarative services and such the need to use osgi interfaces and mechanisms from your code is greatly reduced you just add a few descriptor files to the jar s meta-inf

530700
32-bit	x86
however on x86 cpu s at least which to the best of my knowledge is the only place .net runs 32-bit integers are still the default

530700
32-bit	64bit
so prefer 32-bit integers even in 64bit mode

530700
32-bit	64bit
and on x86 in 32 and 64bit mode that is 32-bit integers

530706
32-bit	64bit
suggests you might find a more authoritative source this one is the first one that i found that microsoft s 64bit offerings use 64-bit pointers with 32-bit integers

530706
32-bit	64bit
in order to keep code bloat to a minimum amd actually sets the default data operand size to 32-bit in the 64bit addressing mode

530706
64bit	x86
in those situations where 64bit data operands are desired they can be activated using the new rex prefix woohoo yet another x86 instruction prefix

530712
ruby	php
do the major php ide s have built-in test runners the way eclipse s java tools do or netbeans s ruby rails tools do

530735
jar	war
we have an ear file which contains a few jar files one of them being named ugc-ws.jar for libraries that we use and also a war file which has the web.xml to load a servlet - this war file also has the same ugc-ws.jar in it s lib directory because the servlet is inside that jar

530735
jar	war
so basically we have the main ear file and within it multiple jar files as well as a war file - which also has a jar file inside it s lib directory

530740
32-bit	64bit
the com objects are all 32-bit the os is 64bit thus my .net application needs to be targetted to 32-bit

530759
prolog	lisp
procedural is part of the procedural functional logical or logic oriented distinction compare c lisp and prolog between different ways of describing what a program should do

530762
right-align	margins
to mimic this column you could either use to put text in the margins or you could use to right-align text on the same line as blahblah

530768
arguments	default
example consider default an arguments to the current time

530775
webserver	upload
after upload these files onto my webserver i can navigate to the page and everything works on the computer i developed it on

530779
complex-numbers	matrix
you can double integer strings matrix complex-numbers reals windows sizes on your monitor and all sorts of different things

530779
fclose	fopen
the fopen fclose and other functions are an class of sorts representing the i o capabilities of c

530807
dictionary	arrays
i have actually written about the idea of passing associative arrays as dictionary on my blog here and here

530813
latitude-longitude	location
you can replace the latitude-longitude string with the current location from corelocation

530819
foreign-key-relationship	relational-database
highly theoretical but my relational-database professor would say that the only duplication of data is either a primary foreign-key-relationship or a copy for backup testing purposes

530841
return-value	arguments
save registers generate the function prologue epilogue to set up arguments copy the return-value and such

530848
versioning	upgrade
additionally when you allow subtyping you actually present a very complex contract to consumers and you inevitably end up with versioning problems when you attempt to upgrade your class in the future

530850
any	set
use the backtorecordoptions.none option to prevent the clearing of any expectations you have already set

530860
windows-server	windows
for some reason gtest also doesn t like the wrong style of slashes being passed to it from ant so i made my exec for windows only as my hudson is running on a windows-server

530869
difference	count
your teacher is also probably expecting you to realise the difference between the binary form of the number you will count with and the ascii format you will use to display to the screen

530875
contains	set
or instead of invoking int 21 with which prints one character at a time you can set to print a string set ds dx to a block of memory which contains

530886
simpletest	phpunit
there are at least two mature stand-alone junit style test suites available named phpunit and simpletest respectively

530886
cakephp	symfony
as far the asp.net-mvc frameworks go symfony has its own testing framework named lime code igniter has a unit_test library and cakephp relies on the aforementioned simpletest

530886
simpletest	phpunit
i know that zend studio has built in support for phpunit tests and both phpunit and simpletest have command-line runners so integration into any workflow is possible

530898
postback	ajax
for ajax work avoid postback at all costs

530902
superclass	subclass
we may notice that one class is very much like another so instead of copying and pasting code we let one class inherit from another the subclass inherits from the superclass or base class

530902
superclass	subclass
in this way the subclass has access to all of the data-structures and procedures of the superclass and can augment or override them in certain ways

530906
image-processing	imaging
image-processing security manufacturing medical imaging

530917
default-value	default
the default constraint specifies a default-value to use when doing an insert

530920
space	input
if it helps typically machine learning is most powerful when the mapping between input and outputs cannot be well described the mapping space is too highly dimensional to process in a reasonable fashion and or needs to be adaptive over time

530923
comparator	sortedset
in the example below i inject the comparator query and dao but the sortedset is directly instantiated

530931
any	set
this goes above and beyond any other acls set on the list or it s items

530932
variables	boolean
instead of a simple boolean variables you could perform a complex calculation every time you need to verify the license and base your logic on the result from that calculation

530936
click	mouse
maybe click down on the scrollbar could set some sort of flag that would disable the autopostback and then releasing the mouse would re-enable it

530939
latex	tex
i would like to use tex without needing latex on the server

530941
callback	methods
in that case i had to do a new thread because my injector was created after the callback methods for container startup was called

530946
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i think this will be a hard question to definitively answer as so much will depend on a how you implement the webforms application and b how you implement the asp.net-mvc application

530946
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in their raw forms asp.net-mvc is likely faster than webforms but years and years of tools and experience have produced a number of techniques for building fast webforms applications

530946
webforms	asp.net
i d be willing to bet that a senior asp.net developer could produce a webforms application that rivals the speed of any mvc application- or at least achieve a negligible difference

530946
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if improving performance is your chief concern i don t think it s a great reason to jump ship on webforms and start re-building in asp.net-mvc

530948
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in order to make a valid comparison between asp.net-mvc and webforms we need to be sure that both apps are using the architectures correctly

530960
autotools	gnu
i never have to write a makefile myself anymore let alone horrible gnu autotools scripting

530960
autotools	gnu
i usually use the autoconf option and it writes the annoying gnu autotools scripting for me

530974
perl	php
it also has limited server-side scripting capabilities sjs included but can be extended with common languages such as php and perl

530976
assign	add
if that s indeed what you want to do you could add two variables to your global namespace and just assign the value whenever you call show

530992
qdockwidget	qwidget
i m just trying to get into qt and kde program and have hit a snag trying to add a floatable draggable qdockwidget to the .ui file based as a qwidget that is embedded into my kde 4 program

530993
easymock	jmock
one final note when a field cannot be injected for whatever reason but i still would like to mock it out in a test i have found the junit-addons privateaccessor class helpful to be able to switch the class s private field to a mock object created by easymock or jmock or whatever other mocking framework you prefer

531004
selection	cell
i m not sure what pasting a two-dimensional selection into a single cell does so i can t do the last line for you

531015
required	checked
ssl entries and checked the required

531015
required	checked
also checked required 128 bit

531025
listbox	textbox
on screen i can t display all 50 properties each in their own textbox for data entry so i have a listbox of all the possible properties and one textbox for editing

531025
listbox	textbox
when they choose a property in the listbox i fill the textbox with the value that property corresponds to

531041
listbox	textbox
that listbox textbox sounds like it could be pretty tedious to use

531060
activerecord	datamapper
if you have that much associated data you could look at using something like datamapper instead of activerecord with ruby-on-rails as it supports lazy-loading data as required

531067
xsd	xml
use xmlreadersettings to specify xml settings xsd ignorecomments etc.

531077
instances	destroy
as soon as the page is rendering to the browser that instances of your page class is destroy

531077
updating	updates
when using an ajax control you might not be updating the entire page anymore but the concept still applies one request is made and one response is received and used to updates the entire context of the request

531078
literals	hardcode
for constants used in-place of hardcode literals provides additional

531083
swing	swt
i ve developed both with swing and with swt but not with qt

531083
swing	swt
however there are a few things that swt does that swing doesn t do as well or at all -- such as launch the system s native browser and execute javascript scripts in this browser

531083
swing	swt
swt and swing of course do not have licensing fees jambi i don t know about either way but it may depend on your intended use -- for example are you distributing a gpl application or a commercially licensed one

531084
repository	entity
hydrating an entity from repository and then converting it to a dto is a waste of effort

531084
repository	entity
i assume that your dal passes a dto to your repository which then converts it to a full entity object

531101
execution	exit
exit explicitly asks the operating system to stop execution the program

531105
vba	vb6
in vb6 and vba

531109
having	select
is there an automatic way to retrieve the newly created eventtypeid without having to issue another query select max eventtypeid from eventtype

531115
python	java
object-oriented languages such as java python ruby etc provide syntactic sugar to easily manipulate objects and this is the main difference between procedural languages and object-oriented languages

531146
direct3d	gdi
wpf graphics are hardware accelerated where possible through direct3d - it is not gdi based

531146
expression-blend	designer
is hopefully improving the designer coder s workflow with the use of a declarative language xaml for graphic definitions and complex gui design software expression-blend

531146
silverlight	wpf
is not silverlight - silverlight is a subset of wpf

531160
mta	sta
threading models sta mta etc are a necessary evil that apply only to in-process com objects where objects and clients need to coexist in the same process and somehow they must prevent stepping on each other s toes a fun and lengthy topic

531166
implements	abstract
templates methods originally states that the methods should be abstract in order to force subclasses to implements it adhering to the superclass contract

531173
google-chrome	firefox
it currently supports firefox 1.5+ safari 2.0+ ie 7.0 opera 9+ and google-chrome 0.2.x

531176
messagebox	alert
the problem is that the existing code does not separate the view from the controllers and throws messagebox and alert everywhere that ask the user to click on a button in my case just ok continue

531188
output	mode
personally i capture all the stdout console output to a log file then if not running in scheduled mode - i pop up a msgbox

531204
instances	destroy
use an instances and make it a singleton if you only want one instances at any given time. you can then implement idisposible and just call dispose when you want to destroy it

531206
self-extracting	dotnetzip
dotnetzip supports multi-byte chars in filenames zip encryption aes encryption streams unicode self-extracting archives

531214
python	perl
python is not usually best when you literally translate from perl it has it s own programming patterns

531218
perl	ruby
ruby python perl vim + interpreter

531222
sql-server	oracle
my database background is mainly oracle but i ve recently been helping with some sql-server work

531235
pointers	stack
therefore you need to preserve code and stack pointers so that you do a graceful return to the calling part of the operating system

531253
firefox	opera
jquery and other libraries make it easier to code the behavior -- but you generally can t get around the fact that ie6 has so many weird rendering issues that you ll be frequently banging your head on the keys trying to make it do what firefox safari and opera do right the first time

531258
constructor	object
apparently object constructor aren t composable

531260
directory	folder
if you put the images directory into the public folder of the ruby-on-rails app for example public images then you shouldn t have any problems with mime types unless your webserver is configured wrongly

531286
constructor	object
therefore a constructor would normally not be reading a file but you would have a separate class that builds the object from the file

531291
sharpziplib	dotnetzip
i d suggest using dotnetzip or sharpziplib

531315
interop	tlbimp
i ve created an interop for a com dll via tlbimp and added it to the assembly cache

531350
queue	fifo
in fact this defeats the whole purpose of queue and the class you ll eventually come up with the will violate the fifo semantics altogether

531365
google-chrome	firefox
on the internet as a whole ie is the most popular browser with firefox a close second and safari opera and google-chrome taking up most of the remainder

531374
contains	elements
technically yes it is possible since authnrequest can contains an extensions elements which can contains anything - see the saml core spec authnrequest section 3.4.1 is derived from requestabstracttype section 3.2.1 which has an optional extensions

531380
defined	declare
can i initializer an instance-variables in java when i initializerr it when i declare it and initializerr it with the return-value of a methods which i defined later in the class

531388
protected	public
that will restrict the returned properties to public instances properties excluding static properties protected properties etc

531408
exception-handling	try-catch
wrapping something in a try-catch doesn t really have any impact at all if the exception-handling is seldom raised

531412
constructor	object
constructor should create the most minimal generic instance of your object

531412
constructor	object
a valid object is the goal of the constructor valid not necessarily useful - that can be done in an initialization method

531431
attributes	properties
i just need to work on only those properties which has a specific attributes eg showindisplay

531451
open-session-in-view	interceptor
i m thinking about using the open-session-in-view osiv filtering or interceptor that comes with spring as it seems like a convenient way for me as a developer

531451
wicket	spring
is there some kind of best practice for how to integrate this kind of solution with a three tier architecture using hibernate and spring as i suppose my decision to use wicket for presentation shouldn t matter much

531458
revision	svn
this way it is easy to download a particular version of your runtime binary without having to update to that revision in svn first

531460
constructor	object
my customary practice is that if all the constructor has to do is set some fields on an object it can be arbitrarily long

531462
textarea	textbox
input type text and the textarea to 500px doesn t work in ie6 and google-chrome only works fine in ff2 haven t tested other browsers ie and google-chrome add two pixels to the textbox

531462
margins	padding
padding and margins is set to 0 on all elements using

531464
environment	building
but if you have many pre-production environment and if you have many deliveries the cost of building them for assembly integration homologation pre-production platforms can be high

531464
environment	building
a solution is to building them once store them in a deliveries section of your svn and use them directly in your different environment

531471
value	field
you ll just have to make the generic foreign key field of the image form not required and fill in their value in the view after saving the room

531489
llvm	gcc
99 of my arm experience is reversing code generated by gcc llvm on the iphone so my assumption may not carry over to msvc

531503
perl	php
are you executing arbitrary sql statements from within scripts such as perl php or python

531512
moss	wss
our experience of sharepoint at my previous company an fmcg grouping in south africa was positive in many ways mainly wss though we did also implements moss

531577
enumerator	any
since i can t think of any built-in functions that could generically take advantage of the standard anchor- and dockstyles data types in any meaningful way writing your own enumerator seems like a much saner alternative to linking against windows.forms just for the sake of an enum

531580
linux	unix
works in unix linux shells or cygwin

531580
logfile	tail
will show you tail of your logfile

531585
click	mouse
i m having a jpanel bean which inside has two jtoggle button.i compile and add this bean to the netbeans palette and then i add it to a frame.then i right click the bean and from events i choose a mouse event let s say release .this event corresponds to the jpanel and not in the two button inside.thus i cannot catch mouse events coming from the jtoggle button.how can i catch these events

531609
contains	any
any cocoa methods which returns a new object via a methods that does not start with init or contains the word copy will return an autoreleased object

531613
perl	php
the harness uses tap output test anything protocol to determine whether or not the tests pass or fail using libraries like test simple or test more perl and php

531613
perl	php
out of the box apache test supports writing tests in both perl and php

531613
perl	php
running all tests written in both php and perl is done through a single command and any failure along the way is captured apache test noting as best it can what went wrong

531613
perl	php
by running tests in each respective library you can use the php implementation of test more or even perl by testing stdout and spit back out tap for your harness to interpret

531618
keydown	keyup
instead of firing a keyup event when the key is release it gets fired soon after the keydown event

531623
selected	button
for example in my app imood you can selected a mood i d like the user to be able to email this to a friend for example by using a button in the navigation bar

531628
any	set
can anyone think of a really elegant beautiful bit of sql that will take any number of search words and return the most concise result set

531648
attributes	properties
it may require some code to set up you need a class with properties that describe your recordset and the properties must have certain attributes set but after that it works really well

531656
dictionary	map
the most i ve been able to do is to query the data dictionary to do things like map the package dependencies

531695
debugging	trace
i want to programmatically log the current stack trace for debugging purpose

531697
log4net	nlog
i d recommend that you have a look into logging solutions such as nlog log4net or the microsoft patterns and practices enterprise library which may achieve your purposes and then some

531706
google-chrome	firefox
if it works on firefox it will almost certainly work on opera safari google-chrome etc with only a few minor tweaks

531708
command-prompt	cmd
i want to get rid of the command-prompt when using my wxpython gui but i still need a way to show the output of the exp imp cmd

531734
toolbar	tabs
my viewport on firefox with tabs open quick links and the excellent web developer toolbar extension is only 572px when set to 1024x768

531738
standard-library	boost
unlike java or .net there is not an extended library of classes for all kinds of purposes networking file system services cryptography concurrency etc - the closest to that is probably boost which looks and feels like an extension to the standard-library but which is still external although some parts of it are leaking back to the standard-library

531765
keydown	keyup
the keyup event isn t actually fired for all keys not just arrow keys etc. until you release the key there are just many repeated keydown events

531770
constructor	object
in the constructor then leave the object in memory to answer calls concurrently

531772
64bit	x86
reason why double can t be declared volatile it s 64bit which makes it more than the word size on x86 which prevents it from being declared volatile in the cli if i remember correctly

531798
instances	destroy
show how to use extensibility to exercise more fine-grained control over how instances are created and destroy pooling

531819
radio-button	button
each radio-button within the radiogroup has a custom drawable with checked and unchecked states as its android button attribute

531819
positioning	sidebar
the linear layout is itself within a relativelayout so that it can appear at an arbitrary positioning on the screen as a sidebar in this instance

531823
value	field
you can put this in an invisible field somewhere and then let the dynamic controls test on the value of the field

531824
strncpy	strcpy
strcpy vs strncpy in a similar way to how g++ used to warn for inclusion of vs

531825
any	set
the hash code of the class myint is a canonical form of that class because for the set of all instances of myint you can take any two elements m1 and m2 and they will obey the following relation

531825
constructor	private
instances cannot be directly instantiated because the constructor is private

531825
constructor	object
basically the factory method abstracts object creation and personally i think it would be an interesting language feature to force all constructor to be private to enforce the use of this pattern but i digress

531825
constructor	object
as a caveat to the above pattern i should point out that controlling object creation with private constructor and factory methods doesn t guarantee reference equality means object equality because of serialization

531852
constructor	object
let object constructor itself be the one who is loading its data from the xml file

531873
pascal	delphi
is there any tool preferably freeware that can analyze pascal delphi syntax and automatically remove unused vars

531877
show	next
then when that video has completed enable the timer and in the tick event show the next video and set the timer to disabled so it doesn t fire every 15 seconds

531886
.net	wcf
anything else i should do to consume a wcf service as a webservice from .net 2.0

531924
perl	php
common choices are php perl java servlets or asp

531934
ftpwebrequest	ftp
you have to use a specific class for ftp protocol like ftpwebrequest that has a uri property like requesturi

531972
hosts-file	hosts
googling around suggested that there might be a problem with the etc hosts not having a line reading 127.0.0.1 localhost but i checked the file and it s there

531989
google-chrome	safari
there is a known incompatibility with ajax.net and google-chrome safari 3

531989
google-chrome	safari
the general gist of it is that both google-chrome and safari 3 report themselves as webkit in their useragent strings

531989
asp.net-mvc	webforms
once you ve done all that if at all possible stop using webforms and ajax.net and use asp.net-mvc and jquery

531994
message	alert
training application to an access database if any one closes the browser directly i want to display an alert message

531995
python	c++
however there are available api for the entire javascript machine for c++ but no python bindings and i don t see any reason why these can t be bound for python

531997
gnome	kde
on gnome kde you can selected in which application you want to open file right click on file - open with - other

532031
.when	ready
it is a low proirity project so i can t give an estimate on .when its ready

532057
value	field
member field value

532068
locale	french
i cannot rely on the system locale because for example a lot of our french customers use a computer with an english locale even if they still use the comma to fill data in the webforms

532072
ubuntu	debian
i ve installed svn through apache under various versions of ubuntu and debian but never with the newest ubuntu

532072
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r www-data www-data home subversion

532122
gnome	kde
these commands should open up the in the preferred application in gnome or kde respectively although i don t have an installation of either to test on

532123
linux	unix
traditionally on unix systens and therefore linux too you start applications from the console and not from a ui

532123
windows	ms-dos
on windows there is no real console the dos box is just a reminiscence of the dark ages of ms-dos

532138
dialog	pop-up
the only pop-up dialog i ve found in the doc is the wshshell.popup methods

532155
profiling	trace
i ve looked in the files .profiling and etc profiling and can find no trace of display

532173
mouseover	mouseout
one is tripping over your own state because the mouseover effectively hides the object which triggers a mouseout when the cursor moves again ad infinitum

532173
hide	next
the other is that the two events are on different objects and tripping over one hide itself and triggers an event on the next

532201
methods	extend
most of the the examples i ve found are blog entries that just explain how to great it is to extend singleframeapplication and override its startup methods but that s about it

532241
configuration	environment
we have a script that copies certain configuration files to the directory which is used by maven to assemble the war basically spring configuration + web.xml for stand-alone test environment

532273
webforms	asp.net
i don t think there is such a thing as a step-by-step migration from asp.net webforms to asp.net mvc

532273
asp.net-mvc	webforms
they are two completely different design patterns built on the same framework but there are in most cases a lot of things that need not only to be moved but completely re-designed if you don t just want to build a web app on the asp.net-mvc template project instead of the webforms template

532273
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the main reason for this is the separation of concerns which is much stricter in asp.net-mvc than in webforms

532273
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i am currently working well i should be... on migrating an old and pretty buggy hobby-project from webforms to asp.net-mvc and my approach has basically been look at the functionality re-build it from scratch. of course i had some helper methods for formatting output etc that i just included in my new project but most of the basic stuff i chose just to redo completely

532273
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you d be surprised how little it takes me to reach the same goals with asp.net-mvc now that i set up for the webforms app a year-and-a-half ago - with the use of entity framework jquery and other sweet stuff you ll be able to produce results within a couple of hours

532276
contains	set
so for example images contains the default set of images and images es-mx contains the spanish-mexican localised images

532276
order	add
now the issue i have is that in order for this new structure to work i need to add the following to all img tags

532278
parallels	bootcamp
i ve just discovered which is a free alternative to parallels and bootcamp

532279
malloc	free
oh and don t forget when you re done with this structure you need to free up all the pointers that were malloc d in this structure or you ll have a memory leak

532285
selected	listbox
using c# how do i populate a multi-select listbox -- with the appropriate items selected -- based on the comma-delimited string from a database field

532286
metaclass	subclass
look at the modelbase metaclass db models base.py to see what all is done for you behind the scenes when you subclass model

532290
mouseover	mouseout
the first div outer 1 has event handler for mouseover and mouseout events

532290
mouseover	mouseout
when you cross the boundary between outer 1 and inner 1 the mouseout and mouseover event handler fire which in your case is causing the flicker

532290
mouseover	mouseout
the second div outer 2 has event handler for mouseover and mouseout events but these have been created through the jquery .hover command

532320
click	mouse
but that gives me problems such as not being able to selected text dragging the mouse over this overlay just pans the map or scroll if the overlay has a div with overflowing text then scrolling causes the map to zoom in or out click on the scrollbar will scroll but it will pan the map at the same time

532320
mouseover	mouseout
i m currently catching the mouseover and mouseout events to disable enable dragging and zooming but i still can t highlight text and now scrolling the mouse wheel on an area of the overlay that doesn t have anything to scroll causes page elements outside of the map to move up the windows

532324
mediawiki	screwturn
bare in mind screwturn doesn t stick to the mediawiki syntax but uses its own variation which does vary a bit

532324
tokenize	parsing
there s a discussion on that in this question you re essentially stuck with writing your own parsing and tokenize rather than simply writing a bnf file for it and then using antlr gold irony

532396
integer	numeric
ideally you use an artificial surrogate key for your rows a numeric integer data type int is best because space-efficient and fast

532408
order	add
in our application s web.xml file add a servlet that include a load-on-startup element where the number is the order in which it starts

532415
webforms	asp.net
on a usercontrol in asp.net webforms why do the controls within the usercontrol textbox dropdownlist etc. have to be declared as protected in the code-behind

532425
hsqldb	oracle
tested oracle 10g tested and hsqldb

532440
glassfish	weblogic
i am not familiar with glassfish but you could do this in websphere or weblogic using a commonj workmanager

532442
put	get
what i actually intended to do was to create a factory that provides implementations of a generic file transfer interface containing get and put methods based on a given connection uri

532482
contains	any
if it is the sum of all selected records null would be appropriate when any of the records contains a null since you technically don t know for sure

532491
attributes	properties
it fails for all attributess where the html attributes name differs from the dom properties name classname htmlfor plus you have to use the dom-style capitalisation

532491
attributes	properties
it also returns the wrong datatype for attributes whose dom properties aren t strings

532503
z-index	tooltip
solution will be to use a higher z-index property for tooltip than link

532522
bugzilla	fogbugz
does your team use any kind of issue tracking fogbugz bugzilla etc which he participates in

532531
decimal-point	digits
0 default no commas every three digits to the left of the decimal-point and two digits to the right of the decimal-point

532531
decimal-point	digits
1 commas every three digits to the left of the decimal-point and two digits to the right of the decimal-point

532531
decimal-point	digits
2 no commas every three digits to the left of the decimal-point and four digits to the right of the decimal-point

532559
hide	show
i m going to implement an access-control list for each individual user so they can assign access to their own resources so they can hide stuff for example from their mothers but show their friends

532564
getter	setter
the standard xmlserializer serialization only acts on public properties that have both a getter and setter

532569
arrays	map
list map set or even arrays

532577
factors	matrix
s is a diagonal matrix which represents scaling or squashing with different scaling factors the diagonal terms along each of the n axes

532577
factors	matrix
so the effect of left-multiplying a vector v by a matrix m is to rotate reflect v by m s orthonormal factors v then scale squash the result by a diagonal factors s then rotate reflect the result by m s orthonormal factors u

532577
numerical	matrix
one reason svd is desirable from a numerical standpoint is that multiplication by orthonormal matrix is an invertible and extremely stable operation condition number is 1

532580
safari	opera
im unsure about other browsers like opera or safari it is possible that you need to extend this list with further variants

532599
typedef	struct
typedef struct wf_list_workunit_fe

532607
attributes	properties
i ll leave getfriendlyaccessname as an exercise to the reader - use isfamily isprivate ispublic isprotected etc - or the attributes properties

532611
driver	kernel
end-users are allowed to combine for example a proprietary video driver and the linux kernel but people are generally forbidden to distribute the combined work

532617
versioning	upgrade
i have had a lot of success with older versioning i haven t upgrade in a while though

532647
silverlight	wpf
right now flash flex silverlight wpf all give you tons of capabilities out of the box so that s why using them is a good idea assuming you re looking to get things done

532651
value	field
in the example above if any of the parameters are null the coalesce function will use the value in the underlying field

532654
internet-explorer	firefox
however they aren t being very successful yet since other some other browsers including internet-explorer and older versions of firefox don t implement these technologies

532657
dictionary	arrays
i ran into some texts about the introduction of a frame datatype into erlang basically a dictionary associative arrays type thats common in other languages.

532658
markup	xhtml
if you really want to write code according to xhtml dtd schema you can do it but cannot take advantage of the flexibility of dojo markup dojoml

532668
datagridview	treeview
one of these tabpages contains a treeview and another contains a datagridview

532683
duplicates	lookup
duplicates performs a native database lookup and adds the results to the playlist all at once so it is very fast

532713
datagridview	treeview
you probably want to set it to dockstyle.fill on your treeview and datagridview

532715
margins	padding
they have pretty wacky default padding margins properties a good reason to always use a reset

532717
text-align	display
if it is a div text-align center should work as long as you haven t set display block on your a tags

532733
iasyncresult	idisposable
because iasyncresult does not implements idisposable another place must be chosen to free the resources

532745
cursor	row
the methods returns a null reference if a ref cursor is returned rather than the value of the first column of the first row to which the ref cursor points

532774
assign	add
i was assign a feature to add to a chunk of code that takes a collection of images and generates a pdf from the images

532786
iasyncresult	idisposable
anyway there should not be any leak because if the iasyncresult is holding some native resource it should correctly implements idisposable and dispose such resources when the gc calls his finalizer

532810
relational-database	schema
i m pretty sure you can find good acl schema templates for relational-database that you can use as a reference like this document here

532812
sniffing	packets
sounds like you re after some kind of packets sniffing utility

532823
primitive	int
using a primitive type say int could be faster

532829
perl	php
cgi processes are typically php or perl scripts

532838
value	field
you need to know the specifics of a table to insert into it properly you need to be aware of what field are required and what field have default value

532856
webforms	asp.net
what is the asp.net mvc equivalent to override void render from asp.net webforms

532888
swing	swt
i have no experience with swt yet i was working with jambi qt swing and gtk as well

532888
licensing	gpl
the only problem with qt jambi is licensing in my opinion you must either publish your soft under gpl or buy commercial license

532921
filtering	grouping
so ordering grouping filtering

532934
repr	eval
i thought of just using repr and eval but is there a simple way i could accomplish this without using eval

532958
show	next
the next step is to have your overlay containers catch the click events and make sure that they aren t propagated as show in the extinfowindow code near the end of initialize

532966
syntax-error	syntax
i receive an incorrect syntax-error near a character that looks like an u but the syntax is correct

532986
pascal	delphi
are there any static code analysis tools for delphi pascal

532986
delphi	c++
i have seen plenty of options for c++ and .net but nothing for delphi pascal

532989
repr	eval
i thought of just using repr and eval but is there a simple way i could accomplish this without using eval

532989
repr	eval
nothing simpler than repr and eval

533006
value	field
so databases should store key relationships constraints on the data that is allowed in a field default value etc

533014
associations	model
the thing i m trying to achieve is actually quite simple include all user model matching the following the condition in my associations

533038
iostream	boost
i m loking for quick and easy i really don t want to start defining sinks and such with boost iostream as the article does - that stuff is way over my head

533040
puts	gets
the first puts prints hello foo gets called returning hello which is the arguments to puts

533046
panels	grid
the grid panels type not only allows rows and columns but is also very good at auto sizing to content

533048
methods	extend
is it possible to decorate extend the python standard logging system so that when a logging methods is invoked it also logs the file and the line number where it was invoked or maybe the methods that invoked it

533050
python	php
i have experienced this phenomenon in the php python and objective-c libraries for stomp

533094
fflush	gets
i write a lot of perl scripting and on a fast server unless you set stdout to always fflush after each write the output gets all mixed up just like yours

533102
naming-conventions	conventions
to be clear i m not referring to the whole domain.company.project part of this i m talking about the package conventions beneath that. anyway the package naming-conventionss that i see are as follows

533122
komodo	vim
i also use todo fixme tags in code that gets highlighted yellow in vim and tracked by the todo extension in komodo

533126
configuration-management	system-requirements
we have lots and lots of documents like pid project initiation doc business requirements system-requirements tech spec code review checklist issue logs defect logs configuration-management plan configuration-management check list s release documents and lots.

533132
facebook	linkedin
sites currently being looked at include facebook twitter linkedin and google maps

533145
having	select
you are better off having a high-quality jpg or png in your library then right-click it and select properties

533167
text-align	width
try making the link a block with an assigned width and then applying text-align center

533255
parentheses	braces
enclosed in parentheses the braces

533257
xsd	xml
i know the following tools that generate documentation from xml schema files xsd

533263
protected	public
from a purely practical standpoint java s visibility constructs allow classes in the same package to access methods and properties with protected and default visibility as well as the public ones

533274
order	join
order by here should prevent pushing predicate into the view and the optimizer should selected a hash join

533276
contains	elements
if you add a list string that contains two elements - abc and xyz into the viewstate it ll grow by 312 bytes

533276
contains	elements
if instead you add a string that contains the same two elements it ll only grow by 24 bytes

533300
instances	self
methodss of a class accept self as the first parameter to refer to the instances of the class whose context the methods is being called in

533300
instances	self
so what does the first parameter of a classmethods canonically self refer to if the methods is meant to be called without an instances reference

533316
instances	self
self would return the class itself while self returns an instances

533318
overwrite	preserve
you can change that to public or you can add a methods property to your form2 class to set the label and call that latter methods is generally preferred to preserve encapsulation and because the designer may want to overwrite your public change.

533323
detect	move
i have use document click event to detect when a user click on the page to know when to show the next bullet point in the slider or to move to the next page

533330
dynamic-dispatch	dynamic-binding
are dynamic-dispatch and dynamic-binding the same thing

533338
double	int
and the types of variables were defined by a suffix character a was a string while a was an int and a# was double precision

533355
debugging	trace
look at the stack trace and see if you can pinpoint where this is ocurring in your code then wrap some debugging printi outs around it to check if your objects are nil when they shouldn t be

533357
selection	highlight
note that highlight a selection for example double-clicking or doing a drag-select and hitting f1 only does a non-context string-search which tends to suck at finding anything helpful so make sure you just positioning the cursor anywhere inside the word without highlight it

533362
dynamic-dispatch	overrides
dynamic-dispatch - the actual methods grouping signature overrides chain is bound at compile time

533362
reflection	runtime
dynamic binding - the actual methods is bound at runtime and is subject to interpretation based on the semantics of the language or reflection framework

533368
pascal	delphi
pascal analyser delphi 2006+ has built in audits and metrics source monitor and code healer are the ones that i m aware of - all are pretty useful

533372
header-files	linker-error
also you need to make sure that your application points to the directory where the gtest header-files are stored in properties - c c++ - general - additional include directories but if you got to the linker-error i assume that you already managed to get this part correct or else you d have a lot more compiler errors to deal with first

533398
tcsh	bash
without using the new 2.6 subprocess module how can i get either os.popen or os.system to execute my commands using the tcsh instead of bash

533398
tcsh	bash
the string will be interpreted by bash and then interpreted by tcsh

533398
tcsh	bash
can t i just tell python to open up a tcsh sub-process instead of a bash subprocess

533398
tcsh	bash
i realize that bash is the cat s meow but i m working in a corporate environment and i m going to choose to not fight a tcsh vs bash battle -- bigger fish to fry

533421
bazaar	git
however it may also be a good chance to look into alternative version control systems that allow greater ease of use and flexibility take a look at bazaar and git

533430
data-access	ado.net
we have a data-access layer consisting of 5 classes which concern themselves with ado.net threads and transactions

533435
tcsh	zsh
i don t have tcsh installed but with zsh

533453
radio-button	checkbox
there are various asp.net standard web-controls within these tables usually checkbox radio-button lists text entry boxes labels etc

533453
put	get
i am trying to put a datagrid within one of the rows under a tag and get the error message

533462
google-chrome	safari
i would like a solution that works on all popular modern browsers ff3 safari google-chrome ie plus ie6

533467
implements	final
another question touches on mine but the poster never returned to explain how he implements the final step which is the part i m missing

533474
convention	standards
the standards convention for this is to return the instance of this at the end of each of the methods call

533475
getlasterror	createfile
but my application is failing calling createfile with getlasterror code of 123

533476
sql-server	mysql
i m need to copy several tables wholesale from a third-party sql-server 2000 database to a mysql 5 database and keep them synchronized-- when some crud happens on the sql-server tables i d like it to be reflected in the mysql versions in a timely manner

533476
sql-server	mysql
so is there any way to replicate synchronize data from sql-server 2005 to mysql that doesn t involve me comparing tables in the two databases programmatically

533501
ref	out
except in the case of ref and out

533509
put	get
using tags and css one can hide and display areas of html so while i couldn t get the datagrid in the table i could put it outside of a table and simply display or hide it

533517
any	set
you are creating a text file without any built-in linebreaks so each paragraph is a single line even though with linebreak and wrap set it looks like they are multiple lines

533539
xml-parsing	tag-soup
try to use tag-soup as your xml-parsing and then process the output through xpath

533548
onclick	onload
when events are fired they are connected to their action onload onclick

533553
code-coverage	build-process
most stackoverflow answers that i have found in regards to the perl build-process and unit-testing and code-coverage simply point me to cpan for the documentation there

533553
code-coverage	build-process
i ve been searching all over the internet for actual working code samples that i can download or paste into my ide like your typical tutorial hello world example source code but of an example that demonstrates the build-process with unit-testing and code-coverage analysis

533565
dynamic-dispatch	dynamic-binding
dynamic-dispatch or dynamic-binding means that when calling a methods choosing the actual methods implementation to execute happens while the program is running because statically there is not enough information available

533565
dynamic-dispatch	dynamic-binding
dynamic-binding is according to wikipedia a form of dynamic-dispatch in oo languages where the actual methods to invoke is based on the name of the operation and the actual receiver at runtime

533577
code-coverage	build-process
it took me a while and it also took me taking small snippets from a number of different sources and melting them together but i think i have a small working example that sufficiently demonstrates to a perl newbie the perl build-process including unit-testing and code-coverage analysis reporting

533577
command-line	cmd
now from the cmd-line in the top level project directory type the following cmd

533577
click	mouse
then i set up my ide to execute this file via perl builttest.pl with a single mouse click and it automatically runs my unit test code from the ide instead of me doing it manually from the command-line

533581
execute	declare
python will let you declare a function in a function so you don t have to do the execute trickery

533594
environment	execution
for example in an environment were we need to produce a set of programs running on our internal production platform most of our sixsigma projects are centered around operational architecture that is making operational an execution environment how to set up servers and networks in order to stop updates install and launch a set of executable and that for many projects each with their own sdp

533611
put	get
once you get that working you could try to put similar code into a subclassed version of the listview control

533629
radio-button	selected
alternatively you can also set the option globally in enterprise manager under properties - processor - parallelism click the radio-button next to use and selected 1

533650
order	add
in order to speed up the process i would like to add a next and previous button to a toolbar pinned above the keyboard and allow the user to tab between the fields using these button

533656
versioning	upgrade
for example what if a user install the ie6 versioning of your app then upgrade to ie7

533670
hash	md5
i don t know of any flash-specific ways but it certainly wouldn t be difficult to write a script that compares the md5 hash of the original file with the version you have online

533685
order	add
in order to add the same file in two or more projects you can

533695
xml-parsing	tag-soup
a more robust way of removing malicious code is to rely on a xml-parsing that can handle all kind of html documents tidy tag-soup etc and to selected the elements to remove with an xpath expression

533701
protected	public
i m looking into releasing a public rest api which i d like to keep protected via api keys

533729
any	set
i guess it might be because the defaults are set to prevent any invalid transactions from failing silently

533764
attributes	properties
attributess both accessing attributes values and accessing object properties from the attributes

533777

just set the reference you have to null and let the gc do its job .when it s ready

534072
updating	updates
the problem i had faced was that i was actually forgetting to updates idisposable implementation after updating actual logic

534075
constructor	object
it s not worth it since the object can easily stay on the stack and it has all the copy constructor and assignment operator needed for an efficient copy

534086
exception-handling	try-catch
if you open tools|exception-handling then tick the common language runtime exception-handling box the debugger will stop at the point of exception regardless of any try-catch finally blocks

534094
jdom	xom
using jdom xom dom4j makes no sense if there is such a dom limitation

stax	sax
it s worth noting that there is no such thing as a dom parsing all actual xml-parsing are built on streaming apis sax stax or xmlpull

534112

bug-tracking	fogbugz
i would agree with jpunyon that you should use fogbugz for bug-tracking

534139
value	field
both files contains the same keys but one containss dev value and the other containss the value we expect to deploy and be edited in the field

534166
environment	building

534183
ubuntu	linux
note that i use ubuntu linux and so does my friend and that this application compiles and runs without the -wl -bstatic options just fine.

534193
communication	messages
common sense in communication dictates that anything that distracts you away from the messages -- the content of the email is not a good idea

dsa	rsa
in order to check the signature of the hash anything from rsa over dsa to ecc can be used

534248

port-scanning	port
one public facing server then will have ssh exposed to the internet at some obscure high numbered port and a port-scanning triggers setup to block any ip s that try to find it

534260
xsd	xml
i m not sure how well these tools work with xml and xsd and you may have to generate the db using xmlspy and then reverse engineer the database

534261
default	reset
basically the problem is that each time the assembly versioning changes the user install a new versioning of the application all their settings are reset the the default or more accurately a new user.config file is created in a folder with a different versioning number as the name

534291
shopping-cart	paypal
godaddy a shopping-cart with paypal integration isn t that hard to do you could host it yourself

534311
boost	stl
things like what is suggested in meyer s effective stl such as trying to avoid for loops and replace them with more functional constructs using boost bind and boost function etc

534314
python	c++
the shedskin compiler compiles a subset of python to c++ which you can compile to native code using any compiler

534330
value	field
i m only interested in the value of the foobar field

534335
versioning	upgrade
applicationsettingsbase has a methods called upgrade which migrates all settings from the previous versioning

534335
configuration	upgrade
then at application start you check to see if the flag is set and if it is call the upgrade method set the flag to false and save your configuration

534347
contains	set
you can set a projection that contains a list of only the properties that you are interested in

534356
entity-framework	ado.net
i m also looking at using ado.net entity-framework for my orm but i was wondering how do you do full text search fts with linq to ado.net entity-framework

534356
entity-framework	ado.net
is there any support in ado.net entity-framework or am i stuck using the method of creating a function which uses the full text search predicates

534406
configuration-files	web-config
but you will not get the path because the configuration is a mix of a lot of configuration-files machin.config several web-config etc

534415
hosts-file	hosts
the hosts on the webserver has an entry for the database server and the ip-address is correct so the webserver theoretically at least shouldn t even be going to dns to connect to the database server

534431
schema	rdbms
often i find myself working on a new project with a giant rdbms whose schema i don t yet understand

534446
sql-server	oracle
sql-server and oracle both have a feature you can enable called change data capture

534446
sql-server	oracle
you said you re not using sql-server but there s still hope here if you re on oracle

534450
any	set
then i d suggest looking at browser settings specifically any proxy settings that might be forwarding your request to a machine that has no idea what to do with it and firewalls which could well be set to ignore or hide any access to the port

534467
webforms	asp.net
the app i am making is a winform port of a webforms asp.net app

534475
radians	cos
as below note that in c# for example sin and cos take radians not degrees - multiplying by math.pi 180 to get the value in radians first

534481
constructor	object
the next time you retrieve that object the id is passed into the constructor to facilitate retrieving the object

534485
hosts-file	hosts
have any changes been made to the hosts on either server

534520
boost	stl
i m not sure about well written but there are a few things out there like hypertable and kfs that are system-level software that both use boost and stl extensively

534538
credentials	security
it is not security by obscurity and is a good way to store login credentials for an unattended process

534539
code-coverage	ncover
every night a second build is triggers that runs these same tests but under 4 different profiling whilst running under ncover which produces a code-coverage report

534541
uiscrollview	subviews
that is create a controller that has the main view as a uiscrollview and then add in the uisearchbar and uiwebview as subviews

534558
selected	listbox
i ve got a silverlight listbox and i want to remove the colour change highlight that occurs when the user selected an item in the listbox

534558
highlight	selected
by default when an item is selected it highlight the item a sort of light blue color

534566
versioning	upgrade
google designed protocols buffering for this type of scenario they shift a huge amount of data around - their format is compact using things like base-128 encoding but extensible and versioning tolerant so clients and servers can upgrade easily

534570
put	get
with the bin obj directories gone you don t need to exclude all executable xml files etc - which is handy as it means you still get to put in the ones you want you might have sample xml files etc.

534575
hide	show
this works fine but i d like one of the controls to hide if the boolean is true and show if it s false

534581
http	ssl
also this sets the server up for an ssl connection so once you ve set it up the address will be and http address not the regular

534600
where-clause	sql
a far more performant solution would be to construct the sql with only the required fields in the where-clause

534620
contains	any
the sql you have should work if you are returning an empty string for parameters that don t have a value entered you are returning and not null - the like comparison for those fields will then only contains the wildcard match any value

534620
value	field
however this is not very efficient as ideally you only want to do a comparison on the field that the user has entered a value

534622
environment	building
did you test your package on a test environment or just copy the building wsp from your dev server to production

534628
cos	sin
you can use cos and sin to work out the amount of movement in the x and y coordinates

534628
radians	cos
the other thing to note is that the cos and sin functions are using radians instead of degrees

534665
sql-server	mysql
i know mysql exibits this left most behaviour and i think sql-server is also left most

534685
value	field
how about using isnull function to determine if a value has been passed into the stored procedure and if not setting the where-clause field value to search for equal to itself in each case if someone can think of a better choice of words for describing this i will update the answer

534697
return-type	arguments
class as the arguments or return-type

534702
contains	any
3.3.12 applications must not contains any obscene pornographic offensive or

534702
contains	any
3.3.13 applications must not contains any malware malicious or harmful code program

534713
pixels	line
if rearranging the pixels data is important for later operations consider block operations and or cache line optimization

534726
export	report
so you could create these urls as links in your application maybe one using just rs command render as a view report link and one link that include rs format pdf as an export to pdf link

534739
unpivot	pivot
there are some questions related to this already on so search for pivot or unpivot or group_concat but a simple solution for sql-server using a trick with variables concatenation for your stated problem

534756
stderr	stdout
produces a log file from stderr and stdout the contents of which are display as well but

534764
administration	account
i tried adding the user network service to the database but it turns out i don t have the user privileges to do so - it doesn t matter that my windows account that i log on to the server with is admin or that i run the program in an administration context

534767
folder	dir
so if you execute the scripting test.bat below from the c temp long dir name folder

534808
32-bit	64bit
32-bit amis only run on m1.small while 64bit amis only run on m1.large and m1.xlarge instances plus the respective high cpu variants

534810
listboxitem	selected
the easy way to do this is to fire up expression-blend right click a listboxitem go to edit control parts templates and selected edit a copy.

534810
listboxitem	selected
the xaml below sets the listboxitem mouse-over color to be transparent and the selected color to be bright green but you can customize this to your needs

534810
listboxitem	selected
the fillcolor2 specifies the color to use when a listboxitem is selected

534810
listboxitem	selected
in the code above i ve specified #ff00ff00 so the color will be bright green when a listboxitem is selected

534863
svnadmin	dump
unfortunately svnadmin dump just dump everything you cannot specify a path of the repository to exclude

534865
recording	playing
in short i need to have circular bufferings for both recording and playing and i need to be feeding the output buffering every 20 ms or so with the new data that is just about to be played

534878
web-services	security
as he points out wcf 3.5 s usernames over transport security cannot be used on iis-hosted service although my question was regarding asp.net web-services not wcf

534883
32-bit	64bit
i would say go with 32-bit unless you really need 64bit for performance reasons

534913
shopify	zendesk
devjavu bitbucket github shopify versionshelf paypal ipn jott links imified pbwiki facebook platform sort of mailhook.org smtp2web astrotrain notifixious assembla zendesk google code

534920
ruby	php
i have been working with php on zend in a mvc configuration and done some ruby on rails so i do have a good idea of the pattern but i have absolutly no idea about iis visual studio and asp c#.

534931
interpreter	runtime
here the lex and parsing phase is done and you have just the runtime of the inner interpreter

534933
having	select
in general i would try to avoid having too many xpath segments levels in the select clause

534941
webforms	asp.net
the majority of our applications are asp.net webforms apps and wcf services that are running on 64bit servers in production

534949
waveout	wasapi
the story is that directsound is the replacement for waveout but directsound joined directinput as deprecated api s in vista and is replaced with wasapi

534949
waveout	wasapi
directsound and waveout are implements on top of the user-space wasapi in vista

534958
command-line	cmd
cmd will remain because you can run batch files and command-line ops extremely quickly

534964
stream	send
if i kill the connection to the server the end of stream is finally reached and everything goes off without a hitch all of the data from the client in this case firefox requesting www.google.com has been read by the server and it is able to process it as required though obviously it can t send anything back to the client

534964
bytearrayoutputstream	outputstream
the outputstream is a bytearrayoutputstream

534965
32-bit	64bit
i know that you can t have 32-bit code in a 64bit process but i think you can open a pipe to a 32-bit process unless i have that wrong

534972
.net	wcf
wcf .net

534980
clisp	ccl
my guess is that the code is ccl-dependent so use ccl instead of clisp or sbcl

534993
downgrade	upgrade
these steps upgrade or downgrade assembly a in the scenario that was described in the how to upgrade or downgrade an assembly section

534993
versioning	upgrade
when you follow these steps you try to upgrade assembly a and assembly b to versioning 2.0.0.0

534993
downgrade	upgrade
to upgrade or downgrade assembly a follow these steps

535003
highlight	selected
i m not sure if that is the correct term since i also want to do things like highlight the selected part of the image or show a popup bubble pointing to it

535012
constructor	object
note that technically a function level static may not necessarily come into existence until the function is first called and that may make sense for c++ with its constructor but every c implementation i ve ever used creates its function level statics at the same time as file level object

535044
32-bit	64bit
calling 32-bit code from 64bit process

535053
firefox	opera
how about firefox opera safari etc

535070
firefox	opera
according to that page ie4+ netscape 6+ opera 4+ and i gather all versions of firefox support http 1.1

535072
selected	textbox
if the user selected --more-- then i want the dropdown to turn into a textbox so they can enter a numeric value

535072
value	field
i want the field name posted back to have the same form value regardless of which entry methods was used

535078
configuration	environment
if you are using a single glassfish administration console to manage multiple application servers throughout your environment those application servers can share a common configuration

535092
bazaar	git
check out other options too - miscrosoft s tfs this not only used for source control system but for defect tracking project management etc etc bazaar git are popular ones

535144
for-loop	arrays
instead of having two identical for-loops in your presentation logic you should have one for-loop outside of it that builds two arrays then your presentation logic should use each the way that would actually be beneficial to it

535148
contains	elements
lvpept is a listview and contains 10 elements

535148
windows-xp	windows
independent of the windows version windows 2000 windows-xp 32 bit

535154
32-bit	64bit
registering com 32-bit dll for asp 64bit call

32-bit	64bit
more great blog tips back to basic 32-bit and 64bit confusion around x86 and x64 and the .net and clr

535163
32-bit	64bit
the name-mangling leading underscore is the tip of the iceberge even if you managed to fix this calling convention issue you d still have the problem of calling 64bit from 32-bit

535163
32-bit	64bit
we had a similar issue we considered that perhaps we d be able to wrap our 32-bit dlls in com wrappers and then call the com wrappers from 64bit

535165
windows-vista	windows
the development environment is on a virtualized windows 2003 r2 machine hosted on a windows-vista machine

535177
listitem	selected
the only thing that i think could make this happen is if the listview didn t realize that the listitem had changed it s selected value and therefore doesn t update its selected item collections

535182
javascript	dom
if you trigger the javascript enhancement when the dom is ready either by just putting your script at the bottom of the page or by using a domcontentloaded-style event supplied by your framework the links should adapt fast enough that the user is very unlikely to be clicking the button first

535182
document	element
if you really really want to delay click that are placed between the element first being parsing and the document being loaded you could write something like

535188
base-class	inherited
well they don t inherited any special base-class at least

535193
conditional	operators
if you re using the ternary operators for a simple conditional assignment i think it s fine

535199
revision	updates
once you re able to commit revision of your code and run updates to get other people s work then go back and read the red bean book it really is the best way to learn subversion in-and-out

535216
methods	extend
the linq-generated classes are partial classes meaning you can extend them by creating your own partial classes or partial methods

535221
attributes	properties
you could deliberately say you want an actual attributes by calling the dom methods a.setattributes hash value except that this doesn t work in ie6 7 due to a long-standing bug where it confuses attributess and properties

535233
pointers	stack
you either have to make the vector a vector of pointers and remember to delete them afterwords or create the new point on stack and copy them into the vector with a standard assign

535234
shell	bash
there are plenty of shell around for windows bash under cygwin is the one i use the most and it s certainly free

535236
duplicates	elements
edit you have a similar previous question here using css to duplicates html elements

535260
temporary	copy
although i wouldn t create a temporary copy of the point as your code does

535260
pointers	stack
that s creating a pointers to a point as opposed to a point on stack

535269
pointers	stack
the non-scalar issue is because you re assigning a point pointers return value of operator new to a point stack object as it s not point in your code

535269
copy-constructor	constructor
the implicitly-generated copy-constructor of point because you didn t declare a point const point other constructor in your class the compiler did one for you will copy currentpoint.x and currentpoint.y into the list

535271
transfer-encoding	chunked
some may be using transfer-encoding chunked where the content-length is encoded and include as part of the body

535272
sql-server	oracle
also it s been my experience that while filemaker developers love fm they re having to learn other technologies because more and more government agencies my primary employer the past 10 years are moving off of fm and into sql-server oracle and to some extent access and open source

535273
python	perl
also python or perl for that matter can replace the shell entirely

535284
common-lisp	scheme

i m not a fan of looking at a monitor from an angle am wondering what the pairing experience would be like if you had 1 computer with 2 monitors displaying the same info each with it s own keyboard and mouse

535366
internet-explorer	google-chrome
everything works fine in firefox 3 google-chrome but fails in internet-explorer but only sometimes certain actions such as resetting the form which really just does a response.redirect with some querystring parameters .

535366
google-chrome	firefox
can anybody suggest why this only happens in ie and not in firefox or google-chrome

535376
localization	translation
this illustrates the issues that you can run into when you think localization is just translation

535402
groovy	java
as greg above points out languages like clojure and groovy target the jvm for one main reason so that java developers can have the best of both worlds

535402
common-lisp	scheme
so if you want to learn lisp scheme or common-lisp would be a great start

535426
any	set
are there any python object-relational mapping libraries that given a database schema can generate a set of python classes

535428
keyboard	mouse

installation	building
if you can satisfy this requirement in your os x installation then you can building iphone apps

535491
ruby-on-rails	django
ruby-on-rails django etc are all popular for a reason

535492
versioning	upgrade
but issue is that iphone sdk gets frequent updates and requires updated versioning of mac os x - updating hackintosh is pain you can do better development on macmini instead of wasting time to upgrade and you will never know when your hackintosh will be unbootable

535494
.when	ready
and .when questions arise that they cannot answer they have ready access to your customer partners - even if in the coffee line

535496
ostream	std
edit true manipulator semantics a persistent quoting state could also be achieved by wrapping an std ostream rather than deriving from it as noted by benã it in the comments.

535496
ostream	std
to the best of my knowledge this cannot be done directly without either deriving a new class from std ostream or similar or wrapping such a class in another class that forwarding most methods to its contains std ostream object

535499
messenger	bots
i have done some internal bots for my company using the xmpp jabber protocol i ve used the agsxmpp sdk and the jabber.net client libraries i was looking for apis to work with yim aim and windows live messenger but i ve found only com exposed apis nothing for .net.

535540
javascript	dom
coding all your own javascript from scratch teaches you a bit about the dom and javascript in general but ultimately its a waste of time focus on making your app framework better instead

535556
constructor	private
you cannot make a struct with a private parameter-less constructor or even declare a parameter-less constructor

535582
windows-server	windows

if the dto is a class that is exposed by a web service the wsdl that is created defines the property as an element and the proxy that gets created on the other side just creates a getter-setter property that is run on the client itself so the getters and setter do not cause a roundtrip

535654
getter	setter
even if you just create a public variables in your dto the proxy will be implements as a getter and setter

535655
hide	show
given that most people have a tendency to top post i d like to be able to hide the duplicates message in an email reply in a manner similar to how gmail does it show quoted text

535745
contains	any
the release notes contains any long-term issues or questions we want the customer to think about issues that can t be resolved immediately by a phone call or email and the application displays these notes for the user

535746
instances	self
what you need to do is either create a new class to act as the delegate and create a new instances of the class for each request or if you want to continue using self as the delegate make sure you take a look at the connection parameter passed into the delegate methods

535755
constructor	object
if you just need to deal with adding object to a collection then collection initializers work great but if you need more static initialization to be performed you can use something called a static constructor that works the same as a static initializer in java

535764
value	field
why couldn t you just use reflection to set the value of the field or properties directly and remove the entire concept of the -commands classes

535771
satisfiability	np-hard
we want to prove that deciding the satisfiability of boolean formulas is an np-hard problem as well

535771
variables	boolean
for each vertex v have two boolean variables v_h and v_l and the requirement v_h or v_l each pair can only have the values 01 10 11 which we can think of as color 1 2 and 3

535771

535814
global-variables	call
the getopt function uses some global-variables like optind and optarg to store state information between call

535826
implements	extends
with poco you have to use the runnable interface and the usage is close to what you would get with java threads if you implements runnable not extends thread

535826
implements	extends
instead of implements extends an interface it depends on the operator being defined

535838
linux	bsd
that s the case with almost every platform that i know of still in use including linux bsd and even emerging os s like helenos - i know i was the one who ported getopt to its libc

worksheet	excel
the source data is a table on a hidden excel worksheet

535918
32-bit	64bit
if you application needs to run on both 32-bit and 64bit systems a good way is to configure the compiler to force the binary running in 32-bit mode

535918
32-bit	64bit
this will force any 64bit system to run your application in a 32-bit emulation mode

535918
32-bit	64bit
otherwise you have to provide two binary versions of your application a 32-bit binary and a 64bit binary

535921

535963
hide	show
why can t i instantly show or hide private or protected members

535972

one of my other gripes with prepares is that sometimes it is more efficient to append some non-escapable input to a statement like .

536031
subtract	add
then add the number of preceding enumvalue siblings of the current node and subtract the number of preceding enumvalue siblings of the node from which you took the data value

536034
contains	any
while the suggestion that you could simply use is true i simply prefer reading this kind of if-statement from left to right if this value is equal to any of these instead of if these values contains this value

536035
configuration	logging
there is a built in facility for using nhibernate which allows for simple configuration of logging and connections etc

536038

536119
jquery	.post
the code above came from this .post how do i get a jquery selector #39

536125
webforms	asp.net
if you completely abandon webforms you ll be faster becuase the asp.net life-cycle and object model is humongous

536125
webforms	asp.net
i don t care about view engine abstraction because the support for aspx pages in visual studio is decent but i ve completely dropped webforms as a concept and basically any asp.net framework due to code bloat or not being able to change the things that wire my application

536125
asp.net-mvc	webforms
behind the scene there is a lot of things going on but this code is fast a lot faster than webforms or the asp.net-mvc framework

536189
contains	elements
one optimization for kevin loney s solution might be to merge partial paths that contains the same elements at the same column

536195
constructor	object
the public constructor requires you to pass a class object at run time which means class information is available at runtime to code that needs it

536195
superclass	subclass
not a subclass of t not a superclass of t but precisely t

536195
constructor	object
this then means that you can create an arrays object of the appropriate type in your constructor which means that the type of the objects you store in your collection will have their types checked at the point they are added to the collection

536205
methods	extend
should i extend the model classes with appropriate methods

536207
lcov	gcov
we have started to use gcov and lcov together

536207

536275
grouping	sorting
given that the view you want is - as you say - just a view of the underlying data then you should do the sorting and grouping in the view module

536278
sftp	ssh
i think that the gnome desktop uses a single ssh connection when accessing a share through sftp ssh

536290
superclass	subclass
slicing means that if you assign a subclass instance to a superclass variables the extra information contains by subclass is sliced off because the superclass variables doesn t have the extra spaces to store this extra information of the subclass

536290
superclass	subclass
when you assign a subclass instance to a superclass variables you actually just copy the reference

536305

contains	any
it certainly does it contains a collection of actions which could be any number of executable statements that are executed under the constraint that the function must be called from somewhere before it can execute

536415
return-value	arguments
it is much nicer to have composability - putting functions together conveniently passing the return-value of one function directly as an arguments to another

536424
put	get
i might put file compare into this search engine and get a bunch of matching projects back

536439
boost	stl

536464
dependency-injection	factory-pattern
also i use the abstract factory-pattern for dependency-injection

536486

note that converting this number to from a human-readable form is by no means a trivial task - it requires multiplication and division by 10 or 256 and i cannot present code as a sample without proper research

536486
subtract	add
the advantage is that the operations add subtract and multiply can be made really efficient and the heavy conversion to from base-10 is done only once in the beginning and once after the end of the calculation

536502
settimeout	fadeout
is there any way to fadeout a div after 5 seconds without using a settimeout function

536511
directory	folder

oracle	mysql
for whatever reason i prefer to keep my code as free from platform-specific constructs as possible one reason this problem arose is that i m migrating from mysql to oracle

536714
contains	any
your settings bundle cannot contains any runnable code so it s not possible to have button like safari clear history clear cookies etc

536715
contains	any
this token can just contains a status login timestamps your userid usertype if any et al

536864
perl	ruby
apparently there is a 6343 character perl regexp written by paul warren that does a very good job and also works in ruby but even that is not foolproof i think it might also have some performance implications

32-bit	64bit
can i have the 32-bit and 64bit version of libstdc++ installed on the same machine without too much worries of breaking my linux install

536868

536872
mousedown	mouseup
you can develop one yourself by using a custom view and tracking mouse events mousedown mouseup -mousedragged

536878
mouseleave	mouseenter
you could use mouseenter and mouseleave in this way

536895
mstest	nunit
the problem is when trying to unit test our code nunit or mstest are not running from within the autocad context and they also cannot start it

536898
sql-server	oracle
the costs of sql-server and oracle are not that far apart you know

536900
abstract	extends
so if anyone tries to use your library it won t have difficulties implementing your interface as opposed to the case where he would have to extends your abstract concrete class given that he already extendss another already

536907
hotmail	gmail
this approach can have mixed results depending on your user s mail client so before sending it out try testing your format on dummy gmail yahoo and hotmail account

sql-server	oracle
only oracle and microsoft s sql-server are closed source and when something goes wrong and you have a problem the answer is just a phone call away and cash if course

536911
postgresql	mysql
anyways mysql and postgresql have several enterprise consulting services but in the end these consultants aren t really resposible for the product because the product belongs to everyone

536911
sql-server	oracle
ok now finally the most important difference is between sql-server and oracle and that difference is the os most people using windows will stick with you guessed it sql-server but if you run on flavors of unix oracle is your closed source solution

536911
sql-server	oracle
anyways i use oracle on solaris but if our target were windows i would probably use sql-server because both products are rock solid but i trust microsoft has some special tricks under the hood to get the best performance on windows

536938
javascript	dom
they are called the javascript programming language javascript the good parts dom an inconvinient api and advanced javascript

however i would like to change the line marked this line so that it returns the outer class s x that is c1 s field x with the value 3

537127
linq-to-nhibernate	criteria
we re using it here but behind a repository interface so that if linq-to-nhibernate doesn t quite fit the bill in some situations we can fall back on hql or the criteria api when appropriate

537131
textbox	button
another method is to set the associated textbox as button tag when instanciating them

537136
orientation-changes	device-orientation
i got much information on the action to be taken when the orientation-changes but i am not getting how do i change the device-orientation itself programatically

python	perl
is there some default windows scripting language that comes pre-installed on xp and vista similar to how os x comes with python and or linux comes with perl

537180
vbscript	jscript
windows-xp and vista have vbscript and jscript engines installed by default

537180
vbscript	jscript
as for my 2 cents vbscript and jscript are both very mature technologies that have plenty of resources available

537188
vbscript	jscript
windows scripting host invoked through cscript.exe supports vbscript and jscript

537197
vbscript	jscript
xp and vista come out of the box with vbscript and jscript support

sql-server	oracle
in microsoft sql-server i d use identity to do this in oracle i d use the sequence.currval

537231
value	field
some of these field legitimately cannot be a boolean because they can have several value but the majority can be treated as a boolean

537231
value	field
logically the field is a boolean in the sense that i m only interested in the y n value and the third value is really either yes or no but the values can be more than just true false there is a upsshippable field that can be y n or g

537231
value	field
to sum up i get a little long-winded 1 when dealing with char 1 value in data would you keep them as chars or convert to bit or whatever your database s boolean type is and why and 2 how would you tackle a tri-state char field in your code assuming you would leave it as char 1 in the data schema

537247
autotools	gnu
it works fine and i use it to generate the gnu autotools scripting

537247

csv	xml
an xml structure for example is more suitable for such a scenario but giving the inherent verbosity of the xml the csv like approach could have been a more attractive alternative

537297
photoshop	layer
in photoshop gimp there is a screens layer composition mode

537332
value	field
an enumset represents enum value internally with bit field and presents a set interface for manipulating these flags

glib	gtk
if you want to look at an example check out glib part of the gtk project

537340
32-bit	64bit
when you tried calling into the setup api directly was it from a 32-bit or 64bit process

537341
value	field
i m customizing work item templates in tfs 2008 through the powertools and i m wondering is it possible to hide a field or it s value for certain users

537349
highlight	cells
update i would like to return a maniplatable list of ids that failed i plan to highlight those cells in the application

537362
16-bit	8bit
this might make sense for 8bit numbers but probably not for 16-bit or larger

537366
classnotfoundexception	classpath
when i run that it finds the doclet on the path and executes it but the doclet uses an additional jar that needs to be on the classpath so eventually i get a classnotfoundexception

537381
positioning	sidebar
the sidebar will expand but for some reason it will not move back to it s original positioning

537382
boost	stl
most new projects that i am aware of do use modern c++ raii stl boost

537388
constructor	object
it gives you more object oriented features than you can remember in a language having a c-like syntax in a more elegant and standard way than trying to bolt constructor and so forth onto c with libraries and macros

537388
constructor	private
the system supports constructor destructors single inheritance interfaces virtual public and private methods and so forth

537391
webforms	asp.net
has anybody gone through the process of converting a real-world business application from asp.net webforms to mvc

537392
procedure	records
based on your updates you could also insert errored ids into a temporary table and then at the end of your procedure selected the records from that table as an additional result set you can look at

537396
version-control	git
git and svn are both good version-control solutions and are both popular within the ruby ruby-on-rails community

537421
.when	ready
another piece i just noticed is that your attaching a click event to the .active button .when the document is ready but there is no .active button .when the document is ready that comes in after you change it

537425
calayer	uiview
i m animation a uiview s frame property using a cakeyframeanimation on the view s calayer and animation the position property

537426
rollback	commit
this was both fast and memory efficient at least compared with traditional approaches like those the previous versioning used and we got commit rollback transactions for free

537426
memory-mapping	virtual-memory
also what is important to know is that memory-mapping is a must when dealing with large data because the data is never allocated hence consuming memory but dynamically mapped into the address spaces and managed by the systemd s virtual-memory manager which is always faster than the heap

537433
webforms	asp.net
i think the problem here is that no matter how much faster asp.net mvc is than the old webforms it won t make a difference because most of the time taken is in the database

537459
value	field
of the struct field to default value

537463
toggleclass	removeclass
of course instead of using toggleclass you could also use addclass and removeclass to be more explicit

537504
webserver	nginx
i d recommend nginx for the webserver

537504
configuration	environment
you d probably want to have one unix user per vhost - so every home-directory holds its own application python environment and server configuration

537518
apache	vhosts
that way you can still use apache s built-in support for vhosts

537531
hash	md5
if saving is a very expensive api call db transaction etc then you might find that it s worth the expense to serialization the object on-load and save an md5 hash of it

537534
contains	set
another option to consider is to set up a macros autocall library which contains the definitions of many macross

537535
constructor	object
please note i realise that actually calling a method might instantiate other object or variables that will use memory - my question simply relates to how much memory they use after calling the constructor

537542
hash	md5
how can i get a md5 sha and other hash from a file but only doing one pass

537553
virtualbox	vmware
contemplating on moving to vmware or virtualbox setup for development and keeping the development tools off of my main system but then think that would cause a headaches if i want to just try something really quick

537800
streamreader	binaryreader
i need to be able to determine whether the file is text or binary so i know whether to use a streamreader or binaryreader

537806
subclassing	superclass
using prototype would save you this and make a property updates on a superclass filtering through to the subclassing as expected

537812
order	join
if you have 50 customers and 1000 order you will have 50-1049 rows after the join and the meaning of an element in the result is hard to define

contains	any
these constraints are designed to ensure that the expression can be evaluated at the earliest possible stage of stylesheet processing without any dependency on information contains in the stylesheet itself or in any source document

537887
panels	grid
the other would be to somehow parsing the text so that each word is it s own text block you could then use a grid to left justify the first word of a line and right justify the last word of a line then space the other blocks in the center cell using a stack panels or similar

537889

for instances firefox 3 decided that it was going to block all self signed certificates for security purposes

537919
binary	octal
there s no syntax for literal binary constants in c++ the way there is for hexadecimal and octal

537920
execute	prepare
also if you look under the hood most db abstraction layers will prepare the query then run it even if you just tell it to execute a static sql statement

537932
communication	messages
this setup allows the view to communication up the chain but with a messages that conveys its own status instead of a messages that instructs other object to do something specific

537943
put	get
a lot depends on how detailed you want to get - but additional buffer time should be based on a risk assessment - at a task level where you put in various buffer times for

537950

i implemented a grid by placing a panels on top of it and drawing simple horizontal lines from one edge to the other using datacontext.drawline pen new point 0 y new point widthofpanels y

537989
hash	md5
an example for content of userfile.jpg md5 hash is 39f9031a154dc7ba105eb4f76f1a0fd4 and sha-1 hash is 878d8d667721e356bf6646bd2ec21fff50cdd4a9

537989
hash	md5
if this file s content changes but has the same md5 hash before and after is it probable that the sha-1 hash will also stay the same

537990
createfile	drive
i m using the web client service aka webdav redirector webclnt.dll which does a wonderful job of letting the normals createfile read write windows api calls be redirected from their normals drive i o path out to the network via webdav

hash	md5
checking the md5 hash by itself is sufficient for most purposes

538005
syntax-highlighting	code-folding
views syntax-highlighting code-folding

538011
hash	md5
md5 is probably safe for what you re doing but there s no reason to continue to use a hash with known flaws

538016
hash	md5
in general if the md5 hash don t match the sha1 or any other similar hash won t match either

538033
logout	login
you can also merely logout by killing the terminal session then login again and reattach the screen session

538040
hash	md5
because the two hash are calculated differently two files with the same md5 hash are no more likely to have the same sha-1 hash than two random files

538074
hash	md5
md5 is considered weak in the sense that it is possible to construct two documents with the same hash with a much lower amount of cpu time needed than it would take for a brute-force search collision resistance of md5 has been broken

538074
hash	md5
but it s not as far as i know weak from the standpoint of if you have an arbitrary document x someone else can create a document y with the same hash with a much easier time than a brute-force search md5 still has preimage resistance

538074
hash	md5
even if md5 is broken in that regard it s improbable that someone can come up with an algorithm to create documents to match an arbitrary md5 hash and an arbritrary sha1 hash

538074
hash	md5
but again if this is just integrity to protect against errors one md5 hash is fine

538099
show	next
i added a new column which show up next to the gallons field

538106
value	field
your option 1 combines value drawn from different domains in a single field

getprocaddress	dllimport
and since we are using getprocaddress instead of dllimport we don t need to do the ifdef dance from above just a simple dllexport

538190
global-assembly-cache	gac
you can also try using the .net configuration tool to see if the assembly is indeed present in the global-assembly-cache gac

538208
contains	any
i am looking for something at this point where if any part of destination column name is contains in the source it s a possible match i don t know of any way to determine likeliness

538210
constructor	object
you could add a parameter to the method that would represent the parameters to the constructor of the object you wish to instantiate

538210
constructor	object
then when you call activator.createinstance you could pass that arrays in and activator would do its best to find a constructor on the type you specified that matches the types in the object arrays

538210
constructor	object
we have three types that all have different constructors - if the caller is responsible for sending in the type name then they will also be responsible for supplying an arrays of object that will satisfy a non-default constructor

in particular because it s done at jit time it will depend on the version of the clr - and i believe that the 64bit clr inlines differently to the 32-bit one as well

538333
jar	war
maybe i am not understanding you correctly but it sounds like that you are putting the classes in a jar or a war before you are trying to refactor

margins	padding
edit updated my answer to use offsetwidth instead of jquery s width as the latter does not include border padding or margins in it

538334
firefox	opera
tested it on ie7 firefox safari opera and it gives the desired efirefoxect

538347

imho triggers are generally a bad thing but beyond that enforcing business rules at the level of insert into database tables doesn t strike me as a good separation of concerns

538350
ruby	php
after doing a code-review with an associate who uses both php and ruby routinely a fun challenge came up on string interpolation in php compared to ruby

538350
ruby	php
challenge can anyone specify a way to get the php version behave like ruby

quite some time ago some lisp systems can t really say many there haven t been all that many common-lisp implementations interpreted lisp functions by compiling them on the fly

538363
superclass	subclass
i have heard of conventions where this indicates calling the subclass s methods while an absence of this is calling the superclass s methods

538480
haskell	scheme
lisp haskell scheme - functional programming

538505
constructor	object
call synchronizationcontext.current on the main thread in the constructor and use the returned object whenever you need to synchronize calls

edit based on the negative votes i might want to explain why this question i am aware of methods but in the code base that i have been looking for getting first byte people do all kinds of crazy things like do a copy of the buffering copy it to a streaming and then do a get

538570
databound	gridview
the gridview is databound to an oracle

538599
version-control	cvs
assuming that you use version-control cvs or any other system properly it is a good way to keep track of old versions of files and you are more likely to find that version of your file exactly before or after you did some particular change if you have it

538606
key-value	key
however the way i read the original question is that the key object contains two integers and that the question was regarding the fastest way to retrieve all the key-value pairs that match one range for the first integer and match a second range for the second integer

538615
jruby	mri
it seems that jruby and mri have different limits to separate fixnum and bignum

rewrite	rule
if you opt for the apache rewrite rule rather than the application server mapping filtering as i did you might also want to do more than just look for 0-9a-za-z +

538840
click	mouse
you need to use the glutmotionfunc glutpassivemotionfunc callback to track mouse movement independent of mouse click

538852
global-assembly-cache	gac
i asked something similar do i ever really need to use the global-assembly-cache gac

538856

538856
composite	visitor
how can i use together visitor and composite

538857
interpreter	runtime
methinks you are actually writing c# in that string and getting it compiled interpreter at runtime against .net types instead of table defs

538879
packaging	building
we usually rename the production web-config to web-config.prod a copy for each of the environments and have the building tool pick the right file and rename it back to web-config while packaging for deployment

538882

538954
virtual-machine	vmware
a google search for create vmware virtual-machine will give you plenty of options

538955
procedure	records
in this case you d send in two extra parameters to the stored procedure for the starting row index and the page -size and return adjust the selected statement to retrieve only those records between row_index + 1 and row_index + page_size

538955
put	get
this can all be put into an extra layer of looping so you get a new segment and then inside of that go through each row in that segment

538993
jquery	dojo
using jquery dojo prototype etc

539030
stderr	stdout
add to the end of your command to redirect errors from stderr to stdout

restart	reload
is there no way to work on mod_perl2 modules without having the webserver restart after every reload whether automatically via maxrequestsperchild or manually as before

539096
constructor	object
the best you can do is write a method that checks the object in question either for nullity or some pre-determined flag value and be disciplined about calling it at the end of each constructor and or at the top of each method that references the object

webforms	asp.net
i m doing some maintenance on a classic asp application for my client and as i m looking through the asp the following question comes to mind - would it be easier to convert a classic asp app to asp.net mvc or asp.net webforms

539123
asp.net-mvc	webforms
let s assume that this asp code is written very well which isn t always true of course so really the question is will a best-case-well-designed asp site migrate better to asp.net-mvc than webforms

539127
value	field
secondly have that methods call settext on all those text field and set them to the new value

539127
value	field
if that variables s value can be changed outside the event dispatch thread then that methods must use swingutilities.invokelater to set those text field

539175
asp.net-mvc	webforms
on the other hand asp.net-mvc allows you to reuse some of this logic while making your application much more maintainable and with the appropriate architectural pattern your application can be developed and refactored much quicker than any webforms project

asp.net-mvc	webforms
i personally would try webforms so you will know how much better asp.net-mvc is when you start using it

539216
select	union
if you want it in parenttaskid taskid order then select the taskid as parenttaskid and null as taskid in the first union element

539224
put	get
i was thinking that if i could put a list collection into a gridview then perhaps i could get it right back out

539224
constructor	object
perhaps i create a new constructor for my email object which takes a datarow

539227
arrays	loops
i thought about adding the found components to a standalone arrays and then walk through that after this loops to delete them which i think will work..

539260
drawimage	draw
i was able to port large amounts of custom j2me draw code by writing a few shims for drawrect and drawimage

539278
any	set
one issue you may run into which i have just recently run into as well is drawing to the windows with any anti-aliasing flags set

539278
any	set
specifically using drawtext any text that s rendered with anti-aliasing flags set is rendered as though the background were not transparent

539288
firebird	hsqldb
i ve some 1 1 comparisons for sqlite firebird embedded derby and hsqldb others i am missing

539295
textmate	bbedit
although only the trials are free both bbedit and textmate are excellent text editors and reasonably priced

539295
textmate	bbedit
i like textmate a little bit more but i tend to use bbedit as it has better printing capabilities and i often find myself printing hard copies for reference

539326
derived-class	base-class
if you could simply cast your collection to base-class you could then stick something that was of type base-class into it thereby forcing a simple base-class object into a derived-class collection

539346
python	java
take a look at the java swing material essentially you are just using the same api in python syntax

539348
webforms	asp.net
i have an asp.net webforms application in which i m using forms-based authentication with membership and role providers which is fine for authenticating and controlling access to directories and or files

539359
webforms	asp.net
classic asp also uses normal html elements as opposed to asp.net webforms controls

539359
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in these respects it matches asp.net-mvc a lot closer than webforms

539359
webforms	asp.net
if you do not know asp.net webforms or asp.net mvc i would say mvc is the way to go

539359
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you know webforms very well and don t know much about asp.net-mvc i would say webforms is the way to go

539360
subtraction	modulo
you can convert that to hours and remainder by using a combination of modulo and subtraction

539400
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in my opinion now and looking back to my knowledge of asp i would go to webforms instead of asp.net-mvc first it s a language that it s in the market some some yeras now and very used across the world while asp.net-mvc is still in beta so not suitable for production environment says microsoft - even if this site is written in asp.net-mvc

539427
any	set
the trick is to use the local proxy then set the value before you render any templates

539444
observers	listeners
observers observable using listeners

539445
powerpc	arm
can emulate non x86 machines if you are doing powerpc or arm development

539450
emacs	vim
i would also consider trying to learn how to use vim or emacs

539460
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
you can use a static autoresetevent manualresetevent data-members in your application class

539487
variables	boolean
hint 4 in general if you have n boolean state variables and t different events that can be triggered there are t 2 n entries in the matrix of all possible events in all possible conditions

539488
hash	md5
what i need to do is provide a file browser box on a web page where a user selected a file from their computer and through javascript or flash if necessary some sort of hash is returned such as crc md5 or sha1

539488
webserver	upload
i would prefer not to have to upload the entire file to the webserver as i expect some rather large files to be used in this

539495
json	xml
you could store the data as an xml data island or json object

539495
postback	ajax
if you need to persist this data back to the server the end resulting data could be posted via an ajax or standard postback

539497
put	get
what you d also proabably need to do is put it in a namespace and implement the free function operator overloads and rely on adl for it to get picked up

539506
decrement	increment
you can get the implementation of the nonmutating operators for free just by the conversion to _simple_type_ and you would get the assignments and increment decrement by conversion to

539506
decrement	increment
this leaves the assignments and increment decrement - you would just have to implement those

539506
header-only	boost
another possibility is using boost operators - a header-only library that facilitates creation of operator overloads based on algebraic rules

539510
constructor	private
additionally you could benefit from making the constructor private and provide an static factory method for the same reason

539525
value	field
the software collects data about ships currently 174 details for each ship each detail can be a text value a long text value a number of a specified length with or without a specified number of decimal a date a date with time a boolean field a menu with many values a list of data and more

539525
value	field
- description - nvarchar 200 the description of the value the field contains

539525
value	field
- text - nvarchar 500 the field contains the detail s value

539548
stream	send
i wish for the scripting to immediately send the headers to the user as a stream

539561
protected	public
there s no syntactical way of making a methods private public or protected in javascript it strictly relies on where the methods is defined scope

539575
video-player	flv
i have a movie that loads an flv using the video-player class

539578
python	c++
why do some languages like c++ and python require the namespace of an object be specified even when no ambiguity exists

539578
python	c++
i understand that there are backdoors to this like using namespace x in c++ or in python

539584
boost	stl
if you do decide to take a c++ job make sure the shop uses the stl effectively and that they are using boost

539584
boost	stl
not looking at using boost stl but actually using it

539587
contains	any
if you have a piece of code which to the best of your knowledge doesn t contains any bugs there s nowhere to go but downhill

539589
perl	ruby
it s not written in java python ruby perl etc

539590
readfile	fopen
you don t have to use fopen when using readfile

539591
python	c++
i also like to be able to look up to the top of the file and see exactly what names are being imported and where they re coming from i m talking about python of course but the same reasoning could apply for c++

539599
ruby	php
you should also learn python ruby or php and some web frameworks rails symfony django asp.net

539621
python	c++
and if you think that it s obvious in a particular context read in a particular function or .cpp in c++ .py file in python - never in c++ header files you just have to express yourself and say that it should be obvious adding the using namespace instruction or import

539631
filtering	sorting
it depends on what you are filtering sorting on and how the table is indexed

539633
filtering	sorting
also if you do the filtering sorting on the client-side then the records would only have to be retrieved once

539635
shell	bash
short of writing a patch for it try the following shell incantation for bash

539642
webserver	upload
however when i attempt to upload a revised rtf file to the webserver i get an error cannot open the file for writing

539661
include	ssi
in order to improve the maintainability i refactored the pages to use server-side include ssi so that the common content is not duplicates

539705
moss	wss
sounds like a job for the business data catalog moss feature not wss

539736
python	perl
the problem is that for a non-matching string your pattern is a pathological case for a backtracking regular expression engine which is true of those in most scripting languages like perl python and anything based on pcre

539739
http	ssl
you can enable http in your iis config but it won t be secure unless you acquire an ssl certificate and plug it into iis

539769
implements	extends
you could always extends smtpappender to implements the functionality you need

539772
javascript	dom
when a postback occurs i reorder these rows in the dom based on a business rule using a javascript function

539774
altera	fpga
i m attempting to create a generic graphics controllers for vga monitors with an altera fpga via a vga connector but i cannot find any good online resources explaining the standard specification which monitors use

539781
value	field
if input is specified i create the xpath expression dynamically and slot the incoming value in the field

539798
output	cat
are we talking about the output of cat . h c | wc -l or some other mechnanism for instance

539800
include	ssi
ssi just throws the raw bytes in it doesn t attempt to recode the include so that their charsets match the file they re being included into

539804
hash	md5
convert the integers to strings separated by commas and hash the resulting string using a common hashing algorithm md5 sha etc

539816
salt	md5
can i use md5 or sha1 or salt

539823
msbuild	nant
can you have nant or msbuild call a perl or some other scriptinging language scripting to examine the svn repository and do the checkout

539828
hash	md5
md5 sha1 are used to derive hash that are used to verify that data has not been tampered

539833
tuples	set
given a set of tuples classes in an oop language pair triple and quad should triple subclass pair and quad subclass triple

539850
hash	md5
to create a hash value using md5 try

539850
hash	md5
hash md5 string to hash

539857
localization	translation
localization it s easier to translation text than images

539862
compile-time	hardcode
however as you had already discovered before posting this question the problem with is that you need to hardcode the reference it doesn t let you supply a value at runtime because the compiler needs to literally embed the asset at compile-time

539864
updating	updates
when updating a datatable from a selected from sometable i am iterating the columns in the datatable to dynamically create an updates or insert statement based on datatable.rowstate and datatable.primarykey

539898
datamatrix	barcode
can anyone recommend a .net component that can create and read datamatrix barcode

539905
quantifiers	pcre
see the pcre manual under atomicity grouping and possessive quantifiers

539906
contains	any
finally securityservice.asmx contains a login methods to allow the flex application to login without redirecting to the login.aspx page should the cookie expire for any reason

539918
any	set
i can t find anything to set in my environment variables any idea as to how to keep this session across all domains on my domain

539933
.net	wcf
if you host a service in com+ you can access it through wcf in your .net service and through com interfaces in your unmanaged code

539944
gridview	listview
i have a listview gridview that has a list of clients

539956
triggers	insert
as for future inserts correctly extracting the date you re going to have to create a triggers on insert to extract the date for that record

539977
silverlight	wpf
if you use this code in silverlight and wpf you get slightly different results

539982
silverlight	wpf
this is because the default template of the button between wpf and silverlight is different

539984
document	editing
i ve seen at least two recommendations on stackoverflow to insert newlines between sequences when editing latex document

539988
installation	downgrade
downgrade your installation of xampp to the previous version and the bug is fixed

539990
key-value	key
you have to create a new key-value pair with the street address and a new key

539990
key-value	key
instead you have to make a third key-value pair with values of the address book key and the street address key

539992
multiplication	complement
assuming the latter if you operate with unsigned 32-bit integers say on 2 s complement arithmetics multiplication by any odd number is a bijective and reversible mapping

540000
authentication	login
i want to write a sql 2005 script to create a new login that uses windows authentication

540005
constructor	private
thirdly a non-static private method can be called from a constructor of the class also it need not be static

540038
markup	xhtml
and it will be clean xhtml compliant semantic markup instead of thrown together templates with extraneous crud

540045
expression-blend	silverlight
to get design control over your silverlight 2 xaml you need to install expression-blend 2

540045
expression-blend	designer
once open in expression-blend you can drag and drop controls from the toolbox onto the designer

540045
checkbox	button
once the asset library is open a good tip if you can t find the control you are looking for you mention you cannot find the button control in expression-blend 2 is to type it s name in the search area at the top left or click the show all... checkbox as shown above

540045
expression-blend	silverlight
this blog post is a good place to start for a first look at using expression-blend with silverlight 2 with plenty of screenshots

540045
expression-blend	silverlight
there are also some follow up videos to that blog post called introducing blend to silverlight developers and silverlight programming and expression-blend that you can watch

540048
button	popup
could you share the best practices of making the same action bar with standard images and popup button

540087
revision	svn
whenever i try to specify a git svn init like git svn init -t trunk projecta -b branches -t tags the follow-up git svn fetch fails mysteriously on different revision

540087
repository	entity
my current thinking is that i should create a git repository that mirrors the whole subversion repository as a single entity with subdirectories for each project

540114
contains	any
i have developed a tool where you can build the screens from loading up the business-objects and their properties into a database then the user just selected the objects and object properties she wants to display a control can be made up of any number of control groupinging each control grouping can contains any business object property the business-objects are generated from views by my linq orm

540123
haskell	ocaml
edit if you want general information try perusing a bit of haskell or ml family ocaml f# to see how they re used and then form your own decisions

540137
contains	any
note as klaim pointed out you would never in any circumstances want to rely on auto-lookup inside a header file as this would immediately prevent your module from being used at the same time as any module contains a conflicting name

540138
32-bit	64bit
of course none of this has anything to do with the difference between 32-bit and 64bit

540141
basecamp	trello
you really should consider something like trello versionone rally or even basecamp for this

540145
normalize	inverse
performance is inverse to the amount of normalize done on rdbms

540171
tuples	any
any case it pays to have an interface abstract class maybe tuples which all these implement

540188
remote-desktop	rdp
there are a bunch of ways to get a screens capture and then stream it but i m wanting to find out in particular why the rdp remote-desktop terminal services vs

540208
database-normalization	denormalization
database-normalization and denormalization are at the heart of this trade off

540226
value	field
the scripting accepts 3 value initial number field start positioning field length

540227
silverlight	wpf
what the criteria for choosing between wpf silverlight or xna

540261
buffering	streaming
i want to invoke this web service methods using httpwebrequest so that i can streaming the file without buffering in memory

540267
driver	kernel
i m not familiar with kernel driver development so i want to know if there are other easy ways to add a virtual driver like cd emulation in windows explorer

540271
any	set
if f uses any ordered data structure ordered set priority heap etc. that has been properly implemented and the algorithm adds roughly x objects to the data structure the operations are o log x

540297
exception-handling	try-catch
later in class1 since the exception-handling was handled nothing happens in your try-catch block and your second exception-handling is never logged as you expected because it never happened

540303
selected	button
if you click on the drop down that says all you can selected several button states and set them accordingly

540304
selected	checkbox
when i selected the checkbox at run time i need to get those values.

540304
selected	checkbox
but on selected or on click to checkbox it s not finding or value is taking as false.

540316
firefox	safari
although the gradient without the image is only working in firefox and safari

540319
abstract-class	subclassing
this seems like a bad use for enums - why not just go with a base abstract-class with a new subclassing for each operation

540329
ubuntu	debian
get your apache up and running and try do configure it like debian and ubuntu do it eg have directories for loaded modules

540340
stream	send
due to the possibly large amount of objects that may need to be passed back to the server it changes depending on implementation i would prefer not to do these all as individual calls any more rather wrap all the objects in a single serialization or better still compressed stream and send them through as one connection to the server

540347
managed-code	native-code
on a managed os managed-code is going to be native and native-code is going to be...alien

540349
hide	show
using jquery i want to show hide the rollover image when the onmousemove onmouseout event happen

540359
managed-code	native-code
technically a native-code android-emulator can be written in managed-code but it s not running on bare hardware

540364
buffering	streaming
let s assume these problems are cleared and i have some kind of local buffering that holds all the raw bytes from the streaming

540366
selected	textbox
add textbox as child items to the selected node

540373
order	add
note that you don t want to use since if you ever add a column to the table that will break all your old queries that relied on there being a certain number of columns in a certain order

540373
postgresql	mysql
you might like to look at the chapters in the mysql manual and postgresql manual on indexing

540374
click	mouse
click with the mouse should set the data cursor to the point with the closest x value

540383
data-structures	tree
database indices sometimes use disk-based data-structures based on hash tables although balanced tree are more popular

540388
binary-data	chunks
why don t you segment the binary-data and store it in 4k chunks

540391
firefox	safari
actions 1 2 works in in firefox but not in safari and ie 6 7

540393
vb.net	vb6
well the vb.net has some stuff for backward compatibility with vb6 but you can access the moste of it from c# if you add a reference to the right assembly

540396
void	main
in the case of languages with a c-like syntax we declare the main methods to return an int or float value or void

540414
python	java
pure python would be fine since it can be compiled to java with jythonc

540416
managed-code	native-code
of course it is possible to produce verifiable native-code but that puts a lot of limitations and in essence is no different from managed-code

540416
virtual-machine	virtualization
though the managed os might provide a virtualization layer like hyper-v and host the native code in a virtual-machine

540419
void	main
in java the reason main returns void is threads

540427
python	c++
otherwise i m likely to just write a c++ wrapper around the c code that stops python from having to deal with the pointer

540448
target-platform	platform
if you know your app is going to run on only one platform you shouldn t care - you should evaluate the framework using the same criteria as every other framework on your target-platform

540450
web-applications	scalability
i worked for a shop that used coherence to provide scalability and redundancy sort of for it s web-applications

540452
mouseleave	mouseenter
consider using a textblock and adding each word as it s own inline or then either bind to the inline s ismousedirectlyover property our add delegates to the mouseenter mouseleave events

540453
low-level	hardware
sometimes it s impossible to avoid platform-dependent function calls for example because of having to directly communicate with some hardware device at low-level

540468
freebsd	linux
the advantage to have a multiplatform application is that our customers sometimes have knowledge in linux sometimes in solaris sometimes in freebsd .

540486
void	main
the main methods must indeed have a void return-type

540486
execution	exit
it goes on to describe when a program exits in execution - program exit â 12.8

540492
restart	reload
this allows you to reload your application without having to restart the whole viewmodel

540493
rewrite	rule
what do i need to do to the following rewrite rule to make it so it works whether or not their is a slash at the end of the url

540495
nsurlconnection	nsdata
i don t know the internals of apple s code but i would guess nsdata s initwithcontents of url uses nsurlconnection internally

540515
inherited	subclass
however the above breaks when i subclass foo since even tho init is inherited it still returns which contains a pointers to instance of foo

540523
environment	execution
now its this execution environment that determines whether it can allow native code to run without being verified

540523
environment	execution
their only relationship is that the top application is calling the underlying os for low-level tasks but in calling the os its actually being executed by the execution env which may may not support code verification depending on say options passed in compiling the code for example and when control is transferred to the os the execution env again is responsible for execution the os code this environment might be another envionment all together in which case it verifies the os code because its a managed os

540523
environment	execution
it all depends on the behaviour of the execution environment in which its running

540524
javafx	swing
i try to find an open security framework that can be plugged-in to both swing and web applications and javafx

540528
stream	send
the advantage of the daemon is that you can just send the reply back in a compact form in your case as a stream of binary integer value

540538
installation	environment
my problem is that code autocomplete does not work for a classes from base library one that are installed with base python installation and it works without any problem with classes from virtual environment

540543
any	set
this class takes care of starting the operations making sure that they are run in the appropriate order and account for any priorities that you set

540543
nsinvocationoperation	nsoperation
nsinvocationoperation objects can be added to an nsoperationqueue just like nsoperation so that you get multithreading without having to subclass

540544
contains	elements
also as the return value may contains 0 1 2 3 or 4 elements i suggest you to return a list

540550
void	main
the reason for the main methods having void as return-type is that once main finishes it doesn t necessarily mean that the entire program finished

540554
callback	methods
that is a subsequent statement in a callback methods

540563
implements	final
and the final user-interface implements in a chosen programming language

540571
linux	unix
in unix linux

540592
configuration	installation
i believe vs2008 uses the file c program files microsoft visual-studio 9.0 xml schemas dotnetconfiguration.xsd with default installation for validation of the configuration file

540597
shell	bash
this is bash your shell may vary

540602
zipfile	archive
use unzip -l to get file directory lists for both the zip archive and then flatten the hierarchy of the user generated zipfile and compare with the contents of your scripting generated zipfile using some thing like diff

540617
value	field
the result of the test should in my database oracle is there an easy way in testcomplete to check these value multiple field in multiple tables

540645
configuration	environment
ok so i updated the firmware to 2.60 and everything seems to work other than some network stuff but i think that is specific to my environment not this configuration of distro ps3

540678
click	mouse
four mouse click and possible scrolling of the minutes combobox.

540684
directory	folder
i pull of my source from tfs into my vs projects folder and it doesn t take this app long to search all sub directory and it always seems to find what i need

540715
32-bit	64bit
is it possible to successfully author a c++ program in ix operating systems that operates on both 32-bit and 64bit db2 implementations simultaneously

540715
32-bit	64bit
the exact requirement is to read from a 32-bit db2 database and write into a 64bit db2 database

540737
build-system	cmake
i m wondering how i can make a portable build-system step-by-step i currently use cmake because it was easy to set up in the first place with only one arch target but now that i have to package the library i m developing i m wondering how is the best way to make it portable for arch i m testing

540751
.when	ready
my point is .when the code is ready to release the design wiki and quite a bit of documentation would be done

540755
positioning	slider
for example this is code that allows the slider to change the height and top positioning of the element but what is the syntax to control the alpha value in the background attributes of the border

540763
.net	wcf
is it safe to switch a .net 1.1 webservice to a wcf service knowing that not all clients use .net to access the service

540768
automake	gnu
i have been using the gnu autoconf automake toolchain which has worked well for me so far

540768
64bit	x86
i am only really focussed on linux x86 and 64bit and the mac which is important if you are building on a powerpc due to endian issues

540768
autotools	cmake
i am not certain have never tried how well the gnu autotools work on windows so if windows is one of your targets then you may be better off finding similar functionality with your existing cmake build system

540770
silverlight	wpf
i would look at it being reasonable for the silverlight parser to fall back to the wpf silverlight parsing by default

540770
silverlight	wpf
you would get errors if you used wf xaml or even wpf xaml not supported by silverlight parser

540770
silverlight	wpf
xaml is a language supported currently by wpf silverlight which uses a subset of wpf and wf and a little bit in wcf

540770
silverlight	wpf
wpf wf and wcf will all be using that parser and would guess that silverlight in the future will use it

540773
silverlight	wpf
this code works in wpf but not in silverlight

540775
python	perl
you can use perl s archive zip or python zipfile to extract the filenames sizes and crc checksums of the files in the archives

540775
contains	sorted
create a file which contains the results sorted by file name ignore the path

540784
bazaar	git
it isn t clear to me how to support this work flow well with git or mercurial or bazaar

540785
attributes	properties
if you only care about componentmodel not direct reflection there is a way of suggesting attributes from an existing type to avoid duplication but it is only valid for properties and indexer usage

540842
ubuntu	debian
which works on at least debian and ubuntu and since it s lsb it should surely be on most of the other mainstream distros at least

540846
http	ssl
recently i ve set up the clearcase remote client an eclipse plugin to work through ssl so instead of an http url it follows an https url

540847
git-repo	repo
for what i ve seen you can use git between repository retrieve with git-svn so you could have a git public repository which would be the mirror of the svn repo you re talking about but the git-repo could be hosted in you site

540847
push	pull
thus checkout clone push pull for git users will be fast

540847
git-repo	repo
then i guess you can add hooks to your git-repo to sync with the svn repo via git-svn but you ll have to deal with conflict until you use different branches

540849
base-class	inherited
however if you really want to use inherited you need to tell the base-class what are the sub types by using knowntype attributes and its methods

540861
json	xml
you could make soap xml or even json coexist for your wcf services this way you still support the existing protocols

540863
contains	elements
i m not sure this is possible so i would suggest using a hidden div to contains the input elements which can be shown as needed

540889
.when	ready
the problem is .when i try and restore this backup i get the message the log or differential backup cannot be restored because no files are ready to rollforward.

540907
vmware	esx
i have a vmware esx server

540923
any	set
the machine.config file can be set to not allow overriding which means that any changes specified in web.config files will not override these settings

540928
windows-xp	windows
for example is windows-xp a different platform than xp 64 or vista or windows 7

540952
return-value	arguments
in fact just about every arguments and return-value is an integer

540954
expression-blend	wpf
i ve tried snooping expression-blend a wpf app and other wpf apps too

540970
integer	zero
i believe that local integer variables are not initialized to zero in delphi

540974
easymock	jmock
use mocks easymock is one of the best mock frameworks or you could use jmock if you like the name better

540975
right-to-left	hebrew
presumably your users don t have hebrew selected as the system default code page otherwise you could just use the native vb6 controls bearing in mind that hebrew is right-to-left obviously

540977
detailsview	gridview
and changed autogeneratecolumns to false in gridview and autogeneraterows to false detailsview

541024
sql-server	postgresql
i have an existing asp.net app which is configured to connect to a ms sql-server database and i am trying to modify it to use a postgresql database instead

541031
required	checked
so if checked is not required

541034
easymock	junit
once you have small components it s pretty easy to test them with junit easymock or any other standard test utilities

541054
directory	folder
at work we use codeigniter as a php framework for our web-applications and have created a new project templates which does exactly that simple directory structure blueprint css jquery and the codeigniter application folder filled with a couple of commonly used libraries authentication some speciales models for often used databases...

541075
constructor	object
for example you can create prettified form with automatic labeling and css styles and everything and just by changing it s dao object in the component s constructor it s completely reusable in another project

541089
datagrid	listbox
what i did was to create an attached property synchronizedselecteditems that you can set on the listbox or datagrid in fact

541097
instances	destroy
to work around this check is_open right after close ing and if it returns true destroy whole instances of boost-asio serial_port and create it again

541109
.when	ready
normally you should get an exception-handling of type boost systemd systemd_error .when read_some cannot ready anymore

541110
failover	san
note that storage back ends raid arrays san can deliver data at a very high rate so you often can get away with one storage systemd for several video servers one storage systemd per n video servers and 1 load balancer or two if you want failover

541115
contains	lookup
so the question is how to implement get_db_prep_lookup to perform string-based lookup types like contains regex startswith endswith

541127

any decent text editor has one notepad++ kwrite not to mention emacs

541144
exception-handling	error-handling
look into exception-handling and error-handling in the php manual

it s pointless to test your private and protected methods since those will be consumed by public methods that you should test in your subclasses

541147
base-class	superclass
create test superclass for your unit tests that exercises the base-class methods

541147
superclass	subclass
whenever you re testing a subclass of your base class have your test class inherit from your test superclass

541166
pixels	line
3 pixels empty 3 pixels with color -- dashed line

541177
display	width
i want to know how to be able to change column width in the gridview when it is being display in the web browser

541179
gethashcode	equals
you should override the equals and gethashcode methods in order to implement your own equality comparission

541179
gethashcode	equals
as you have pointed out they have to be same type cause if not it would fail on compile-time but i would insist that it might be convenient to implement your own equals and gethashcode functions

541179
gethashcode	equals
that s because .net internally uses gethashcode and equals methods from object

541203
put	get
if i try to add a user to that grouping i get the access denied page but the user is not put in the grouping

541205
hide	show
i need to produce letters that hide and show sections paragraphs based on formulae but the users want to be able to edit the text

541235
exception-handling	try-catch
the exception-handling that occurs is not caught by the standard c++ try-catch block nor by any seh translator function set by _set_se_translator

541258
tripledes	aes
in that case use any decent symmetrical encryption algorithm you can such as tripledes or aes or blowfish

541264
gzip	zip
this example illustrates how gzip zip and bzip2 archive formats can be supported

541268
constructor	object
constructor is a regular property of the prototype object with the dontenum flag set so it doesn t show up in for..in loops

541268
constructor	object
if you replace the prototype object the constructor property will be replaced as well - see this explanation for further details

541268
constructor	object
andrey fedorov raised the question why new doesn t assign the constructor property to the instance object instead

541268
constructor	object
all object created from the same constructor function share the constructor property and shared properties reside in the prototype

541270
contains	elements
consider using a manifest instead that contains the clrclass elements

541271
base-class	inherited
one approach that i took when binding domain objects to ddl controls is to inherited from a base-class that has an overload in the constr to allow for a text value only subset of the original

541278
subtract	add
datetime.today holds today s date from which you can subtract 1 day add -1 days to become yesterday

541299

541337
silverlight	wpf
this msdn documentation article is quite succinct on the specifics of the wpf functionality that silverlight does and doesn t currently provide

541344
erlang	python
i am quite excited by the possibility of using languages which have parallelism concurrency built in such as stackless python and erlang and have a firm belief that we ll all have to move in that direction before too long - or will want to because it will be a good easy way to get to scalability and performance

541349
hide	show
yes the entity-framework hide foreign key id properties and show navigation-properties instead

541358
constructor	object
i m not sure why the constructor property isn t just set on an object when you use new

541363
put	get
to do that you have to associate each key with a set of values with corresponding logic to create the set and enter remove values from it instead of simple put and get on the map

541417
xsl-fo	xslt
typically xsl-fo is generated using xslt and then the transformation result is passed to a formatting objects processor such as fop

541417
xsl-fo	xslt
in some cases xslt at least not 1.0 is not enough if your xsl-fo document is very complex

541417
xsl-fo	xslt
in some cases maybe xslt is not right for the job you could then consider using code to generate xsl-fo

541423
internet-explorer	firefox
i tried internet-explorer and firefox same problem

541450
value	field
meta-variables with names beginning with http_ contains value read from the client request header field if the protocol used is http

541454
put	get
now that the level of indent becomes meaningful you no longer have to rely on balancing parenthesis to get that information and since it s more compact to put them on the same line as the closing statement that s what lispers do

541454
convention	standards
granted it s not required that lisp code be formatted this way but it s a fairly standards convention that people use and can rely on

541460
contains	elements
selector is not a string it is a jquery object which contains all elements that plugins understands as this

541472
arrays	loops
when i loops through and print them off using a while loops and mysql fetch arrays the result looks exactly like it does above

541482
command-line	cmd
the only editor was a simple command-line interface which treated everything starting with a number being part of a program and everything else as cmd to be executed immediately

541498
driver	kernel
you will have to install a driver or kernel plugins in order to get this information

541500
implements	extends
i m not an expert but i can think of one reason to implements runnable instead of extends thread java only supports single inherited so you can only extends one class

541506
implements	extends
in practical terms it means you can implements runnable and extends from another class as well

541511
installation	uninstall
publish your installation by grouping policy to do so you only need an msi version of the program and you have to have access to grouping policy management console when you do so you only have to add new entry under the software installation menu i forgot the exact name of the option you can also uninstall it later the same way you installed it

541517
udp	tcp
specifically what are some good tools for viewing data and not tcp udp header information

541548

space	input
the following regular expression works if there is no space character but if the input has a space character it doesn t work it seems like a link but javascript doesn t work

541591
digits	zero
in the general case use a varchar column and format all numbers to five or more digits with leading zero spaces right-align

541609
push	pull
then every time it was called it would check what state it was in and process i o accordingly push bits onto output pins pull up a line etc

541640
stateless	stateful
what you want is to open a session with the client stateful soap instead of stateless

541682
triggers	insert
perhaps drop indexes and triggers before doing the insert recreate afterwards

541683
proximity	distance
it takes me milliseconds maybe your approach is wrong take a look here sql-server zipcode latitude-longitude proximity distance search 2000 2005 versioning

541703
webforms	asp.net
i have on request from a client built a huge site with asp.net webforms

541703
webforms	asp.net
the problem is that i m finding asp.net webforms to be somewhat unintuitive my personal taste only

541703
webforms	asp.net
so what i m asking is can i use asp.net mvc and webforms at the same time and gradually use mvc more and more

541705
defined	declare
in the c programming language it is my understanding that variabless can only be defined at the beginning of a code block and the variables will have the scope of the block it was declare in

541740
order	add
could you not add a order by directly to the mapping of the collection

541758
checkbox	button
most annoyingly if i open the generated document in word 2003 right click on the image open the format picture dialog and go to the size tab it display the correct height and width under original size. it even provides a reset button that resizes the image to its original size assuming the relative to original picture size checkbox is checked.

541793
contains	elements
each item is then placed into its appropriate column meaning some columns might be empty and certainly the columns do not all contains the same number of elements or rather the last n elements in each column are empty apart from the column that has the most elements

541794
.when	ready
it started using it on my own pc then moved it to the company s vmware server .when they had it ready

541831
order	add
the format of the data is as below i ve had to add extra carriage returns in order for it to display across multiple lines.

541866
itemtemplate	textblock
the listbox uses an itemtemplate that is a stackpanel with a radio-button and a textblock

541866
background-color	transparency
so far i have been able to prevent the background-color of the item from changing when the item is selected by using a style that sets it s background to transparency

541866
radio-button	selected
basically the selection mode of the listbox is single and when an item is selected i only want it to be reflected by the radio-button

541866
background-color	transparency
at the moment i have the background-color being set to transparency when the item is selected

541879
arrays	loops
when you call the selected selector that is going loops through all the select elements decendents looking for the .selected property to be set and will return an arrays of any

541909
value	field
i have a combobox that will display the hostname of all the saved connections when the user selected a hostname it will populate the other field on the form with their respective value

541927
arrays	loops
i would put the repeated elements in arrays and then loops over them

541956
button	popup
i want this modal popup to appear again on the page_load allowing the user to enter new data without clicking again on the button who show this modal popup

541956
button	popup
the modal is showing up on the page load like i want but the problem is if i click on any other button on my page the modal popup is also appearing again

541956
button	popup
example i have another modal popup for deleting data when i click on the button both modal are appearing which is not cool

541959
arrays	loops
you can also create arrays of foo and bar and you can loops and call the method to get the string

541978
virtualization	vmware
as a general answer vmware together with other virtualization vendors in the spec virtualization sub-committee has put together a hypervisor benchmarking suite called vmmark that is available for download

541983
data-access	nhibernate
data-access is done using the wilson o r mapper we re migrating to nhibernate this summer

542010
dictionary	hashmap
you can use a dictionary or hashmap if you are coding in java it s called table driven development by steve mcconnell

542015
ref	out
it should be noted that if you called messagebox instead of throwing the exception-handling you would have the problem of having to actually return something and set all out ref parameters as well which would have been additional overhead

542018
data-dumper	xml-simple
one thing i often do is to dump the structure that xml-simple returns using data-dumper to see what it looks like if it will always look the same

542075
for-loop	loops
a for-loops is merely a nice convention - a for-loops is easily decomposed as a while loops

542106
click	mouse
right mouse click â menu â delete

542106
click	mouse
shift + right mouse click â menu â delete

542139
while-loop	loops
another loops method would be to do something like this in a while-loops

542184
linux	unix
if you have unix linux available you might also look into tcpdump

542189
http	ssl
also this example does not work properly over an http ssl connection tcp 443 by default because the telnet client cannot negotiate the necessary encryption commands to establish the ssl session

542189
http	ssl
although an initial connection is possible over the http ssl port no data is returned when you issue a get request.

542192
processor	affinity
has not a got processor affinity set

542202
contains	set
an arrays is usually not the best way to contains a set of related values in c++

542234
swing	awt
which java framework awt or swing makes more sense for something this simple

542237
rewrite	rule
then all you need is one simple rewrite rule to elide the â .phpâ

542239
oracle	mysql
i m from the mysql world but was trained on oracle i think this will work

542248
background-image	height
one way you could achieve this effect is to use a single pixel background-image tiled horizontally at 50 of the height of the div

542252
swing	swt
use swing or swt since awt has no tabs built in

542252
look-and-feel	nimbus
starting with java 6 update 10 swing got an entirely new look-and-feel the nimbus look-and-feel

542257
http	ssl
the telnet client is not going to know to send a properly constructed request to initiate an http handshake so i imagine the ssl secured server is just waiting for more data

542272
packets	ping
if so try to ping it continuously with t and see if all packets arrive

542274
constructor	object
use the constructor for a regexp object to dynamically create a regex

542280
updatepanel	web-parts
i can only assume its because i have my web-parts - usercontrol wrapped in a panel used for scrolling and also an updatepanel which i use to refresh so how do i get it to see the usercontrol

542285
any	set
the manager could pickle the set of actions at any point and allow

542286
value	field
every bit of information to be display in the user-interface should have a corresponding field or property in the viewmodel although they may be retrieved or derived from value in the model

542304
dictionary	arrays
into an arrays hastable dictionary other like this

542308
postback	ajax
the above is asp.net ajax you will have to parse and determine if the postback is coming from a updatepanel s update

542310
forms-authentication	security
you might want to look at implementing forms-authentication with role-based security

542312
denied	temp
system.unauthorizedaccessexception access to the temp directory is denied

542326
xsd	xml
you use a command line tool called xsd.exe to turn an xml sample into an xsd schema file tip make sure your nodelist has more than one node in the sample and then use it again on the schema to turn that into a c# class file you can load into your project and easily use with the system.xml.serialization.xmlserializer class

542329
google-chrome	firefox
this works in the three browsers i use for testing ie firefox and google-chrome

542332
traveling-salesman	np-complete
if the time between points depends on distance as well as backpack weight then it s np-complete because it s part of the traveling-salesman problem

it contains most of the important actions that the database does as well as any important errors that occur

542358
instances	private
private static readonly examdtoregistry instances

datagridview	treeview
i d rather not have to build my own treeview datagridview or whatever

542379
triggers	insert
i need to write insert update and delete triggers that will execute when this replilcation occurs

542379
triggers	insert
will a triggers designed to run when a simple sql insert statement is executed also run when replication occurs

542381
one-to-many	entity
i have jpa entity object a with a one-to-many owning relationship object b in an arraylist

542387
swing	awt
swing is your best choice if you re stuck choosing between swing and awt

542404
.net	wcf
while i haven t done it with a 1.1 web service i was able to refactor a .net 2.0 webservice into a wcf service then just expose it with basichttpbinding

542409
32-bit	64bit
i really see no reason to run 32-bit unless you plan to use some component that don t support 64bit such as wse 2.0

542409
windows-xp	windows
so vista 64 bit is probably the best choice or xp windows-xp x64 if you run windows server 2003 and want to play safe

542418
internet-explorer	firefox
however i sometimes and it seems random the bigger files fail to download internet-explorer and firefox claim the download was successful but the size of the file is smaller than expected and it is not usable

542419
order	join
i have two tables involved in this query i need to create and i m not exactly sure how to join these two tables in order to update

542429
logout	login
when a user with admin rights hits the logout button and the return url to a restricted page is passed to login.aspx then another user without admin rights try s to login they get redirected back to the login page

542429
logout	login
because this application is already in production i cannot alter the page flow of the login logout timeout process or rename the login page

542437
order	add
the publisher s sql-server platform would need to have administrative changes made to it in order to add your sql-server instance as a subscriber so it is quite unlikely you will find what you are looking for

542442
swing	awt
awt was the first java gui framework it had a lot of flaws and was abandoned in favor of swing

542443
publishing	release
i think you also lack the ability to publishing a site without visual-studio you can certainly run a website but it won t build the binaries for release with web developer you have to publishing the source to iis

542446
googletest	gmock
gmock which only works with googletest

542479
versioning	migrate
does it make sense to migrate all historical versioning branches

542509
contains	set
doing fast substring lookup using suffix arrays which contains all the suffixes of the set of searchable strings in lexiographic ordering i wanted to conserve memory and keep the implementation simple

542518
contains	elements
thus key ksimpleenvalues someid is the nodeset contains all enumvalue elements following the enumvalue that has its generate-id equal to someid and all these enumvalue elements are preceding the next enumvalue with a data attributes if such exists

542524
any	set
the result set of the selected is determined before any inserting takes place so there is no conflict

542525
sql-like	between
what are the difference between the classic transaction pattern in linq to sql-like

542537
jquery	.post
i have been starting to use json and jquery to .post complex types to a controller action using json.net and a jsonfilter on the server side which automatically takes your json object and serializes it to the equivalent c# type

542550
perl	php
most people would do this through a server side programming language library like php s pdo or perl dbi

542550
arrays	loops
for instance in the above query i could prepare the statement once and then loops over creating the data arrays from a bunch of data and repeat the - execute as many times as needed

542554
convention	standards
if you have a language-independent shop standards naming convention here use it

542584
webserver	security
if you are running the test from a file instead of testing it on a webserver it might be because security settings

542585
constructor	object
the subclasses cannot automatically inherit init so that init would still call the subclass constructor because init is not a virtual method and is called without an object

542599
32-bit	64bit
it currently only supports 32-bit application development but the application itself will run on 64bit windows

542613
rollback	commit
i believe they are fundamentally the same that the transactionscope class will interface with the ado.net underlying connection to create and either commit or rollback the transaction

542638
any	set
since the base class would require that any implementation set this value anyways i think it is best to change the interface to include it

542641
event-viewer	log4net
also you can configure log4net to do almost anything you want text files rolling text files log to database event-viewer etc

542660
np-complete	np-hard
in other words the carrying costs just made our tsp harder so it is still np-hard and can be used to solve any np-complete problem but it did not make it hard enough that we cannot quickly check a proposed solution to the decision problem does this tour cost less than c

542660
knapsack-problem	np-complete
the np-complete decision versioning of the knapsack-problem is independent and can be solved sequentially with the tsp problem

542661
windows-mobile	windows-ce
your question talks about tablet pc which is really just xp and therefore the cf really isn t relevant but for the sake of the question subject itself we can still talk about maintaining code used by the cf and the ffx assuming you actually meant windows-mobile or windows-ce

542733
alt	src
img src offer.png alt

542795
value	field
my own person preference is to disallow null s in date-type field and always use a high value for something like an end date

542808
button	popup
did you tried to bind an onclickclient javascript function to the button who close the modal popup to manually call a postback to the server

542853
rewrite	rule
however the below rewrite rule is ignore for some reason

542864
required	checked
sql s behavior when processing nulls will required more code for more checked

542878
order	add
in order to indicate to google wt that the site of google adsense can be trusted you need to add a regex matching url to the -whitelist command-line argument

542879
webserver	upload
once you upload it to a webserver it will work smoothly

542893
increment	reset
you could change the figure formatting environment to increment a custom counter then make the paragraph code set a conditional indent only if counter equals 1 and subsequently make it reset the counter

542898
contains	any
source contains any comps notes documents specifications etc

542898
shadowbox	jquery
vendor all 3rd party code jquery shadowbox etc.

sql-server	oracle
i have a problem writing a sql statement for both oracle and ms sql-server

542910
stripes	guice
here s an article on integrating guice with stripes

542926
configuration	installation
sometimes when you do an apt-get install on a package it asks you configuration questions during the installation

542929
curly-braces	parentheses
since python code doesn t have curly-braces to highlight we ll have to choose something else perhaps other parentheses

542929
python	c++
i m using python to generate c++ code a language that likes parentheses and semicolons

542934
declarative	imperative
it then goes on to express that functional languages because they are not imperative are declarative by their very nature

542950
animation	rotation
you can but you will need to split your animation into half-circle rotation

542951
haskell	erlang
yes haskell erlang etc

542968
contains	elements
thus leaving your masterpage to strictly contains design elements

542978
sql-server	oracle
you could write an oracle function named right which is doing the same like the sql-server one and then use it in your sql

542978
sql-server	oracle
then you would need to map the according sql-server functions to oracle

542991
simulink	matlab
matlab and simulink are good examples of this

542992
ubuntu	debian
for instance if you re on debian ubuntu you can install a ming win32 cross-compiler by doing

is it possible to set up a mysql triggers that fires back the id number of that record when ever there is an insert into the database and how do i capture that using php

543011
radio-button	button
in order to get your radio button to populate you need to persist back something like viewdata providertype 3 to have the radio-button repopulate with its data

543017
ndepend	ncover
i seem to recall ndepend being able to compare with data from earlier builds so it looks like the combinations of ndepend and ncover might do the trick

543022
contains	any
in the i m here it contains the ip-address of the running application so that any clients could connect to it via a tcp connection for further data updates that had to be delivered

543027
puts	gets
the trick in get_values starts with the top-level reference gets the next low-level and puts it in the same variables

543029
dictionary	map
basically no you will at least need to have a dictionary or function to map operator characters to their implementations

543042
thickbox	jquery
for crud operations i use jquery thickbox modal pop up and iframe

543049
document	element
my xml document has a default namespace defined in the root element

543054
triggers	insert
unless i don t fully understand your question you don t need a triggers for this - just use the last insert id functionality of your database driver

543061
methodology	waterfall
the biggest problem with the waterfall methodology is that requirements change

543061
methodology	waterfall
once the requirements are frozen beyond thawing which never happens in software designed for human use waterfall is a very efficient methodology

543088
constructor	object
it s generally not a good idea to force creation of object using shared_ptr by hiding the constructor

543089
javascript	dom
asynchronous javascript server callbacks with dom manipulation

543098
triggers	insert
however if you need to use the new insert id in a triggers use new. identity_column_name as follows

543105
filtering	grouping
the situation is this i want one user grouping to have one filtering as default on blogs while another grouping - another filtering without having an effect on filtering defaults for other content types

543110
implements	abstract
card games especially because they generally have simple rule sets to implements but are sufficiently complex from an abstract point of view

543116
base-class	inherited
a base-class sounds reasonable to me so people can inherited it and override certain calls as well can keep the default functionality or can use some internal helper functions

543131
selected	listbox
when i scroll down and selected an item it scrolls back to the top of the listbox

543134
implements	abstract
if a certain type of plugins likely shares certain functionality make an abstract base-class that implements the interface

543140
python	c++
when using a multi-paradigm language such as python c++ d or ruby how much do you mix paradigms within a single application

543156
assign	add
each time you move along an edge you have to keep track of current time add up the transit time and if you arrive at a vector you have to assign infinite cost to any buses that are prior to your current time

543232
webforms	asp.net
i m in the process of buidling a few asp.net webforms that need to support approvals

543244
selected	listbox
google-chrome after postback the selected item might be hidden since the listbox scrolls to the top as you say

543258
stderr	stdout
if you want the actual traceback sent over you need to create a socket channel for both stderr stdin and stdout which goes over the network instead of printing to your local host

543277
background-color	border-color
i would prefer that the tooltip track along with the mouse s movement over the link and that the tooltip s appearace background-color opacity border-color etc. be configurable

543283
nspopupbutton	nsmenu
to the left main-window with a nspopupbutton under the nsmenu

543290
base-class	inherited
the most basic difference in this context are that by providing an abstract base-class you provide an inherited point for custom plugins written either by you or other developers and ensure that certain methods properties provide default behavior and force the derived classes to implement certain required methods properties

543290
protected	public
you also cannot specify anything other than public members in an interface while an abstract-class can have abstract or virtual non-public members typically protected

543300
keydown	keyup
you could trap the enter key in keydown keyup keypressed

543327
put	get
the reality is that if you make data hard to get to in the database developers will use other techniques to not put the data in the database or perverting the database

543327
environment	building
make sure that the stored-procedures end up in source control and that deployment of stored-procedures to the appropriate database environment can be performed automatically by the building tool continuous or daily .

543349
triggers	insert
i ve had a setup in sql-server where we would use views to access our data which would handle insert updates and deletes with instead of triggers

543361
stderr	stdout
including stdin stdout and stderr

543379
textmate	vim
i d like to know how people deal with this in other editors including vim texshop textmate and any others you think would be useful to collect here

543387
export	csv
i am using a macros to export a table in a microsoft access database to a csv file in order to import into a mysql database

543392
order	add
they couldn t possibly afford to pay for a visual-studio sized development team in order to add all the bells and whistles to the ide which isn t even their product

543421
revision	svn
they even use some of the svn commands to get things like the revision number and what not for auto generating the assymbly info files

543448
children	nodes
it doesn t allow for an unlimited hierarchy max 10 levels max 1000 children per parent nodes - if i d started the orderby at 0 but more than enough for my needs

543471
rollback	commit
it s only setting up for a commit rollback scenario on any rows added to tables

543479
groovy	java
using groovy s package name convention i can intercept groovy method calls to a java method like so

543520
getter	setter
it also depends on what standard is used in your organization in your application or even on what language you are using if you use a language with getter and setter you can more easily replace member variables at a later time for example

543546
javascript	dom
otherwise you re stuck with traversing the dom in javascript

543555
constructor	private
my approach if it has any private data a constructor destructor or any complex member functions which do more than just conversion upon set get etc. use class

543566
actionscript	mxml
flex is an mixed open-source proprietary framework + compiler by adobe written in actionscript and an xml based declarative language called mxml used to construct user interfaces in a declarative style

543575
csc	vbc
if you open the configuration file for nant you can see where it expects the .net versioning to be go check to make sure it s there and that you can see hte compiler methods csc vbc etc

543577
enterprise	platform
flex originally was designed to bring enterprise programmers to the flash platform

543580
where-clause	sql
when using sql are there any benefits of using in a where-clause instead of like

543581
actionscript	mxml
flex is many things but in short flex is a technology that combines mxml and actionscript and allows you to quickly build rich internet applications for the flash player

543581
actionscript	mxml
good to know is that mxml is compiled down to actionscript so it is perfectly possible to write everything in actionscript and avoid mxml although i wouldn t recommend that in most cases

543582
host	root
if you want to do this all within the same windows you could use a grid as the root element and host a login element possibly another grid for layout and the chat windows

543582
hide	show
you d attach a handler for the log in button s click event that would hide it and show the _chatform instead

543591
gethashcode	equals
equals and gethashcode for anonymous

543605
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux and you

543608
cosine	sine
remember that the affine transformation is a matrix and that a rotation matrix contains the sine and cosine numbers precomputed

543608
cos	sin
now let s review some sample value for cos and sin

543608
cosine	sine
remember the matrix doesn t contains the angle -- it only containss the cosine and sine

543608
cos	sin
note that calculator.app gives wrong results for cos xï and sin xï

543643
sftp	ftp
the site editing is very easy for anyone to use but a bit slllllooooowwww and somewhat clumsy and doesn t appear to play nicely with the concept of uploading downloading via ftp sftp etc

543647
gethashcode	equals
if they are not value types then the type needs provide it s own equals and gethashcode implementations for it to work

543660
associations	model
when i create these in visual-studio s entity model and place an associations between them i get a associations is not mapped error

543689
any	set
in all the projects i ve worked on you always need to set the references to include any dll s whether they are from .net 3rd party or your own ie project references otherwise they won t link in properly

543693
versioning	upgrade
to versioning simply deploy the solutions as an upgrade and use powershell to update in your apps as appropriate if you update your versioning number

543693
versioning	upgrade
in a recent upgrade i had to versioning two web parts and then used powershell to loop through all 1 500 my sites removing the old web parts and adding back in the new ones

543695
msbuild	nant
with nant you will have to use the exec command to shell out to msbuild for the solution files

543709
xsd	xml
is there a way to generate ruby classes maybe even activeresource classes from an xsd so that they contain a way to serialize the classes to xml valid for the initial xsd

543714
put	get
since you re opening up a new windows this is about as efficient as you re going to get unless you want to put it into a function to shorten it for typing purposes

543730
background-color	width
and then also set other relevant attributes like the width height background-color etc for that

543748
pointers	stack
similarly if you have a pointers on stack

543748
pointers	stack
so every stack frame has to have some sort of map saying what is a pointers and what isn t and before you do any gc traversing you have to get any pointerss out into memory

543748
pointers	stack
the obvious way is to never hold pointers on the cpu stack or in registers

543753
functional-programming	imperative-programming
where imperative-programming will typically update variables functional-programming will define new read-only values

543772
auctex	latex
the references to latex are for auctex support

543780
attributes	properties
either that or if you can add the datacontract attributes to the type and the data-members attributes to only the properties you wish to send over the wire

543783
processor	cpu
on a machine with a load less than 1 per core your desktop machine when you re not doing much of anything a cpu bound process will consistently have more that 50 of a processor often more than 90

543787
account	userid
i d create an account table with a userid with common information between the two stored there and which type of account it is

543787
account	userid
then a companies table with company specific information using the same userid as the account and i dunno a users table with information specific to users

543800
arrays	map
an arrays in php is actually an ordered map

543800
dictionary	arrays
it can be treated as an arrays list vector hash table an implementation of a map dictionary collection stack queue and probably more

543820
environment	execution
long answer if you re eval ing untrusted code that really wants to read or mess with your execution environment you re screwed

543830
any	set
does anyone have any idea how to set the user agent string for an httprequest object

543834
any	set
this is usually only encountered when the file needs to be locked in order to write to it but i m pretty sure it will mark any read only file with the grey checkmark not just ones that have svn needs-lock set on it

543850
background-image	width
if you use the same width for each tab depending on longest text in it then you can even use a single gif background-image

543870
children	tree
its simpler if you use jquery otherwise you will have to start from document body get its children parsing their ids selected matching elements and continue down the tree

543873
keydown	keyup
rather than trying to stack up the animation you could start an animation on keydown and if at the end of the animation you haven t yet received keyup then start another animation

543878
having	select
select key value from table grouping by key value having count x

543878
case-when	subquery
the left join will ensure you list all keys the subquery will only return values for the case-when the count of the grouping is equal to the number of keys

543947
asp.net-mvc	webforms
my criteria is it has to work in .net for a client winforms or wpf app and a web app asp.net-mvc or webforms

543962
google-chrome	firefox
works in ie8+ webkit google-chrome safari seems will work in next opera and firefox

543963
safari	opera
usually ie6 vs everyone else with safari and opera adding their salt

543965
google-chrome	firefox
works on firefox ie google-chrome safari and opera

543973
versioning	upgrade
have you updated the versioning number and configured the upgrade

544014
entity-framework	data-access
so in your wcf service layer you make will your calls to your data-access layer entity-framework which retrieves user objects and you should return to your consumer objects constructed with only what you want to expose

544015
aggregate-functions	sum
but for other aggregate-functions such as count sum and avg the distinct option may affect the result

544049
wicket	spring
an application i integrate with is moving from spring to wicket

544049
wicket	spring
it seems to me that changing your entire framework would be some work so i wonder if wicket offers something that spring does not

544054
sql-server	ms-access
one simple reason to use sql-server instead of a microsoft access database the ms-access db can result in a bottleneck if the db will be used heavily by a lot of users

544062
default	reset
here s an example of a reset rule taht does nt break the default properties of form elements

544062
margins	padding
don t clear margins and padding on everything it s much safer to clear what you need to and leave the browser defaults elsewhere

544065
actionscript	mxml
this framework allows you to use a markup language called mxml to define structure similar to html and a scripting language called actionscript to define behavior similar to javascript

544068
reliability	scalability
not to mention scalability and reliability issues

544071
htmlspecialchars	echo
and since i htmlspecialchars the text and i also get a for a â from browser i echo back an which gets displayed as in a browser

544085
any	bag
for instance say at any time there s 5000 humans hitting the page a few times a minute looking for the bag of crap and 50 bots slamming it every second

544085
integer	modulus
so you could add a condition that the crap appears first to any users where the modulus 30 of their integer ip is a random number say 17

544103
constructor	object
if you created the object via constructor calls you need to make calls to free to free them

544116
declarative	imperative
sql is declarative rather than imperative your query is a description of the criteria that your results must meet it is not step-by-step instructions on how to generate those results

544122
wicket	spring
spring is more all-encompassing than wicket

544159
value	field
so i m using asp.net-mvc rc1 and using the defaultmodelbinder s validation to show validation errors when not-null integer field are not set to a value

544162
datagridview	treeview
something like datagridview and treeview into a single control

544165
constructor	object
if you assigned an element s value by calling the constructor of a class then free the object referenced by that element

544183
google-chrome	firefox
are fat-clients coming back with the new versions of ie firefox safari and google-chrome

544183
concurrent-programming	plinq
within iis and the .net that it uses how do things like plinq help use parallel or concurrent-programming to help speed up handling requests

544183
oracle	mysql
how does the latest ms-sql server or oracle or mysql handle using the additional resources of both multi-core and multi-socket if a quad-socket motherboard has quad core cpus in each socket and something like hyperthreading on top there are 32 threads that could run at once which is really different than a single core cpu back in the days

544223
children	nodes
one technique i have seen when performing a large number of dom manipulations all at once is to get a list of the body element s children remove them perform your manipulations wherever they fall in the document tree and then reappend the body s child nodes

544232
show	next
to show that the item cannot be dragged into the tilelist i would like to show the normal white cross in red circle icon next to the cursor

544232
message	alert
if a drop is attempted when it has been determined that drop should not occur i would like to show an alert message explaining why this item could not be dropped

544276
rewrite	rule
i m trying to set up a simple rewrite rule to convert a url such as

544332
32-bit	64bit
check this msdn link on migrating 32-bit managed code to 64bit

544356
negative-number	integer
0x8000000 is a negative-number as a log or 32-bit integer

544382
python	java
i find c# s attributes python properties too a really nice idea and i guess their direct ancestor might have come from java s annotations but i m curious as to where this concept originally came from anyone has any clues

544404
iframe	popup
when they hover over a selection an iframe popup becomes visible displaying some data

544416
cursor	row
if someone can re-write this with mrtelly s faster id addition which wouldn t require building sql from a cursor for each updated row then i ll mark that as the accepted answer

544437
32-bit	64bit
32-bit programs will run fine on 64bit windows

544437
32-bit	64bit
a pointer is 64bit wide while an int is 32-bit

544437
32-bit	64bit
if you need to communicate between a 32-bit process and a 64bit process you will need some of the many different ways of ipc on windows

544437
32-bit	64bit
the system directories on 64bit windows are different than on 32-bit windows

544439
javascript	dom
ajax is when a page makes a http request to the server and can also return data which is then used with javascript to update the dom

544441
put	get
when you put the information in the address bar that is not the post methods that is the get methods

544441
put	get
when you put the address in the browser it is using a get

544463
binary	hex
such a person might jailbreak their phone get access to the binary run strings or a hex editor and poke around

544466
cryptography	security
security or cryptography

544493
postgresql	mysql
very simple question i hope does there exist a tool similar to phpmyadmin when working with a mysql db but for postgresql databases

544493
postgresql	mysql
the reason i m not just googling for a solution is that i am not as familiar with postgresql as i am with mysql and i was hoping that the so community would be able to provide a tool that you have experience working with

544523
http-method	post
if you are indeed supposed to use the post http-method you have a couple things wrong

544527
contains	any
using this methodology all of the business logic is contains in your web app but you have the reliability of the windows task manager or any other commercial task manager to kick it off and record any return information such as an execution report

544528
hide	show
then in the code when i want to hide control 1 and show control 2 i have this

544544
arrays	loops
you can do it with a fold where you accumulate the news as you process the olds and compute others as news + non-me olds or you could covert to an arrays and use a loops to in-place update and then convert back to a list when done if needed

544559
versioning	upgrade
download a clean copy of the wordpress versioning you are trying to upgrade from the wordpress release archive

544570
silverlight	wpf
finally you have a choice between silverlight and wpf they re not the same

544570
silverlight	wpf
although silverlight is a good sub set of wpf there are certain things you just can t do

544594
credentials	account
because the guest account is used for all users without validated credentials and that s everyone up until the point where their login succeeds that makes sense to me

544598
contains	any
4 the web service decrypts each request bouncing any which don t contains a valid identifier

544598
blacklist	whitelist
you can do as much or as little work as you want here keep a whitelist blacklist monitor usage on a per-identifier basis and investigate suspicious behavior etc

544604
contains	any
typically garbage-collection can be depended on to cleanup but if your object contains any unmanaged resources database connections open files etc you will need to explicitly close those resources and or exceute the dispose methods on the object if it implements idisposable

544625
exponent	modulo
a public key contains both a modulo very long number can be 1024bit 2058bit 4096bit and a public key exponent much smaller number usually equals one more than a two to some power

544625
exponent	modulo
the formula to decrypt a signature is message public exponent modulo

544626
where-clause	sql
why didn t the designers of sql require a keyword all for any update or delete statements that don t have a where-clause

544633
malloc	free
for the same reason you can have a malloc without matching free in c it s your responsibility

544643
border-layout	boxlayout
my advice from years of laying out java gui and maintaining them is to learn and use the most powerful layout manager you can master in two hours and that you ll never forget then layout your gui with nested containers using this layout manager and the basic border-layout gridlayout flowlayout boxlayout

544660
children	tree
i would recommend the nested set technique as it allows you to get the whole tree and its children in one query

544668
jsonp	ajax
if you re looking for other ways to communicate cross-domain using ajax style without using the xmlhttprequest object you should check out jsonp it is currently fully supported on all browsers

544687
restart	exit
i have to do this because i need to make sure that if the user crashes the program or exit abruptly this secondary process is restart when the application is restart or if the user wants to change the parameters for this secondary process

544689
oracle	mysql
oracle sqldeveloper yes made by oracle but works with mysql and is free

544691
aquamacs	emacs
if you re an emacs fan try aquamacs an aqua-style version of emacs

544691
aquamacs	emacs
i use it because i don t have to learn the weird emacs command to quit or save - aquamacs uses traditional mac hotkeys for quit save open new

544693
buffering	streaming
use the lower-level functions such as read write mmap as opposed to the c buffering streaming i o functions

544693
fwrite	fread
it is better to use fopen fread fwrite for maximum portability as these are standard c functions the functions i ve mentioned above aren t

544703
buffering	streaming
stdio streaming are buffering while open file descriptors are not

544708
where-clause	sql
where is it written that you need to write an sql statement that is executable without a where-clause

544714
required	checked
one very basic but useful thing that doesn t required complex infrastructure to implements is to checked the inputs to all functions that have non-trivial precondtions with asserts

544746
python	java
use a garbage-collected language such as python or java if it makes sense for your project

544758
required	checked
in me.startup i m calling a function which does a db versioning checked then updates if required

544773
processor	cpu
given the frustration i have with a two core machine and seeing high cpu usage i think my blood pressure would rise less on a 4 processor box.

544785
printf	scanf
printf and scanf have a richer api that allows you to read and write formatted text files

544789
postgresql	mysql
navicat for postgresql is an easy one to use simple administrative tool very similar to the mysql one

544795
traversal	parent
traversal the arrays and assign a reference from the parent object to each of it s children

544797
rollback	commit
then running it making sure the rows affected count looks sane staring at the sql some more then replacing rollback with commit and running it for good

544803
version-control	git
i recommend using git or any other version-control system you might like

544805
filtering	grouping
findstr does have some regex support but it is pretty weak no grouping or alternation especially so if you want to filtering out multiple response codes using findstr you would have to chain them eg to also filtering out auth failures

544823
contains	set
i have set each contains div with a unique id onlinestatus

544838
remote-debugging	debugging
it is a platform independent graphical gpl python debugger with support for remote-debugging over a network multiple threads namespace modification embedded debugging encrypted communication and is up to 20 times faster than pdb

544840
put	get
however if i put the in a hash i get the same syntax-error you got with print

544846
32-bit	64bit
since the c common client uses a network connection there s no obvious reason why the 32-bit client should not connect to either a 32-bit or a 64bit server or both on separate connections

544846
32-bit	64bit
i can answer definitively for informix which you didn t ask about - i use 32-bit or 64bit esql c to connect to either 32-bit or 64bit ids servers without problem

544849
callback	methods
you pass your data as a json object as the second parameter to the load methods and you can pass a reference to a callback as the third parameter

544850
contains	set
so how to set row filtering to filtering rows whose column visiility contains only true

544863
internet-explorer	firefox
internet-explorer is not my default browser but when i click a link in internet-explorer i do not expect the linked page to open in firefox

544876
contains	elements
basically when all is said and done the output stream contains data from the input stream wrapped in a elements contains in a parent elements

544876
contains	elements
if data in the input stream contains a it needs to be split across two cdata elements

544882
function-call	inline
either could be inline if you re worried about the overhead of the function-call

544887
required	checked
making the site completely required human input eg captcha will greatly increase the difficulty of logging in checked out etc

544898
adventureworks	northwind
what are your strategies best practices when it comes to dealing with a reasonably sized sql-server database anything larger than northwind or adventureworks - do you use multiple filegroups

544901
javascript	dom
however when i click the button that replaces the input element with the select element from then on the form.inputbox and form.selection in the javascript code contain the respective element as it was in its last state in the dom - even if it is no longer in the dom

544901
javascript	dom
so is the javascript caching the dom and not updating the elements when they are removed from the dom

544915
continuous-integration	code-coverage
is code-coverage a fixed part of your builds or continuous-integration

544946
ubuntu	linux
i ve managed to build a .so .dylib and .dll for linux macos and windows respectively but to do so i had to have a machine running each operating system in my case running linux ubuntu gcc natively and windows mingw and macos xcode gcc in virtual machines

544949
mbunit	nunit
test these libraries using nunit mbunit or the likes

544949
cassini	iis
if you have doubts if something runs on cassini but not in iis

544955
driver	kernel
you must be able to do this from a linux kernel driver see comment under jerome s answer

544955
kernel	mmu
yes an os kernel can use the cpu s mmu memory-management unit on architectures that have one to remap memory in either the kernel virtual address space or the user virtual address space

544976
virtual-machine	vmware
for linux it is fairly easy to setup or even download a virtual-machine using vmware for instance

544978
for-loop	arrays
just use a for-loop that moves over the arrays in sizeof int chunks

545019
any	set
we don t really have any fixed metrics on how often we do this but it s all set up to run with a keypress or two

545020
double	int
in either of these cases you ll need to byte-swap all numbers that are bigger than 1 byte shorts int longs double etc

545024
mouseover	mouseout
now i have attached mouseover and mouseout event for programinfo class using jquery

545024
mousemove	mouseout
what i want is to change the border color of inside table contains class tblprogram on mousemove and mouseout

545024
mouseevent	mousemove
my mousemove and mouseevent are

545028
detect	move
i do not believe this is possible in a single line unless you are willing to detect the error and move on not a bad thing

545066
constructor	object
obviously if the constructor fails the object won t be created to begin with so no need to dispose

545081
pthreads	usleep
in old-school pthreads you could use the usleep function which accepts the number of microseconds to sleep as an unsigned-integer argument

545081
gentoo	linux
for newer posix-style programs my gentoo linux box man pages says it s posix.1-2001 you d use nanosleep which requires a pointer to a structure holding the period to sleep

545082
required	checked
now the server i am connecting to required ssl in pidgin i have to checked force old port 5223 ssl

545097
32-bit	64bit
if you have existing 32-bit executable that were built with the largeaddressaware msvc linker option or which have the image_file_large_address_aware flag set in their pe headers through other means such as editbin.exe then they get a full 4 gb of virtual address space in 64bit windows and you must test them with the allocationpreference registry value set

545097
32-bit	64bit
i can see why the option is deprecated for 32-bit builds where it is an evil hack that requires annotating many of your typedef but it s unfortunate that it is also deprecated for 64bit builds where it is actually useful

545100
rad-controls	telerik
telerik rad-controls for asp .net has support for asp.net-mvc

545115
32-bit	16-bit
the default is refering to 64k 16-bit in real mode or to 32-bit in protected mode if i recall well

545117
value	field
way in testcomplete to check these value multiple field in multiple tables

545126
fortran	ada
the glut library has both c c++ same as c fortran and ada programming bindings

545129
click	mouse
overall i find it disappointing that the selectionchangedevent generated is the same regardless of whether a mouse was click

545135
iteration	elements
so the next iteration will look at which is actually the elements that was originally in

545157
cvs	git
for someone coming from a more conventional vcs background cvs svn what are the most compelling reasons to learn and migrate to git

545164
any	set
is there any way to set timezone automatically for different countries of users in php

545187
nsstring	uilabel
i am thinking about a work-around applying a transform to the uilabel to make a y-axis symmetry but how can i detect if a nsstring contains a rtl string

545194
powermockito	junit
i have a problematic situation with some quite advanced unit tests using powermockito for mocking and junit 4.5

545195
put	get
keep in mind you can put xml in sql-server and query it using xpath so depending on the shape of your data you may be able to get the best of both worlds

545197
xml-serialization	xml
does anyone know how i can use xml-serialization or something to load xml from a file and convert it to the messagetype the webservice expects

545223
sql-server	oracle
i know if you re using sql-server that works out of the box not so sure for oracle

545228
environment	building
one of the directions i am pushing is to set up a lab environment install with the nightly building so developers can test the performance impact of their code

545273
nsstring	nsobject
note that because we are dealing with an nsstring which is an nsobject derived class we use the retain option to ensure the reference counts are correctly updated

545280
environment	building
nightly building are excellent lab environment are excellent but you re in danger of muddling performance-testing with straight up bug testing i think

545281
naming-conventions	conventions
i seems daft for me to have two different naming-conventionss fxcop complains about the prefix on the control names and i don t like the naming conventions

545317
export	csv
then you can export it as csv format and work on it in excel

545329
logging	trace
i installed my own win32 se handler with _set_se_translator and tried to dump the stack trace with stackwalk64 and finally throw a c++ exception which actually does the logging when caught

545329
while-loop	infinite
as i saw in some examples but there is a problem stackwalk64 always return true and that while-loop becomes infinite

545362
detailsview	gridview
you can hook up the gridview and detailsview and use basic sql scripting or complex business objects along with detailsview

545364
dialog	pop-up
i have seen ctrl+n pop-up the connect to server dialog in some screens but when i am in a query windows already and hit ctrl+n it just opens up another query windows

545375
openrowset	openquery
you have the choice of creating a linked server and use with openquery or use openrowset

545387
directory	folder
edit to clarify my files are at multiple levels in a directory tree they re not all sitting in the same root folder

545423
required	checked
if they re required to enter the answer with the e notation why not just checked if all the stuff before the e is the same in both the student s answer and the correct answer

545431
linux	bsd
you can get libraries compatible with some parts from gnustep.org and run them on linux bsd but it s still not the full osx stack

545444
subclassing	base-class
i think the second approach using a factory function is a lot cleaner than making the implementation of your base-class depend on its subclassing

545460
append	input
then when new input comes in append it to the queue and again take all but the last two characters search-and-replace over them and output

545465
exception-handling	try-catch
a try-catch finally is not expensive unless an exception-handling is thrown

545467
g++	gcc
to install gcc g++ and other utilities like make in one step you can install build-essential meta-package

545474
python	perl
other examples are perl and python to name just two

545474
python	java
java python and perl seem to have achieved this relatively well and i m sure microsoft has the brainpower to do the same for .net

545482
publishing	enterprise
and even if you re using on an enterprise network you can also publishing records on the intranet dns server so you are not going to rely on your routers and their multicast tolerance which can be overwhelming

545485
any	set
not only does it provide excellent handling of any unhandled exception-handling screen grab email etc but it has a nice set of callable routines to hand you back a stack trace that you can use almost anywhere

545489
contains	any
the boolfield 1 is really a variables dyn sql that can contains any where statement on the table

545497
portrait	screens
the problem is if they press a button that takes them to another screens after the rotating to landscape then the next screens goes back to portrait mode and the status bar correctly remains in landscape mode

545507
low-level	hardware
in practice the most demanding technical issues with cross-platform development arise from low-level hardware communication drivers to specific devices etc. but typical apps don t need to communicate with hardware directly anyway

545514
boost-phoenix	boost-lambda
if you want to compose predicates the nicest way to write it is probably using the boost-lambda or boost-phoenix

545516
decimal	hex
so if you convert the hex 0xff00 into decimal you get 65280 so i selected that numbers on the android-emulator and click run but it doesn t want to run the image linked to my disk 0

545522
silverlight	wpf
you can get the silverlight chart controls running on wpf they re quite nice and free

545526
click	mouse
right click mouse button connection change connection

545526
dialog	pop-up
both will pop-up the connect to database engine dialog box

545526
openrowset	openquery
if your wanting to write some tsql between servers then you ll need to create a linked server and then use openquery or openrowset in your sql

545540
postback	ajax
can you hook into the client events of an async postback in asp.net ajax add an eventhandler to the pagerequestmanager endrequest event

545562
base-class	accessor
that is the base-class provides a virtual property with only a get accessor but the child class overrides the get and also provides a set

545579
msbuild	nant
i would like to execute my unit tests from the command-line using msbuild or nant etc. and fail the build if the tests fail

545582
derived-class	base-class
you can hide the base-class implementation by using the new keyword in your derived-class

545584
expression	brackets
i m after a specific regular expression that preserves grouping by brackets

545586
protected	public
unfortunately you can not even override and change the accessor level from protected to public for example as documented on msdn

545586
derived-class	accessor
i would recommend that you consider restructuring the code class slightly and look for an alternative way to accomplish this task such as declaring the set accessor with the protected modifier using a setproperty methods in the derived-class

545589
base-class	inherited
and either way you need to be careful not to break polymorphism and inherited what if the base-class talks to the private field

545589
base-class	accessor
so if the accessor in the base-class was protected

545593
value	field
i am using the following query to insert value into one field in table a

545594
any	set
set it to zero and your text should scroll back up to show the start of the text set it to maxscrollv to show the last line or set it to any value inbetween those two to show a line of your choice

545596
value	field
i have been spying the msdn and can t see a property methods for textbox that allows you to get the default text value that was set on a field

545600
value	field
you should rather use update if you want to change the value of the field in records you selected using the where-clause

545601
implements	extends
the disadvantage would be reactions like yeah great but i just need to know what class i need to extends to implements this controller.

545635
put	get
the complication comes if you talk to multiple instances and partition your data ie split it across different instances then your clients need to know which instance to get the data from or put the data into

545635
json	xml
typical choices are xml or even json

545637
put	get
- knows where to get new preferences and where to put them

545637
required	checked
presenter - checked the model determines new preferences are required

545659
python	perl
script and script-like languages like python and perl as mentioned go that way they use minimal features of the os and build everything they provide on top of it

545667
authentication	login
provides me the authentication for given name+pass but i d like to authenticate based on the windows login

545681
reasoning	rule
first as a general rule coding standards should be discussed and agreed by the team and the reasoning behind them should be written down so that anyone can know why they are there

545697
double	int
perfectly valid code if a little unconventional but in the above i know that bbb is a double despite the initializing value appearing to be an int but aaa will definitely not be a double but rather an int

545706
ebnf	bnf
personally i would stick with bnf ebnf due to the prevalence of information and tools which use it in some form

545706
bison	yacc
tools like bison or yacc can help with the generation of a parsing from such a grammar and make it quite trivial to produce an interpreter

545708
callback	methods
i have a program in c# that connects to a server using a duplexchannelfactory and that server can call methods from client side by callback the problem is that i have no idea how to access the main thread were the connection was created from the callback methods

545730
python	java
i m starting to work in python now and i d like your advice in which tools should i use to accomplish the same as described for java

545742
attributes	properties
create a base class that define all the abstract properties attributes and methods belonging to a state

545746
python	java
i also work with both java and python

545758
stderr	stdout
edit you can always read stdout stderr and return code of the process using p.getoutputstream p.geterrorstream

545773
click	mouse
create your own flash app which embeds the main swf and puts a transparent sprite on top of it to capture the mouse click

545778
stateless	stateful
the whole idea of session is to make stateful applications using stateless protocols http and dumb client web browser by maintaining the state on server s side

545792
any	set
some obfuscators allow the generation of constructs which are not representable in any of the target languages the set of all operations allowable in cil for example is way more than that expressible through c# or even c++ cli

545817
vbscript	jscript
why are you btw doing this in vbscript if the rest of your code is in jscript

545819
getter	setter
humans say this is a getter and this is a setter but tools don t

545826
contains	set
announces to the compiler that your custom component dispatches this particular event but you re actually dispatching it with your contains document rather than your custom component -- so your event listener never gets called because there s nothing set up to call it

545839
python	java
i know hudson is a java app but it can run python stuff just fine

545843
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
to prevent someone decompiling and reverse-engineering your il code back to source code you ll need to obfuscation the il code

545860
contains	lookup
not all the information required to produce xmlb is contains withing xmla a database lookup will be required

545899
archive	backup
for instances tar which is probably the most common of these was originally intended for making backup on tapes hence the name tar tape archive

545899
linux	unix
tar in unix linux environments

545900
emacs	vim
i m 28 and switched from vim to emacs a month or so ago

545912
bazaar	git
bazaar mercurial or git for version control

545926
boost-spirit	boost-regex
and i would use get_line to get the whole line of input and then handle it accordingly - use lexical_cast regular expression for example boost-regex or boost xpressive parsing it with boost-spirit or just use some kind of appropriate logic

545932
hash	md5
tfs does this by comparing md5 hash of the files contents before and after check-in

545935
order	add
now we need to add the ability to process order from other data sources

545935
order	add
i ve been leaning towards the provider model one provider for each data source and using it to standardize data into sql-server tables before calling the api s to actually add customers and place order

545938
oracle	mysql
ok the question is obviously wrong as it stands but i m wondering how can i choose storage implementations on oracle as i would for mysql say i want one table to myisam like and another for archiving only and one black hole style for test purposes

545953
binaries	install
for this reason i tend to use changesets in tfs when recording the point in time for a particular release in fact we label our binaries and install with the actual changeset number that they were built from just to make it easier to track

545968
credentials	security
for security reasons i need to verify individual user credentials before allowing access to the reports

545998
contains	elements
one could be to hide an elements that contains the answer

546046
variables	boolean
user answers the boolean variables in the other responses is known and then the exporter gets to the real work and the user can go do something else

546051
exception-handling	try-catch
all code is wrapped in try-catch equivalents and all exception-handling output is emitted only via outputdebugstring or into a log file

546051
constructor	object
as far as i can tell from our log files and by observing the issue via sysinternals processmonitor when the addin get disabled on outlook startup rather than during the session the dll gets unloaded even before the com object the addin gets instantiated log messages in the constructor never show up

546051
exception-handling	try-catch
that exception-handling gets caught by a global exception-handling handler built into the framework i m using add-in-express and does not appear originate from anywhere it my own code every single methods of which is by now entirely wrapped in try-catch

546051
copy-protection	licensing
we are using a licensing copy-protection module from a third-party vendor which wraps the compiled dll in a shell and only unpacks it on-the-fly

546059
twitter	tweets
we have twitter account for many projects which tweets things like commit messages notices from builds failed unit tests deployments bug tracking activity - any kind of event associated with the project

546073
logout	login
using a loginstatus control to automatically render a login or logout link depending on whether the user has logged in or out

546099
progress-bar	progress
the two exist because status is design to update a status message and the progress-bar is designed to work with a indicator of progress

546099
switching	screens
especially if you have multiple screens the user could switching between

546101
triggers	insert
i ve added a before insert triggers which prevents the insertion of duplicate users

546119
selected	textbox
even selecting a tabitem name through the list does not do anything it does not even update the selected value textbox of the combobox

546147
cargo	maven
for that it s easier to use the maven cargo plugin it can re deploy your ear to a running j2ee server

546151
oracle	mysql
you can download a small database mysql or oracle express and begin working

546168
oracle	mysql
oracle does not have a storage engine concept like mysql does

546175
perl	c++
since i m also used to hacking in c++ i find myself often do it like this in perl using references

546176
export	report
the export to rtf option might be workable provided you can live with one-way generation after you use crystal to generate the report and start editing the output you can t re-generate without losing your edits

546208
output	mode
the resulting output in release mode is

546214
erlang	prolog
compiler in erlang and used the prolog

546239
datagrid	listbox
instead of a datagrid try using a combination of a listview or listbox depending on which functionality you want - both derive from itemssource and datatemplates

546240
motorola	sony
nokia sony and motorola don t support their old symbian phones any more

546241
sql-server	oracle
i am looking for the best .net orm tool that would work with oracle and sql-server 2005

546256
authentication	login
assuming you d probably want to fetch some columns along with the authentication check real name last login etc.

546278
python	java
i ve read that most of the spotify back-end is written in python with smaller parts in c and java

546309
filtering	grouping
chart properties - data tab - series grouping edit - filterings - add the appropriate filtering to remove series that you don t care about

546316
vbscript	jscript
try to do what you want to do in a cmd-file it that doesn t cut it use windows scripting host to call a wsh-file with jscript and or vbscript in it

546316
vbscript	jscript
if you prefer the jscript-look use that as your primary language and use vbscript for things you copy from the .net or cannot find a jscript solution to

546316
vbscript	jscript
you can call vbscript from jscript and the other way around

546333
member-function-pointers	function-pointers
try it like this - the boost thread constructor is expecting a boost function0 which a function-pointers is but a member-function-pointers isn t due to the this pointers

546358
credentials	security
for example when i configure with security message security windows credentials i get a timeout after 10th or 11th call

546360
contains	any
i wouldn t recommend it but if you do at least validate that the sql entered starts with selected and does not contains any semi-colons

546365
postdata	request
using fiddler i monitored the request all the postdata is passed correctly

546367
safari	opera
anyway i discovert that s it s not even working in opera and safari but the whole thing ajax control toolkit - modal popup extender

546367
google-chrome	firefox
in my case i wanna make it works at least in firefox and google-chrome too

546369
object-reference	instances
but this keeps getting out of error object-reference not set to an instances of an object

546377
webforms	asp.net
asp.net mvc alongside webforms in the same web app

546377
webforms	asp.net
i am kinda new to .net applications i have a webforms application that i am working on and i am about to start the development of new pages i am trying to make the new pages with the asp.net mvc but i am not beeing able to make the pages hit the controllers

546385
value	field
the quantity qty sold and cost field are just part of the item model and cost value is just a simple model function

546411
value	field
the sample that follows is what the results should look like but the actual value aren t important the numbers could anything as long as the two combined field can be used for a unique-key

546411
value	field
the value of line num is not important but the field is only 4 characters

546424
text-editor	editor
i need to swap out the out-of-the-box rich text-editor with the telerik editor for all article page layouts

546426
arrays	loops
if code is repetitive arrays and foreach loops neaten things

546433
expression	brackets
i need a regular expression to selected all the text between two outer brackets

546434
contains	elements
i was wondering if there is a reference body of code anywhere which contains all these elements of the c language and which can be used to test tools compilers which process c code

546443
expression	brackets
note that this expression does not attempt to match brackets

546455
webforms	asp.net
i have often run in to this problem while developing in asp.net webforms

546458
triggers	insert
either that or you could use a triggers and on the insert calculate the max id for the order

546470
any	set
if it failed to read any integer in the first place then the fail or bad bit will have been set

546470
strtol	atoi
specifically this talks about the function strtol string-to-long which is basically atoi with error checking and capability to work with other bases hex for example

546472
expression	brackets
if you need to match matching nested brackets then you need something more than regular expression

546479
python	java
or if i follow the design patterns will i just end up writing java in python which apparently is a very bad thing

546483
wait	hang
this all works fine but it essentially hang the parent app while it wait for the licensing app to finish its work

546492
configuration	logging
without the packaging everything works fine and the logging configuration is perfectly loaded but within the packaging only part of the configuration is appied

546492
csv	xml
the log level as well as the filehandler pattern are well understood because the logging ends up in the correct file but as row xml output which makes me think that the formatter is not loaded as it normally outputs a csv format

546495
python	java
the biggest differences are that python is duck typed meaning that you won t need to plan out class hierarchies in as much detail as in java and has first class functions

546498
base-class	inherited
it will only take methods and properties on class2 and not inherited ones otherwise you would get all public methods all the way down to your base-class

546501
environment	building
i use a virtual-machine to make a stable building environment and keep all the options in finalbuildinger

546504
contains	any
that was great back in the single-user days of ms-dos when any locking process was likely to be on the same computer that contains the files however on a network it s a nightmare

546511
javascript	dom
- you should read this re-introduction by crockford and forget about the dom - the dom is superugly but that s not javascript fault and javascript is not the dom

546521
python	java
the implementation of the same design pattern in python would obviously be different than in java or c#

546537
.when	ready
i m mulling over an approach which would triggers my user-interface only .when all the data sets are ready

546549
sendmessage	message
if the spawned application invokes sendmessage with one of the broadcast targets hwnd_broadcast or hwnd_topmost then the sendmessage won t return to the new application until all applications have handled the message - but your app can t handle the message because it isn t pumping messages..

546592
ruby-on-rails	django
both django and ruby-on-rails have done a lot of good work in this regard...even the lispers have some good noob tutorials

546595
base-class	inherited
for example if you define a base-class with a member and then inherit the base-class in a derived class that is exposed as a com object clients that use the derived class in the com object will not be able to use the inherited members

546608
boolean	int
in a database i use throughout several projects there is a field that should actually be a boolean but is for reasons nobody can explain to me a field duplicated over two tables where one time it is a char y n and one time an int 1 0

546616
base	zero
i don t think the optimizer is smart enough to use the index if substring is used even with a zero base but i am a bit too busy to test it out right now

546629
filtering	sorting
sql is specialized code well-suited to manipulating sets of data such as sorting filtering and joining

546629
filtering	sorting
joining filtering and sorting data almost always belong in sql because the database will do that faster and easier than you can do on the client side

546644
contains	any
we looked at the logs files in the rs folder and the only errors that show are the ones that we get when we try to access the web site from ie but that don t seem to contains any more info about the root cause

546677
dynamic-memory-allocation	c++
in c++ you should avoid explicit dynamic-memory-allocation with new wherever possible

546681
g++	gcc
the other thing to do is turn on your compiler warnings - if you are using gcc g++ the option is -wall

546690
checkbox	textbox
on the gridviewrow i have to use a gridview1.rows i .cells j .findcontrol mycontrol1 then get the appropriate value from it be it a checkbox textbox or drop down list

546694
children	nodes

546694
children	nodes
from any such child nodes a mark it s children of being children of a x where x is marked as being 2 steps away.

546704
selected	button
for instance i have a button that the user clicks on to selected a file it would be nice if i could use windows standard folder icon

546727
inline-code	code-behind
also i am for right now trying to do this using inline-code -- is this feasible or do i really need a code-behind if i m doing things by hand.

546736

546746
authentication	login
i can login using sql authentication without problem

546762
runas	cmd
try using a different valid login using runas cmd

546785
.net	wcf
in a windows-based environment using .net framework the best choice would be to use wcf which allows you to add security robustness with a simple configuration

546802
attributes	properties
if the properties is declared with the retain attributes then using the setter will automatically call retain when you assign with it and it will also release the old value

546802
attributes	properties
if instead the properties is declared with the copy attributes then the value will instead be copied every time you assign to it and you will become an owner of the new object

546817
shell	bash
i m attempting to support modern portable bourne shell so bash ksh arrays aren t available

546822
select	union
well you can use a union and run 5 select statements one for each column in your table

546847
dictionary	arrays
basically i m getting the exc_bad_access errors when i release both the pools mutable arrays and the dictionary

546852
triggers	insert
you may add a column called username fill it in the insert update triggers with the expression you use in selected and search on this column

546864
value	field
it is not permitted to pass a form field as null - all fields that were on the form must pass a value

546864
procedure	records
the procedure is mechanically generated takes the pk as a parameter and has the ability to return a validation message when trying to delete the order header if it still has child order item records

546864
triggers	insert
records are insert into the archive by a update delete triggers on the main table

having	select
when you select for example a size of 8 in a font dialog for microsoft sans serif it returns a font that .net displays as having a size 8.25

546871
qgraphicsscene	qwidget
i spent some time this weekend with qt and have discovered qgraphicsscene class - which seems to be the fundamental class for qt s 2d retained type graphics mode - and qgraphicswidget which allows some auto-layout functionality of the qwidget class

546874
spring	jsf
i m working on 2 projects right now one using asp.net-mvc and the other using java jsf spring hibernate

546874
perl	php
i ve also used other frameworks cgi perl php asp jsp jsf

546874
environment	building
what do you think is the most productive programming environment for building web-applications

546906
methods	extend
the solution i ended up using was to extend uiscrollview and override the touchesmoved withevent methods with this

546908
quirks-mode	doctype
the incorrectly-cased doctype dtd xhtml throws ie6 into quirks-mode from which there is no return

546910
ruby-on-rails	django
ruby-on-rails django certainly can improve development time but if you know asp very well it may not be worth the effort plus you re giving up the visual designer if you use it

546910
ruby-on-rails	django
lots less boilerplate and more magic in django ruby-on-rails

546932
xsd	xml
liquid xml studio has a visual xsd tree editor and lets me save my tree as a .png file which fulfills some of my needs

546939
sql-server	mysql
i know this works for sql-server so it s worth a try in mysql

546949
sql-server	oracle
you may start with sql-server but if policy change to oracle

546953
sendmessage	message
if the c++ app has a main windows take a look at using the sendmessage function via p invoke in the c# app to send a wm_copydata message to the c++ app

546958
select	union
don t know about mysql specifically but to update multiple rows based on a select or a union of multiple selects i would do

546972
solaris	linux
commenting on the accepted answer it didn t work for me in either linux or solaris the problem was the s character class shortcut in the regexp for sed

546984
google-chrome	firefox
runs fine against the following on firefox ie safari opera and google-chrome

546984
instanceof	typeof
instanceof is less safe than using typeof because it will fail when passing objects between frame boundaries

546984
instanceof	typeof
i know that ie returns wrong typeof information for some built-in functions but afaik instanceof will fail in these cases as well so why the more complicated but less safe test

546987
union-all	union
that should not be the case if you use union only if you use union-all

546998
web-services	security
i have a web application which passes an authentication key to web-services for security

546999
margins	padding
if you know the dimensions of your which it looks like you probably won t in this case since they re on the side i ve had luck adding a padding to push the out to the edges past any padding from the itself and then bringing it back in with a corresponding negative margins

547003
hardware	monitor
it can monitor hardware and software components and graphically show the communication between them

547006
assign	add
also assign in the add methods

547011
contains	elements
each arrays elements would contains all the information for a single corresponding cell in the grid with the integer bits mapped like this

547016
authentication	login
bind to ldap server using the ldap account to bind and ldap account password ldap_bind - if you re authentication against an active directory server you can directly use the username and password from the login page and skip all the following steps

547033
any	set
if you need any further explanation about what i m trying to do or how i have things set up let me know

547064
entity-framework	ado.net
i m using the ado.net entity-framework to manage a hierarchy of objects

547064
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework object with parent and children

547064
profiling	debugging
i m monitoring the sql-server profiling while i debugging my application

547068
decimal	hex
yes a good way is to use hex decimal to represent the bit patterns

547111
subtract	add
in this case i ve defined this made up moxy methods to subtract 2 from the integer if it s zero and add two if it s nonzero

547111
reflection	runtime
and that s certainly an important aspect of reflection in programming also - using ruby methods like is_a kind_of instance_of to perform runtime self-inspection

547111
reflection	runtime
but reflection also refers to the the ability of a program to modify its own behavior at runtime

547134
forwarding	port
i ve tried with and without port forwardinging set to forwarding incoming requests on the given port to the server machine with no effect

547149
contains	set
i want to set the response.encoding type to an appropriate value - and i need to to match what the xml itself will contains

547160
data-structures	dictionary
the collections like stacks queues sortedlist dictionary hashtable are all standard data-structures which come in handy in various situations

547160
queue	fifo
queue enables fifo implementation without you having to do it yourself

547164
methods	extend
and while it doesn t apply to private variables it does to protected variablesiables in classes that extend this class you really should try to avoid the second methods for pure readability

547172
mousemove	mouseup
i am trying to create a subclass of certain .net controls label panels that will pass through certain mouse events mousedown mousemove mouseup to its parent control or alternatively to the top-level form

547185
protected	public
you need to write a public protected methods in your base-class which will raise the event for you

547222
postdata	request
the update edit and delete actions postdata from a form to the server while the cancel and list actions are can be handled by appropriate get request

547223
lighting	shading
lighting and shading viewport transforms and depth queries are some of the operations used to create the illusion of 3d

547225
font-size	width
i should note that you do have a point - most websites with fixed width do suck on high-dpi because they don t take into account the changed font-size

547240
directory	folder
hdf5 grouping are analogous to folder directory except that folder directory are hierarchical a unique path describes each one s location in filesystems w o hard links at least whereas grouping form a directed graph which can include cycles

547261
firefox	safari
i don t have any way to test in ie 6 the this works in safari and should in firefox

547267
sql-server	oracle
i have done this many times with sql-server and there is no reason it should not work with oracle since ssrs is going to build an ansi compliant sql statement which it will pass to oracle

547268
python	perl
it can generate lots of admin scripts in vbscript perl javascript jscript and python

547276
value	field
i m trying to default a value in a field to the current date but my code

547278
base-class	inherited
first thing to know with trying to get some kind of inherited going with ef is that you cannot assign a non-ef-modeled class a base-class

547289
ruby-on-rails	django
i ve used several languages and frameworks as well from .net both mvc and webforms classic asp ruby-on-rails merb and django

547295
getter	setter
inotifypropertychanged when used also gives you the ability to add more logic in the code of your getter and setter of your properties

547295
getter-setter	setter
in your getter and setter --- all you can do is simply call setvalue and getvalue respectively b c in other parts of the framework the getter-setter is not called instead it directly calls setvalue getvalue so your property logic wouldnt reliably be executed

547300
put	get
a good place to put the logic to get the next route is probably the movenext of your iterator

547313
windows-xp	windows
how do i run windows 32bit applications in iis on windows-xp 64 bit

547326
ghostscript	imagemagick
can imagemagick ghostscript handle this sort of thing or am i having so much trouble because i m using the wrong tool for the job

547337
httpd.conf	.htaccess
to permit ssi on your server you must have the following directive either in your httpd.conf file or in a .htaccess file

547346
value	field
then field with values type text name makeupassignment size 50 and value .date and then m d y .

547376
lighttpd	apache
is apache iis lighttpd etc. running

547383
subclassing	superclass
subclassing is an option you don t loose the designer as long as you don t set the superclass as mustinherit it doesn t really like that

547389
g++	gcc
well it s not a complete answer but the gcc manual mentions that g++ can sometimes place empty base classes at the wrong offset

547431
any	set
now i have been developing in drupal and it is really better for larger projects although it takes more time to set up a simple blog compared to wordpress - it has wonderful modular architecture that allowed me to solve any request problem so far by writing a module instead of hacking the core

547439
contains	any
they may conformingly all occupy the same address as long as they don t have any bases in common with one another or with the contains class

547441
imagemagick	mogrify
imagemagick s mogrify convert commands will indeed do the job

547444
external	host
one reason you might want to host on an external server is to work around the browser limitations of concurent connections to particular server

547444
external	host
second reason to host it on external server is to lower the traffic to your own server

547453
viewwillappear	viewdidload
if you are just loading subviews as above you can construct them in the same xib or build them programatically in viewdidload or viewwillappear which will be called after the xib is loaded with your basic view

547454
contains	elements
you say you don t want to emit elements that contains the empty string and then give as an example this

547454
contains	elements
in which the title elements doesn t contains the empty string

547454
contains	elements
if you genuinely want to abort the transform with an exception-handling if you encounter an elements contains whitespace you can t use xsl strip-space as it will remove all of the exception-handling-triggering conditions before the transform runs

547454
contains	elements
it wouldn t match or though because neither of those elements contains text nodes

547465
hsqldb	oracle
this is extremely slow on oracle but can be very fast if you use an in memory database like hsqldb

547466
any	set
the problem is this means any time the mutator fancy word for the real program sets a pointer it also has to put an entry in the appropriate rememered set

547472
value	field
in this example the first three field are the key and i combine value1 and value in a certain order to be the value

547485
sql-server	mysql
see simulating group_concat mysql function in microsoft sql-server 2005

547507
value	field
just read over the lines and if the field are the same as the previous line emit both value

547508
macros	let
however i was wondering if there exists a package or macros that would let me do the following automatically place a float automatically right after it was first reference

547511
event-log	logfile
check the windows event-log application and systemd and check the httperr logfile in c windows systemd32 logfile httperr folder may be different location on win64

547512
value	field
using sql-server 2005 i have a field that contains a datetime value

547539
arrays	loops
and i know that loopsing through an arrays each time isn t as efficient as using a switch statement but this code isn t in a tight loops

547544
csv	xml
also there is fbexport to export to xml csv forma

547554
reflection	runtime
and that s certainly an important aspect of reflection in programming also - in ruby for example we have methods like instance_of to allow objects to ask questions about themselves at runtime

547554
reflection	runtime
as you can see reflection is more than just runtime self-inspection

547571
cross-domain	xss
some browsers may see it as xss cross-domain and disallow the file

547600
.net	wcf
this is not so much a wcf question as a .net question

547620
grouping	sorting
the grouping by order by was probably causing it to save an intermediate data set as a temporary table and sorting it on disk which is very slow

547628
javascript	dom
javascript dom methods reference

547629
nested	order
overall the whole thing is poorly performing in a udf especially when it s all nested and the order of the steps is important etc

547632
put	get
you could use this to get the count and put as the first row

547633
updating	updates
i recommend doing a selected before every updates to see exactly what you will be updating

547635
updating	updates
for the most part the shouldbe column can be filled in with updates queries but you will also be able to run your eye over the results before updating the main table

547657
administration	account
it allows you to copy the settings of your logged in user you to the administration account network services in this case

547659
webforms	asp.net
in the upcoming release of asp.net webforms with .net 4.0 this will be a settable property using a number of different methods such as static inherit etc.

547662
any	set
any table that didn t need transactions could be set up as myisam instead of innodb

547666
account	api
a suggestion to deal with this a different way a way that is much more secure is to run under the default account and map to the network drive using the wnetaddconnection2 windows api

547670
oracle	mysql
right now the application can work with a variety of different databases oracle mysql access etc

547690
unsigned	integer
similarly you can specify an integer to be unsigned by adding a u or a long by l lowercase ell etc

547722
getter-setter	conventions
btw i don t like the getter-setter conventions that is so commonly used on java i think a using leftchild instead would be better

547748
navigationcontroller	viewcontroller
i ve added a navigationcontroller with a viewcontroller that s another subclass of uiviewcontroller vcb and i ve specified a xib view for this viewcontroller

547779
webforms	asp.net
reading between the lines i gather you are trying to add mvc pages to your existing asp.net webforms webapplication

547790
python	perl
but since i m not a perl expert i ll give you an example of what i m talking about in python taken from this question

547796
show	next
then the web logs show a request from the 3pw to my site step#2 but the very next entry in the logs is a new request to the login page for my site

547796
authentication	login
my webserver is seeing the request come in tries to serve the page but realizes the user is not authentication and redirects the request to the login

547799
macros	vba
you can use vba macros to create out look appointments

547800
exception-handling	try-catch
is a guaranteed opportunity to execute code after your try-catch block regardless of whether or not your try block threw an exception-handling

547829
python	java
in other words i am looking for a equivalent class.forname in java function in python

547835
external	host
for that reason i host the jquery-min version myself either on the same server or a static external server but either way a location where only i or my program proxy can update the library after having verified tested every change

547871
exception-handling	try-catch
and you want to catch the exception-handling then use try-catch finally and close the stream data reader etc

547890
private-key	rsa
the existing pem files i have for other services just have a certificate section and a rsa private-key section

547891
jquery	.post
so in the end i can t really see me using the google ajax api for jquery at least the more complete apis are a different story in some ways much except to .post examples here

547903
contains	any
i would like to define a common function that can take a reference to any of these types and extract the data contains

547904
sql-server	oracle
i truly want to understand if sql-server between is less functional than the oracle between

547906
lookup	any
then getting the count from any point just involves a lookup of node.count

547922
haskell	scheme
i am a haskell newbie though had a previous lisp scheme experience

547934
constructor	object
of course it would need to determine that the call graph does not have side effects to other objects which is the typical case for a normal constructor that simply initializes the internal state of the object

547935
constructor	object
you don t show what your implementation of the copy constructor for job is but if you are copying the id from one job as the id of the copy of that job then attempting to save the copy job will fail because jpa will know that the instance of job with that id lives in another object and it is that original object that should be persisted

547948
haskell	lisp
lisp is homoiconic haskell isn t

547969
required	checked
then you need to checked the state of these which required a join with the original table

547984
command-prompt	cmd
you can clear the application store using mage -cc cmd from vs cmd-prompt

547989
malloc	free
its garbage collected while allowing you to specifically delete objects when you want to or even eschew the gc all together in favor of malloc free

547990
contains	any
conversly generics are not syntactic sugar because you can do things with them in c#2 that were impossible with c#1 such as creating a collection class that can contains any value type without boxing

548008
order	add
add and remove items without worrying about the sequence order and then update the items to set the sequence value when you click a button that says save sort

548034
chmod	sudo
sudo chmod 777 usr local iphone-dirs

548042
http	ssl
that s why it can be very helpful to enable ssl sessions for your http service where many connections are made

548045
external	host
i wouldn t want any public site that i developed to depend on any external site and thus i d host jquery myself

548058
double	int
note that switch only works with int primitive-types and enums so you do need to use if else statements if you re using other object types and you probably shouldn t be comparing double or floats for equality anyway

548071
delphi	vb.net
there may be namespace problems in delphi which doesn t enforce a leading dot but that issue simply doesn t exist in vb.net so the people that are posting rants about delphi are losing their time in this question

548101
subclassing	inherited
java and other object oriented languages have polymorphism implements through inherited subclassing

548106
javascript	dom
situations where this might happen is the browser may not have javascript enabled or the dom implementation may have a bug where the click binding on the button is lost briefly i ve seen this happen once in testing but not in a way that is reproducible

548107
signals	sigpipe
man 7 signals and look at things like sigpipe sigill sigchild etc

548107
sigkill	sigsegv
i presume you re really just interested in sigint sigcont and the rest sigsegv sigkill etc. will take care of themselves as the parent process termination will clean up the child as well

548107
shell	bash
for some more interesting thoughts take a look at man bash and the trap builtin to see what the shell developers have done to help this problem

548136
contains	any
i create a basenode class that contains the shared data i want to maintain and inherit further from that for any specific node types

548142
uiapplication	uiwindow
i imagine it is uiapplication but maybe the appdelegate or uiwindow

548154
pkcs#12	pem
one way to do this is to convert the jks to a pkcs#12 aka pfx file using keytool and then use openssl to convert the pkcs#12 files into pem private-key certificate files

548155
double	int
in printf d is for a signed decimal int whereas cost_unit and total are double

548159
formatting	printing
if you study the documentation for the format syntax that you are using when printing your result you will realize you are using integer formatting d where you want to format as a floating point number f

548191
contains	any
when user types in words which contains the and etc lucene does not return any result

548205
ref	out
but returning an arrays ref can be handy if you re going to pick out individual elements

548230
assign	add
edit i m not entirely clear on what the code on your end is doing but i m assuming you just new up some instances of that control in a loop and assign them a unique id and add them

548230
arrays	loops
if this is the case then i would run a loops in your codebehind to find all the controls and register them in a client arrays or just do it as they are created

548234
textbox	button
in code behind you can put something like this to call it from a button and pass in your textbox id

548236
click	mouse
if another mouse click is detected before the timer expires then you have a double-click else once the timer expires you can process the single-click

548248
http	ssl
is there some sort of firewall setup on either the virtual machine or the host machine that might be blocking port 443 http ssl port

548248
internet-explorer	firefox
there is also another setting in security policy system cryptography use fips compliant algorithms for encryption hashing and signing. if this is set you cannot connect to servers that aren t using tls 1.0 most sites are not serving tls 1.0 however this has only affected internet-explorer not firefox in my past experience

548271
getter	setter
and then there are the setter getter automatically being built

548271
getter	setter
you can create all the variables then right-click in the editor go to source and then pick generate setter getter

548272
.when	ready
one could say that the .war started .when this app was ready

548285
contains	set
this blog post contains most of what you need to set up log4net

548287
println	output
also writting java applications doesn t necessarily mean writing gui applications so when writing console applications one would use print println printf and other functions that will output to system.out

548313
while-loop	loops
the while-loops would loops infinitely if you enter anything but 0 for the cost

548316
performance-testing	profiling
profiling logging and other forms of performance-testing will help you here

548336
upgrade	migrate
check out this link for more information it is not for windows but is hopefully still useful - upgrade bdb to 4.4 or migrate to fsfs

548339
put	get
it s best to get the second file from the sqlite website and extract it to the ruby bin directory as you shouldn t manually put dll s into the windows or windows system directories any more

548346
duplicates	contains
items doesn t contains my duplicates

548354
getter	setter
and is there a propertymodel alternative that uses getter and setter by default

548362
csv	xml
if your data is stored in csv or xml you can import the records with sql-server assuming you re using sql-server

548364
distributed-system	reliability
they d have to utilize everything a large scale system would need distributed-system coordinating those systems large amounts of data transactions reliability to ensure inventories stay correct etc all under very tight performance requirements eve online is the major one i m thinking of

548369
order	join
in an outer join the order the tables are listed matters unlike the inner join you have listed

548374
arrays	loops
how can i add a new key value pair to an existing arrays inside of nested foreach loops and have that pair persist outside the scope of the loops

548375
data-access	ado.net
i created a class which implemented the idatareader interface which i can pass as a parameter to a sqlbulkcopy.writetoserver methods see ado.net building a custom data provider for use with the .net data-access framework for an example of how to implement the idatareader interface

548379
input-field	selected
if you d like to have this functionality in all languages use the source bundle click the plus symbol at the bottom left and choose new command. chose nothing for the save field and selected text or line for the two input-field

548411
interlocked	atomicity
interlocked operations must operate on aligned data to ensure they are atomicity on multiprocessor systems see

548417
contains	any
i don t know if there is a direct translation of the in where part in linqtosql didn t found any reference but i replaced that with a contains

548420
python	perl
the preference for sed is only because i assume it must be faster than a python or perl script

548422
silverlight	wpf
delphi prism aka rem objects oxygene formerly chrome provides the gc version of delphi that those who need it are looking for along with asp.net and wpf silverlight ce with the readability and lack of curly braces of delphi

548434
python	perl
you are unlikely to notice any speed difference between perl python

548442
python	c++
a friend and i have been toying around with various python c++ wrappers lately trying to find one that meets the needs of both some professional and hobby projects

548465
command-line	cmd
i m just trying to run calc cmd from cmd-line if you are trying this code on platform other than windows please replace it with some cmd that works on your cmd-line or shell

548466
python	ruby
i need to add some ruby and python code to a web page

548468
business-objects	data-access
use methods on the data-access layer that can save retrieve business-objects properly depending on their type it has an internal mapping between the tables and the objects they correspond to

548488
python	perl
they generally are an order of magnitude faster than languages that are normally purely interpreted like perl or python

548501
jruby	mri
a quick sanity test showed that using your example i would get 2 os threads on mri and 12 when running the same thing under jruby

548501
jruby	mri
this was on os x using mri 1.8.6 and jruby 1.1.6

548528
host	root
# user host root root localhost

548528
host	root
# user host root root localhost

548533
macros	basic
i m creating a program for end-users that s already written using mysql and some openoffice.org star basic macros

548538
execute	declare
you can declare and execute a function without assign it to a variables

548539
ms-access	mysql
engines mysql adabas d ms-access

548549
value	field
if no getter methods exists the propertymodel returns the value of the property field directly

548549
value	field
if a matching field is found the propertymodel returns the field s value

548549
protected	public
note that the propertymodel will check private and protected fields in addition to public fields-for a match

548549
constructor	object
in your case the property expression used in the propertymodel constructor is password so the propertymodel will first look for a method on the user object called getpassword

548549
value	field
if no such methods exists the propertymodel will return the value of the private password field instead

548549
value	field
since in your case the propertymodel is returning the private field s value instead of calling the getter you most likely mistyped the name of the getter in your user class

548549
getter	setter
this way you can force all property accesses to occur through getter and setter

548551
lazy-evaluation	maybe
apparently i am too lazy-evaluation and stupid or maybe it is just the hyper aversion to com to get started with existing answer by franci penov

548551
implements	extends
how do i extends implements the irtd stuff

548555
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
i m using symfony which is inspired by ruby-on-rails and is very well documented but i ve heard cakephp and zendframework are also very good

548565
constructor	object
i m reading an object from a file and i need to pass it as a different object type to a second constructor

548567
tstringlist	tlist
i find myself unsure of which route to take when setting up these properties -- using an arrays property a tlist a tstringlist a tcollection or something else altogether perhaps a new class that inherited from one of those

548569
order	add
you would instantiate the panelmanager and associate it with the main form then add panels to it perhaps keyed to a string and set the order

548571
python	ruby
if you specifically need just ruby and python highlighting you may want to check out netbeans

548582
environment	building
which will give you the basic of a unix command-line building environment like most tutorials assume you have

548589
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know if ie supports __proto__ or even has an equivalent frome some s comments this looks to only work in firefox and safari based browsers so camino google-chrome etc work as well

548591
google-chrome	firefox
the closest cross browser thing i have come is this tested in firefox ie google-chrome and opera

548598
hard-drive	floppy
i ve dumped out the boot blocks from my thumb drives and have found both floppy and hard-drive formats

548610
order	add
since the rtd interface is an idispatch interface you will have to inherit your class from idispatchimpl and to add idispatch to the com_interface_map using com_interface_entry2 in order to specify that it s implemented through the irtdserver

548610
shutdown	exit
if your app has user-interface you will have to modify the shutdown logic so that when the user closes the user-interface the app does not exit untili the last com reference to your objects has been released as well

548613
ruby	php
i d prefer to do this in either php c c++ python or ruby

548620
bison	yacc
the usual versioning for c is lexx yacc or flex bison and the easiest way to do it is construct a parsing tree

548624
binary-tree	tree
and then when you have the expression in binary-tree form you can then parenthesize up from the tree s leaves up to the root

548624
bison	yacc
and of course you could compile a full-fledged parsing via yacc bison

548630
protected	public
we don t have this problem in c# because there are namespaces and private protected and public keyword to denote visibility

548635
postgresql	mysql
openoffice.org users however can choose to connect to external full-featured sql database such as mysql postgresql and even oracle through odbc or jdbc drivers

548662
python	ruby
i want to print out some syntax-highlighted ruby and python code and netbeans has a feature on the file menu for print to html

548662
plugins	add-on
i m wondering if there is a plugins or some add-on for eclipse that enables a feature like this since it is my preferred ide

548664
quirks-mode	doctype
put a doctype in to force the browser into compliance rather than quirks-mode

548664
contains	elements
minimize box model issues by minimizing the use of contains borders or by giving invisible borders to other similar elements and nesting elements to minimize padding margin border combos which will just cause you grief

548669
directory	folder
why not check the current directory to see if it s a temp folder

548688
sql-server	oracle
you can download any of the following for free on multiple platforms....php ruby sql-server oracle java c c# ..

548691
data-access	nhibernate
i have a query about the microsoft s enterprise library data-access application block and nhibernate

548691
data-access	nhibernate
we have decided to go for designing our data-access layer either with msel or nhibernate

548696
insert-into	declare
if you have arbitrary xml files you want to insert-into a db table declare an xml column sql2005+ and simply insert the data as string

548696
xsd	xml
if you have xml files adhering to an xml schema you can declare an xml schema collection using the xsd bind the xml column to that xml schema collection and insert the data

548696
xsd	xml
sql-server will validate every inserted xml value against that xsd

548700
uinavigationcontroller	uiview
this is from a uiview inside a uinavigationcontroller

548704
python	ruby
you should at least glance in ruby and python direction to get yourself acquainted with the idea of dynamic languages

548705
scheme	lisp
in lisp scheme a function is thought of a piece of code and examining a function simply means examining its code

548705
scheme	lisp
similarly as in your question in lisp scheme you would write a derive function that differentiates correctly when given expressions and just errors out or returns garbage on arbitrary inputs

548707
shell	bash
i find that shell script syntax bash for example doesn t support decent data structures

548707
python	java
if you were taught with java learn a dynamic language like python or perl and a low-level language like c or pascal

548720
shell	bash
i prefer bash for interactive shell however

548720
linux	unix
i don t know how to automate it however. but if you plan on finding a job in the unix linux world you must be familiar with the command line so that you don t take 5 minutes to do a 30 second job

548729
configuration	logging
debugging messages can be turned on off via logging configuration

548732
controllers	routes
if you are developing an asp.net-asp.net-mvc website that will result in the issue above as the asp.net-mvc routing system is configured to reject explicit requests to the pages and process only requests through the proper routes to the controllers

548737
profiling	debugging
strange i had to use an entitlements.plist with the get-task-allow checked for debugging profiling and unchecked for distribution profiling for the respective profilings to work

548745
attributes	properties
once you understand the life cycle of a session you might want to look into the isinitiating isterminating and isoneway properties that can be specified for operationcontract attributes on the methods of the service contract

548749
row	col
somewhere on so i read that 2d arrays in c++ are simply syntatic sugar for 1d arrays of nm size and you can access elements via row + col width

548751
boost	stl
does it make sense to restrict yourself to the stl libraries when learning c++ and then tackle boost and its additions after you have become fairly proficient with vanilla c++

548756
conditional	operators
which turns the pseudo-function s parameter list into a bunch of expression separated by the comma operators that will never be evaluated since the conditional always returns the void 0 result

548756
debugging	trace
i think this can be useful for eliminating debugging trace function calls which are generally never combined into a larger expression but beyond that i think it s a dangerous technique

548761
.net	wcf
having said that .net sockets do not natively communicate with wcf

548761
.net	wcf
whether you are using tcpclient or raw sockets in .net to connect to and communicate with wcf does not matter

548761
udp	tcp
the answer points out that tcp + binary serialization or udp + binary

548763
python	perl
then learn something useful -- perl and python are good bets for someone with limited time resources

548773
zipfile	archive
instead of bundling the application in just a zipfile bundle it in a self-extracting archive and write a scripting for default extract path and what file to execute when extracted

548774
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
strings equals case-sensitive equalsp case-insensitive

548779
boost	stl
if there s functionality provided by the stl but not boost concentrate on learning those bits of the stl

548784
postgresql	mysql
mysql can do it and also postgresql

548789
python	ruby
modules in ruby have different purpose than modules in python

548789
python	ruby
but modules in ruby could also be used in similar way as in python just to group methods in some namespace

548791
scheme	lisp
lisp are the only ones with a regular syntax at the core and well-defined standards in the case of cl and scheme

548791
common-lisp	lisp
there are good and free beginner s books on it check out lamkins successful lisp and seibel s practical common-lisp

548799
python	perl
ideally this is usually done from a perl or python script but it ll work from c# as well

548813
constructor	object
the prototype can only portably be set during object creation via a constructor function s prototype property

548827
boost	stl
i d suggest getting a clear handle on stl before looking at boost

548827
boost	stl
boost is meant to build on top of stl and many of the libraries are slated to become part of the standard library eventually

548827
boost	stl
boost libraries are generally less mature and less standard than stl

548832
shell	bash
on a nix system your account will be associated with a particular shell gnu bash is a popular choice

548832
shell	bash
and it so happens than in bash and most other posix compliant shell the tilde character expands as a shortcut to your home directory

548848
boost	stl
once you re past the basic with c++ learning how to use parts of stl and then how it works will be better than tackling boost

548855
postgresql	firebird
it s a cross platform framework on top of wxpython which supports mysql postgresql firebird and sqlite

548859
boost	stl
the principles used to design the stl are built upon and expanded on by the boost libraries

548859
boost	stl
if you don t and boost ends up hard to follow you can go back to the stl to get your bearings

548869
reflection	runtime
alternatively if the name of the jar class is only known at runtime you can create a new class-loader load the said class and invoke main via reflection

548875
checkbox	button
an alternative to a checkbox in this case could be a togglebutton or normal button control

548877
value	field
i am using the string value as an input to a stored procedure which takes in only integer types for that field

548894
double-quotes	spaces
note it is recommended to always use double-quotes around your file full path in case that path or that file name include spaces

548902
overlay	slide
i have an overlay that i want to slide in my cocoa-touch application

548921
contains	any
this is one difference between linking with a static library and a plain object file - a static library is not merely glued like any object file into the executable but still contains separate tables which are referred to on loading

548921
windows	ms-dos
i believe that this is in contrast to the much simpler static libraries in ms-dos and classic windows .lib files but there may be more to those than i remember

548921
g++	gcc
and you would have to use ld directly and not gcc g++ to link to avoid linking with the dynamic versions as well

548921
g++	gcc
libstdc++ for that reason is tightly coupled with gcc and code compiled with one version of g++ will in general only work with the libstdc++ from with this or a very similar version of g++

548963
command-line	cmd
for this you could try the --force cmd in the mysql cmd-line to skip over failed executions however be aware that this might not correctly restore your data

548966
json	xml
data can be sent to the server and the data returned can be json xml html or whatever you like really

548966
json	xml
json and html are probably the most common with xml next

548976
object-reference	instances
there are two specific phrases in the error message object-reference and instances of an object

548976
constructor	object
at creation time the object properties are defined by the constructor method called to create the object

548976
object-reference	instances
in this example my_int is the object-reference to an integer object instances being created

548976
object-reference	instances
if you try to access my_int before assign it a reference to an integer instances then you would have the error an object-reference my_int not set to an instances of an object integer

548985
animation	rotation
add the animationdidfinish delegate method and setup the animation again for another rotation

548999
value	field
in the second field we assign the current value of ip_address to the variables

549020
having	select
i m familiar with the imagemap concept from html i m just used to having editors that allow you to select areas visually like drawing a hotspot on the image itself and the software generates the html itself

549021
google-code	bitbucket
many are listed on django plug g ables and most are hosted on google-code github or bitbucket

549059
display	width
as you can see in the image above i have a member menu the links in the member menu differ slightly from time to time - to notify the member of some events also as you see in the image the member name is display next to the menu as the member name is chosen by the member it varies in width from one member to another and i m worried it could become too wide for some members which will cause the member name to be display below the menu not to the left of it so in case the member name is too long i want to hide a part of it using overflow hidden so that it fits on stays on the same line

549061
pointers	stack
as for implementation from what i remember of dce user-mode threads which i think were the precursor to the current pthreads each thread had a single structure which stored things like instruction pointers stack pointers register contents and so on

549061
linked-list	arrays
the pointer pointed to a arrays linked-list in some implementations of key pointer pairs so each thread could have multiple keys one for strtok one for rand

549085
32-bit	16-bit
some 32-bit architectures take longer to retrieve and operate on 16-bit elements

549114
text-align	display
edit another solution would be to set text-align right to your container and display inline to d1 and d2

549118
uclibc	libc
i assume you checked this and i know that uclibc is intended to be a lightweight but rather full standard c library but do not forget that c++ code is hardly independent on the c library and g++ and libstdc++ depend on quite some delicate things i remember problems with libc on some proprietary unix versioning so i would not just assume that g++ or the gnu libstdc++ actually works with uclibc without trying - i don t recall seeing it mentioned in the uclibc pages

549147
external	host
if you create your own code library in a swf external to the main swf this will be cached by the browser for all requests to the same host so multiple swf files using the same code library on the same host will benefit from this

549174
ftp	ssh
you could use it to write a tool which accepts requests via some other protocol http or unix domain sockets ftp ssh or whatever and triggers file transfers over a long running ssh connection

549177
device-manager	driver
i figured the scrambled screen indicated a problem with the graphics driver and i disabled it in device-manager and tried the setup again

549212
icollection	ienumerator
here s a small function i m using to determine if an object is a collection which will be enumerator as well since icollection is also ienumerator

549226
value	field
table2 is the child has its own identity-column childid the foreign key field parentid and its own value childvalue

549234
haskell	erlang
i haven t used to write haskell or f# but for example below code in erlang should state as example how to do it in functional language

549275
animation	rotation
in that case i split the rotation animation into half-circle rotations made them cumulative and set the number of half rotations as the repeat count

549278
boost	stl
but stl can be learned in isolation whereas boost won t make much sense until you understand the stl since that s what boost is modeled on and designed to extend

549278
standard-library	boost
and then you can move on to boost which is more or less the second standard-library these days

549284
iteration	tuples
struct can be represented as tuples allowing iteration over their fields

549284
deep-copy	object
i once wrote a function templates that could deep-copy any struct as long as no runtime polymorphic class object which compile time reflection simply can t work on were involved

549285
gnome	kde
then most systems have some other information stored about users like their long or full name which is nicer to read and therefore many user interfaces windows-xp mac os and i guess also some newer unix desktop interfaces like gnome and kde display on desktop login choosers messages etc

549287
groovy	scala
like scala jruby groovy boo etc

549289
scala	java
i m saying real-world because some will claim others starting with lisp were first here but i believe scala s java compatibility object-oriented features type system etc

549293
contains	set
take those whose immediate following sibling does not belong to that set closed or not contains 763

549294
type-inference	currying
some features of note include type-inference generators multimethods optional duck-typing macros true closures currying and first-class-functions

549302
python	ruby
how do you search a websites source code with ruby hard to explain but heres the code for doing it in python

549310
chip	fpga
the way we ve broken the problem down to this point leaves us something that is quite analogous to how sa algorithms are applied to the automated layout and router of asic chip fpga s and also the placement and router of printed circuit boards of which there is quite a bit of published work on optimizing that type of problem form

549314
safari	opera
is there a guide on a safe subset of css which can be used across browsers ie6 ie7 ff1 ff2 safari opera

549316
json	xml
lately well ever since i ve started using it actually json has been around and appears to be a real alternative to xml

549324
reasoning	rule
i guess the caller was wrong to want a simple rule of thumb to enable efficient reasoning about code behaviour

549326
json	xml
xml is very verbose where json requires extra attention in processing it due to security

549326
json	xml
there is not really a best practice personally if i would choose between json and xml i would use json

549330
margins	padding
even some of the most basic attributes like margins padding float can cause things to look different between ie and everything else

549331
firefox	opera
i recommend developing for firefox opera w3 spec then using conditional comments for ie6 7

549337
json	xml
we generally prefer xml because it has some advantages over json like

549337
json	xml
xml can be validated while json has no validator

549337
json	xml
xml is extensible unlike json

549345
json	xml
json versus xml seems to be an ongoing debate - i d rather go with json since it is a better fit for web services that power mashups and ajax widgets because it is essentially serialized javascript objects and thus easy to use with javascript

549345
json	xml
you can find some extensive comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of json and xml on json or xml which format to choose

549345
json	xml
and the ajax response xml html or json

549354
compact-framework	.net
i m looking for a toolkit to allow me to draw lines and boxes at design time in visual studio 2008 for .net compact-framework 2.0

549364
session-cookies	cookies
otherwise you ll have a redirection loop which can be caused if the ajax response doesn t set a session cookies accordingly assuming you use session-cookiess to track user session

549365
strong-typing	types
strong-typing avoids treating one types as another improperly

549365
ironpython	ironruby
where a dynamic language is more appropriate use ironruby or ironpython

549414
json	xml
if your web application does a lot of asynchronous loading and rendering on the client side parsing large datasets of xml or json or many dom modifications it can be relevant to include the browser tier to measure the end user experience

549422
arrays	loops
however you ll still need to use two loops to iterate over all the items in the 2d jagged arrays

549425
javascript	dom
you could create the elements in the dom using javascript instead of just dropping them into the innerhtml of the div something like the following untested

549428
inline-assembly	assembly
if you are really inclined to use intel syntax inline-assembly within c code compiled with gcc and assembled with gas do not forget to also add the following after it so that the assembler can grok the rest of the at t syntax assembly generated by gcc

549437
emacs	vim
i m 17 and i started using emacs when i was 14 and vim when i was 15

549441
hide	show
the better alternative is to place that code in the page load the value based off the id s and show hide it if necessary

549453
javascript	dom
the objects created from json are standard javascript objects therefore you can easily use jquery selectors to create or access dom elements and insert content from your json objects

549467
arrays	loops
you would probably need to loops through the arrays to find the letter then print out the location

549470
filtering	sorting
if so you may need to bind the view directly to the arrays s content propertyâ or to the original arrays on the underlying object and suffer the loss of free filtering and sorting

549485
python	perl
gtk qt windows etc.. just an fyi this includes any scripting language that you program a gui in python perl etc.

549489
arrays	loops
loops through the arrays s indexes and return the current path when you find what you want

549503
constructor	object
the constructor of userdataprovider could instantiate a global instance of the data context object for reuse

549511
external	host
are there any other potential disadvantages to this subdomain external hosting approach using a free blog host

549518
panels	grid
when current ribbon panels is people below ribbon is displayed grid with people data

549521
fltk	gtk
recently i had the opportunity to work with both wxwindows and qt while some time ago i wrote some small programs using fltk and gtk

549521
python	c++
if a gui program has to perform some intense computations just develop a core library in c or c++ but keep the interface in python or whatever other interpreted language

549523
json	xml
i think the debates on json versus xml show that json can be a best-practice

549545
progress-bar	progress
instead i d like to have single progress-bar that inform about global progress

549570
versioning	upgrade
the correct answer now is to ship a single binary and offer your paid versioning through in app upgrade

549572
swing	swt
swt could also be an option but so far i ve been happy with swing

549575
svn	rcs
there s a custom checkout process so i can t use the svn rcs method

549618
instance-variables	local-variables
there s no language-defined meaning - it s just a convention some people use to distinguish instance-variables from local-variables

549618
instance-variables	local-variables
alternatively some people like to prefix the local-variables and parameters instead of the instance-variables

549638
triggers	insert
you d just need a triggers so that when you insert update the title description it removes all existing t d entries and replaces with the new ones

549649
ondestroy	oncreate
create the class in the oncreate and free it in the ondestroy of the form

549662
postgresql	mysql
for postgresql or mysql you might check out sphinx

549679
webserver	upload
my understanding is that where the file is upload is actually a function of the webserver not cf itself

549693
google-chrome	firefox
then what s going on that in firefox google-chrome steel android browser and ie 6 the page loads and does not execute anything in schedulegrid.js

549737
stderr	stdout
because it will mix the original stdout and stderr

549748
methods	extend
extend is a methods of list which modifies it but doesn t return self returning none instead

549771
unique	words
you would need a unique constraint on the combination photoid words to ensure you don t have repetition in that table

549776
file-descriptor	dev-null
you expected the last quoted redirection to be applied to the ones before it on every output so that output the original standard output file-descriptor 1 will go to dev-null and output to the standard error file-descriptor 2 will go to the original standard output

549776
shell	bash
if using an interactive shell which supports that extension bash and some other implementations do but not all and it is not standard you can also do it like this

549776
driver	kernel
this may be better - it can save some time because when the command tries to write to standard output the call to write may fail immediately without waiting for a context switch into the kernel and the driver handling dev-null depending on the system call implementation - some may catch this in the libc function and some may also have special handling for dev-null

549789
put	get
get a button and a listbox on a form and put this in the button_click

549790
.doc	xls
ole 2 compound .document format based files include most microsoft office files such as xls and .doc as well as mfc serialization api based file formats

549790
xlsx	docx
office openxml format based files include the new 2007+ xml based file formats including microsoft office files such as xlsx docx and pptx

549817
compareto	equals
equals should also be consistent with compareto though this is not strictly necessary

549820
contains	elements
contains the specified elements

549823
methods	extend
i would extend the list class to add unique-testing code to whatever methods of the list you are using

549841
progress-bar	progress
the progress-bar can update itself accordingly mapping the total of the operations expected times to its total and the total of the operations progress times to its current progress in whatever way makes sense for your progress-bar framework

549849
base-class	inherited
my understanding is that in c++ a methods made virtual in the base-class is virtual all the way down the inherited hierarchy but if there are any tricks in c++ to accomplish i d be interested in hearing about them

549881
any	set
by default it will pass no variables to the constructor and hence the initial render will happen without any of your properties set

549927
vb.net	vba
if you have considerable code in vba i would suggest first moving it to vb.net making this first and most error prone transition easier then migrating that to c# if that is your desire

549934
mousemove	mouseup
i think you can implement your own easily using flowlayoutpanel and mouseup mousedown mousemove events of the controls where you change the location property approximately and flowlayoutpanel should handle it

549945
arrays	loops
then loops through the arrays and update sorting with primary keys

549956
maven-release-plugin	release
you can use the maven-release-plugin when doing a release

549961
superclass	accessor
the list is defined in a superclass but the hibernate annotations are applied to property accessor in a subclass

549965
contains	any
the compilation error occurs if i attempt to use any code contains in my app code folder

549973
triggers	insert
where a database triggers alters the object state upon insert or update

549979
visual-c++	dev-c++
what are the differences between dev-c++ and visual-c++

549979
visual-c++	dev-c++
dev-c++ uses gcc visual-c++ uses own compiler

549979
visual-c++	dev-c++
i tried to compile a program written in visual-c++ with dev-c++ and it didn t work

549992
python	perl
if you want to do a data munging job you might be better off with a scripting language like perl or python

549992
python	perl
good free windows distributions of both perl and python can be found at www.activestate.com

549992
python	perl
there are also some utility libraries such as pyexcelerator xlrd and xlwt for python and spreadsheet writeexcel spreadsheet parseexcel for perl

549999
filtering	sorting
i can t give up using an arrays controller because i need the filtering and sorting and because there s an nstableview bound to the same controller

550001
transparency	frame
i ve found how to create a windows without a frame but there doesn t seem to be any obvious way to make it transparency

550002
protected	public
so if you don t export all your class it s usable by client code as far as it don t have any public or protected function definition in a cpp file

550012
arrays	loops
also you are recreating you to_do_this_week arrays on every iteration of the loops which would wipe it clean

550021
value	field
typically the choices that i see are a using a label and assigning the text field or b simply entering a string value directly where you want your html to appear

550026
uisearchbar	uitableview
i m trying to set up an app with a uitabviewcontroller and one of the tabs will have a uitableview and uisearchbar but no navigation controller

550027
version-control	git
i have a dedicated ubuntu-server using git for version-control

550027
gitosis	repo
gitosis aims to make hosting git repo

550028
googletest	cppunit
personally i don t think the test framework googletest boost test cppunit etc matters that much

550054
visual-c++	dev-c++
you touched upon one of the differences between ms visual-c++ and dev-c++ and its cousins also using gcc under the covers

550059
defined	declare
you can inspect udt instances using the typelib information component at run-time as long as your udt s are declare public and are defined within a public class

550059
value	field
part 3 creating a custom iterator class that allows you easily iterate through the fields of any public udt and get field names and value

550059
value	field
the first thing to do is to create a simple wrapper class that will hide the details of the tli.memberinfo class from calling code and make it easy to get a udt s field s name and value

550073
firefox	opera
also we test our sites in firefox safari ie6 ie7 and opera

550097
versioning	upgrade
keep in mind this is not upgrade proof - you will probably have to do this again if you upgrade your versioning of wordpress

550115
javascript	dom
any dom element can be setup to receive a multitude of javascript events including click events

550119
execution	exit
it can only continue execution or exit

550129
pdfbox	itext
although i do know about itext pdfbox and various other java pdf libraries i am hoping for a pointers to some working example or some how-to

550151
meta-inf	jar
services configuration file may be in the saxon jar meta-inf services javax.xml.transform.transformerfactory

550202
ultrawingrid	ultrawebgrid
infragistics ultrawebgrid asp.net and ultrawingrid windows forms support grouping and can be setup as edittable grids

550215
constructor	object
one way to do this is to make both the constructor and the destructor private and enforce object creation through a class factory function which creates the the object on the heap and returns a pointer to it

550221
.net	wcf
wcf services are present in the .net 3.0 and 3.5 frameworks

550243
cgpoint	cgrect
a cgpoint is a c struct and so are cgrect s and cgsize s

550246
nssearchfield	nstableview
i have a simple cocoa user-interface with a list of items and a search field implemented using nstableview and nssearchfield respectively

550279
button	popup
you should be looking at the nsarraycontroller you ve bound the popup button to not the popup button itself

550279
button	popup
if you re doing it right the popup button will observe the deletion automatically

550288
arrays	loops
using i as a loops counter is more common than ncount or similar especially for arrays indexes

550303
blacklist	whitelist
from there you can check a whitelist blacklist and act appropriately

550316
python	perl
can the defect be reproduced programatically with a perl or python script

550322
push	pull
so after much push and pull i m curious..

550341
ubuntu	debian
if the machine doesn t have apt-get then chances are it isn t a debian or ubuntu machine which means that using a tutorial designed for debian or ubuntu is unlikely to get you very far

550365
getter	setter
in objective-c 2.0 it s easy to declare these properties and automatically synthesize the getter setter so there s not much excuse for not using them

550365
getter-setter	initializer
the reason the ivar should be used directly in these cases is beacuse the getter-setter may have side effects that depend on a fully initializer instances thus making them dangerous in -init and -dealloc where the state of the object is fully initializer

550365
getter	setter
prefixing with _ works and is relatively common i believe the synthesize d setter and getter will automatically do the right thing in this case but you may have to explicitly set the _ivar as the backing

550382
debugging	trace
wer even collates all the stack trace so you know which crashes are duplicates which is helpful when you don t feel like debugging thousands of duplicate crashes

550411
ruby-on-rails	django
java ee competes with frameworks like ruby-on-rails and django that expect the developer to unit test his code against a real database dedicated especially for that purpose

550419
python	java
though i love ruby and rails and would not part with them for web development or perhaps for a domain specific language i prefer heavy data lifting of the type you describe be performed in java or perhaps python or even c++

550438
templating	jinja2
jinja2 is a django-ish templating system that has a sandboxing feature

550446
py2exe	exe
is there a way using py2exe or some other methods to generate dll files instead of exe files

550446
python	c++
i would want to basically create a normal win32 dll with normal functions but these functions would be coded in python instead of c++

550452
any	set
since the test methods doesn t actually change any data best practice is to set it const as follows

550461
expression	evaluation
this gives you object access via header and the scriptinging code in the scripting block as do next evaluates only the first expression and returns the result of the expression and the positioning in the code block after that evaluation

550465
datagrid	listbox
add multiple grouping via propertygroupdescriptor to the collectionviewsource then use a listbox datagrid with multiple groupstyles

550474
python	ruby
i have also learn that we can program with ruby and python on mac

550485
perl	ruby
as a perlite i m just going to point out that os x has perl as well as python or ruby

550485
perl	ruby
as far as perl python ruby goes programs are almost completely cross-platform

550485
perl	ruby
it is fairly easy to run a perl python ruby program on any platform and it works more or less the same

550499
python	ruby
ruby and python are useful scripting languages and there are also bridges to write cocoa applications

550509
communication	messages
what we had was the cameras connect to a lan and with messages passing was very easy to communication with them is the same that communication with any pc

550516
python	ruby
ruby s object model is closer to that of objective-c than is python so i suggest also learning ruby but not until you have your objective-c skills down solidly

550520
contains	set
you also used single quotes instead of double quotes so the value set was exactly the string shown rather than contains the expanded value of home

550521
configuration	installation
otherwise it s just one extra assembly to xcopy - no configuration or installation or anything like that

550547
.when	ready
but you don t need the function inside your .get callback - passing a function to actually binds an event handler to the ready event which only gets called .when your page is first loading

550548
conditional	operators
i have to say that i also have a cast-to-long-double operators for my class that works without exception-handling only under certain conditional

550564
double	int
but your function matches the second argument by a standard conversion sequence from int to long double integral to floating-point-conversion

550564
double	int
even though a standard conversion sequence converting from int float double to long double is better than a user-defined conversion sequence converting from myclass to long double your operator version is not chosen because your other parameter long double requires a conversion from the argument which is worse than what the builtin operator needs for that argument perfect match

550565
double	int
edit you ve updated your question to suggest that your conversion is to long double and your comparison is against an int

550565
double	int
either t s operator long double is called and the built-in operator for long double and int is used or d must be promoted to a long double and your member operator is used

550568
double	int
i assume you are comparing against a literal int and not a long double

550568
double	int
built-in conversion int to long double

550570
carbon	cocoa
in addition to carbon fsgetvolumeinfo which returns a fsvolumeinfo containing signature and filesystemid fields there is the cocoa -getfilesysteminfoforpath method of class nsworkspace which returns a string representation of filesystem type hfs for hfs+ and msdos for dos fat

550579
json	xml
but in my opinion it s better and easier to use json instead of xml it s more easier to work with it last lines of get function

550581
host	dns
in your case since you have no servername directives apache supposedly uses a reverse dns lookup on the ip-address to fake a server name and presuming that the reverse dns leads to domain.com which doesn t match apache then defaults to the first virtual host

550585
python	ruby
python and ruby on the other hand are available on a large number of platforms including both windows and many unix-dialects

550585
python	ruby
note also that both python and ruby have objective-c bridges available which allows you to write quite fancy cococa applications in any of those languages

550589
hide	show
you can then use the visibility on each element to show hide them

550589
hide	show
setting grid2.visibility to visible hidden will show hide your overlay content

550611
webforms	asp.net
i have done a lot of asp.net webforms in the past but this is not enough to create great web site without loosing time on compatibility css javascript issue

550629
nsstring	nsdata
i wanna have a nsstring object as nsdata

550633
pixels	line
i would like to identify the line in the graph - if i can indentify the positioning of the pixels in the frame i believe i can get back the value x y which were used to plot the graph

550636
ndepend	fxcop
a client i work for has begun using ndepend as a replacement for fxcop and the architect has compiled a list of practically unusable cql queries which i gather he has taken from advice from the ndepend website

550643
mootools	extjs
for javascript jquery prototype mootools extjs

550654
visio	dia
i m not after something that will do pretty diagram that take ages to do btw. like visio dia kudos the the dia developers though kick ass app etc

550667
authentication	login
i create a login authentication with username and password to access to the application with linq tosql to store data and it is right

550677
declarative	imperative
now you can use role-based security either declarative or imperative

550680
sql-server	mysql
i will be implementing this for a c# application that uses linq-to-entities with sql-server and mysql as dbmses

550685
contains	elements
but does he want that every elements must contains some nonspace text

550685
contains	elements
or are there some elements that must contains at least something and other elements where

550690
32-bit	64bit
i was thinking if there is a simpler and less expensive considering that this is timing code way to do such scaling than doing the equivalent of iterative 64bit multiplication and division with two 32-bit integers

550700
webforms	asp.net
i have read all the post regarding the pro and con of asp.net webforms vs mvc

550700
asp.net-mvc	webforms
however i m wondering under what circumstance does one use webforms or asp.net-mvc

550709
authentication	login
formsauthentication.redirectfromloginpage will redirect to login page when you didn t set authentication cookie or when your login page is a home default page of the application -

550710
asp.net-mvc	webforms
typical business application with lots of controls their behavior rules with enabling disabling them in response to the events fired by other controls would be a lot more complicated task with asp.net-mvc while with webforms you can do it during a coffee-pause

550710
protected	public
webforms do not offer that convenience however for internal applications or the public ones protected by customer login it is no concern at all

550714
order	add
i want to add a textbox on a web page in order for users to add space delimited tags

550723
web-config	app-config
it integrates with various components and relies on an app-config or web-config

550732
double	int
you ll need 64-bit int and double floating-point

550735
firefox	safari
full seo compatible supports firefox ie6 and safari and degrades gracefully on other browsers

550756
textbox	button
how can i make a textbox that allows users to enter tabs and does not send the user to the next element when the tab button is pressed

550757
having	select
you generate the compound select statement in vb.net having split the delimited tag string

550757
union-all	union
if there might be duplicate tags and you want to remove duplicates use union instead of union-all

550767
onkeydown	onkeyup
onkeypress onkeyup or onkeydown check the key that was pressed and if it is a tab then append t to the textbox and return false so that focus remains on the textbox

550781
asp.net-mvc	webforms
as time goes by i find it very hard to use webforms against asp.net-mvc for anything new

550788
webforms	asp.net
my opinion is asp.net webforms more suitable for application that use it in intranet internal systems because it have a bunch of controls

550792
versioning	upgrade
we have a table that stores the versioning number of the latest patch applied - so upgrade tools can apply any newer patches

550792
contains	any
our release database also contains sanitised starter data which is deleted or sometimes adopted modified before a new installation goes live - so this is not include in any update scripting

550809
callback	methods
consider an event to be a callback interface where the interface has only one methods

550812
json	xml
this could be xml or json if they have the capability to parse that or if they just want to embed an iframe in their page it could return plain html

550829
python	ruby
python ruby in parallel for a while

550829
python	ruby
ruby and python yes

550829
python	ruby
learning objective-c now does not prevent you from learning python or ruby in the future

550832
button	popup
anyone familiar with the photoshop toolbar interface will know what i m after the user can either click the button and start working with the selected tool or pick one of the tools from the popup menu that appears upon click and from that point on the button will represent that tool

550832
selected	button
also the button will have the checked property set to true when that tool-family is selected

550854
json	xml
i d recommend html xml and json

550854
json	xml
html for clients that want to use a iframe or have a javascript do a document.write xml and json for clients that want to process the data before outputting it either with client-side javascript or serverside using whatever language they re using

550855
benchmarking	profiling
if you really believe that piece of code to be a performance bottleneck profiling or benchmarking it both ways

550856
ruby-on-rails	django
anyway this is not built into php its framework dependent as with ruby-on-rails or django

550879
linux	unix
not rocket science but not trivial either for the occasional linux unix user like myself -

550899
json	xml
you need just evaluate json code from response instead of parsing xml

550901
push	pull
this is the default remote used when you type git fetch or git pull to retrieve new commits into your local repository and the default destination when you git push to push your new local commits out to a remote repository

550903
python	perl
an exact equivalent of your python example in perl would look like this

550907
unit-testing	expectations
when doing unit-testing you can then substitute a mock wrapper that has expectations for the method calls and responses

550915
python	c++
i use all the languages c++ ruby python and objective-c

550915
python	ruby
you can t do that in a seamless way in python and ruby

550915
python	c++
apart from that ruby python and objective-c are very similar in their object model at least compared to c++

550915
python	ruby
in objective-c ruby and python classes are things created at runtime

550929
entity-framework	nhibernate
my choices are basically down to nhibernate or linq entity-framework

550940
onkeydown	onkeyup
try onkeydown or onkeyup instead

550966
taglib-sharp	taglib
there are a number of libraries to help you access the tags taglib is a popular choice taglib-sharp for .net apps

550974
fwrite	fclose
try using the fopen fwrite fread and fclose functions for the most basic file i o

550974
fputs	fgets
there are other functions that can help such as printf fscanf fputs and fgets

550979
versioning	upgrade
your best bet is to upgrade to the next versioning of windows7 when it comes out and hope it permanently fixes the issue

550988
cvs	git
i doubt any generic version control system git svn cvs etc. can handle database in the ways you described

550999
entity-framework	nhibernate
so right at this moment linq2sql is great and you can get up and running with it quite quickly without necessarily having to dive into the inner workings of it expression trees etc. but for the future i d recommend entity-framework nhibernate as i believe these two orm s will be the ones in majority use over the next few years by most .net dev teams

551010
entity-framework	nhibernate
once you use entity-framework a little bit you ll either be satisfied with it or you ll wonder what the big deal is with nhibernate and some of the others mentioned in related questions

551026
arguments	default
not everybody knows the concept of a default arguments

551031
push	pull
when a is happy he will git push to push the newly merged changes to the shared repo and b and c can git pull to fetch them

551043
value	field
notice that for some field the value are replaced - for instance general- output directory - while in others they are aggregated for instance c++- general- additional include directory the value of the proper configuration are added to the value inherited

551046
directory	folder
we make a complete directory listing all drives and folder to a text file each day

551051
panels	grid
at the moment the puzzle grid is drawn on a panels in the app s main windows using a painteventhandler

551068
activerecord	datamapper
if what you want is to compare activerecord ruby-on-rails and datamapper hibernate the data source architectural patterns chapter from patterns of enterprise application architecture is a good place to start

551109
maya	mel
have you tried searching user-interface item names in mel files under maya installation directory

551122
double	int
the built-in operator long double int

551126
malloc	free
i believe they simply override the memory allocation and deallocation methods malloc free which has some logic that keeps track of the pointers

551144
interpreter	runtime
you re forcing the runtime system to incorrectly interpreter bits of memory but in this case it s not going to crash because the bits all make sense

551149
stream	send
we can make this better by introducing a new class that acts like a stream and that actually send each output to two streams at once

551152
pointers	stack
you still need a way to check if pointers is allocated on stack

551168
lookup	any
note that this doesn t help determine how good of a programmer you are - just like knowing english without having to lookup words in the dictionary doesn t show how gooder you is at writin stuff - that s subjective and has nothing to do with a particular language as people that are good at programming are good in any language you give them

551178
typedef	struct
the above link covers commonly encountered issues typedef pointers to struct etc

551180
font-size	height
absolute positioning to offset the panels from the bottom of the page by the height of the footer works but inaccurate the footer s height depends on the current font-size and whether text is wrapped

551180
overlap	margins
this means i must leave a large margins to ensure they do not overlap

551182
httplistener	http
if you want to roll your own http server the .net httplistener class makes it really easy

551190
selected	button
when the user selects a tool from the drop down list you apply the selected tool s icon to the split button

551190
background-image	transparency
to show the selected item you can simply set the background-image to a solid-colored semi-transparent image solid black with 25 transparency

551200
solution-explorer	resource-files
in the solution-explorer when working with c++ projects there is the standard filtering of header-files resource-files and source files

551214
any	set
if you have to use a single defining question then ask yourself which better describes your situation a set of loosely related events any of which may be used or ignored or a set of closely related events which will all generally need to be handled by one observer

551227
python	c++
i m thinking about using python as an embedded scripting language in a hobby project written in c++

551230
reflection	runtime
during runtime i load the types in plugins.dll using reflection

551233
delphi	c++
if you know how to call c c++ code from delphi you should look into the zebra barcode reader

551236
domcontentloaded	onload
also greasemonkey executes the scripting after the domcontentloaded when the dom is ready event so you don t need that onload nonsense

551236
attributes	properties
also you can t use attributes to set event listeners or properties for that matter - you must use dom api for that

551251
macports	fink
of course if you re not generating the ps yourself then the simple answer is that preview sucks and you should use a better postscript viewer instead install gv through macports or fink or macgsview from here or macghostview or 22 postview

551252
python	c++
embedding python in c++

551267
widget	button
another rather annoying option is to create a wrapper in your button class for the widget move function and friends

551274
contains	set
maybe it depends on whether you set the background color directly on the uitextview or make it transparent and set the background color of its contains view

551285
data-members	constructor
instead of casting the the base class could contain a as a data-members the derived class would pass this to the base class constructor which would be an extra data-members but which avoids a cast and i think may permit composition instead of or as well as inheritance

551287
rollback	commit
the commit or rollback will be handled at the end of the service-layer call

551301
emacs	vim
the difference between emacs and vim is that emacs includes many many features and combines mail news filemanager and of course a text editor

551301
emacs	vim
i personally like vim more but give emacs a try and find the best suitable text editor for you

551310
emacs	vim
these days i use emacs for my serious editing and vim for quick things when i m ssh d into a server

551311
instances	private
plus having everything public has its own awesome perks like for instances you can unit test pretty much anything from outside which you can t really do with c++ private constructs

551334
spacing	layout
test them on a few older and less common browsers to make sure that they look acceptable and are still legible and accessible even if the fonts spacing and layout is not exactly what you want

551334
internet-explorer	firefox
if it doesn t look really good as you designed on a very common browser internet-explorer 7 and firefox 3 nowadays and more depending on your audience that s a shame - even if it s because of a browser bug

551342
emacs	vim
since emacs is much older than the extensible vim as opposed to the relatively non-extensible vi it has a much larger collection of extension modes covering almost any purpose you can imagine

551342
emacs	vim
your tool of choice can be either vim or emacs or perhaps something else but in any event take the time to learn it well

551357
version-control	git
for information lately i started using git for version-control

551361
python	perl
python is like perl in this respect

551385
google-chrome	firefox
it looks fine in firefox google-chrome safari opera even ie 6 alas not ie 5.5 but who cares

551394
emacs	vim
1 in this question emacs could be replaced with vim or any other cross-platform editor

551394
emacs	vim
this for me is the primary benefit of being fluent with emacs or vim

551406
contains	set
is it possible to restrict the character set of the encrypted string so that it doesnt contains specific character ranges

551408
google-chrome	firefox
the typical user there is not an administrator on their machine and can t change browsers say by downloading firefox or google-chrome

551413
16-bit	8bit
actually i think some 8bit controllers will have a longer lifetime than their 16-bit counterparts

551415
contains	any
so it won t contains any non-textual characters

551425
.when	ready
at this point the data should be ready to display and your presentation layer code-behind is responsible for where .when how that is performed

551429
callback	methods
if you use foreach to iterate over it then any attempt to add or remove a subscriber within one of the onfoo methods callback will triggers an exception-handling unless you write further code to deal with it cleanly

551465
python	ruby
python and ruby

551469
postdata	request
if postdata in the request does not show up it s something with the browser

551469
wamp	php
maybe your wamp setup uses fast-cgi or similar to call php so it is not using the actual php module for apache

551471
buffering	streaming
a bufferingedstreaming should buffering the underlying streaming and not more

551476
web-config	app-config
2 obtain access to each project s app-config or web-config file and modify it

551477
python	ruby
and both python and ruby are good ones to know

551477
python	ruby
it s important to note that while python is a language ruby on rails is a framework

551484
python	ruby
second you are comparing a language python with a web framework ruby on rails

551484
python	ruby
i think your best option is to try a few different frameworks in both python and ruby do the same fairly simple task in each and only then pick which one you d like to learn more about

551484
pylons	django
for python i like pylons and django

551484
python	ruby
pros and cons ruby is a little cleaner language-wise than python

551484
python	ruby
yes to both python and ruby

551495
cryptography	security
even the little it of security that is cryptography is not an issure as long as the current math holds together and we don t see the development of general quantum processors because

551501
web-config	app-config
since you have the selected projects why just don t check if project directory has web-config app-config files and if they exist then edit them

551507
python	c++
i dont mind if they are for c++ or python bindings

551517
perl	c++
just because it makse sense in perl doesn t mean it makes sense in java or c# or c++ or c or basic or...

551525
javascript-events	onclick
may affect some previously attached javascript-events unless it s inline onclick stuff

551545
postgresql	mysql
i will be running things like mysql postgresql tomcat and my own code

551559
interpreter	runtime
your compiled c# application is a language which the .net clr interpreter should have said jited reads the il compiles to native code and then invokes the compiled native code at runtime

551562
silverlight	wpf
if i were getting started in game development today i would definitely bet on silverlight and or wpf

551562
silverlight	wpf
thanks to the fact that silverlight is essentially a lightweight version of wpf it was initially introduced as wpf e where the e means everywhere you can target both without a great deal of extra effort

551562
silverlight	wpf
you can have a lightweight version free or supported by advertising of your game using silverlight in the browser and the real deal for serious gamers which uses wpf and runs on windows

551562
silverlight	wpf
better yet be the person to create an excellent gaming library which allows for easy targeting of both wpf and silverlight 3 or silverlight 2 if you don t need hardware assisted 3d rendering

551573
gentoo	debian
right off the bat i d say the major contenders are debian red hat and gentoo depending on management preferences and needs

551575
x11-forwarding	xming
putty + xming - i had to set the display environment variables manually to get things running alongside with checking enable x11-forwarding in putty - connection ssh x11

551613
puts	gets
wrote a small app that accesses a bunch of search websites and puts the results in a word document which gets run a few hundred times a day

551616
scheme	let
if your doing bit manipulation and stuff like that figure out a packing scheme for you bits and let that be your data structure

551620
linux	bsd
on posix systems bsd linux you can use mlock to lock memory in ram

551627
value	field
i can receive all my field value using

551634
typedef	struct
as for typedefs around struct you can even use the same name for the typedef and the struct something like this

551634
typedef	struct
from my point of view typdef-ing a structure is a bad idea as that hides the information that the typedef like foo is a structure and writing the keyword struct isn t really additional work especially if those typedefs get a postfix added to indicate them being a structure -- i ve seen this quite often

551652
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried in google-chrome firefox and ie7 but none work

551660
emacs	vim
if use now use and like an ide and you are already familiar with vi vim then don t give emacs a second thought

551660
emacs	vim
emacs will never replace your ide and if it could then vim would do you just fine

551666
required	checked
this works for finding the distance from each endpoint to the other line segment constraining the calculated parameter u to be no less than 0 for a line segment or ray and to be no more than 1 for a line segment but it doesn t handle the possiblity that an interior point on one line segment is closer than either endpoint because they actually intersect thus the extra checked about intersection is required

http	ssl
for http this works fine except that if you have a webserver which supports ssl session caching then the ssl session cache will be lost if the client comes back to a different server

551765
sftp	ssh
you will need to have fuse installed locally and an ssh server supporting and configured for sftp

551771
processor	cpu
just using the stopwatch class won t work and having a look at the process processor time doesn t respect the fact that the cpu time could have been consumed on another node

551778
firefox	safari
the css active link style is being correctly applied in ie7 firefox and safari but is not applied ie6

551824
multiplying	subtract
also generally speaking you shouldn t multiplying or divide by variables adding and subtract is fine though when you move them to the other side of the equation because you ll generally forget of about the conditional where the term you multiplied or divided by is zero

551853
constructor	object
if you use senocular s method by grabbing the object constructor and creating a new instance of the movieclip you end up with a new movieclip with 0 frames

551859
virtualization	vmware
but if virtualization works then vmware offers products for windows and mac that support a snapshot feature

551863
administration	account
i d like to see an iisadmin grouping which grants a developer s user account permission to manage iis without granting full administration privileges to the entire pc

551875
placeholder	required
if you need even more fine-grained positioninging then you need to put a placeholder or div or span etc on your page in the required positioning and add your control to that as in scarletgarden s answer

551877
virtualbox	vmware
if virtual machines will work for you you can choose between virtual pc vmware and virtualbox

551877
virtualbox	vmware
virtualbox supports same hosts and guests as vmware

551927
subclassing	getattr
my best guess is that the c++ getattr methods should check which will of course be the subclassing dictionary if this an instances of the subclassing and only call getattr_methodss if you fail to find name in there see the pydictionary_ api functions

551965
directory	folder
for this i need to switch off the normal mapping of url paths to directory folder in apache all requests to all paths should go to one central scripting pages.php which than analyzes the path component of the url

551970
put	get
all resources can be manipulated through a constrained set of well-known actions usually crud create read update delete represented most often through the http s post get put and delete

551970
put	get
it can be a different set or a subset though - for example some implementations limit that set to read and modify only get and put for example

551970
json	xml
the data for all resources is transferred through any of a constrained number of well-known representations usually html xml or json

551978

i can force the xslt processor to output both the opening and closing textarea tags if i place something in between like a non-breaking spaces

552061
python	perl
mainly init scripts but also i ll be writing a simple set of package manager scripts. since i m gonna be going this far off the norm and since i have never been a fan of dynamic-typed languages perl python bash and the rest are good but just not my forte i was wondering if anyone knew of an interpreted language that actually has declared variables

552065
dialog	pop-up
and the site requires either a cookie from a previous logon or a response to a pop-up dialog

552068
subclassing	base-class
seems kind of unnecessary to me - when i m writing classes like that i usually just make the base-class your isomething with no methods and mention in the actual documentation which methods subclassing are supposed to override

552123
entity-relationship	diagram
i use omni graffle for entity-relationship or class diagram and graphviz for showing flow charts state diagram really

552145
constructor	object
as with any argument to the jquery constructor passing this into the constructor transforms it into a jquery object

552145
jquery-plugins	jquery
i think the confusion comes in when remy starts talking about jquery-plugins in the same article as jquery events

552145
javascript	dom
to get around this jquery performs some javascript magic that always makes this refer to the dom element which triggered the event

552148
push	pull
what you probably should do is look up the various git workflow questions and answers - they describe the means by which various team members pull push from to each other

552149
getter	setter
in the second project the code is identical but the first thing that is called is the setter for the selectedsubscription property it is null then the getter for the subscriptions collection is called and finally the setter for the selectedsubscription is called a second time and it has a value that matches the first item in the subscriptions collection

552156
haskell	lisp
having said that as well i would recommend you learn a language like haskell or lisp as well

552158
lookup	any
that way given the lookup table is l and two referring tables x and y we can join x to y without any looking up of enum s or table l and can know with certainty that there s a row in l if when we need it

552162
google-chrome	firefox
and yeah that means it gets flagged in say firefox or google-chrome for a partially invalid ssl certificate

552177
python	ruby
rule of thumb - python if you like strict rules and ruby if you hate them

552189
gitosis	repo

552210
firefox	opera
there are lots of gotchas which are browser defendant and that you may not see unless you check in ie firefox safari opera etc

552216
associations	model
this assumes that you have setup the associations in your model

552217
input-field	checkbox
that would have the same input-field but as a checkbox with a label which explains they need to check it not to be ignored

552231
arrays	loops
note that as roborg pointed out there s overhead in creating the arrays so it should be moved inside the iteration loops

552240
fadeout	fadein
for instance when you re doing a callback after an animation or a fadein or fadeout

552241
unsigned	short
c1 is unsigned int src is unsigned short

32-bit	64bit
results for 32-bit and 64bit compilation shown

552250
pointers	stack
instead of pushing arguments onto stack or passing them through registers depending on the calling convention you would push a pointers through which you would read values

552250
value	field
this converts a reference argument into a value argument or an aggregate into scalars for internal functions with small numbers of field that are only read from

552280
build-process	nant
i m unable to replicate this in my dev environment so have no idea how to debugging our sites are compiled via a nant build-process and are all set to release mode - so no debugging info available

552281
contains	any
in this case the executable was not linked to any dll library file so it will not contains any stubs into the dll and as such the program loader has no issue running the executable

552284
firefox	opera
html5 provides window.postmessage which provides a mechanism for safe cross domain messaging and is supported by firefox 3 opera 9.6 and webkit nightlies

552293
32-bit	64bit
what happens when the extended stored procedure is invoked from a 32-bit sql-server instance running on 64bit windows

552296
json	xml
i d use json over xml since json will transfer less bytes and php s json_encode object is quick and easy

552296
json	xml
you might have a look at this article for comparison between json amfphp and xml

552307
32-bit	x86
if you selected any cpu or x86 in the project build options the dll should run as 32-bit instance

552307
32-bit	64bit
under windows 32-bit processes can t load 64bit dlls so sql-server will be running a 32-bit version of the .net runtime inside its process

552307
32-bit	64bit
so your .net assembly will also run as 32-bit even on a 64bit machine

552331
integer	zero
the integer 0 zero

552332
linux	unix
i do java on unix and win32 and php on both plus c on linux using visual-studio on windows as well

552357
value	field
if the field is a mutable object then again its value can be changed

552385
stderr	stdout
or use proc_open which gives you much more control than popen as you can specify where you want stdin stdout and stderr to be handled

552385
stdin	pipe
or you can fopen stdin or php stdin and then pipe to php

552390
binary	hex
when trying to determine the content of binary data string use repr or hex

552405
player	movie
this also means that the flash player which you get if you run the movie hosted by the flash player outside of a browser environment will not know about the window.location property this works when you deploy your movie but not when debugging

552408
shell	bash
one thing to keep in mind is that bash itself does not run your .bashrc file for a login shell

552408
execute	declare
if it is being called when you log in you can execute export -p from your shell to get a list of all the exported variables - make sure ps1 has a declare -x in front of it

552412
kerberos	ldap
apache can hook into ldap most any type of sql-server or even use kerberos authentication

552421
value	field
inject the value found in the html into the field set the value of the field on the object of type t created in the first step

552424
python	php
for me the benefits was a cleaner separation of code and the ability to reuse the acl logic in multiple places by using rest json as the bridge between say php python

552432
instance-variables	class-variables
in another word yes all class-variables are allocated before instance-variables

552433
ruby	php
for a small web application there are some great python php and ruby frameworks that ll get you off and running very quickly

552433
enterprise	platform
java is a great choice for larger projects because of the compile-time checking and enterprise libraries and platform

552433
data-structures	tree
came with the basic but tended to chicken out when it came to standardizing on things like network communications encryption graphics data file formats including xml even basic data-structures like balanced tree and hashtables were left out

552433
ruby	php
modern languages like python php ruby and java now come with a far more decent standard library and have many good third party libraries you can easily use thanks in great part to their adoption of namespaces to keep libraries from colliding with one another and garbage collection to standardize the memory management schemes of the libraries

552446
double	int
suppose i have a takeintreturndoublearrays methods in this c# library that takes an int and returns an arrays of double

552446
double	int
all i need to do is have a c++ methods that takes an int calls the c# library and returns an arrays of double to the calling application

552451
unmanaged	c++-cli
c++-cli - this allows you to have both managed and unmanaged code in the same source file

552461
filehandle	pipe
it ends with a | which means that that command is being run and it s output is being pipe in as the input for the filehandle piper

552463
instrumentation	debugging
you mention that your debuggingging skills are limited but it is actually quite easy do debugging those with the new instrumentation app

552472
attributes	properties
are there specific cases when one should use custom attributes on class instead of properties

552474
scheme	lisp
in a functional style data and functions tend toward having more in common with each other as in lisp and scheme while offering more flexibility in terms of how functions are actually used

552478
attributes	properties
in short use attributes to describe your mechanisms use properties to model the domain

552486
getter	setter
you can certainly observe readonly properties but be aware that in order for kvo to work you need to be kvc compliant - which means using either the setter getter for a property since you re readonly you don t get a setter for free via synthesize or the property s -setvalue forkey methods

552492
attributes	properties
2 creating your own custom attributes and using it to decorate a class or methods properties etc

552496
required	checked
the features in question required both compiler and runtime support and so while it is certainly possible to build a compiler that supports the syntax llvm clang comes to mind many of these features call out to the objective-c runtime and to my knowledge and quick double checked on google the gnu runtime doesn t have the necessary support

552500
postback	ajax
or any ideas as to how i can generate an image at runtime and show it on my webpage using ajax must not postback without having to save the image to any location on the hard drive

552509
g++	gcc
my question is can i call the apparently already configured gcc g++ in the iphone developer package which i already have installed like in the latter article

552509
g++	gcc
can i call them like normal or do i need to specify it s path because i m not calling the default gcc g++

552528
python	ruby
just my two cents...as i m sure you re aware apple and others in the respective communities are doing a lot of work with ruby and python for both mac and iphone development

552528
python	ruby
ruby and python will get you a lot further if you are looking beyond solely mac desktop and iphone

552540
perl	c++
do they make some new code in c++ see it works and then figure out how to do it in perl or what happens

552541
stream	send
this ashx page will generates the image stream on the fly and send it to the requesting image object

552541
javascript	dom
after you have done this in javascript access the image object via dom and set change the src property

552546
perl	ruby
i ve not used perl in a while so i m going to write this in ruby

552556
windows-xp	windows
yes at work we have a windows-xp deployed with english language because we have worldwide site and only one kind windows to deploy with only one kind of settings when it comes to language

552572
similarity	distance
you may want to use some sort of edit distance as a similarity metric to compare for various filenames

552616
callback	methods
if you want to allow cancellation â no problem let the callback methods have a return value which will indicate a need for cancellation

552622
c++	lua
once you have an api i recommend using command-pattern in lua or in c++ to create a bridge with the user-interface

552622
python	lua
i don t know lua but i know that python is a good script language to use with your commands

552628
sql-server	mysql
the above should work in sql-server but i need this to work against a mysql database

552645
sql-server	oracle
i guess sql-server has no such feature and oracle as far as i understand it does - it is rac mentioned by wuputah

552646
value	field
enum should be used to define a possible range of value for a given field

552646
value	field
this also implies that you may have multiple rows which have the same value for this perticular field

552650
pointers	stack
you could have a pointers to somewhere inside your valid memory even inside your data segment bss stack or heap but not pointing at a valid object

552656
environment	building
dev building testing servers different live environment

552670
rollback	commit
i don t think this is necessary as there is the concept of implicit commit rollback

552670
rollback	commit
error the commit or rollback behavior

552674
rollback	commit
once you either commit or rollback you ll be back in autocommit mode

552674
rollback	commit
i believe begin is implied from when you last committed or rolled back but you must either commit or rollback any queries you run

552711
sql-server	mysql
i ve been trying to specialize into the ms sql-server technologies but my job has required me to understand more mysql recently

552714
windows	ms-dos
sorry guys but that makes all of you that participated in ms-dos the mac windows c++ and java eraly majority rather than innovators

552718
configuration	logging
with this configuration we can see info level logging coming out of our application when using debugview but it is clear that this is from the

552734
ironpython	ironruby
both languages will have some level of broken backward compatibility in their next majopr release both have .net implementations ironpython is production ironruby getting there

552734
ruby-on-rails	django
both have web frameworks that reflect their strengths search so for the django ruby-on-rails debate

552734
python	ruby
if i d never seen ruby i d be very happy working in python and have done so without suffering when necessary

552749
exception-handling	try-catch
i m trying to log all exception-handling to a sql-server database through log4net and i ve seen some posts here explaining how to properly configure the web.config file but my question is do it is enough to get the exception logged the application will log automatically but in this case it does not work on my app or do i have to call the logger from code-behind into try-catch statement

552782
pointers	stack
the reason is that the debugger will always kick in but after dereferencing a null function pointers stack is shot

552783
for-loop	loops
a for-loops is evaluated as a while loops under the hood anyway

552784
while-loop	for-loop
you can think of the for-loop being a more compact way of writing the while-loop

552785
export	csv
i ve tried excelexportplugin but it is not better than export in csv

552785
formatting	import
i ve had better luck saving the whole html report isolating the html table and import it as html file in excel it keeps well all the formatting

552789
versioning	upgrade
perhaps it was a problem with a partial upgrade or a versioning mismatch on the settings

552797
for-loop	loops
however unless you need to access the i variable outside the loops then you should use the for-loops

552822
windows-vista	windows
funny thing it seems not to lose handles on windows-vista but i d be very surprised if this should be a bug in windows 7

552830
instances	self
is it somehow possible to hijack into the object factory of asp.net and do the instances creation by my self

552853
json	xml
but really the only reason to use xml in the first place instead of a more lightweight serialization format like json or yaml is to reap those benefits that standardization has to offer

552861
sql-server	mysql
this has implications particularly for enterprise class systems as the performance tuning techniques and best practice design principals that you use to optimise and design a sql-server platform will not necessarily translate to mysql

552861
sql-server	mysql
if you already have a solid understand of the sql-server database engine then i would look to develop this level of understanding with mysql starting off by looking at the different database drivers that can be used to drive the mysql engine such as inodb and myisam etc

552873
private-members	private
this is purely a coding standards question but for what it s worth i always explicitly mark private-members as private

552876
required	checked
i want to validate the data according to some simple validation logic required fields and data format and some more advanced checked of the data hierarchy

552878
startup	launch
iâ ve setup application verifier transport and startup server as microsoft activesync if i click test button it says â œconnection to device establishedâ but if i try to connect to the device it says â œunable to launch device exeâ

552895
push	pull
every repository is also a backup of the â œmain repositoryâ which is â œmainâ by convention only so a git push from the repository that did the most recent git fetch or git pull should be all it takesâ up to its state of course

552905
click	mouse
another problem when dragging images in ie is that the image becomes detached from the mouse pointers when the tool tip appears you have to release the mouse and click again on the image to re-acquire the drag

552908
push	pull
a git pull and then a git push should be enough

552917

552921
having	select
select reports my socket as having had an error by leaving the socket

553029

553032
hash	md5
also md5 hash contain only alphanumeric characters all of which are safe to use pretty much anywhere

553064

it looks like sql-server and oracle have solutions to this but i don t know anything about them

553064
sql-server	mysql
i ve seen this done with mysql but not sql-server

553086
browser-cache	caching
if you put styles in external css file and set a caching expiry of say 1 month then during this time all users will have very low start delays because only the content that has changed will be downloaded the styles will be reused from your browser-caching

553097
usergroups	userid
public sub logevent byval userid as string byval usergroups as string

553100

553155
command-prompt	command-line
if you have visual-studio installed in the start menu under visual-studio tools you can open a visual-studio command-prompt that will set up all required environment and path variables for command-line compilation

553155
msbuild	nant
while it s very handy to know of this you should combine it with knowledge of some sort of build tool such as nant msbuild finalbuilder etc

553155
environment	building
these tools provide a complete building environment not just the basic compiler

553156
command-prompt	cmd
you can build your class files within the vs cmd-prompt so that all required environment variables are loaded not the default windowss cmd windows

553160
subclipse	svnkit
svnkit was specifically developed with subclipse in mind so no surprises there

553160
subclipse	svnkit
the subclipse guys support svnkit but i ve had issues with it in the past that was several years ago

553188
msbuild	nant
msbuild nant etc

553212
value	field
2 rows can be order based on the value of any of their field

553219
any	set
although i prefer the first solution just to remind me that it s set to zeros the compiler shouldn t generate any code for this unless it s brain-dead

553221
contains	elements
the javascript is looking for an elements contains in the noscript

553223
unsigned	zero
if it has arithmetic type it is initialized to positive or unsigned zero

553223
arrays	loops
the safe way to set all entries to a null pointer is to either loops over the entries yourself and set them to null or to use an uninitialized static arrays which you can memcpy over the arrays you want to set to null

553227
message	alert
now when user refresh the page using f5 an alert message is display to resend the information to server if we selected retry the action is repeated automatically

553242

inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
of course you need the inotifycollectionchanged interface to fire whenever one of the member inotifypropertychanged items fires its event

553317
gtk2hs	gtk
which is better for developing gui applications with haskell wxwidgets via wxhaskell or gtk via gtk2hs

553320
subtract	add
convert both strings to timestamps in your chosen resolution milliseconds seconds hours days whatever subtract the earlier from the later multiply your random number assuming it is distributed in the range 0 1 with that difference and add again to the earlier one

553325
double	int
on some platforms you can generate a time as a double date is the int part time is the fractional part is one implementation

553325
subtract	add
subtract the difference multiply by random number 0 r 1 add to start time and done

553338
version-control	cvs
and version-control wise how do you manage i guess cvs will finally have to go...

553360
environment	building
if so i see no problem installing the dev environment and execution through a command-line task in msbuilding on the building servers

553371
version-control	git
even with the best version-control system out there for me that would be git you can t solve the fan-out you get if you can t get everyone pull into the same direction except of course you can really split each customer into a plug-in

553372
windows-vista	windows
what is an easy to implement way to check whether i am on windows-vista or windows server 2008 from a python script

553377

553398
queue	fifo
i don t think lilo is the real term...but you re looking for a fifo queue

553400
vbscript	vb6
this is in vbscript but it should work the same on vb6

553409
contains	elements
todays computers copy data at such speeds that it doesn t matter unless your list can contains billions of elements

553409
linked-list	queue
the only advantage of using a linked-list in java is that the class already implements the queue interface so it is more natural to use in your code using peek and pop

553409
linked-list	queue
let s look at some details linked-list implements queue so the code which uses the list is a bit more simple list.pop instead of list.remove 0

553429
transient	entity

553429
persistence	hibernate
i m using hibernate as my persistence provider

553460
type-safety	generics
i found a way to do polymorphic method chaining in the fluent interfaces with type-safety enforced at compile time using generics builders and generics extension methods

553482
firefox	opera
i m making a website that will have to render correctly on firefox ie6 ie7 opera safari

553484
client-server	web-services
as to using a gui for real-time you should investigate using 2 tier client-server control of the real-time process using something like jmx rmi or web-services whichever is the lightest-weight

553515
profiling	trace
when i have time i ll use profiling to try and trace the udf calls

553519
google-chrome	firefox
build in a more-compliant and developer-friendly browser like firefox first test thoroughly in ie and safari google-chrome webkit and opera later

553519
javascript	dom
use a javascript framework like jquery or prototype - they can hide some javascript and dom incompatibilities

553521
value	field
according to how silverlight twoway binding works when i change the data in the firstname field it should change the value in checkfirstname field

553524
internationalization	localization
the specifics of internationalization localization in .net applications are outside of the scope of this answer but there are many books on the subject

553526
callback	methods
the applet invokes the clojure code s callback of init paint etc from java s hooks for those methods that are defined by the applet model

553546
restart	reload
this so so that i can re-initialise the contexts without restart or reload my containers or webapps

553576
subtract	add
if you were to add up all the inbound deliveries and then the outbound deliveries and subtract one from the other you have the current stock level

553578
difference	count
this won t make any difference to the compiler because end-of-lines count as mere whitespace but it might make some difference to other tools the diff on your version-control system

553584
common-lisp	lisp
the common-lisp object system is an example of lisp oo and maybe the most complex object system around

553602
revision	svn
svn time-lapse view is a cross-platform viewer that downloads all revision of a file and lets you scroll through them by dragging a slider

553623
pascal	delphi
it s fast and can be compiled with most current pascal tp 5 5.5 6 bp 7 vp 2.1 fpc 1.0 2.0 2.2 and delphi versions tested with v1 up to v7 9 10

553626
constructor	object
a class testexcel extends from phpexcel and when submitting the object testobject into the constructor we get a scientific notation of the variables when we do a variables_dump

553633

it is a platform independent graphical gpl python debugger with support for remote-debugging over a network multiple threads namespace modification embedded debugging encrypted communication and is up to 20 times faster than pdb

553653
windows-applications	desktop-application
for a desktop-application consistency with other windows-applications is usually considered more important that any design whims

553679
keyvaluepair	key
you can switch the key and value in the keyvaluepair to whatever makes sense for you

553688
rollback	commit
in other case you either would not be able to rollback a transaction or a commit would take forever like in old versioning of postgresql

553718
defined	declare
we can declare but not defined functions with arguments and or return value of type foo

553757
methods	extend
this seems to cause a load of errors telling me i can t extend some final methods

553764
firefox	safari
then i d just wrap the entire chunk of code in a conditional that checks to see if the user is on ie as there s no need to run this on firefox or safari

553765
mantis	trac
is a solid step up from trac and mantis and provides migration tools

553792
python	java
it has backends for c# java c c++ python etc

553806
spring	seam
i don t use spring but you can probably use dependency injection to do something similar to what we do in jboss and seam

553823
hierarchicaldatatemplate	binding
i m having trouble converting the xaml into code because i don t really understand how the hierarchicaldatatemplate works and how the binding work

553886
order	add
update kb908002 requires vs 2005 on the pc in order to add the shared add-in support update to the pre-requisites dialog of the setup projects

553886
command-prompt	cmd
open a cmd-prompt navigate to the folder where the fix is located and launch the following cmd to extract the files from the self-extracting installation file

553888
macros	vba
but when i use that vba code in my macros each line ends up in one cell again

553890
web-services	api
does anyone have any real world experience with the worksite web-services they specifically come with the worksite web product not to be confused with their com api which we have used within web-services

553900
any	set
the methods may then set a flag or do whatever processing is needed it could also notify any observers

553915
attributes	properties
you create an attributes and specify that when the user changes the associated properties the entity becomes dirty

553928
3dsmax	nurbs
i d like to slice the nurbs surface with a slicing-plane thats on-axis not as advanced as 3dsmax

553940
value	field
the flagged enums are just good old bit field so you have to use bit operations to see which value were set

553943
macros	vba
not sure but you can try recording a macros to do the same thing and check the vba code it produces

553958
configuration	environment
in configuration environment development.rb

553989
double	int
casting double to int truncates the .99999 right off

554009
configuration	upgrade
when i update add configuration data i ll issue an upgrade for the app

554009
configuration	upgrade
when the user upgrade to a new version of the app i want to maintain their existing data but replace all configuration data

554029
signals	sigint
what you need to do is have gdb generate the sigint using the signals command

554029
signals	sigint
and man signals will tell you the signals number in this case sigint is signals 2 so signals 2 will do it.

554029
signals	sigint
oh by the way odds are that you have a signals handler install for sigint and the arguments aren t right somehow

554039
internet-explorer	firefox
in firefox it works fine but on internet-explorer 7 i get the following error

554090
contains	any
but a full string may contains any of the following

554099
switching	screens
each can then have their own distinct conventional menubar and toolbar and the users can put the windows side by side on their screens to do their work instead of switching back and forth with a tab control

554108
double	int
shog9 has it right using the type double for a problem like this is not the best way to go if you are going to cast things to int

554108
unsigned	integer
looking at it i realize that you could probably get away with a standard unsigned 32-bit integer as the sum number but i will leave it as is just in case

554119
order	add
i have also had to add this line to the assemblyinfo.cs file of my application in order to get log4net working

554138
required	checked
i know this happens but i can t easily checked ahead of time to see whether it segfaults or not - either i can pre-scan input data to see if it will cause a segfault which can be impossible to determine or i can refit it to not use pointers arithmetic which would required a significantly larger amount of work or i can try to catch a segfault

554138
malloc	free
and don t worry - basically all i want to do is print a more user-friendly error message and free some malloc ed memory and then die

554145
methods	extend
and i want to extend it to add something beyond what an extension methods could do....my only option is composition

554145
methods	extend
the big problem is that .net seals lots of classes that would occasionally be nice to extend and they don t usually implement a common interface so api methods that take a foo would not accept a superfoo and you can t add an overload

554160
directory	folder
for this case you might be able to improve on that by immediately creating a small placeholder file in directory in question and holding a lock on that file until you re completely finished with the folder

554199
linux	unix
signal handling is relatively portable across unix machines this includes mac and linux

554200

lets say we have an employee entity composed of a few other entities such as a one-to-many addresses and contacts and a few fields name age etc

554201
spring	guice
i ve used spring before and like it but thought i d take a look at guice

554207
restart	reload
next if resources already decorated as obstructed please close and then open again corresponding projects or simply restart eclipse ide in order to reload svn meta-information cache

554215
floor	ceil
if you are still stuck with older standards you may use std floor which always rounds to the lower number and std ceil which always rounds to the higher number

554237
postgresql	rdbms
if you have the option of using trying out another rdbms such as postgresql by all means give it a try

554237
postgresql	mysql
mysql is appallingly bad with complex joins innodb when compared with other cost-based engines like oracle and postgresql

554237
postgresql	mysql
i switched from mysql to postgresql and complex joins that would take 30s+ on mysql with all indices in place take milliseconds on postgresql

554241
integer	zero
zero integer means zero truth

554247
vb.net	vb6
in vb6 a long was a 32-bit value hence the need for a change in vb.net

554253
any	set
you may have to set and check a forciblyclose flag and return from any other processing methods before it ll actually close

554255
any	set
is any bit set

554270
dictionary	arrays
my iphone client has a lot of involvement with asynchronous requests a lot of the time consistently modifying static collections of dictionary or arrays

554277
triggers	insert
to reset the value just set a triggers on insert that checks if is 0

554282
nsinteger	int
this is true of any constant type be it a primitive such as int float or a class such as nsstring or nsinteger

554282
nsinteger	int
note for the reason why nsinteger instead of just regular int see this post

554300
sftp	scp
but to solve your problem you should use to sftp or scp all transfers are done in binary alleviating your problem

554303
internet-explorer	google-chrome
support the latest versions of all major browsers internet-explorer firefox safari opera google-chrome

554307
textmate	bbedit
on mac os x i would suggest textwrangler free textmate or bbedit

554312
shell	bash
this is complicated by the fact that in the shell sh bash true is 0 and false is 1

554330
dictionary	arrays
is it strictly necessary to access your dictionary arrays from multiple threads

554339
value	field
for example if one thread writes a new value to a field without appropriate synchronization then the new value is not guaranteed to be observable by other threads

554341
runas	cmd
when attempting to run ie on windows-server 2008 under different user account using the runas cmd i get the message the runas cmd is not supported. this cmd works fine for other applications but not for ie

554381
scp	ssh
the accepted answer proposed to open a tunnel when ssh ing to the remote machine and to use that tunnel for scp transfers

554388
signals	sigint
a simple but effective technique is to run the program under gdb and handle the sigint signals

554415
button	popup
i found a work-around that works although it is a bit ugly when the user clicks the login button it opens a popup that comes from my own site and which contains the facebook connect login button

554415
iframe	popup
after the user logs in i close the popup and reload the iframe

554416
arguments	default
you could achieve what you want to do by not having a default constructor and instead defining a constructor that takes employment type as an arguments

554425
value	field
however i can t seem to find the right syntax for entering this into the properties value field of any of the built in validators without converting it to code

554445
authentication	login
most popular web-sites that require you to login have the authentication form on the right side of the page

554496
associations	model
if you correctly define the relations in your model then the customers table should have an associations with all the products so you ll be able to access products associated with the customer just using c.products

554512
double	int
i looked around for a good idea on how to make your implementation of generatenthfibonaccinumber handle cases where it returns the double 54.999999 but when you cast to an int or a long you get 54

554519
attributes	properties
i would like to know if attributes can be used to mix-in functionality to a class methods properties

554521
digits	zero
i need to determine how many digits wide a count of items is so that i can pad each item number with the minimum number of leading zero required to maintain alignment

554527
any	set
i have set up my p3p fine as far as i know the p3p validator doesn t return any errors but i still get blocked cookies

554534
order	join
since the two conditions exist on different rows of the term_taxonomy table you have to join to that table twice in order to compare them in one row of the result set

554543
selected	button
to show the sql pane either turn on the query designer toolbar and click the button labeled sql or it s avalable from the query designer menu pane then selected sql or press ctrl-3

554556
webforms	asp.net
webforms 4.0 will fix some of the current shortcomings like the id s which are automatically assigned by asp.net

554562
lookup	any
as others have said make sure you ve got indexes on any lookup fields

554564
getter	setter
basically marking the overall property as public but giving a more restrictive scope to the setter or getter

554564
getter	setter
since the property you re defining in there is marked as mustoverride you can t provide a default implementation it too is abstract and this include the get and set outlines therefore whichever overall scope you give to this abstract property declaration vb.net will force you to use this scope for both the getter and setter within derived classes

554564
getter	setter
leaving off the readonly qualifier still will not work since whatever scope you give to the abstract property will be the scope you must apply to both the setter and getter within derived implementation

554564
implements	abstract
attempting to make the base-class s abstract property protected will not work either since you would then be required to implements the property at the same level of scoping as it s declared in your base-class protected

554564
getter	setter
ordinarily when not overriding a base-class s abstract definition with a specific scoping level you can give a getter or setter a more restrictive scoping level but you can t give it a less restrictive scoping level

554564
protected	public
doesn t work either due to the public scope being less restrictive than the overall property scope of protected and moreover not of the same scoping level as defined on the base-class s abstract property declaration

554564
getter	setter
if the design of your classes is as you mention in your question i personally would go with a java-style getter and setter methods as they can then be declared separately with their own scoping levels

554567
environment	building
manual building requires us to miss out on some of the niceties in the modern ide like background compilation but what we gain is much more critical clean and easy building that can live in multiple environment

554567
environment	building
having building managed through continuous-integration allows us to more formally stage and migrate your code deployment to different environment and lets us know almost immediately when someone checks in bad code that breaks the build or unit tests

554570
silverlight	wpf
iâ m porting a wpf app to silverlight 2 and have come across several wpf features which are presently missing from sl

554570
textbox	button
i want to handle button presses f2 delete on a textbox embedded in a list box

554570
listbox	textbox
the wpf implementation uses previewkeydown on a textbox control which embedded as an item in a listbox

554570
listbox	textbox
i want to change the width of a textbox depending on the actual width of the listbox in which the textbox is contained

554579
multiplication	addition
this grammar handles only multiplication and addition and already it s not immediately clear whether the grammar is ll 1

554611
put	get
i couldn t seem to get the require-bundle header in the manifest file to work so put everything in the feature.xml

554611
packaging	building
once i could building compile everything successfully packaging it as a product was the next thing

554614
.when	ready
.when you pass a function to the jquery ready function it aggregate the new function with all previous functions

554629
silverlight	wpf
i m more familiar with silverlight than the full wpf

554629
keydown	keyup
for many keys i check on keyup and keydown

554629
keydown	keyup
i use keydown while trying to watch the entire time that the key is held down and keyup when it was used just once

554634
listbox	textbox
for item 4 you can bind both the listbox width and the textbox width to a static resource s property so that it acts as a router for the binding

554634
listbox	textbox
you could also use a value converter that you initialize with a reference to the listbox then use the converter for your textbox width

554657
required	checked
generally speaking though you should probably be writing code which checked that an object has all the interfaces required for a particular operation before carrying it out

554675
textbox	button
i just add links textbox button on page

554675
.when	ready
.when we are ready for the first demo i apply the design

554684
document	editing
do wysiwyg editors generally have problems editing html document that has been exported by microsoft programs like excel

554684
document	editing
i m currently using tinymce and i m having trouble editing an html document that was saved by excel

554689
jquery	.post
i d like to dynamically generate from the controller the jquery script code associated to perform the classical .ajax calls to the controller for create read update delete operations in ajax instead of classical get .post form actions

554695
put	get
also in the folder app_code i get an error if i put my javascript file saying that the language is not the same as other file in app_code

554731
entity-framework	ado.net
i need some help understanding the ado.net entity-framework

554731
entity-framework	ado.net
i m trying to represent and manipulate hierarchical data in a wpf treeview control with the ado.net entity-framework

554731
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework object with parent and children

554731
profiling	debugging
i m monitoring the sql-server profiling while i debugging my application

554731
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework object with parent and children and a related object

554734
subclassing	superclass
you ll find articles on how to set up tables that store the attributes of the generalized entity what oo programmers might call the superclass separate tables for each of the specialized entities subclassing and how to use foreign keys to link it all together

554734
entity-relationship-model	relational-model
if you know how to translation an entity-relationship-model into a relational-model and thence to sql tables you ll know what to do once they show you how to model gen-spec in entity-relationship

554738
key-value	key
instead of storing everything in the schema store the object s type and primary key in one table and key-value tuples for each object in another table

554758
sqldatasource	detailsview
i have always used the standard asp.net detailsview formsview controls along with either sqldatasource or objectdatasource controls to accomplish what you are trying to do

554767
protected	public
is it a bad idea to make my data-members in my data class to have public protected default protection so that i don t have to use a getter

554768
put	get
though to get a new row you could work with the nth-child selector or use an attributes for older browsers and put clear left

554777
comparator	sortedset
alternatively if you do not specifically need a list use a sortedset same goes with the comparator

554800
getter	setter
chances are good that trivial getter and setter will be inlined anyway - but with public fields you ll have lost the distinction between contract api and implementation

554801
getter	setter
the java bean specification relies on having public getter and setter as a way to determine which attributes are important

554811
getter	setter
from the perspective of who has written the code and who is going to use it then it doesn t matter whether its you or anyone else you might still need getter and setter - if anyone at all uses it later on its a defacto public api

554822
getter	setter
if you are replacing getter setter for performance memory optimisation then you are taking the wrong approach

554822
getter	setter
also i would be careful about designing the application as you suggest since it will mean that some properties eg simple properties will be directly accessible while others more complex derived properties or properties where you do not want to expose the underlying types will have getter setter

554826
getter	setter
the jvm will inline frequently used getter and setter

554838
getter	setter
imho for properties that by their very nature are just meant to passively hold data and couldn t do anything more complicated without completely changing their meaning from the perspective of the api user getter and setter are just unnecessary boilerplate

554842
versioning	upgrade
the database has a versioning table that i can programatically access and determine which upgrade scripting to run to get the database upgraded

554844
versioning	upgrade
apparently our infrastructure upgrade to a new versioning of the pop server and new uids were assign on the new versioning

554852
logging	trace
what i have done in a similar situation a legacy c++ application with custom logging an a new c# module using log4net is create a custom log4net appender that forwards trace into the old logging framework

554867
python	c++
if you have a strong handle on c then c++ is not a huge leap once you have a good handle on the oop concepts....which hopefully you have from becoming proficient in python

554874
instrumentation	profiling
if you don t have access to a profiling add simple instrumentation to determine where the bottleneck is

554888
getter	setter
getter and setter are not just for protection privacy

554901
key-value	key
if all you want is key-value pairs then the important thing is the types the key and values take this will colour how you deal with things

554903
methods	extend
the longer answer is that microsoft has provided a mechanism to extend sealed classes called extension methods

554907
directory	folder
i was going to use a filesystemwatcher to watch a folder on the server sign each instance up to it s deleted event and just create and delete a file in the watched directory but that s just dirty isn t it

554915
base-class	subclass
the prospect -- however unlikely it seems now -- that the representation will need to change in the base-class or in some future subclass

554931
dependency-injection	service-locator
for more details contrasting di to service-locator see fowler s inversion of control containers and the dependency-injection pattern

554947
shell	bash
the prompt says is your current directory most likely because you re using bash as your shell and the value of ps1 the prompt string you see - it s set in etc profile or etc profile.d more than likely contains a w or a w somewhere

554949
lisp	let
in all of my lisp code that i ve looked at recently you could replace every let with let with no change

554949
macros	let
edit ok i understand why some guy invented let presumably as a macros way back when

554949
lisp	let
have you written any actual lisp code where a let would not work as well as a plain let

554957
dictionary	arrays
in my real code the filenames arrays is a dictionary containing a function to call once a match is found

554982
webserver	upload
i need users to record their voice on a browser and then automatically upload the resulting mp3 to a webserver

554992
ftp	scp
in a simple case you can use scp or ftp command line programs to write a small command line script that can upload all your files

555014
protected	public
when referencing a public or protected methods or property on the base-class be sure to prefix it with base

555015
constructor	object
the first constructor argument you pass to the jakarta object is of type abc.def.mdd.msg.alarm.huawei.mddpackageralarmm2000 but the ctor wants a string

555016
jquery	.post
the function btn_save_click doesnâ t .post the page so it doesnâ t call the javascript jquery hidetabs function

555021
jquery	.post
in order to use collections binding you ll need to wrap a form around a list and submit it note this form will submit only selected values in this list but you may select them all before submit or to create a map of values and submit it via javascript for jquery - .post url data callback or to add all pairs of name value to some hidden element of a form and submit it

555039
attributes	properties
properties overloading on attributes objects escapes ampersands

555079
xlutils	xlwt
there is a package on pypi call xlutils which might help and there is this presentation from chris withers lightning talk from last europython i think where you can see some example code with xlrd and xlwt

555091
constructor	object
from the error message it sounds like spring is attempting to instantiate the object with this constructor

555098
factors	primes
once i have a function to determine primality i can use this function to find the highest primes factors

555103
any	set
i am assuming you are using a database if not now s a good time to set one up - in which case i would recommend writing an asp.net webservice .asmx extension - visual-studio can make them really easy to communicate with this database and tell the client if any files have been modified since the last time it checked

555111
any	set
i ve just tried this in vc++ 2008 express you can set a conditional break point which tests any of the floating point stack values st0 1.0 as a condition

555115
datagridview	formview
i m trying to develop a small utility a winforms app and i was hoping to save time to use a winforms equivalent of an asp.net formview or detailsview to bind to - for single objects as opposed to multiple objects which we could use a datagridview for

555120
webforms	asp.net
asp.net ajax serves a very specific subset of client-side functionality specifically adding asynchronous abilities to the webforms control model with the specific intention of abstracting away the markup client-side script whenever possible

555123
filtering	sorting
basically entitydatasource is build to support entity-framework entities for features like sorting filtering inserting deleting etc.

555135
factors	primes
of two 3-digit numbers if it can t it should have a 4-digit primes factors

555136
scheme	lisp
the above bullet points apply to scheme another lisp dialect

555138
json	xml
the content negotiation feature can be used to return groovy objects from grails controllers in different formats xml json etc. and you can consume the json on the client side

555138
json	xml
it literally just takes a few lines of code from a grails controller to return html json and xml representations of your objects

555153
actionscript	mxml
for a true flex application i think you need to start with a top level mx.core.application often defined in mxml rather than actionscript to which you would add mx.core.uicomponent s

555156
contains	set
i would like to set the body of an appointmentitem to a string of rtf that contains an embedded image

555171
export	csv
i have a function that export values into a csv file but the comments field has commas in it and it messes up the columns when you open it in a spreadsheet program

555177
python	c++
i have spent days playing and failing with image processing libraries for python and c++

555179
http	ssl
_server http isn t there switched on or not no matter if you re looking at the site via ssl or non-ssl

555196
implements	abstract
then you have to implements all of the abstract members of the base-class

555220
dependency-injection	inject
you can design your classes to have their dependencies inject via a constructor or properties without having to use a dependency-injection framework

555242
revision	svn
i use subversion to synchronize the local copy of my website on which i make modifications with the live copy whenever i check in a revision an svn hook script automatically updates the live site.

555242
scp	ssh
like scp it normally runs through an ssh tunnel although there are other modes of operation which are not secure

555273
background-color	transparency
when i was drawing a transparency rect i could just set srcover and specify an alpha for my background-color and it would work

555305
haskell	erlang
haskell and erlang solve the problem by being functional languages that never allow a variable to be modified once it s created

555308
fogbugz	trac
there are as has been mentioned other products out there that cover this off fogbugz covers this off i believe but i and the team love trac so we worked around this

555327
png	gif
i m only concerned about jpg gif and png

555329
communication	messages
the two most common mechanisms for thread communication are shared state and messages passing

555330
put	get
logan suggests to use -fno-implicit-templates and put somewhere presumably into a separate .cpp file that gets compiled with -fno-implicit-templates but i still get linker errors

555340
contains	elements
so you just need to identify the web elements that contains the body of the email and use that as the parent for the search

555347
jmonkeyengine	java-3d
i ruled out com.sun.scenegraph because it s gpl and seemingly dead java-3d because of this post and jmonkeyengine because of this post

555353
globalization	localization
i m working with an asp.net app with localization and globalization

555353
globalization	localization
does anyone know the best way to handle globalization localization of a javascript date value

555417
java-3d	jogl
it uses jogl not java-3d

555425
value	field
when i leave these field blank asp.net-mvc automatically throws up model errors stating a value is required

555426
windows-xp	windows
if you want apps for windows-xp to just look 100 like vista then it s going to be very complex as you will need to override the way windows are painted so you can design your own compatible version

555489
ref	out
in your first example the int parameter value is increment but is destroy when the methods ends you cannot get the value outside the methods unless you use the ref or out keyword

555489
ref	out
ref and out parameter-passing modes are used to allow a methods to alter variables passed in by the methods caller

555489
ref	out
the main difference between ref and out may be subtle but it s important

555490
ref	out
for extra bonus knowledge there s also the out keyword which is similar to ref but doesn t required value to be initializer first

555494
emacs	vim
engage in hackery like having the program check for the lockfiles that vim or emacs create

555507
moss	wss
the difference between wss 3.0 and moss 2007 commonly trip people up why pay for moss when wss is free

555521

oh yes and you can call msbuild from nant ok from nantcontrib -

555535
gridview	formview
using this method you can still use dynamic data formview gridview validation etc

555561
value	field
skeet pointed out only for value types and are accessed as static field

555568
fossil	svn
fossil may be used like svn or a dvcs

the pain for you would be losing your revision history at this time i don t beleive you can import a svn repository into fossil

555572
bug-tracking	fossil
look into fossil it is a dvcs that contains a built in wiki and bug-tracking system

555576
deployment	install
i have recently install nginx + thin on my deployment server but i am not sure how this will perform in last requests responses situation

555581
debugging	trace
i ve read the microsoft docs explaining the trace and debug facilities here and they claim that using #undef debug and #undef trace removes all tracing and debugging code from the produced executable but does it really remove the whole call

555584
triggers	insert
an insert triggers to set the column to the current date and an update triggers to prevent changes to that column or more precisely set it to its current value are the way to implement a datecreated column

555584
triggers	insert
an insert and update triggers to set the column to the current date is the way to implement a datemodified column

555593
key-value	key
a good use of const is for key of key-value pairs

555607
value	field
you will also need to have your panels implement some interface of your own that allows you to re-initialize them for reuse in a new dialog reinit typically means erasing all field contents or setting these field back to their default value

555652
debugging	trace
what you can do is decorate your expensive method with a conditional trace or conditional debugging attribute

555652
debugging	trace
the method will not be compiled into the final executable if the debugging or trace constant is not defined nor will any calls to execute the expensive method

555655
tuples	any
a vacuum is recommended after you have dropped temporary tables to clean up any dead tuples from the catalog

555668
attributes	properties
the typical oo behaviour of these two types of profiling is same but only the important attributes properties are common the very important ones 5-6 in number others properties like interests etc almost 10-15 properties are not there for bots profiling

555670
contains	any
those blockers stop xmlhttprequest s from happening to any domain but the one that loaded the contains scripting or page

my web application uses jquery and some jquery-plugins validation autocomplete

555699
scala	java
i have used scala on our existing java infrastructure to query and manipulate large xml documents

555718
internationalization	localization
i feel localization can go without internationalization but.

555718
internationalization	localization
internationalization with localization should not be done.

555723
arrays	loops
everything worked fine until another team member dropped in mootools and then all my loops were broken because the for i in ... syntax also goes over extra methods that have been added to the arrays object

555726
javascript	dom
i am looking for a good api documentation for javascript especially related to browsers and dom

555729
javascript	dom
javascript kit - dom reference

555731
javascript	dom
the dom section of it is probably what you look for alongside with javascript

555752
double-quotes	single-quotes
i know that single-quotes need to be doubled up and perhaps double-quotes as well

555758
hashtable	set
insert each element into a set hashtable first checking if its are already in it

555771
static-code-analysis	stylecop
if you want to create a windows forms or console application both will work fine if you want to build these applications more seriously and use a source control systemd static-code-analysis and stylecop from the ide you need sharpdevelop

555776
directory	folder
this should work recursively inside the sub folder of the selected directory

555781
getter	setter
designing functionally you are never going to need getter setter is just as bad as premature optimisation

555784
constructor	private
instead the fact that there is only one of it can be a private implementation detail and enforced by a private implementation detail by the throw statement in the constructor .

555831
stream	send
when a user types in a www.yahoo.com on the client box there is a session started on the server then i grab the screenshot and send them in a rtp stream back to the client

555834
space	input
my point your test may cover 100 of the lines of your code but it will not typically cover all your possible input data space the set of all possible values of inputs

555861
preventdefault	event-bubbling
prototype has a stop methods for events that besides preventing the default action also cancels event-bubbling - you could try that in the onend function instead of preventdefault

555876
json	xml
also working with xml or even json is an annoying extra step if you just want your flex app to get results data an api call

555876
json	xml
if for some reason you need to also handle outputting data to xml or json that can easily be added to your app by extending or creating new controllers services that translate the data from arrays and objects to xml or json

555884
contains	any
the common language runtime automatically maintains a table called the intern pool which contains a single instance of each unique literal string constant declared in a program as well as any unique instance of string you add programmatically

555886
export	report
for testing our own java-based report product i-net clear reports we run a whole slew of test reports once export them to various export formats make sure the output is as desired and then continously have these same reports run daily comparing the results to the original data

555899
project-management	scrum
we use scrum for project-management and mix in the engineering practices of xp

555900
testdriven.net	coderush
also integrates with a code-generation tool called coderush and i ve seen them both used very effectively together with testdriven.net check out the summer of nhibernate screencasts

555904
getter	setter
you should store the state of your wizard in the wizardmodel and add getter and setter like a javabean appropriately

555927
linux	osx
phones for instance some of which run mac osx or linux

555931
callback	methods
at the very least as dani suggested above whatever methods you re calling from inside your c callback would have to be static so that you guarantee no residual state is left from an invocation of your callback

555939
space	input
sample input orgtext a crlf b space c crlf

555945
contains	elements
no the html specification states that no form elements should contains another form elements

555971
python	php
i have solid knowledge of oop as much as you can get from php javascript and little actionscript python here and there

555971
spring	seam
also you can suggest framework from what i seen struts looks nice spring too but it seam that it have too much xml configuration.

555979
string.format	stringbuilder
as others have explained string intern occurs for all string literals but not on dynamically created strings those read from a database or file or built using stringbuilder or string.format .

555990
arrays	loops
if you do need a pattern match then you ll need to loops over the arrays elements to use preg_match

555995
linux	unix
cygwin provides a very unix linux like environment to the extent that most unix programs can be built without change

555998
boost	stl
you may use boost stl whatever to learn these

556019
keyboard	mouse
i will respons to both keyboard and mouse

556030
perl	ruby
it is ideal for use in shell and perl scripts or ruby or python or.

556044
selected	button
the itemdatabound event of the repeater is fired before the onclick event on a button and changes the selected values to their old values before the new selections can be saved

556050
python	perl
i ve grown accustomed to using ipython to try things out whilst learning python and now i have to learn perl for a new job

556053
continuous-integration	build-server
the build-server is set up with continuous-integration codeigniter in team build and to keep this from bogging too much with slow tests the full test suite takes over an hour to run on the server we have separated the tests into slow tests that gets run twice a day and fast tests that get run as part of continuous-integration

556074
driver	kernel
my kernel driver is working fine now and it is a lot less ugly compared to the situation before you provided me with all these tips

556085
python	c++
any popular one will do for a prototype but i d prefer one i know well python c# javascript or c c++

556090
turkish	locale
capitalising the email tim foo.com would be different in the us and turkish locale

556092
arrays	map
map supports access based on arbitrary keys you can have any range you want or even a sparsely populated arrays

556097
latex	tex
first and foremost you should familiarize yourself with tex and latex - a famous typesetting system created by donald knuth

556097
mathml	tex
edit #2 convert that messy word-stuff to tex or mathml

556106
miktex	latex
miktex is a nice little application for churning out images using latex

556109
malloc	free
it was designed in the sense there was a definite easy to comprehend architecture - malloc a struct send the main loop a user message with the pointers to the struct as the lparam and then free it when the message is processed

556114
textbox	button
so a dialog object containing several button objects and a textbox object is a much more realistic idea and no more complex to understand - everyone has seen a dialog box before

556114
textbox	button
this can then be refined into a generic windows object of which button textbox and dialogs are subclasses

556116
textbox	button
what i m trying to do is to create a webpart that has a textbox where you can set the value of a literal h2 on the webpart and a save button that posts back and then sets the literal accordingly

556117
persistence	hibernate
for persistence db part i recommend you look into ibatis before trying hibernate

556155
linked-list	nodes
i was thinking something along the lines of using a circular linked-list and append a success or failure nodes for each event

556175
margins	padding
there is no way to avoid this except by compromises such as modifying the padding margins for each state

556177
order	add
you could use a queue which would allow you to add new events to the end of the queue and remove expired events from the start of the queue assuming that events are added in chronological order

556177
linked-list	queue
in java for example you could use a linked-list or an arraydeque both of which implement the queue interface

556187
value	field
if you mean to only get the current value of some field you don t need the aggregate-functions but you have to be sure you are inside a control that repeats data for each row of a dataset a detail row of a table

556198
restrictions	userid
since the suserid bit on executable only changes the effective userid euserid the executable will run as and not the real userid ruserid which getuserid returns and in addition to the restrictions on suserid interpreter scripting any executable beginning with #

556198
shell	bash
some shell like bash as an extra safety measure will set the euid back to the ruid in this case you will need to use the call setuid 0 in the c code before executing the script

556198
contains	set
set the access to your scripting and wrapper as strict as you can only allow this very specific scripting which you intend to be executed and clear the environment within your c program before starting the scripting setting environment variables such as path to contains exactly what is necessary in the right order and no directory that are writable to others

556203
static-class	inherited
i am trying to inherited a non-static-class by a static-class

556212
order	add
2 - add a random button which generates the order randomly - could be useless could be fun depending on your app

556212
order	add
3 - add a display order field by the side of each item and allow the user to manipulate it but make sure that you have some code to auto update the rest of the numbers when one changes personally i think this could be very confusing but for some users it might work

556215
static-classes	inherited
i don t think c# supports inherited for static-classes

556222
plugins	add-on
do you have any recommended add-on plugins for microsoft visual-studio

556230
static-class	inherited
static-class implicitly inherited from

556234
static-classes	static-class
so inheriting from a non-static-class violates the first feature of static-classes on this list by introducing non-static members to your static-class

556237
database-table	mysql
i have a mysql database-table with the following columns

556260
fieldset	labels
it might make more sense as a p or fieldset or labels

556267
required	checked
note that using like somestring will usually required a table scan and may therefore lead to performance problems - if you have millions of rows to be checked

556279
exception-handling	try-catch
when exception-handling are used sparingly you don t need to turn your code into a try-catch -spaghetti in order to avoid receiving incomprehensible-in-the-context exception-handling from the deeper layers

556288
checkbox	button
in my forms i want to make html labels bold in general but not bold when they are labelling radio button and checkbox

556295
export	report
this bug report seens to suggest that my issue can be resolved by export to a file writen in binary mode

556309
c++	lua
googling tells me how to shove put c++ in lua in swig but not how to put lua in c++

556314
openoffice.org	uno
we used its uno cli api to create an utility api in .net for any conversion possible in openoffice.org excell to pdf to word etc. convert file from format.excell to format.pdf

556325
postgresql	oracle
moving from oracle to postgresql what preferably free oss software tools are available that replace oracle enterprise manager

556334
windows-xp	windows
our website has border styles on select boxes and text inputs to make them look like they would in the windows-xp style on windows

556334
selected	button
i have made no attept to change the style on the little down arrow button next to the selected

556334
selected	button
the final effect that i am after is a blue border on all selected and text inputs and selected should have the system default for the little dropdown arrow button

556334
windows-xp	windows
however in ie8 rc1 if you use the windowss-xp theme blue curvy windows headers then ie8 rc1 continues to use the grey windowss classic button

556347
multiplying	formula
changing the cgbitmapcontextcreate call should allow you to get actual colour value too obviously if you have more than 8 bits per pixels you will have to multiplying that in to your pointinside formula too

556353
versioning	upgrade
is there any valid reason why the user would not want to upgrade when a new versioning of the program is released

556353
versioning	upgrade
maybe in the options there could be an option for prompting when a new versioning comes available but the default should be to just upgrade it silently without telling the user unless it is a major upgrade which is not fully backwards compatible or might break some other stuff

556363
sql-server	oracle
cadaeic provided the answer for sql-server which seems to be no savings in sql-server until version 2008 whereas according to quassnoi you can get savings in oracle if the null columns are at the end

556367
affinity	cpu
gets the opportunity to be cached near affinity cpu

556387
decrement	increment
global counters for the fail and success are not recomputed from all events but instead gradually increment events are added and decrement when nodes from the list that are older than x seconds are removed

556390
default-value	arguments
this looks rather ugly as you need to monkeypatch the new aggregate into django.db.models.sql.aggregates due to the way the sql aggregate classes are looked up but all we ve done here is added a new aggregate which subclasses sum hardcoding a call to the coalesce function and adding a placeholder for the default-value which you must supply as a keyword arguments in this very basic example implementation at least

556392
triggers	insert
a half-way-house might be to have an insert triggers create a row in a 1 1 table so that column was outside the main table

556392
updating	updates
the second table could have selected permissions where the main table has updates permissions and thus not need an updates triggers to prevent changes to createdate - which would remove some weight when updating rows normally

556401
duplicates	contains
it is just a way to tell search engines which urls contains duplicates content

556407
updating	updates
if you have multiple concurrent threads updating the arrays you will have to wrap the updates and reads if the updates are not atomic in a synchronisation mechanism

556409
code-coverage	ncover
ncover is an open source code-coverage tool for .net

556411
any	set
it is also quite possible to directly issue a trap to kernel mode from any user space code if desired although you may need to write a snippet of assembly to set up the registers correctly for the call

556411
fwrite	fread
some operations that you do like malloc or fread fwrite will invoke these kernel functions and that then will count as sys time

556438
revision	svn
we annotate our .pdb files with the svn path and revision of the original source file

556440
contains	set
the queries contains parameters that i set using sqlsetparam

556456
common-lisp	scheme
it obviously is possible to write almost any kind of application in almost any programming language especially in such a powerful one as lisp be it scheme or common-lisp

556478
dialog	pop-up
a while back i read before i lost it a great book called gui bloopers which was full of examples of bad gui design but also full of useful tidbits like don t call something a dialog one minute and a pop-up the next

556485
profiling	trace
the advantage to using this kind of method over sql-server profiling is that you can get full stack trace for each executed piece of sql

556511
common-lisp	lisp
if you do decide to use lisp try seibel s book practical common-lisp

556526
getter	setter
with the given resultset extracting the metadata i want to build a class file dynamically with getter and setter methods for all the columns that exist in resultset

556549
methods	extend
your other code will not be able to call any methods on this class because it did not exist when they were compiled and consequently the only way to actually use this generated class would be either via reflection or via methods on its parent class or implemented interfaces i m going to assume it would extend resultset

556549
reflection	runtime
you can do the latter without bytecode weaving look at dynamic proxies for arbitrary runtime implementations of an interface and if you re doing the former i don t see how having a class and mechanically calling the getfoo methods through reflection is better than just calling resultset.getstring foo - it will be slower more clunky and less type-safe

556580
constructor	object
if you enforce idisposable-requirements on interfaces and concrete types to be future-proof whose responsibility is object injected as part of constructor calls

556580
required	checked
implements runtime checked that checks that if a concrete type that is being registered implementss idisposable required that the interface it is exposed through also implementss idisposable

556580
constructor	object
also what about injecting object in constructor

556580
constructor	object
our container and some of the other containers we ve looked into is capable of injecting a fresh object into a parameter to a constructor of a concrete type

556596
ethernet	packets
i ve used winpcap successfully to inject packets to a gigabit ethernet port as fast as the hardware can handle

556611
required	checked
assuming that you have the server and any required credentials correct double checked these i would try increasing the timeout on the smtp client

556620
debugging	trace
debugging causes trace information to be emitted on the debuggingobj

556620
callback	methods
compatible with the original methods of using a coderef as a callback

556623
required	checked
also checked whether your server required an authentication or encrypted connection

556640
kdevelop	kde
also try out kdevelop if you are using kde

556643
getter	setter
often you do need getters and setter perhaps but when i write a getter i always ask myself whether that data should be exposed or whether the object should hide it completely for me

556647
process-explorer	perfmon
i was monitoring the application using perfmon when i got confused about the memory difference between the .net bytes in all heaps and the working set reported in process-explorer mem usage column in case of task manager

556660
inlining	inline
declaring the methods within the class declaration makes the function inline which is a hint for the compiler to do you guessed it -- inlining

556684
emacs	vim
eclipse netbeans kdevelop vim and emacs are all good options

556697
wordpress	blogs
able to manage multiple blogs with wordpress mu +

556698
children	tree
however the control needs to be able to instantiate itself when the user clicks the button of the parent control at least 1 nested children control of the same type will be displayed underneath kind of like a tree

556704
profiling	debugging
in circumstances like this i get the actual call to the sproc either from a debugging in my app or using sql profiling and then plug that into ssms or whatever ide you use wrapping it in a rollback transaction so it can t accidentally make any changes

556704
output	mode
use text mode for output rather than grid mode which might hide something

556716
constructor	object
if the object s constructor throws you can easily catch the exception

556716
exception-handling	try-catch
just you need to remember wrapping every call of getobject into a try-catch block or suffer from the exception-handling bubbling up the stack chain

556728
pointers	stack
there are also stack registers such as bp sp stack pointers built-in that you can use hence the built-in commands you have mentioned

556740
pointers	stack
stack is implemented by means of stack pointers which assuming x86 architecture here points into stack segment

556740
pointers	stack
every time something is pushed on stack by means of pushl call or a similar stack opcode it is written to the address stack pointers points to and stack pointers decremented stack is growing downwards smaller addresses

556740
pointers	stack
when you pop something off stack popl ret stack pointers is incremented and the value read off stack

556740
pointers	stack
in a kernel-space environment you have to set up stack segment and stack pointers first.

556742
implements	abstract
you confuse an abstract stack and the hardware implements stack

556745
temporary	copy
we copy our project to a temporary project files and alter it using checkbox and parameters files

556770
pointers	stack
a programs stack isn t generally hardware though it s kept in memory so it can be argued as such but stack pointers which points to a current area of stack is generally a cpu register

556770
pointers	stack
it s worthy of note that some processors do not implement all of the instructions for accessing and manipulating stack push pop stack pointers etc but the x86 does because of it s frequency of use

556774
pointers	stack
the memory location is stored in a register which has different names for different architectures but can be thought of as stack pointers register

556774
pointers	stack
also some architectures store the last used memory address as stack pointers

556775
attributes	properties
in wcf what is the difference between applying the data-members attributes on a properties

556777
gridsplitter	splitter
the gridsplitter will bind to the right edge of column 0 if you put the splitter in column 0

556783
value	field
field field is never assigned to and will always have its default-value value

556789
hide	show
having an html page with a simple table and javascript code to do show hide on it

556792
font-size	display
you d have to set a specific font and font-size at a minimum to be able to semi-reliably count display lines

556792
onkeydown	onkeyup
also if you don t use his scripting make sure you use one that involves either a time interval check and or the onkeydown onkeyup events of the textarea

556794
equals	getter
in theory and as long as you keep m_somevalue always equals to somevalue like a simple getter setter nothing

556794
protected	public
the proxy class will generate a public property whether you use a public protected internal private field or property

556810
removeclass	addclass
or you can use addclass and removeclass if that s more appropriate

556812
static-class	inherited
you will have only one instances similar to how the static-class works and you will be able to inherited behavior or implements interfaces

556817
constructor	object
in fact raii usually requires you to do this sort of things because objects have an internal invariant that must be satisfied and if the constructor can t initialize the object and leave it in a valid state then it s the only way to go

556838
boost	stl
any idea how i do that with c++ and possibly stl boost

556840
pointers	stack
instructions like push and pop adjust stack pointers while the operating system takes care of allocating memory as stack grows for each thread

556851
textbox	button
i created a textbox with a button and added a monthcalendar control as well

556851
selected	textbox
you cannot selected from the textbox

javascript	dom
if you havenâ t got time to get into it now then iâ m sure someone will offer a solution here but i would recommend anyone who does anything beyond the most cursory javascript dom manipulation to consider jquery or a similar framework

556859
hide	show
jquery offers browser independent hide show and toggle methods

556869
required	checked
the second idea is better if you have a network that you required to checked all msn conversation

556886
private-members	data-members
however there may be some permissions issues accessing private-members in particular on silverlight and cf - in which case i would recommend using the public property as the data-members

556892
windows-vista	windows
this all works fine with the exception of windows-vista and windows 7 beta

556892
authentication	login
i have read that because it is used on the login screen it will not prompt the user for authentication

556898
defined	declare
if it doesn t do this implicitly you may be required to defined the index yourself before you can declare the constraint

556903
pointers	stack
first the data and stack segment registers are set and then stack pointers is set 0x4000 beyond that

556904
version-control	git
the project in question is git distributed version-control system

556927
click	mouse
is there a way to catch a mouseleftbuttondown or other mouse event at a page or user-controls level and then be able to determine which child control was actually click

556934
ssms	ssas
there is a migration wizard in ssms that will migrate ssas 2000 cubes over to ssas 2005

556941
assign	add
you can then assign it to the short-cut or add button to your toolbar

556969
button	popup
each of the items has a button next to it to launch a modal popup that will contain additional information about the item

556976
value	field
you need fast update s and delete s of the indexed value with a where conditional that is not selective on the indexed field that is number of rows affected by the query is comparable to the total number of the rows say 1 500 000 rows of 2 000 000

557004
put	get
hence you can get a free blog and just put in the bits you want to share that way you would also have a steady online reference whenever you need it

557030
contains	elements
so i stored these values in a tree a list of number elementss contains in a root elements numbers

557038
keyboard	mouse
and then i must make sure to block away keyboard mouse and focus messages so the underlying edit control doesn t mess with me

557046
mime	rfc
generators processor for s mime and cms pkcs7 rfc 3852

557060
data-members	private
in general you should favor applying the data-members attribute on the property rather than on the private field

557060
attributes	properties
the only reason to apply the attributes to the field instead is if the properties were read-only it has no setter

557066
jndi	jmx
java -classpath jmxquery org.nagios.jmxquery -u service jmx rmi jndi rmi localhost 8004 jmxrmi -o java.lang type memory -a nonheapmemoryusage -k used -i nonheapmemoryusage -j used -vvvv -w 82208358 -c 105696461 -username monitorrole -password changeme

557068
csv	xml
iirc someone has created a linq to csv library that might be a starting point to create the intermediate xml in memory as input into the transform

557069
export	csv
i m also not opposed to export the data in for instance csv format and loading it into another program if that would be easier

557077
ready	live
it is a pretty straightforward site and i had it working real well but i was developing everything at .. html backend for the sake of simplicity and to make sure nothing was spidered before it was ready to go live

557100
shell	ifs
there is certainly no need to restore the value of ifs before exit - this is a real shell you are using not a dos bat file

557109
exception-handling	try-catch
wrap your dispatching code with try-catch to catch any code that does throw exception-handling

557110
exception-handling	try-catch
there are places to use the try-catch blocks in your application say if you want to check for a single exception-handling that does not necessarily need to be caught in the same way

557117
associations	model
i am using polymorphic associations as reviewable but i am not sure where i should put the logic for creating a review for each model

557134
asciiencoding	utf8-decode
there are also functions for converting strings to byte in the asciiencoding utf8-decode and utf16encoding classes see the getbytes string functions

557137
constructor	private
if you re trying to stop people creating instances of the class just add a private default constructor

557139
mouseenter	mouseover
this is different behavior than that of the mouseover event which is dispatched each time the mouseenter the area of any child object of the display object containers even if the mouse was already over another child object of the display object containers

557143
put	get
i think most of the work to get a smooth result in such a case which of course does happen needs to be put in beforehand in having a good automatic test suite

557145
eula	gpl
the gpl is not directly an eula end-user licence agreement

557145
licensing	gpl
i m still not a lawyer - if you need legal advice be prepared to pay to speak with a lawyer who is experienced with software licensing and the gpl

557167
licensing	gpl
but you ll still catch flak if you re doing this primarily to avoid gpl licensing the closed source software

557213
arrays	loops
in my case the assertions are based on a couple loops over an arrays containing an object plus some function names and the expected output see below so there isn t an obvious way at least to me to just separate every assertion into a separate testcase

557217
local-variables	function-call
and each call to the anonymous delegate is a new function-call so local-variables will not help

557226
xsl-fo	xslt
in past i ve always gone for xml xslt xsl-fo using apache fop with perl being used to create the initial xml data

557232
jtable	jlist
to address your issue with jtree which i agree with you should look into using glazed lists if you want nice jlist and jtable interaction in your app

557236
show	next
not only this but in a work culture that promotes this craziness you are usually expected to show up the next day at 8am ready to continue giving 100

557262
duplicates	contains
it would only make a difference if you started joining tables which contains duplicates column names

557267
callback	methods
to use a static methods the callback is something like

557291
mapping	unique
still other times the collection is actually a proper mapping from some unique key-value to an entity in which case it s a python dictionary

557321
firewatir	watir
however you couldn t go wrong with watir firewatir either

557327
arrays	loops
use a foreach loops and get both the key and the value for the assoc arrays

557333
waitpid	fork
after fork ing and running the test.sh scripting the bin sh shell which was the child of the perl system call exits and so you get a -1 return-value from waitpid

557340
contains	elements
i cannot do because the list might contains zero elements

557359
jquery-cycle	slider
i am trying to build a slider show with jquery-cycle plugins

557364
contains	elements
the footeritemtemplate and edititemtemplate elements in my aspx markup both contains requiredfieldvalidator controls as well as textbox

constructor	private
you could create a protected constructor which populates the private properties directly

557369
internet-explorer	firefox
i use both firefox and internet-explorer so i d like to search both of their caches

557371
python	java
i can t speak for python but check out the gethtmlsource method for the java api of the selenium interface

557385
constructor	object
you need to create a constructor that accepts the properties of your book object so that you can instantiate a book from an existing set of data rather than a new hit to the db

557390
internet-explorer	firefox
nirsoft has free cache viewers for firefox and for internet-explorer

557446
linux	unix
there are already .net ports to unix linux and there is no reason that ms-access can t be emulated there either

557452
internet-explorer	firefox
i would like to make it work at least in firefox and internet-explorer

557462
buildout	plone
i am using buildout to automatically download and setup the many dependencies of my plone installation

further i dont want to use c++ but c# java ruby or python

557504
uiscrollview	subviews
add both the uiscrollview and your headingview to this as subviews

557509
installation	environment
using software like virtualenv to create a virtual python environment that has its own site-packages directory and then running setup.py install or pip install appname with that virtualenv active or placing or symlinking the app in the virtualenv s site-packages highly recommended over all the global installation options if you value your future sanity

557524
cakephp	django
3 i m not familiar with cakephp but adding a process_request middleware is definitely a good django way of preprocessing each request

557538
stderr	stdout
the use of simple print statements to write stuff to the log doesn t work wonderfully consistently for all django implementations mod_python for example loses all the stdout and stderr stuff.

557544
for-loop	arrays
and run a for-loop over the arrays boxes or use the foreach member function

557583
display	height
use the intensity roughly speaking the grayscale in simple rgb spaces to display the height or add contour lines in black like the example image does

557588
environment	execution
it will indeed attempt to pop open the interactive sas windows environment upon execution

557634
asp.net-mvc	wcf
the rest of the project is going to be an asp.net-mvc app possibly sprinkled with a little wcf

557661
compact-framework	.net
i was surprised to find out that this installer project doesn t install the .net compact-framework if necessary

557667
dependency-injection	singleton
it also uses lots of singleton ugh and untangling it to make it able to use dependency-injection would be a fair amount of work and i don t think i could convince anyone that we should do that now

557669
textbox	button
our container application would contain a textbox and find next previous button

557677
arrays	loops
it seems that you loops through the to build an arrays of articles then loops through these adding to a feed - you can skip a whole loops here by adding items to the feed as they re found

557684
any	set
the methods used for ordering items in the gallery web photo album works pretty well for ordering photos and it should work just as well for any set that can be represented as a sorted grouping of clickable elements

557684
highlight	selected
click an element selected it it is highlight to indicate it s selected

557695
textarea	textbox
for instance i d like to use it with jquery-validate so i can restrict a textbox textarea to have say 250 words

557696
inline-code	code-behind
if the source is mostly markup then inline-code works well however if the source is mostly code then code-behind and as jeff notes vb s xml support could really help here

557717
default-value	default
parameter default must be compile-time constants because the compiler has to put in the default-value when the code is compiled

557718
communication	messages
this architecture is event driven off of thread messages so when the receiving thread is processing a thread message it is processing data explicitly newed for the communication between threads see example below

557719
directory	folder
you can t get to a public folder inside a private folder in general and if you can t add new directory outside the web root your cache dir will have to be protected another way

557720
attributes	properties
having a requirement to add the methodimpl attributes makes the use of your properties bag non-transparent for other developers

557720
attributes	properties
even if the properties bag has the methodimpl attributes nothing guarantees you it will be the first frame on the call stack

557742
dependency-injection	factory-pattern
most of the examples quoted for usage of dependency-injection we can solve using the factory-pattern as well

557748
triggers	insert
anytime you add a new record insert triggers or the even_time column changes update triggers you would recompute the reference to b that this time corresponds to

557753
directory	folder
from what you posted i think you are trying to expose a working copy instead of a repository the .svn folder is typical of a working copy and i bet the e dev.svn is a checkout directory

557755
processor	cpu
in addition to that this design will make maximum use of multiple processor or cores at the cost of slightly more memory consumption and more cpu cycles spent

557780
configuration	upgrade
what we need is when there is an upgrade available to merge the configuration in local machine with what is coming from the deplyoment

557791
authentication	login
i wish create a role for each user after that the user authentication login to access to the application i will give some role to and save the role on the database

557791

557792
.net	wcf
not all .net assemblies can be used by partially trusted assemblies here s a list namely wcf assemblies ie system.servicemodel is not on the list

557802
dependency-injection	service-locator
some of the difference between on the one hand inversion of control and dependency-injection ioc di and on the other hand a service-locator or a suite of factories factory is

557811
paradox	dsn
first of all when i m registering the odbc as a user or systemd dsn the microsoft paradox odbc driver only display versionings up to 5.x so it looks like that it does not support paradox versioning 7.x

557819
value	field
the getsortedlist function determines which of the named sorts to use which results in a list object where each fielddata contains the methodinfo and type value of the field passed in addsort

557833
authentication	login
the server login one might be a bit harder but i ve even seen cracks go so far as to locally create a dummy login server so the program thinks it s being authentication

557838
xquery	xslt
that helps a lot since you can use a lot of tools originally designed for xml such as xml parsing xslt xpath xquery .

557854
object-reference	instances
message object-reference not set to an instances of an object

557854
object-reference	instances
sink failed because system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

557854
compatibility	legacy
the db server is sql 2005 running in 2000 compatibility mode yay legacy

557870
mathml	xhtml

557891
getter	setter
i then have getter and setter on my class that return accept only dates

557908
moving-average	average
an infinite impulse response iir digital filtering computes a moving-average depending on how you define average has a minimal memory footprint and only takes a few lines of code

557918
callback	methods
if you believe i should then the next question is if my web page is done processing and returns to the client before the third party comes back would the callback methods even be there listening to run the code

557924
worksheet	excel
google earth also has an activex control called the gepluginx control you can embed in an excel worksheet as long as you have the google earth browser plugin installed this is a separate installation from the standalone google earth application

557936
silverlight	wpf
wpf in particular and xaml in all its reincarnations wpf silverlight moonlight

557939
access-control	authentication
usually the identity iis is using is in web site properties - directory security - edit authentication and access-control

557948
entity-framework	massive
in my experience nhibernate now is relatively easy to use with the fluent interface entity-framework is a legitimate contender and microorms such as dapper and massive are becoming quite popular

557954
mathml	xhtml
as mentioned above xhtml allows you to play with svg and mathml

557971
document	element
i want the a element in the first two document to be selected

observer-pattern	command-pattern
the gui will keep watch on the game engine by using observer-pattern and interact with this by using one of several command object created using command-pattern

558022
webserver	upload
if you wish to return status information about the file upload you need to somehow interface your app to the webserver receiving the upload

558027
any	set
since name is a public property any control that has access to it could set it to null at any point prior to your call to getcalendarstring

558034
webforms	asp.net
in fact this syntax was always available in asp.net webforms

558042
stateless	stateful
the blog post author says that the true strength of asp.net was the controls i would argue that the strength was the event driven model and the presentation of a stateful environment overtop a nearly stateless environment

558043
perl	php
i used many languages including the 4 big scripters perl ruby php python

558068
baud-rate	parity

558080
python	php
in the context of building a website i would and have used both technologies - the php for the main website and python for specific scripting tasks that either aren t possible in php or are faster in python

558080
python	php
i think you should use what suits best and i m not sure you can compare them python and php directly

558095
webforms	asp.net
because of this difference asp.net mvc significantly increases the testability of the code over both classic asp and webforms

558101
webforms	asp.net
but asp.net mvc views are still compiled like asp.net webforms are - this is big difference over asp 3 and you have intellisense available in .aspx

558122
defined	declare
and why is it that if i declare a function let s say void print_matrix in let s say a.c without a.h and include a.c - i get print_matrix .... already defined in a.obj but if i declare it as static void print_matrix then it compiles

558125
any	set
also if you re using mbstring functions you need to explicitly tell it what character set your string is either with mbstring.internal_encoding or as the last argument to any mbstring function

558125
any	set
database strings are a little easier if you carefully set the connection character set because most dbmss will do any conversion for you

558139
any	set
make sure your default_charset directive is set to utf-8 before any of this execution occurs

558143
rar	zip
it supports almost any office office-like file format even dwg msg pdf and files in zip rar archives

558173
abstract-class	subclassing
use an abstract-class if you have some functionality that you want it s subclassing to have

558173
abstract-class	subclassing
for instance if you have a set of functions that you want all of the base abstract-class s subclassing to have

558186
time-complexity	quicksort
fisher-yates is o n whereas any implementation using icomparer uses a quicksort behinds the scenes which has a time-complexity of o n log n

558201
data-members	instances
a static data-members is also called a class variables while a non-static data-members is an instances variables

can anyone suggest a good python or clojure common lisp even ruby library which implements bayesian spam filtering

558227
g++	gcc
i am using gcc gcc g++

558259
pointers	stack
in the x86 calling convention va_list s are just pointers into stack and are safe to copy

558269
constructor	object
the object you pass to the constructor or set can be implemented with factory

558271
contains	lookup
as the user types i use a webservice to return an itemssource contains a lookup of only the word that the user is currently typing into the autocompletebox as oppossed to the entire phrase which is the default behavior

558274
stderr	stdout
the problem is that normal output like compiler command lines go to stdout and compile errors go to stderr

558274
buffering	streaming
this results in a single log file but the problem is that the streaming are buffering and so the result in the log file is all mixed up

558274
stderr	stdout
is there a way to turn off buffering for stdout and stderr in this case

558284
double	int
you should really look into using some int type for these values that supports equality comparison rather than trying to use double

558288
exception-handling	try-catch
you are better off capturing exception-handling information in a try-catch block and then working on it separately

558292
triggers	insert
first thought was to use transaction to get max commentid + 1 but i am looking for something more abstract maybe instead of triggers something that could be used for example in linq with no knowledge of the background just insert to the appropriate table all required values so no commentid and save it

558302
stderr	stdout
this should work better for you because it is not redirecting stderr and stdout separately but redirecting stderr to stdout which should make the buffering sync up

558303
arrays	loops
the reason .count worked for the first loops is that childobjects does not return an arrays it returns a com collection object

558304
ienumerator	ienumerable
can anyone explain ienumerable and ienumerator to me

558304
ienumerator	ienumerable
what s the difference between ienumerable and ienumerator

558314
webforms	asp.net
what is the preferred method for handling exceptions in asp.net webforms

558319
arrays	loops
you can make an arrays of the possible objects you want to try then run a loops

558321
ienumerator	ienumerable
implementing ienumerable means your class returns an ienumerator object

558324
abstract	extends
now if you have your integration web combined test that tests all components together you d need remember the ideal world for this abstract scenario 5 5 5 125 tests that test all permutation to give you the same result as the 15 test cases above given that you can even triggers all permutation otherwise there would be untested unspecified behaviour that might bite you later when you extends your components

558331
ienumerator	ienumerable
most of the time ienumerable ienumerator are used transparently as part of a foreach loop

558332
ienumerator	ienumerable
thus when your class implements ienumerable you are saying that you can call a methods getenumerator and get a new object returned an ienumerator you can use in a loop such as foreach

558359
decimal-point	digits
and if by round to n sig-fig decimal places you mean the n most significant digits regardless of the decimal-point then the test assert nearlyequal -1e-9 1e-9 5 should fail because 0.000000001 and -0.000000001 are totally different when viewed this way

558380
configuration	environment
other environment have their own configuration location or application

558423

558427
attributes	properties
by means of a properties see browsable attributes and properties get setters and a propertiesgrid control

558430
selected	button
try going to the publish tab in the project properties and then selected the application files button

558431
response	timeout
it is my experience that minute long delays often is caused by dns misconfiguration bad routing tables dns must timeout when no positive response is received or simply an incorrect lmhosts file

558435
selected	button
i solved the problem by going to the publish tab in the project properties and then selected the application files button

558443
driver	kernel
if you are writing a windows kernel driver how do you unit test it

558443

i am writing a data-access library using the ado entity-framework in visual-studio 2008 sp1 using the .net 3.5 sp1

558462
order	add
based on what i have read online in order to resolve this issue you must add a condition to the associations on the foreign key like so

558462
any	set
since the leader follower properties are only in the persontoperson derived type - not any other derived type or base type - and the same is true of the person location property why isn t the typediscriminator field sufficient for the ef to figure out which set a given row belongs in

558469
affinity	cpu
i have a pthread_t and i d like to change its cpu affinity

558469
affinity	cpu
i need to be able to set the cpu affinity of an arbitrary thread

558479
json	xml
you will probably want to use the json object call so you can pass back a javascript object that will be easier to use than return xml etc

558497
extends	super
because composite itself doesn t need to be initializer with a constructor no need to call super my constructor of widget extends composite look something like

558500
perl	php
read the sign ups at most free webhosts and they support php server side includes some perl cgi a version of python around 2.2 or 2.3 if at all and rails

558529

hard-drive	floppy
that means since a b are reserved for floppy drives and c is by default the first hard-drive you have a max of 23 other drives that can be mounted and assign drive letters

558568
debugging	trace
i know you used to be able to use nslog to trace out messages when debugging cocoa applications

558574
relative-path	filepath
where filepath is the relative-path of the file from the classpath root and filename is the name of the file

558582
hash	md5
also instead of using registration_confirmation_code you might want to consider using a md5 hash or the like of the users email address

558592
selected	listbox
when the user selected and item the second listbox should be populated with the pertinent data

558592
selected	listbox
here is what happens the first listbox is filled with data the user selects an item and the selectedindexchanged event fires but the selection gets cleared before method can see which item was selected

558593
dialog	pop-up
if you want to pop-up a potentially long list i would suggest creating your own dialog

558601
core-animation	core-graphics
you could either dynamically create a bunch of uiimageview s and animate their positioning in a loop or possibly with core-animation or could draw the images to a core-graphics layer and update that with a loop

558605
display	width
because if thatâ s the case you can give your li s a fixed width of 33 and float them or display them inline

558622
.net	wcf
not to mention all of the stuff you get with .net 3.0 wpf wcf etc

558626
populate	row
click on a date row should allow a controllers with uidatepicker to populate on the screen

558635
postback	ajax
this way only the second listbox will be updated when you perform your ajax postback

558636
uinavigationcontroller	uitableview
i m in a uitableview with a uinavigationcontroller in my application and launching a uiwebview that loads an mp3 file on the internet by pushing the web view s controller onto the navigation controller s stack

558642
contains	elements
or you can positioning them absolutely relative to the body or some other contains elements - but that comes with severe limitations regarding the size of the elementss and positioninging relative to other elementss on the page

558650
hide	show
assuming you have the different tabs working showing already you can just loop through all elements the blocks with the form fields you show and hide as requested when the user click all and show them all

558652
selected	button
then set the visibility of the divs bar the selected on click of your tab button fields to hide them

558660
persistence	hibernate
spring transactions are valid for jdbc hibernate ibatis or any other persistence technology that spring supports

558677
hidden	reset
you can set the attributes of the files you want to keep to readonly and hidden first delete the rest and then reset the attributes of the hidden readonly files back

558715
updating	updates
when you are only updating part of a page or perhaps performing an action that doesn t updates the page at all ajax can be a very good tool

558734
order	join
... mysql uses the stored key distribution to decide the order in which tables should be joined when you perform a join on something other than a constant

558741
openbsd	bsd
for system-level networking code you expressed an interest in drivers etc see openbsd sources since it s tight clean and the standard networking apis are based almost completely on bsd

558748
enterprise	platform
i say that after having built commercially available software which was delivered as a netscape plugins 13 years ago followed by activex controls and java applets and seeing all of these platform fail to become ubiquitous in the enterprise for one reason or another

558748
silverlight	wpf
one more important point is the fact that silverlight and wpf share so much in common

558748
silverlight	wpf
our plan is to share a large amount of implementation between silverlight and wpf versions of our software

558748
windows-applications	wpf
it is only a matter of time before wpf is the standard for windows-applications â i donâ t know whether that is a couple of years or ten years but it will clearly happen over time

558756
conditional	operators
would a conditional de-reference operators

558758
selected	cell
responding to the cell did selected message

558772
redmine	trac
for something completely different the best way to do agile development with trac may be to simply migrate everything to redmine

558775
membership	guid
one technique i use is to use the membership guid id as a foriegn key to my own users table which contains my extended data

558777
key-value	key
edit return arrays of key not new arrays with key-value

558779
thickbox	jquery
thickbox jquery plugin

558796
attributes	properties
double check your properties types and attributes match

558798
put	get
take the time and get the schema right and put some thought into data quality in the design of your application

558815
processor	affinity
other than accessing internal data-structures of the threading library which you understandably do not want although with your assumptions about processor affinity and linux thread ids your code will not be portable anyway you may be able to play a trick at creation time if you control the code that creates the threads

558815
affinity	cpu
whether this trick is worth it depends on how important setting the cpu affinity is in your case versus not accessing internal structures of the thread library or depending on a thread library that provides pthread_setaffinity_np

558822
iteration	sorted
a list will still require some kind of scan straight iteration or binary search if sorted

558827
versioning	upgrade
to my knowledge microsoft doesn t simply provide a download of the epu to upgrade it so how do i execute the package on a server that s running the previous versioning of sql-server

558839
boolean	int
subclasses for specific int boolean might also be needed

558848
communication	messages
the other week i wrote a little thread class and a one-way messages pipe to allow communication between threads two pipe per thread obviously for bidirectional communication

558864
object-reference	instances
system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an

558897
document	element
the document even a para element that

558897
document	element
is a document element will be selected

558897
document	element
by para since the document element

558911
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
you could do dynamic-sql in your code to create the statement as required but if so you need to watch for sql-injection

558929
constructor	object
its use ensures that the new object doesn t become available to any other thread until after the constructor has been executed and after all of the properties have been initialized.

558930
constructor	object
it looks like you re trying to access age in the object s constructor

558930
constructor	object
the object initializer values won t be set until after the constructor has executed

558930
constructor	object
if you need access to age in the constructor itself then you ll need to create an explicit constructor with the required parameters and use that instead of the object initializer syntax

558941
exception-handling	try-catch
if you rarely expect the exception-handling to be thrown i d use the try-catch

558942
oracle	mysql
this is running on an sql database so mysql and oracle won t work

558952
punctuation	words
if there were punctuation between the words hello world would the punctuation be a separate token part of hello or ignored

558958
keyboard	mouse
i believe click will be triggers for both keyboard and mouse

558966
.net	wcf
returning xhtml from a wcf component would be the same as returning wcf from any other .net component - probably as a string

558977
.net	wcf
i know that wcf in .net 3.5 sp1 allows one to run wcf with the jsondatacontractserializer instead of the standard datacontractserializer which serializes objects into xml

558980
wan	vpn
it works quite well i have complete control over who accesses my repo by their ssh certificates and the performance blazes even over remote wan and vpn links

558985
macros	let
i don t know why but whenever i ve seen this the solution is to record a dimple macros and let excel create a new module for that macros s code

558985
put	get
your code works when i follow this procedure but if i put it in the code module attached to thisworkbook i get the #name result you report

559019
value	field
building a hashmap of these objects based on the field value as a key could be worthwhile from the performance perspective populate maps once and find objects very efficiently

559066
abstract	extends
well it lets you be explicit about your intentions where you call and unambiguous about the meaning of arg1 and arg2 where you recieve and it lets you abstract to a custom data object class you can extends functionality to

559101
textbox	button
there is a textbox for application name and right next to it a button create if the folder isn t already an application

559102
dialog	pop-up
also you can experiment with css visibility by setting display none and undoing that just before you pop-up the dialog

559104
directory	folder
you can generally tell by looking at iis manager whether or not your directory is a virtual directory as it will not look like a yellow folder

559104
directory	folder
if it does look like the typical yellow folder right click the parent default web site or whatever and choose new virtual directory

559107
getter	setter
getter and setter are usually inlined replaced directly in the machine code instead of a call to a subroutine and constants are folded

559135
attributes	properties
to remove the warnings add the following attributes so that the class methods and properties look like this

559138
any	set
the rendered code in firebug lacks any indication that the onclick event has been set

559139
osql	bcp
if these still don t suit your needs you ll need to use another tool such as bcp or sqlcmd osql

559157
tortoisecvs	svn
however i am finding it hard to get buy-in for svn because tortoisesvn doesn t work like tortoisecvs

559166
host	dns
the smart host is correctly set up with reverse dns and mx records set up correctly

559168
click	mouse
for those unfamiliar with qc the patch editor is a visual representation of the patch graph effectively showing each node and it s properties and providing a mouse driven selected click drag interface

559168
children	nodes
i ll be using it to render a specific type of multi-rooted tree where each nodes has some associated text and an arc joining it to its children

559168
keyboard	mouse
at the moment i m using a custom nsview inside a scroll view that quartz draws each node the arcs etc at each render and processes mouse and keyboard input by hand including hit testing movement and so forth

559176
command-line	cmd
you of course might want to move the actual cmd into some configuration file as also cmd-line options vary among operating systems mac

559183
gridview	listview
eval is mainly intended for use in expressions within controls such as repeater gridview listview etc where there is a list of data items being bound using templates and you need a method to be able to access the properties of the current data item

559183
reflection	runtime
for all other controls just use normal code expressions inside a data-binding expression - it s much faster and more intuitive than eval which relies on runtime reflection

559224
expression	evaluation
is an expression whose evaluation is deferred something to do with jsf lifecycle requirements and was introduced as part of the unified el

559225
cvsnt	svn
just a wild guess here but if you re using cvsnt on the server this observation might be based on the fact that cvsnt simply is much better at merging than svn because it has the notion of mergepoints

559244
.when	ready
this is an event that will fire .when the document is ready to have dom manipulations performed on it

559244
document-ready	.when
along with the document-ready event the frameworks have provided a way to queue up multiple bits of javascript code and functions to run .when the event fires

559244
jquery	dojo
if you re not opposed to frameworks then you ll want to look into jquery and document.ready prototype and dom loaded dojo and addonload or google for your framework and document ready

559250
value	field
i want to populate form fields with values from a database immediately after the user enters a value in the #sid field

559261
contains	any
be aware that a lot of mail servers rejects email with attachments with files .exe .bat .cmd etc executable and zip files contains any of this files

559282
contains	elements
i d like to use smarty to find the character count of the headline then decide how long to make the first line based on the default font size and the width of the contains elements

559282
arrays	loops
but i m not a coder and don t know the best way to make arrays foreach loops iteration counts and other stuff that s probably necessary to pull this off

559287
emacs	vim
note that emacs vim etc can work as ides - i m not talking about forcing you the world of guis if you want to stay in a text-only situation because you re sshing in

559290
firefox	safari
for example to use it in firefox you would use the property -moz-border-radius for safari use -webkit-border-radius etc

559296
json	xml
are there existing jars available to convert from json to xml

559306
hash	md5
keep in mind that md5 hashing has been cracked by brute force attacks so having a hash password in the open is not 100 secure but for most cases it may be a non issue especially if you use some stronger hashing algorithm

559340
return-value	arguments
as a result of these two constraints everything that a function does is fully captured by its arguments and its return-value

559340
haskell	scheme
haskell is an exception ghc executables are almost as small as c programs both at compile-time and runtime but sml common lisp and scheme programs always require tons of memory

559374
temporary	copy
also you should throw a temporary and catch it by reference to avoid the copy ctor be invoked at your catch site

559382
any	set
if i the visit a page with a before_filter that sets i18n.locale every subsequent visit to any controllers even if it doesn t have that same before_filter setting the i18n.locale get an i18n.locale of whatever was set say en-us

559394
sql-server	ms-access
well of course there is a need to convert the data storage portion to sql-server 2005 while keeping all of these gui forms which were built in ms-access

559433
32-bit	64bit
we run the 32-bit sun java 5 jvm on 64bit linux 2.6 servers but apparently this limits our maximum memory per process to 2gb

559448
firebird	mysql
linked access tables work fine but i ve only used them with odbc and other databases firebird mysql sqlite3

559451
g++	gcc
i usually run in nix so i usually use gcc and g++ as well

559511
delegation	dealloc
so maybe a delegation with dealloc is the secret to getting it to exit back to main

559528
profiling	trace
a profiling is great for looking at your running code during development but if you re looking for the ability to do custom trace in production then as denis g

559531
ftpwebrequest	ftp
the ftp protocol can be accessed through the ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse classes in the system.net namespace and was introduced in .net 2.0

559542
fieldset	labels
i suggest you hide the legend and include an extra labels inside the fieldset for cross browser goodness

559549
msbuild	nant
there is no fancy dependency stuff which i assume is the natural domain of tools like msbuild nant and make

559550
icollection	ienumerable
see the icollection ienumerable etc

559554
recording	playing
the loadrunner virtual user generator vugen works by recording and playing back the http requests

559555
build-process	msbuild
on the other hand i would choose msbuild as while the tasks are very procedural it gives you the flexibility to extend this build-process later on to handle more complex tasks

559568
selected	button
when i selected button b or c the asyncpostback triggers fine and the dropdown is populated

559568
radio-button	button
i have tried both setting the checked state of button a in code on inital loading of the page only ie ispostback is false and alternatively setting the checked attribute of the radio-button in the html with the same results

559578
stderr	stdout
stdout and stderr output can be interleaved on the

559578
stderr	stdout
how do i log stdout and stderr

559592
bug-tracking	trac
i use subversion and trac for bug-tracking and communication with management types

559592
32-bit	x86
my hardware will be staying the same a 32-bit x86 single-core system

559595
abstract-class	subclassing
something you might consider depending on the rest of your design is a factory where your abstract-class has a static methods or multiple static-methodss depending on how you implement it that constructs the appropriate subclassing and returns it as an iconverter

559595
contains	any
iconverter.cpp include iconverter.h and converters.h contains implementation of iconverter abstract functionality static factory methods and any inheritable functionality

559610
return-type	arguments
if your function pointers describe functions with the same return-type and the same number size of arguments you should be okay

559618
expression	brackets
you can use round brackets to grouping parts of the regular expression match

559641
linux	unix
i have successfully compiled it in windows unix and linux

559643
contains	any
therefore it is a very good idea to use a parsing function that validates the json string to ensure it contains no dodgy non-json javascript code before using eval in any form

559644
opensuse	rpm
i think this happened to me with the default rpm for opensuse recently.

559648
contains	set
in some file that normally contains passwords set them to dummy values doesn t matter what

559665
procedure	records
executescalar returns null if no records were returned by the query eg when your searchforpassenger stored procedure returns no rows

559671
arguments	default
default arguments promotions

559671
arguments	default
compatible with the type that results from the application of the default arguments

559671
pointers	stack
in the x86 calling convention arguments are pushed on stack and all pointers are the same size 4 bytes in x86 or 8 bytes in x86_64

559671
pointers	stack
calling a function pointers boils down to pushing the arguments on stack and doing an indirect jump to the function pointers target and there s obviously no notion of types at the machine code level

559671
calling-convention	function-pointers
if you pass a function-pointers that uses the standard c calling-convention cdecl badness will result

559671
member-function-pointers	function-pointers
in c++ cast between class member-function-pointers and regular function-pointers

559676
stderr	stdout
your already defining the stdout stderr of the processes your executuing by the stdout stderr methods

559684
methods	extend
if you just want to format a time a clean approach in ruby-on-rails as given in agile web development is to extend the formats used in the to_s methods

559698
windows-vista	windows
the problem is that everything is working fine using rundll32 to call the dll on windows-vista but when i try the same rundll32 call on windows 2000 i get the following error

559700
triggers	insert
you should be able to call a udf in your triggers for each row in insert

559714
order	add
so if you are using linqtosql then you would have to add a row into the table that the iqueryable was querying in order to add a row into the iqueryable

559718
debugging	trace
the conditionalattribute that is applied to the trace and debugging class methods causes all calls to the methods to be removed if trace or debugging are #undef d including the expensive parameter evaluation

559722
interceptor	inject
but for certain events in the engine you can attach interceptor aka aspects the events being the point-cuts etc -- i use this to inject using inversion-of-control business entities into my domain objects

559722
managed-code	unmanaged
adding extension points in your managed-code for unmanaged callback to c++ through p invoke but this requires some thought as exception-handling-handling don t cross m um memory-boundaries happily rather it will mess your application up and unless you re using vc++ c# in windows with managed exception-handling framework this could seg-fault quite badly

559727
lgpl	gpl
tri-licensed under gpl lgpl and mpl so you shouldn t have a problem with it

559729
put	get
you could even put the code to get the connection string into getconnection unless you need the flexibility of opening multiple connections with different connection strings

559758
background-image	width
and since allot of the divs are set with a background-image there is no css code for setting the width on the image but i guess it would work on the divs

559764
double-quotes	single-quotes
no except in double-quotes you can put single-quotes

559764
double-quotes	single-quotes
and in single-quotes you can put double-quotes

559775
bison	yacc
lex and yacc or their gnu equivaents flex and bison do their work at compile time and may not be flexible enough for your needs

559784
arrays	map
arrayss are not classes in java for a good reason - they map well onto people s understanding of how an arrays should work from experience with c-style languages

559808
daemons	systemd
in other words if my daemons exits normally and closes dev watchdog the systemd would still re-boot 59 seconds later

559808
daemon	sigint
i need to make my daemon aware of this setting because it will influence how i handle sigint

559808
shutdown	daemon
if the setting is on my daemon would need to preferably start an orderly shutdown on exit or at least warn the user that the system is going to reboot shortly

559808
shutdown	daemon
i need to be able to tell if config_watchdog_nowayout was set from within a user space daemon so that i can handle the shutdown of said daemon differently

559815
export	csv
when export a csv from access 2007 it automatically converts decimal into scientific notation

559821
python	ruby
those methods start to look an awful lot like ruby or python idioms

559828
shell	bash
however i think i ve gotten more mileage out of the bash shell script if you re using a good development platform

559853
notification-area	tray
i know how to place a icon in the windows notification-area systemd tray

559856
put	get
this implementation provides constant-time performance for the basic operations get and put assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets

559856
put	get
this implementation provides guaranteed log n time cost for the containskey get put and remove operations

559860
function-calls	main
but also keep in mind when debugging a multithreading gui app and you re debugging in a thread other than the main application thread you need to turn off the enable property evaluation and other implicit function-calls option or else vs will automatically fetch the value of local global gui objects from the current thread which will cause your application to crash fail in strange ways

559867
export	csv
you can write your own csv export routine in vba

559872
any	set
it enables you to set a proxy to any program

559877
cross-compiling	toolchain
in the not-yet production ready category it looks like the mono folks are able to cross-compiling c# to native code for deployment on the iphone using the apple toolchain

559906
getter	setter
examples are getter setter and or things that a compiler interpreter will catch immediately

559917
git-rebase	git-merge
does that mean i should use git-merge instead of git-rebase if my branch went public and others are working on it

559925
required	checked
d our development process required us to checked in unit tests for new features and bug fixes

559926
attributes	properties
then use an msbuild script that calls the project msbuild script twice and uses the properties attributes of the msbuild task to specify the configuration to build

559927
fadeout	fadein
you could consider implementing and learning jquery which has a few plugins to fade things as well as built in functions such as fadein fadeout etc

559937
bugzilla	trac
i would suggest something more modern than bugzilla such as trac or lighthouse although bugzilla may fit your bill

559937
bugzilla	trac
there are lots of vendors that do trac bugzilla other bug tracker hosting

559943
windows-xp	windows
the ole automation is sometimes source of strange issues it sometimes gets automatically selected on my windows server 2008 x64 machine but i have to disable it on my windows-xp 32bit desktop.

559953
constructor	object
we d have really specific constructor that made sure you fully constructed the object before using it

559953
constructor	object
these days with orm frameworks dependency-injection serialization etc. it seems like you re better off just relying on the default constructor and exposing everything about your class in properties so that you can inject things or build and populate object more dynamically

559953
constructor	object
in c# it s been taken one step further with object initializers which give you the ability to basically define your own constructor

559953
constructor	object
i know object initializers are not really custom constructor but i hope you get my point.

559969
regular-language	pumping-lemma
so if we think about the pumping-lemma for regular-languages what it says essentially is that any regular-language can be broken down into three pieces x y and z where all instances of the language are in xy z where is kleene repetition ie 0 or more copies of y . you basically have one nonterminal that can be expanded

559971
git-rebase	git-merge
in other words if others are pulling and pushing it s better that you stick with git-merge or avoid pushing until after the git-rebase and only git-rebase your work

559975
design-by-contract	paradigms
they they being application and domain services and other intrinsics classes to the program expose their dependencies but in fact can be encapsulated and tested in even better isolation than previously since the paradigms of design-by-contract design-by-interface which you often use when mocking dependencies in mock-based testing in conjunction with inversion-of-control will move you towards class-as-component semantics

559975
constructor	object
object initializers aren t the same as constructor they are just a way of collapsing a few lines of code

559975
constructor	object
values instances in the will not be assigned until all of your constructor have run so in principle it s just the same as not using object initializers

559977
base-class	subclass
all the public methods of the base-class should make sense for the subclass

560009
subtract	time
then you can see the difference at any time by subtract the saved value

560016
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
viewwillappear viewdidappear of view 1

560043
error-handling	try-catch
the other answers are correct try-catch is for exceptional circumstances and error-handling

560043
contains	elements
does the document contains a leftnav elements

560044
perl	c++
python isn t compiled in the same sense as c or c++ or even java python files are compiled on the fly you can think of it as being similar to a interpreted language like basic or perl

560044
python	java
python code is byte compiled into an intermediate form like java however there generally isn t a separate compilation step

560076
contains	set
for example given a basic data class contains only public get set properties and private backing fields

560077
.doc	xls
xls .doc pdf odt etc. in my java application eclipse-rcp

560091
boost	tbb
i develop on windows with msvc2008 and am using intel tbb boost and qt

560097
archive	corrupt
until now i ve used archive zip found on cpan but it has a major bug on windows machine that use non-ascii filenames the filenames get corrupt in the archive as they don t get translation into unicode

560097
put	get
thanks to the clarifications from brian and alan haggai alavi it seems that enough love is being put in archive zip to get these bugs out soon and finally have a fully functioning zip module in windows

560098
shell	bash
this is bash syntax if you re using another shell you may have to use expr 1

560110
function-call	inline
performance issues should be negligable as the jiter or compiler will happily work out that your function-call the getter of the property doesn t do anything exciting and can be inline

560119
silverlight	wpf
is it possible to develop against silverlight and wpf using the same source code

560120
silverlight	wpf
i think you can learn a thing or to by studying xaml and wpf silverlight applications

560155
memcheck	valgrind
i have also tried running the program through valgrind s memcheck tool but not getting anything significant about the above piece of code

560176
primitive-types	generics
it helps that .net generics cope with primitive-types better than java does.

560187
rollback	commit
this is why i rely on database transactions to commit or rollback workflow state as the workflow is being processed

560198
triggers	insert
optionally have the insert of triggers on mytable log the fact that it was called it can do this minimally update a pre-existing log tablerow with getdate only if existing row s date is 24 hours old - so will only do an update once a day

560239
32-bit	64bit
it points out itself to 32-bit version of jre jdk instead of 64bit

560242
webserver	security
php5 is pretty good with backwards compatibility and you should not run php4 on any publicly facing webserver if security is even a little bit important to you

560250
default-value	default
intptr.zero represents the default state of the structure it is declared but no constructor is used so the default-value of the intptr void would be null

560270
cross-compiling	toolchain
toolchain cross-compiling

560304
cvs	git
while i m primarely a mercurial user git is also supported as are darcs svn and cvs

one way to get around this is by pasting with put instead of just p like this yat put

560370
logging	trace
i have added service trace logging and can see the response from the service coming back

560372
silverlight	wpf
incidentally prism the composite application block from patterns and practices now supports silverlight and there s a c9 video with a quick sample on using code in both wpf and silverlight

560384
web-config	app-config
within the app-config client and web-config server you can add blocks

560394

the textbox gets bigger and smaller according to the font-size it display so i don t want to set the height property directly if i can help it

560431
silverlight	wpf
i have no experience on that but i have used a component that targets both wpf and silverlight environment with the same code there are only few differences

560437
margins	padding
the grid doesn t care either so finally it asks the page windows which has a fixed size and then this size is propagated down the visual tree taking any margins and padding into consideration along the way

560451
selected	checkbox
i want to achieve that i can use this checkbox to selected unselected a detail row which will then be related to the current master row

560472
anonymous-methods	begininvoke
so in order to pass a function-pointers to anything else you need only create a delegation with the correct signature in this case i used an anonymous-methods but you can use any function with the correct signature and call it s begininvoke methods passing a function that will get called when it s done

560474
keyboard	mouse
using intentionally triggers mouse keyboard events to create pseudo worker threads as in this example

560475
contains	elements
i use an itemopen event with the following code to update another data provider when a tree folder is opened using small triangle - the data provider contains all the elements in that particular tree folder.

560492
mapping	unique
give it a parameter with some kind of unique identifier in the mapping table.column

560492
double	int
you d only have to create a handful of custom types to wrap string double date int etc

560504
google-chrome	safari
i only tested in safari 3.2 and the webkit nightlies google-chrome just uses the webkit from safari 3.1 but i don t believe there s any engine changes between 3.1 and 3.2

560549
getter	setter
keep in mind the only place i want people mucking around with the backing field bar is in setter and getter of the property

560554
versioning	upgrade
and i havent had any need to convert any of my programs to another language in my 20 years as programmer only upgrade from different versioning of same language

560560
silverlight	wpf
this will give you all the layout goodness of wpf silverlight

560560
silverlight	wpf
i did this in a wpf application i m pretty much assuming that you can do the exact same thing with silverlight 2.0 you ll just yell at me if you cant

560561
scheme	let
how about using all colour schemes and let the user change the colour scheme on the fly.

560566
directory	folder
when you set up the three projects to work this way you will find that you are compiling each project to it s correspondent bin folder and to a combined target directory

560581
display	width
thanks kjetil the gridviewcolumn.celltemplate works well and the auto width works of course but when the observativecollection collection is updated with longer-than-column-width data the column sizes do not update themselves so that is only a solution for the initial display of data

560605
alt	src
how do i stripes all attributes from html tags in a string except alt and src using java

560613
wait	hang
use can use sigstop to hang a child process - but that is observably different from the child process going into an infinite loop or a bad conditional wait - still it may be close enough for testing

560628
children	nodes
nodes that have children

560657
ruby	php
generating html with any modern web-flavoured language c# java php python ruby etc is trivial straightforward easy to log and easy to debug

560657
json	xml
the only place i can really see having an application for xslt these days is in consuming web services that produce xml lots produce json and more easily consumed formats these days

560659
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
asp.net mvc ruby on ruby-on-rails cakephp catalyst etc

560671
children	nodes
this code will build a list of root nodes with children

560679
postgresql	mysql
a free database like mysql or postgresql

560679
postgresql	mysql
should i use mysql postgresql or something else which ideally is free as we have a limited budget

560700
compatibility	legacy
the other one is for compatibility with legacy code returns ienumerator

560725
selected	checkbox
selected the checkbox for java navigation

560734
value	field
currently to set the value of the customerid field i have to get the entire customer object from the database and assign it to the account

560734
value	field
i d rather set the value of customerid field directly without round-tripping the database

560768
state-machines	automata
deterministic finite automata dfas or finite state-machines useful for expressing many things such as basic lexers regular expression state transitions etc

560772
contains	any
the header file used by the c++ dll contains a few user defined type definitions and function declarations.i have browsed many sites and all the posters say that its not possible to import header file into c#.i would like to know if there is any way to import header file into c# code as it is required to declare the functions of the imported dll in the c# application class

560780
duplicates	sorted
assuming no duplicates for every sorted sequence there are n

560783
sql-server	mysql
what is the equivalent of sql-server function scope_identity in mysql

560786
aptana	pydev
my favorite environment right now is aptana + fdt + pydev + phpdev

560793
webforms	asp.net
definitely other technologies are advancing at a pace xslt hasn t since 2005ish but it remains a powerful tool which gives you a level of abstraction that say asp.net webforms don t and allows you to provide a general scalable solution to trivially serialise to a range of output formats

560793
json	csv
it s easy to generate html with any given language it s harder to now extend that to xml now extend that to json now extend that to csv

560796
triggers	insert
so it uses the last_insert_id of the original table and not the table insert ed into inside the triggers

560823
scp	ssh
if you can ssh to the ftp server scp and rsync -e ssh are much better

560828
http	ssl
for http connections the webrequest and webresponse classes use ssl to communicate with web hosts that support ssl

560828
http	ssl
if the uri begins with http ssl is used

560832
ftp	scp
although it sounds like the answers so far are sufficient to your needs the question sounds like you re only uploading changes not downloading them the ftp scp rsync-based ones are only really suited to one-way synchronization

560832
cvs	git
if you need bi-directional sync both uploading and downloading changes then you ll need to go with either a remote filesystem-based solution or better imo a proper revision control system such as git svn or cvs

560841
xsd	xml
classes to xsd generates an xml schema

560847
installation	environment
it would be dangerous for the setup to modify a local environment variables such as java_home since it might reference an existing java installation

560847
any	set
when you deploy to a very large set of users you do not want to make any assumption about their platform and configuration

560848
exception-handling	try-catch
use try-catch statements to cover every single piece of code that might throw an exception-handling

560857
contains	elements
i am planning out an edi system that sends amongst other things an xml acknowledgement message contains several elements but specifically these three

560862
httpd.conf	.htaccess
solution add the execcgi option to that directory via either httpd.conf or a .htaccess file

560870
entity	pojo
so if you would have concurrency issues with a simple pojo you will also have them with your entity

560877
constructor	object
unions whose members are object whose respective classes have non-trivial constructor

560926
ruby	php
you should look into rpx its a layer on top of openid and a few other schemes that for most languages is really easy to implement there is a gem for ruby and i know a friend of mine got it into his php application in a less than a couple of hours

560951
sql-server	mysql
these all come from my assumptions on sql-server your mileage with mysql may vary

561000
value	field
you can use it as an ordinary data source and place value of field in the report area

561037
constructor	object
in my opinion a much clearer way of handling object constructor and inheritance in javascript

561076
linux	uname
on linux it returns the same as uname -m

561077
callback	methods
i realized i had accidentally made the web methods static and also forgotten to add the callback methods parameters

561079
realloc	malloc
memory allocation every pointers new ed should be deleted malloc free should not be mixed with new delete when to use delete instead of delete why the c functions are still useful expand realloc

561081
lisp	let
so anyway the key is to learn emacs lisp and then let emacs help you

561090
basic	vba
vba has replaced visual basic 6.0 within offices who thinks of manipulating office via the .net route

561114
order	join
i want all orders listed even if an order doesn t have any charges -- what i would consider a left join in the traditional sense

561115
constructor	object
however i hit the problem that the copy constructor must access a private member of the object it s copying the raw pointer and if it s in a different specialisation of countedpointer they re not visible

561158
arrays	map
if you want to do any kind of indexing or searching of the individiual items of the arrays then you d be far better coming up with a database design to reflect the data you re modelling so an arrays of cartesian coordinates mgiht map to a table containing x y and z columns

561166
constructor	object
the _phonebookentries collection is being initialised in the constructor from a business object

561169
export	csv
you will need to export all the access tables to csv files and import each one into mysql

561170
callback	methods
i can t change the signature of the callback methods - for instance by adding the ref keyword and i don t want to wrap the value type with a class - which would work.

561213
python	php
php is more specialized you hardly do anything else than web apps with it so if you wish to expand your knowledge with more practical languages i would suggest python and for web apps boosted with django

561213
python	java
python is quite general purpose and useful language to anyone s toolbox - and if needed it can be combined with java using jython

561218
virtual-functions	base-class
order of construction and destruction the state of virtual-functions in the middle of constructing an intermediate base-class

561241
spring	grails
since you re already familiar with java and probably spring i would recommend grails

561269
updating	updates
if you want to change the built-in templates that come with visual-studio rather than creating your own derivitives you can try updating the files that live around c program files x86 microsoft visual-studio 9.0 common7 ide itemtemplates though you may also need to updates the itemtemplatescache folder for the changes to be picked up immediately

561277
row	col
changing the value of one cell you call firetablecellupdated row col

561285
glassfish	weblogic
do you specifically mean java ee app servers like weblogic websphere jboss glassfish

561297
qt-designer	pyqt
i would suggest using pyqt and the qt-designer wysiwyg gui designer for making cross platform gui apps

561298
linux	unix
cygwin is a runtime layer that provides libraries and software from the unix linux world on windows

561346
fadeout	fadein
my problem is that the fadein for the second div fires at the same time with the fadeout for the first div

561379
loading	gif
how can i change cursor or gif while loading result in div with mydiv.load page.php

561414
bots	api
just make sure the bots that are using the old and incorrect api don t bring your server down

561416
callback	methods
it appears that the the service invokes the callback methods anonymously

561421
selected	checkbox
i have created a picture library and selected some pictures through a checkbox

561450
windows-vista	windows
windows-vista and windows 7 add more columns and they re actually documented

561451
counting	repeat
i d like to be able to say send a known pattern of data simple counting or repeat pattern over the connection and be able to increase the bandwidth by x2 x10 x100 etc

561451
python	c++
no third party libraries just c++ or c or python

561455
.net	wcf
i don t believe there is an official wcf way to return xhtml as of .net 3.5 sp1

561455
json	xml
we return xhtml as well as json and xml from our wcf-based web service

561463
udp	tcp
you should read up on tcp udp ip programming

561464
getter	setter
in general class data-members shouldn t be directly visible either by being public or by having getter and setter

561494
basic	vba
there may be some tools to some of the basic stuff like to upsize to a different database or maybe the look and text boxes of the forms but converting what sounds like a lot of vba code not so sure

561513
32-bit	16-bit
but in a system where a char is 16-bit a 32-bit value will have a sizeof of 2

561532
triggers	insert
insert on duplicate key update will fire update triggers when it will stumble upon a duplicate key and won t violate fk s in case on update

561532
triggers	insert
replace will fire delete and insert triggers and will violate fk s referencing the row being replace d

561532
triggers	insert
if you don t have any triggers or fk s then use insert on duplicate key update it s most efficient

561563
selected	button
when the user clicks the button and selected a file it works fine so far

561568
button	popup
the popup windows contains some asp.net validation controls which do not display when the user clicks the asp.net button to submit the form

561568
button	popup
note when the popup modal is closed a asp.net button is clicked to update an asp.net updatepanel on the parent to show the changes to the record modified in the popup windows

561576
key-value	key
one way of solving this i have heard of is to normalize it with a key-value -pair-table but i do not like that idea since it is kind of a database-within-a-database scheme i do not have a way to require certain key fields nor require a special type and it would be a huge pain to fetch and order the data later

561577
attributes	properties
to resolve this quickly i simply added the attributes properties contextmenu x null to the textbox thereby disabling it

561593
ip-address	proxy
so when say google gets a request it ll see the ip of the proxy which is canadian and not your us ip-address

561598
synchronous	.when
.when you are unit-testing if you re using something like rhino-mocks and the automocking containers you can swap in your synchronous actionrunner

561599
mac-address	ethernet
in this case you ll need the destination mac-address to put in the ethernet frame so it goes to the right place

561599
ethernet	packets
regarding framing and crc ethernet hardware will frame the packets and generate check crcs

561609
temporary	copy
create a temporary copy of i

561609
temporary	copy
return the temporary copy

561609
temporary	copy
for complex objects the temporary copy cost is non negligible

561612
vb.net	vba
make the forms look the same as on your existing application or at least have the same function port the vba to vb.net or c# if you feel like it form by form module by module and test that they work as you go along

561642
sql-server	mysql
i don t have much experience with mysql but on ms sql-server adding an index on both columns allowed for an index seek and return times on a 1m row table went from 1-2 seconds to millisecond response times

561643
double	int
seriously though if i is a native data type such as int double etc -- no difference

561649
value	field
next i need to loop through each row and assign permissions based upon the value enum statusvals in the field status as well as the user role

561671
linked-list	arrays
don t ask me why it was a linked-list instead of a simple arrays list even less as we have in general 0 or 1 view inside... so i took the more common arrayslist in my question as it has an older cousin

561672
selected	button
enter your keyword selected google.ca as your domain country as canada and click the preview ad button

561685
any	set
then to cover off any filesystems changes i would set up a clean install of sharepoint if you didn t need to already by following the document mentioned above and do a file comparison between your source and destination sharepoint application servers

561702
arrays	loops
i think the best way to achieve this is to loops through the objects and arrayss that are passed and found myarrays has arrays and call it self until there only two string number regexp values to be compared against

561729
subclassing	inherited
now i have a subclassing d that inherited of b and c

561742
build-system	scons
there is a paper in which i evaluated a specific recursive make build-system and compared it to a scons port

561742
build-system	scons
the performance results are not representative because the build-system was very non-standard but in this particular case the scons port was actually faster

561742
build-system	scons
personally i would rather use scons for usability reasons or rake - basically any build-system using a modern scripting language and which has implicit dependency support

561753
animation	rotation
normally core animation only handles changing the size position rotation or opacity of a prerendered layer not its content. their example uses an animating sine wave but you could replace that with your arc drawing

561786
superclass	inherited
edit actually the same would apply to class-based inherited for methods declared as abstract in the superclass

561825
json	xml
use json if possible and json_decode - it s easier to work with if not possible use any xml library for parsin such as domxml

561841
expression-blend	wpf
if you have access to expression-blend you can use it to learn a lot about how wpf animations are setup in xaml

561843
order	join
that would get rid of alot of that cast and convert stuff whihc has to act on every row especailly inthe where-clause where it has to join that stuff together into a date for every row in order to apply the where conditions

561861
bazaar	git
i you want to stay up to date you still can play with git mercurial bazaar at home

561874
versioning	upgrade
i think the url form you are looking for is at least that is what works in 1.3 and 1.4 i will point out 1.4.3 should be out soon and with all of the bug fixes and added functionality 1.4.3 would be a good upgrade target if you are thinking of going that way then you could get everything back on the same versioning

561875
digits	base
here s a function that will encode to any base note the digits are actually stored least-significant first to avoid extra reverse calls

561891
value	field
i assumed this was because the date formats did not match causing a problem with having a month value out of range however i do have date values in the format of day month year in the datetime field already

561891
selected	textbox
i am running sql selected statements to read the dates from the database and place the value in a textbox

561891
textbox	button
i then have a commit command button which then performs an update sql statement to place the value of the textbox into the datetime field in the sql database

561901
rabbitmq	activemq
these days i ve moved away from stomp activemq towards amqp + rabbitmq using the txamqp and py-amqplib libraries

561907
value	field
the autocomplete field needs to store the name and there is a hidden-field that needs to store the value

561916
entity-framework	ado.net
since entity-framework is built on top of ado.net i was expecting there to be a xml data provider of sorts

561926
postdata	request
allesklar that is slightly misleading as scripting and bots can postdata nearly as easily as sending a normal request

561946
any	set
so i would like to set up nginx so that if any requests matching the location api will not time out for 120 seconds

561975
configuration	environment
because this issue is going to affect pretty much all projects we deploy to a live environment i held out for a purely configuration solution

561975
host	dns
i think that if you created a new dns entry specific to your web application added a new web site and gave it a single host header matching the dns entry you would mitigate this issue altogether and would not have to write custom code or add prefixes to your web.config file

562014
union-all	union
to solve your problem you can use union or union-all

562018
swing	awt
4 graphviz would be nice but the grappa java library is quite outdated and is built upon swing awt

562033
selected	cell
when the user clicks on the button set a public variables on the form with the cell reference the selected

562033
selected	cell
then you you need to use .show vbmodal on the user form and read off the cell they selected from the form public variables

562056
contains	elements
i now wish to extract a subset of these events contains those elements that are placed in an interval between two datetime instances a b such that starttime a starttime b

562065
directory	folder
go to the cc.net installation directory and delete the webdashboard folder

562074
upgrade	migrate
i would say if you are able to migrate anyway you might as well upgrade to increase the longevity of your code base

562087
revision	updates
i use rev in a file to have the revision number the problem is that the file does not change a lot so the number is not automatically updates

562093
order	add
in order to get the desired behavior you will need to add the namespaces back into your code files as that is the only way the compiler will create type names with that namespace

562104
chown	chmod
why can t internal unix commands cd pwd etc be run directly in java like external commands chmod chown etc using runtime.getruntime .exec

562117
repository	entity
won t it move business operation from entity to repository

562118
sharing	share
then right-click on the folder selected properties then click the web sharing tab then selected share this folder option this should bring up an edit alias windows

562122
command-line	cmd
built-in cmd are not actual executable files but are simply interpreted by the shell when the shell encounters them on the command-line or in a script

562127
contains	any
we need to use the string variant otherwise our command will get mangled by the stringtokenizer if it contains any whitespace

562143
attributes	properties
if you add the system.componentmodel.browsable true attributes to your properties it should show up in the properties browser

562164
account	api
i m fond of creating a gmail or other free account and then using the java mail api in j2ee to send messages from your new gmail account to whoever.

562164
arguments	default
typically i ll create a mailer class which can be constructed with a default constructor and then give it a send string dest string subj string body obj attach...if you want and then in your case you might wrap the thing in a main methods so that you can call it from else with some command-line arguments or call from within some java program

562167
symfony	kohana
thankfully the language is going in a good direction oop and we are getting a share of quality frameworks cake symfony codeigniter kohana and so on and the tools are getting more serious

562168
32-bit	64bit
if fixed-width 32-bit integers are used then it is requires only two fixed-width numbers for 32-bit one 64bit number and one 128-bit number

562170
repository	entity
if you are writing your own mapper then repository would forward request to mapper for the entity

562171
32-bit	64bit
after migrating to jdk6 64bit from jdk5 32-bit windows-server we got leak in perm gen space memory block

562179
numeric	digits
the general way to pass numeric arguments to a command is to type meta digits before the command

562185
unpivot	pivot
look at using the pivot and unpivot commands

562187
rhino-mocks	moq
mocking frameworks like moq or rhino-mocks can only create mock instances of objects this means mocking static-methods is not possible

562192
python	php
i think if the xampp lampp people rolled a version with python instead of php that might be a potential php killer. the one click install makes it easy for novices to get started with php and i could see the same really helping python adoption

562198
compatibility	legacy
vista comes with a set of compatibility options to allow legacy applications to run

562208
contains	lookup
it contains lookup tables to speed up parsing and some default definitions for most everything you d need

562225
key-value	key
for the issue of limiting the scope of your user-controls variables you could store some sort of a key-value structure to keep your user-controls-specific value - the key would be the user-controls clientid and the value would be the variables that you re interested in

562227
globalization	localization
i ve found tons of information on localization globalization how these files work and lots of ways to manipulate them but nothing on preventing them building in the first place

562234
contains	set
and after in each query with contains i set the language to 0

562240
return-value	arguments
i ve also dumped the assembler code for the creation of the derived1 and call to use 4 is first arguments register 2 is return-value register 0 is always-0-register after demangling the names in it by the c++filt tool

562275
environment	building
i have done both in production environment depending on the situation and their sample is a very good place to start building your own custom auth module

562278
contains	elements
in php the _file arrays contains a tmp elements which is where the file lives until you place it where you want it

562283
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome not so great in ie7

562283
google-chrome	firefox
any reason why that would work perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but fail in ie

562293
bison	yacc
input files for bison should follow the yacc convention and be named foo.y

562299
export	report
the bo job scheduler can be set up to automatically run report at a given time and export them as excel csv etc

32-bit	64bit
edit i ve been told that my timing numbers in the documentation are off from what judy s documentation suggests because judy is developed for 64bit cache lines and my powerbook was only 32-bit

562355
internet-explorer	firefox
james has a good point if this is supposed to match the value in an internet-explorer may include the path while firefox does not i know it does on the server it may on the client as well

562358
host	dns
the first node to fire up would reclaim the dynamic dns entry dyndns has a fairly easy to use api if there wasn t an active host on the network

562377
pointers	stack
great on pointers pointers to functions and a variety of advanced topics such as how stuff is stored in memory dynamic memory stack usage function calling parameter passing etc

562380
automake	gnu
by and large it works fine and is much better than our previous system a recursive thing done with gnu automake

562380
solaris	aix
we support all the major operating systems out there commercially aix hp-ux linux os x solaris windows even the as 400 mainframe

562406
author	posts
if say i wanted to write an application to link blog posts to author i would have to account for all those names

562407
administration	credentials
also you cannot write to anything in the registry in local_machine without administration so you either have to stick to local_user or raise credentials see below

562413
document	element
in one document a div element has the id â œfooâ and in the other document a span element has the same id

562428
triggers	insert
so today i made up this instead of insert triggers

562473
spring	guice
write normal testable injectable objects and let guice spring whatever handle the instantiation

562490
ironpython	cpython
ironpython 2.0 is cpython 2.5 compatible so pure python that uses 2.5 apis should work fine under ironpython

562495
pascal	delphi
a delphi pascal parsing can be used to validate the input

562499
response	timeout
edit considering what s found on nginx wiki the send_timeout directive is responsible for setting general timeout of response which was bit misleading

562499
response	timeout
for fastcgi there s fastcgi_read_timeout which is affecting the fastcgi process response timeout

562512
google-chrome	firefox
add to the confusion that firefox google-chrome safari don t ask twice - only ie 6 and 7

562524
google-chrome	firefox
i tried opening the page in firefox ie and google-chrome but nowhere do i see the proper font

562535
methods	extend
you can extend the cgi.fieldstorage and replace the make_file methods to place the file wherever you want

562537
children	nodes
heaps a tree where the parent of a nodes always maintains some relation to the children of the nodes for instance the parent of a nodes is always greater than each of it s children max-heap

562542
mod-proxy	mod-perl
i ended up setting up two virtual-servers on different ports then used mod-proxy to redirect traffic to the rt site to the mod-perl virtual-server leaving the passenger one as the default

562544
constructor	object
if instead an object has a reference to the singleton object passed in either via constructor or other method then it doesn t matter how the singleton is actually created and the whole pattern turns out not to matter

562545
internet-explorer	safari
only two browsers support it â internet-explorer for windows version 5 or better and safari 3.1

562550
instances	destroy
this makes testing easy because you can create a new instances of the class for each test and let the garbage collector destroy the instances when it is no more used

562552
binary-search-tree	skip-lists
a skip-lists is a probabilistic data structure based on multiple parallel sorted linked lists with efficiency comparable to a binary-search-tree order log n average time for most operations

562554
directory	folder
if it matters the folder structure of the global server is a subset of the dev server it s just a few selected files directory but all have the same relative paths etc

562570
jndi	jms
file c data eclipse workspace app testfiles jndi jms label .bindings

562578
identity-column	sql-server
is there a tsql query to tell what sql-server identity-column value it expects to use for the next row insert

562588
base-class	inherited
if there was a base-class deriveme that had a function virtual void dosomething int and a class that inherited deriveme called derivedthat that had a function void dosomething someenum ...would the derivedthat override the base-class dosomething because enums evaluate to ints during compile time in c++

562590
output	mode
i know when i m in debugging mode i can use this to see the message in the output windows

562601
debugging	trace
the trace messages can occur in the output windows as well even if you re not in debugging mode

562608
value	field
now i want one query to give me the following information all galleries with their own data field and the number of pictures that are connected to the gallery and the sumarized value of the votes

562620
managed-code	native-code
i understand that most of the time there isn t much performance difference between native-code and managed-code

562623
debugging	trace
by default in visual-studio trace is only defined in debugging mode

562631
superclass	inherited
just use a mixin that answers the question in different ways depending on what s possible and takes the superclass as a templates parameter so the virtual canmove function will be visible through the inherited chain

562638
decrement	increment
to extend jaredpar s answer it s not very difficult to solve without using a regex just write a function that examines each character in the string and increment decrement a counter

562638
decrement	increment
if you find a increment it and if you find a decrement it

562639
command-line	cmd
than in the post build you can use the standard windows command-line cmd

562657
google-chrome	firefox
this works beautifully in firefox safari opera and google-chrome but - of course - not in ie

562665
triggers	insert
this avoids getting new identity values insert by triggers into other tables and not the table you just insert into

562670
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
my first thought was an excel openoffice.org spreadsheet under version-control

562671
32-bit	64bit
apparently oracle installers for 32bit and 64 bits don t recognize each other so if you first install 32bit version and then install 64bit version the 64 bit version will be installed by default to the same directory as 32-bit version

562671
32-bit	64bit
the solution was to remove both clients and then install 32-bit into one directory and 64bit to another directory

562678
configuration	upgrade
now if your configuration file has changed between releases add removed some options you ll need to do something to upgrade the file while saving the previously edited values

562680
constructor	private
in a language that does not support multiple inheritance nested classes or private classes private constructor not an option how can you design a requirement that task is only ever instantiated through user or project

562682
put	get
how can i get list of all colors i can pick in visual-studio designer which is system.windows.media.colors but that isn t a collection and put them into my own combobox using wpf and xaml markup

562696
multiple-file-upload	multiple-files
what i want to do is use this jquery multiple-file-upload plugins to upload multiple-files

562699
groovy	java
the team went with groovy because it was somewhat more familiar-seeming than jruby but offered more flexibility than java

562700
groovy	java
i had no previous experience using groovy only java

562700
groovy	java
the main disadvantage of groovy is for me that it s considerably less convenient to debug than java - stack traces are bloated by the reflection magic that happens underneath groovy s hood and error messages can be cryptic - but that may in large part be due to my lack of experience

562721
any	set
for any inheritance hierarchy you need a vtable for each set of virtual functions defined by a particular class in that hierarchy

562729
substring	ends-with
this matches any correctly parenthesised substring as long as it begins and ends-with parentheses

562729
contains	set
1 a set of parens contains a balanced substring

562759
put	get
i get intellisense in both the master page and in content pages tried it with the code you put in your question

562760
margins	padding
if your intent is to set the padding and margins of every single element then there should be no problem with that selector

562787
implements	extends
if so you could extends them in a different file and extract an interface and let it be implements by all address classes

562796
groovy	java
i m looking to write some groovy code to perform tasks inside of install anywhere but because of the platforms we support i m restricted to java 1.5

562804
groovy	java
i use groovy with java 1.5 and everything works fine as far as i can tell

562810
attributes	properties
just so people know accessorizer does more than just generate accessors both 1.0 and properties for 2.0 it also generates core data code for persisting non-standard attributes your nsset accessors for custom to-many relationships

562823
preserve	copying
edit for clarification my main problem is i don t have a thorough grasp on how the like command works just copying the code and as the keyword implies some degree of vagueness i would like that vagueness preserve if i switching to a regular expression

562850
canvas	scale
how do i scale an image in flex to fit a canvas

562853
subtract	add
updating vote_values on a vote record should also update total_vote_values with the difference subtract old value add new value

562894
contains	elements
how could i go about detecting returning true false whether an arraylist contains more than one of the same elements in java

562904
contains	any
worded another way minimum number of clusters where each cluster contains a maximum number of addresses and any address within cluster must be separated by a maximum distance.

562907
vb.net	vb6
don t forget how negative numbers are expressed in binary and that vb6 and vb.net interpret numbers like h8300 differently

562907
32-bit	16-bit
because hedb80000 doesn t fit in 16-bit vb interprets it as a long 32-bit

562942
associations	model
essentially we temporarily unbind the item hasandbelongstomany label associations in beforesave so the habtm data doesn t get saved and we store the habtm data in a property of the model so we can use it in aftersave although it s probably still available then anyway

562942
associations	model
we then bind the with model to item with a hasmany associations and format the data as required by cakephp s core model saveall methods before finally calling it on the with model passing in the new data

562945
python	java
java and python have xml support in the standard libraries

562960
integer	zero
scattered zero may mean integer values or unicode strings and so on

562960
c-strings	pascal
try to find as many strings as possible try different encodings c-strings pascal strings utf8 16 etc.

562962
any	set
assuming these are unversioned files for example text xml configuration files not assemblies i would manually set the file version on any file i wanted to always be updated the manually set version will override what is already installed and leave alone the others which the file replacement logic should ignore

562978
dialog	pop-up
no idea but we pop-up a separate error dialog displaying the issue rather than updating an existing label

562985
traceroute	ping
mtr is a traceroute replacement it is a combinations ping and traceroute

562986
type-safety	generics
is there way to implement this with generics to give type-safety for the values

562989
any	set
so if you set say modification plus 2 hours any browser that requests content within 2 hours after the file is modified on the server will cache that content until 2 hours after the file s modification time

562990
boost	stl
.net library support is way better and cleaner than stl mfc and boost

562994
webforms	asp.net
for example in asp.net both webforms and mvc it is not at all uncommon with base classes for a lot of different things - the most common use i ve seen is for methods that you want to run every time a page is loaded or every time a specific group of pages are loaded

562996
contains	elements
one contains the actual elements in the form i want to populate on each row of the form

563000
intrinsics	inlining
can the pdb file become less usable when the compiler uses different kinds of optimizations fpo pgo intrinsics inlining etc.

563003
iteration	set
this is still not complete because of multi-step operations that need to be atomic get modify set or iteration

563004
default	reset
what this means is that if an update is applied the default configuration is reset but the per-user configuration is not

563016
duplicates	elements
if your elements are somehow comparable the fact that the order has any real meaning is indifferent -- it just needs to be consistent with your definition of equality the fastest duplicates removal solution is going to sort the list 0 n log n then to do a single pass and look for repeated elements that is equal elements that follow each other this is o n

563016
duplicates	elements
in a merge or heap sort indeed when the sort is completed you will have compared every duplicates pair unless both elements were already in their final positions which is unlikely

563037
credentials	security
i had to ditch the basic wcf username pwd security and implement my own custom client credentials to hold some more info beyond what is provided by default

563063
methods	extend
i use linq to sql for my dal and i extend the classes to encapsulate my crud methods create read update delete for my bll

563063
linqdatasource	gridview
i don t just use the linqdatasource because i usually have to run some other subroutines whenever i do my normal crud stuff i know this is pretty standard so i use the objectdatasource controls to populate my gridview

563065
highlight	selected
click on an item in the new list selected it and highlight its original slot in the old list which is now a target

563076
pointers	stack
this can be sometimes worked around by going up enough in the call stack to the point where the object pointers or reference exists as a not-optimized-away variables

563080
negative-number	integer
to do that vb6 first extends the integer to a long since h8300 represents a negative-number the long it is converted to ends up with the value hffff8300

563091
euclidean-distance	mahalanobis
euclidean-distance is the easiest to understand but may not be the best look at alternatives such as mahalanobis

563097
nano	vim
personally i prefer the apache php mysql server setup as it is quick and easy to do also you can use almost anything to create php files vim nano

563130
hide	show
if you are simply changing the visibility of the panelss and not retrieving new data via an ajax call you didn t specify remove the updatepanels replace the panels controls with standard divs not running at server and just use javascript to hide and show the divs

563135
32-bit	64bit
i have seen in msdn forums that in order to fix this error i have to build the application set to 32-bit and that way it will run fine on a 64bit server

563142
platform	anycpu
since the default anycpu .net build checks the platform automatically the .net part of the program is starting in 64bit mode

563163
host	root
if one has root on host machine does it always mean that he has root on all vms of that host

563166
selected	checkbox
b selected create from file c check the link checkbox d browse and pick the bmp defined in step 1 e click ok f place the image on the form

563171
codeigniter	kohana
you ll get up to speed with codeigniter or kohana quickly

563208
host	root
ultimately having root on the vm host is the same as having physical access to a regular machine

563221
data-members	constructor
in the book i m reading at the moment c++ without fear it says that if you don t declare a default constructor for a class the compiler supplies one for you which zeroes out each data-members

563229
double	int
this might be confusing because most of the c++ primitive-types do have default constructor that init them to zero int bool double long etc

563234
copy-constructor	constructor
if needed determined at compile time i believe it will also generate a default copy-constructor and a default assignment constructor

563235
udp	tcp
it will be making tcp connections sending udp datagrams and listening for udp broadcasts

563235
ubuntu	linux
i m running on ubuntu 8.04 w linux kernel 2.6.26

563236
installation	uninstall
for a non-msi installation it s easy to define what should happen when a user clicks the change or uninstall button

563246
jquery	.post
if you provide jquery with an actual json literal instead of a string it will convert that into a key value pair of test search and .post that instead of the json

563274
selection	cell
if you want other things to get the box to go you ll need to probably call removeeditor in response to certain events possibly focus or cell selection

563309
sharp-architecture	nhibernate
before billy mccafferty wrote sharp-architecture he wrote what i think is a must read on codeproject about best practices with nhibernate

563319
nsmutablearray	nsarray
there is nsmutablearray and since that s a subclass of nsarray it inherits makeobjectsperformselector

563320
defined	declare
if no destructor copy-constructor assignment operators is definedd the compiler builds one of those for you so a class always has a destructor copy-constructor assignment operators unless you cheat and explicit declare one but don t defined it

563339
parsing	comma
the issue is that the last part of the csv i m parsing can contain comma parts 0-4 are guaranteed not to

563342
common-lisp	lisp
the application was written in common-lisp and ran on top of the cl-http webserver on two symbolics lisp machines later on the open genera virtual lisp machine

563348
ruby-on-rails	django
assuming your site is sufficiently unique enough that it cannot be done with something off the shelf cms blog open source etc then your next best bet to get the site done quickly is to use a programming framework such as asp.net ruby-on-rails django wicket

563350
unsafe	out
i was looking at some older stuff still in use and was trying to figure out what it did and why to determine if i was taking an unsafe shortcut in my new code

563351
webforms	asp.net
from the perspective of an asp.net developer and not wanting to incite a holy war webforms designer in visual studio not really free

563373
pointers	stack
if you know stack size where stack starts and the direction it grows in memory you can simply check the address of stack pointers and see if it past the end of stack

563373
pointers	stack
c++ does not allow direct access to stack pointers

563379
execution	exit
the detached thread is exited using the exit class methods as soon as atarget has completed execution the aselector methods

563388
linux	unix
it s written in java so you can use it on windows and unix linux desktops and servers

563388
execution	jobs
using staf you can create a resource pool of test servers on which you conduct tests then write stax jobs stax is a staf execution framework to conduct the tests

563390
svnkit	svn
svn kit svn 1.5.5 svnkit 1.2.2 r5428

563393
environment	building
like i said we have hudson deploy to our cert environment on each building so it just copies the directory over deletes the web-config and renames web-config.cert to web-config

563407
document	element
just think about it for a second it matches every single element in the document tree

563407
margins	padding
besides for most elements you ll go on and specify a margins padding that is different from 0 anyway

563411
any	set
as others have pointed out the last member of the struct doesn t have any set size

563411
solaris	linux
using the linux definition it s reasonable to assume that any dirent value you have will acept a 255-character string but solaris makes no guarantee that its dirent values will store any more characters than they need to

563438
arguments	default
that means if you only provide one constructor that takes an arguments the compiler will not create the default no-arg constructor for you

563448
value	field
the dataprovider has a list of objects with these two field values but occasionally the second field value can be null

563453
google-maps	openlayers
i admit i ve not really given this problem much attention except to compare openlayers to google-maps after i had already chosen google

563453
google-earth	google-maps
if there are any actually clear benefits in terms of features or performance over google-maps besides google-earth i m very interested too

563464
show	next
next level up show the templates it was instantiated from and so on all the way up to the top-level

563472
common-lisp	scheme
you don t just have to pick between common-lisp and scheme

563472
common-lisp	scheme
you have to pick between several incompatible implementations of common-lisp and several incompatible implementations of scheme as well as other little things like arc and clojure

563472
common-lisp	scheme
it s popular it s actively developed it has many libraries offering the features of a modern programming environment and scheme is somewhat simpler not to say better just simpler than common-lisp

563473
python	php
currently we have php and python libraries for our restful api as well as a wordpress plugin

563481
silverlight	wpf
you can use visual-studio file linking to include classes from wpf projects in silverlight - but only if they don t do any ui or xaml based stuff as this is where you will usually find inconsistencies between the two .

563483
ironpython	ironruby
the issue is i d like to try creating one from ironruby or ironpython which to my knowledge don t support attributes

563490
oprofile	gprof
i use oprofile to try to find hot spots in optimized code i find that it often works a little better than gprof and it can do things like look for data and instruction cache misses

563490
oprofile	perf
update i ve found that perf works way better than oprofile

563515
reference-type	generics
an unmanaged-type is any type that isnâ t a reference-type a type-parameter or a generics struct-type and

563542
authentication	login
check if the user is authentication to access the page in the returnurl after login on the login.aspx page

563544
unsigned	zero
the unsigned right shift operator shifts a zero into the leftmost position while the leftmost position after depends on sign extension

563557
interpreter	runtime
if you want more runtime flexibility you might try ruby or some other interpreter language

563574
identity-column	sql-server
the suggestion of guids will work nicely or if you have vfp8 or later you can use an autoinc column which is analogous to an identity-column in sql-server

563586
abstract-class	pure-virtual
delegates and pure-virtual abstract-class are much less appetizing

563592
any	set
the will be set automatically upon any change in the terminal size

563630
administration	account
i changed the user account but both old and new account is in the same grouping of administration for the server where sp is install

563635
sbcl	ecl
contra chuck an advantage of common-lisp is that it has a standard that implementation stick to and strive for such that you can develop largely with sbcl which has excellent typechecking and inference and then say deploy as an executable linked with c libraries with ecl or others or as a .jar making use of java libraries with abcl or with a mac or a windows-native gui clozure both

563670
csv	xml
via google i can only find answers to these related and insufficient topics generating excel files reading excel xml files reading excel csv files or incomplete abandoned projects

563680
ironpython	ironruby
you also might consider a dynamic language like ironruby or ironpython

563683
put	get
my best advice is just to get a very good spam filtering if you re going to put your address on the web

563707
json	xml
what s my best option using the latest in the .net for creating a webapp with with a complete extjs frontend all server interaction happens through ajax with xml or json

563716
binary	hex
i didn t get the same binary data that was in the table i created but i haven t bothered going into a hex editor to see what was different

563720
order	join
you can t order or limit on a join or do many other useful things like that so you have to fetch every row and then scan them in code which sucks

563723
callback	methods
or so that the class can do a callback typically a callback to a methods of the class which created it

563755
installation	uninstall
one thing you have to remember with an msi installation is that the user-interface is optional you can t count on it being displayed either during install or uninstall

563763
powerpc	arm
the interpreter part of zero is known to work on powerpc 32- and 64-bit x86-64 ia-64 arm and zseries

563795
logging	trace
what you want to do here is insert logging code here to trace the path of execution of your code on different threads and based on that determine where the deadlock is

563805
credentials	security
due to the security setup of the network we cannot consistently use windows authentication to the sql servers so our connection strings and credentials have actual usernames and passwords

563805
configuration	installation
3 copy that configuration file to all installation of a particular piece of software

563811
any	set
once the user logs in it is redirecting to default.aspx although our destinationpageurl is not set to any value

563827
display	width
if i comment out the lines with the label the frame display with the right width

563828
codeigniter	kohana
there are libraries to accomplish this in the php frameworks codeigniter modular extensions and kohana dispatch and component

563844
contains	elements
i d like the contains elements to expand to the size of its contents including the floated elements

563846
value	field
you want a value large enough that it can accept any valid input but not so large that someone could stuff a gigabyte-long string in the field just to attack your system

563847
clearfix	sticky
it should be noted that clearfix can get a little sticky with ie.

563858
value	field
what i tend to do is think of how long a field s value could possibly be then double that to be safe

563868
javafx	swing
is it more advisable to learn swing first and then move on to javafx

563872
sql-server	mysql
the reason that i decided to use orm was because i wanted the ability to switch from sql-server to mysql without changing my code

563876
show	next
there is some interesting work being done on getting a good gnu-screen setup happening by default in the next versioning of ubuntu-server which include using the bottom of the screen to show all the windows as well as other useful machine details like # updates available and whether the machine needs a reboot

563901
javafx	swing
i don t think knowing swing will give you much of an upper hand with javafx

563901
javafx	swing
you can learn javafx fine without swing

563923
nhibernate	ado.net
have kept nhibernate for the create update delete back end stuff but the front end read only was somewhat witlessly implemented and runs like a 2 legged dog and is now being rewritten in plain old ado.net and goes up to 10 times faster

563925
javafx	swing
you don t need to know swing to use javafx

563925
javafx	swing
if you find the javafx tutorial hard learning swing won t be easier

563934
attributes	properties
if by attributes you mean properties then again as far as data-binding is concerned typedescriptor also has potential there - but it is non-trivial

563945
command-line	cmd
add a bunch of missing keyboard shortcuts in windowss explorer xp such as create new folder toggle hidden file show file extension ctrl-enter to open any file as text file in emacs open command-line windows cmd and cygwin shell with the current path set etc

563945
always-on-top	transparency
windows manipulation move resize send to next monitor max minimize toggle always-on-top change transparency etc etc

563946
margins	padding
edit you might also want to play with the left padding margins on the list items and increase it to see if that brings the list markers back

563957
value	field
databases which have varchars almost all do incur a very small penalty for field which are designed to hold longer value but do not

563964
default	reset
also you can find a utility to reset your ubiquity to default in extensions ubiquity labs.mozilla.com google-chrome content reset.html

563970
revision	rcs
not really in need of revision control beyond the capabilities of rcs

563976
implements	extends
it makes it easier to change what the class extends without having to figure out what interfaces it should implements

563988
directory	folder
as the number of files gets large the problem is easy to solve from the point of view of the filesystems store the files into relative path directories so you can keep the number of file per directory under control for instance creating a weekly folder or creating a new folder when the file count is over a certain limit

563998
contains	elements
these xml files contains personal information and the search is based on 10 elements in it for example last name first name email etc

564007
callback	methods
when the socket is closed this forces the receive to complete and the socketerror property of the socketasynceventargs parameter to your callback methods will have a value of socketerror.operationaborted

564047
attributes	properties
then set the type attributes on the properties element to the assemblyqualifiedname of that user type

564063
svnadmin	dump
you could use svnadmin dump and svnadmin load to create a new repository from the original one

564070
python	java
why not do a basic list of requirements cross-match to cms java python ruby et al and then price up the same features if you had to code from scratch

564076
jtable	jlist
aside from debugging overriding the tostring methods of a class can be useful when ading objects into a jlist or a jtable which by default will use the tostring methods to display the object as a textual form in the list or table

564104
value	field
as far as i can figure out the filteringselect does a final query after the user leaves the field and expects the query result to contains only one result which it then uses for the value of the field

564105
passenger	thin
if all that seems like a bit much to keep nginx and thin playing nicely you may want to look into an all in one solution like passenger or litespeed

564114
associations	model
i was using machinist but started using factory girl as it has better support for associations between your model

564121
windows-xp	windows
it uses the win32 api shgetfolderpath which is available on windows-xp rtm and all downlevel windows versions with ie 5.0 installed

564135
python	php
json via python cjson and native php json

564135
python	php
we currently have decently fast implementations in python and php although it isn t very human readable due to using base64 on all the strings binary support

564135
python	php
dynamic languages like php and python get really slow if you have too many iterations in a loop or have to look at each character

564142
32-bit	64bit
startup is particularly slow on a 64bit operating system because of performance difference between the 32-bit and 64bit jitters

564144
keyboard	mouse
alex harui provides a good example with source here it s a bit of a lengthy solution but covers mouse and keyboard interaction with the datagrid

564163
command-line	cmd
on previous versions of java you ll have to access the cmd-line to do a chmod cmd

564210
children	nodes
for each nodes a k the children are a 2 k and a 2 k+1

564210
children	nodes
to maintain the tree as a heap you need to ensure that each nodes is smaller than or equal to its children

564220
checkbox	button
reset checkbox in datalist on click of button that is outside of datalist using c#

564221
exception-handling	error-handling
all pages in the application inherit from a class called applicationbasepage and have consistent error-handling so i m thinking that throwing an exception-handling early in the lifecycle of applicationbasepage will be an easy way to make the application unusable

564221
forms-authentication	security
security is handled by forms-authentication

564223
python	php
is it be possible to implement something similar to this on a much smaller scale using scripting languages like python or php

564226
stream	send
something like qik to broadcast from the device to your website then have the 2nd device connect to that stream -- similar to how quicktime broadcaster not mobile related send its single stream to the streaming server which then handles the distribution

564247
subclassing	base-class
on the other hand if you have an employee class with various subclassing it is a poor design choice to do pattern-matching on an attributes of it say name in the base-class

564248
playlist	playing
how to create a dynamic playlist in c# .net for playing audio files

564249
video-streaming	streaming
a video-streaminging service that can streaming live from mobiles and webcams

564256
sql-server	mysql
would really prefer sql-server as the backend - or a webservice interface if it has to be mysql

564261
integer	zero
using the methods above store a large integer value from which you countdown as soon as the application loads into iis - once it reaches zero delete the value in the db and lock down the application - you would have to reset the value using your encryption for it to work again

564264
key-value	key
an arrays of key-value pairs object literals would provide an iteration order but not the ability to lookup the value based on a key

564268
put	get
i would expect that you would want to put everything on the table and get a full commitment from the customer before performing the work

564271
exception-handling	try-catch
your solution will have to include a for-loop and some sort of error exception-handling process so you will probably have to embed a try-catch statement in your for-loop

564271
exception-handling	try-catch
however by using an try-catch you can make sure that your loop executes all those iterations that don t throw exception-handling

564280
hash	md5
the registration key is then generated by calculating an md5 hash of the supplied name combined with a secred code some random bytes in an arrays

564282
checkbox	button
in the eventhandler for the button onclick event you d loop trough each item in the datalist and find the checkbox and reset it

564289
textbox	button
standard stuff with a username and password textbox and a button to process the login

564295
sql-server	ms-access
i have an sql-server database that includes a linked server to an ms-access mdb database

564295
sql-server	ms-access
the problem is that the sql-server needs to be able to find the ms-access mdw file to be able to login

564307
scheduled-tasks	task-queue
according to the official appengine blog s public roadmap update two weeks ago scheduled-tasks as well as background task-queue are due for the release in the moderately near future in the next six months as of feb

564353
silverlight	wpf
i am a bit surprised that while learning wpf xaml silverlight almost all of the xaml c# examples i have encountered have the click events in the xaml and very few in the windows or page constructor

564363
solaris	unix
for this purpose i m using io.popen and it works as expected in windows but on unix solaris reading from io.popen blocks so the script just waits there until something comes along instead of returning immediately.

564388
conditional	operators
lack of combined like and in conditional operators

564390
versioning	upgrade
ever so often they would release a patch for free and a new versioning that would require an upgrade fee

564392
primitive	int
if you have an arrays of java objects which have a primitive type for example byte int char etc

564392
arrays	loops
in particular can this be done without having to create a new arrays and loops through the contents

564394
traversal	parent
what you want to do is traversal up the parent tree to the very last one -- here s how i would do that

564396
arguments	default
note that the mime type automatically default to text html but you could optionally specify which mime type headers should be sent by supplying the type as an additional arguments to the content methods

564408
ref	out
but returning an arrays ref can be handy if you re going to pick out individual elements

564411
authentication	login
because we also want to user to be able to login by using a small login form visible on every page we developed a filtering which handles authentication and authentication almost like the web container

564411
authentication	login
it redirects to a custom login page if the user is not authenticationd authorized but also allows to authentication a user from a backing-bean

564411
authentication	login
when the filtering redirects to the custom login page it saves the current request to replay it later when the user has been successfully authentication

564411
authentication	login
to do this the filtering has to be able to detect if a post request came from the login page and thus if the user is now authenticated authentication

564412
hosts-file	hosts
the hosts contains entries for both headers pointing back to 127.0.0.1

564412
hosts-file	hosts
i have also given the account explicit permission to read the hosts

564412
hosts-file	hosts
why does the application attempt to use the defunct dns server to resolve the temporary url drs.displayscreen.service instead of the hosts entry

564414
any	set
...and use a style to set the templates and any triggers etc that you need

564414
abstract-class	subclassing
it s an abstract-class of which you d need to create your own custom subclassing that knows how to describe its own presentation via the defininggeometry property

564418
arrays	loops
in particular can this be done without having to create a new arrays and loops through the contents

564420
positioning	slider
when the app comes up tap edit then slider any row to a new positioning tap done and then tap each row one at a time

564435
host	root
for vps providers who use virtuozzo which is based on openvz the root of the host does have access to the whole filesystems even the guest s

564448
revision	rcs
using git for your own locale revision control for the same kind of things you would have used rcs is i would argue easier than using rcs

564453
silverlight	wpf
karl shifflett has some great articles about the mvvm pattern which separates the concerns of your wpf silverlight application very well

564469
python	java
for c++ java or python what are some good game + free game engines that are easy to pick up

564480
c++	lua
i previously have experience with embedding lua in a c++ app and that works really well because i can link statically the whole lua interpreter in with my main executable

564487
sql-server	oracle
if its possible to have multiple rows having the same balance_type month and user_id then you would want to use the pivot command to add up balances for each group which exists both in sql-server and oracle 11g only

564498
subclassing	inherited
object-oriented class hierarchies with virtual methods dispatch are good when you have a relatively fixed set of methodss that need to be implementss but many potential subclassing that might inherited from the root of the hierarchy and implements those methodss

564503
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
i know i can rename a html file to .xls and excel openoffice.org calc will open it as a spreadsheet but i don t know how to have severals tabs

564508
swing	swt
can generate guis for both swing and swt

use data protection api either with the user or machine store different key per account your program database server runs under vs

564537
worksheet	excel
pear excel spreadsheet writer has a function to create new worksheet if thats what you are looking for

564541
contains	any
my executable doesn t define any servicecontract it doesn t even have a reference to system.servicemodel but instead has a reference to an assembly which contains the connection logic to the server

564557
ref	out
can i pass a property as an out or ref parameter if not then why not

564561
tortoisecvs	svn
i don t know any client but have you reported a bug against tortoisecvs svn

564564
ref	out
you pass a variables to an out or ref parameter you re actually passing the address or location in memory of the variables

564591
haskell	scheme
program your logic not the ui in functional programming language such as f# or even using scheme or haskell

564608
profiling	trace
then the system can kick off sql profiling setting various trace properties then writing out to a log or table - which could be viewed by the support team

564629
haskell	ocaml
if you want to write multithreaded number crunching code and you are going to be doing a lot of it in the future i would suggest you take a look at using a functional language like ocaml or haskell

564641
document	element
in this situation the xml document might be viewed as infinite with chunks being processed as the appear long before a final end tag for the root element has been seen

564641
document	element
if a tree-based data structure for the xml child elements being parsing is required you can build a tree for each such element that is being read just not for the entire document

564648
directory	folder
how can i configure the zsh tab-completion such that when i type it expands to cd .. and after pressing again proposes the folder in the parent directory for completion

564658
versioning	upgrade
hitting this silverlight page on microsoft.com tells me my versioning rtw is now out of date and i should upgrade to gdr 1

564664
configuration	environment
the application only needs a single item of configuration per environment dev test prod the db to use

564664
configuration	environment
if you have an application server your applications are configuration free for all environment

564698
ironpython	ironruby
to be fair either powershell or any dlr based language such as ironpython or ironruby would suit the task and would be less overhead than looking after trivial console applications

564700
spring	grails
with wicket and grails and spring asp.net-mvc and struts2 why on earth woudl you risk anything on this also ran framework

564707
superclass	inherited
make your testcase classes supclasses of a common superclass and then use one of the inherited mapping strategies don t worry to much about the number of tables columns but of cause you should ensure that you do not hit a limit of your database engine

564747
common-lisp	scheme
i think you either want common-lisp or plt scheme

564759
arrays	loops
i currently have a program that prints lines of text to the screen in various manners such as system.out.println statements and for loops the print all elements in an arrays to screen

564771
getter	setter
if you need to change any of these variables then you can define some getter and setter

564805
logout	login
i have a common file that s included in every page with common functions handle login logout set up constants and the like

564813
getter	setter
that s not the case if you pass a property by reference in vb.net the property getter is invoked once and then the property setter is invoked once

564857
constructor	object
that way memory is saved the construction of the square object in app can be delayed to whenever needed or they can be done in the constructor of app default or otherwise

564860
kdevelop	kde
eclipse is far better than kdevelop but eclipse do not have support for developing kde application

564860
kdevelop	kde
if you want to develop application for kde than you should go for kdevelop

564887
any	set
note that you can lose data which you put on the local disk if an instance goes down - if you re running a database you should use ebs which is very easy to set up and gets you persistent fast storage which can be attached to any ec2 instance

564896
abstract	extends
of course if you re going to be extends this to multiple button then you could easily abstract the above out to registration methods looping over arrays of button etc

564899
duplicates	contains
i have an arrays of states which may contains duplicates

564899
contains	set
so the set will have capacity of over 5000 but only contains at most 50

564899
contains	set
does it really matter what it gets set to when the most it could contains is 50

564907
administration	account
the sql-server proxy account is mapped to the local administration

564907
command-prompt	cmd
if i open a cmd-prompt at enter the move cmd

564911
instances	destroy
it introduces complexity though when you destroy a point instances what happens to line instancess which contains pointers to the point

564913
arrays	loops
i currently have a program that prints lines of text to the screen in various manners such as system.out.println statements and for loops the print all elements in an arrays to screen

564959
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql

564970
checkbox	button
i have datalist containing radio button and checkbox

564970
checkbox	button
when i come to previous page the radio button and checkbox in datalist must be selected

564980
selected	button
so to clarify my requirements - i need a form selected element and view button that when clicked will not only launch a file download in a new windows note the above issue i faced when these files were pdfs but also submit the form that contains the selected element

564982
rewrite	rule
the rewrite rule change is probably best but you may find rel tag is quicker

565014
python	php
in your python app and possibly your php app aswell

565014
output	mode
that is because when you use standard stream stdin stdout interactive from cmdline they are in a line-buffered mode in short system flushes on each new line but when you call it from within your program streams are in a fully buffered mode doesn t output till system buffer is full

565014
buffering	streaming
more info on this here buffering in standard streaming

565025
configuration	environment
if you don t have control over the server environment yourself no shell access etc. you can set the following at the top of configuration environment.rb

565026
appdata	temp
in my program i need to check that several paths to files are inside system temporary files folder for example c users roman appdata local temp

565026
traversal	parent
is there any other simple solution besides traversal the folder tree and checking that each child folder exists and its parent folder is temp

565034
value	field
i m wondering if i ve got separate default value for each form within a formset am i able to pre-populate the field

565041
jython	pypy
the language python itself has no such restrictions but perhaps your operating system or your python runtime pypy cpython jython could have such restrictions

565056
postgresql	mysql
i want my application to be compatible at least with oracle and mysql or postgresql

565060
python	java
i have a test python script which i can call and run from java using jepp - this then adds the person

565085
32-bit	64bit
for example on win64 you ll be able to run the 32-bit build of python.exe but it won t get the benefits of the 64bit environment as windows will run it in a 32-bit sandbox

565095
getter	setter
after taking a quick look at my code the majority of it was getter and setter 60 compared to the rest that is truly needed for the logic of the game

565095
getter	setter
a couple of google searches have claimed that getter and setter are evil whilst others have claimed that they are necessary for good oo practice and great programs

565095
getter	setter
should i be changing my getter and setter for my private variables or should i stick with them

565117
getter	setter
somewhat evil getter and setter where they re not required

565117
getter	setter
good getter and setter only where they re really required - make the type expose larger behaviour which happens to use its state rather than just treating the type as a repository of state to be manipulated by other types

565121
getter	setter
my opinion is that getter and setter are a requirement for good programs

565121
getter	setter
stick with them but don t write unnecessary getter setter - it s not always necessary to directly deal with all variables

565135
callback	methods
this scope will most definitively be different once the callback methods fires and thus is not reliable

565137
execution	jobs
this would include features of submitting jobs for execution setting task priorities waiting for jobs to finish specifying dependencies do this job but only after job x and job y have finished canceling subset of jobs that fit some criteria querying what jobs remain setting worker thread counts and priorities and so on

565147
updating	updates
if you really really have to use a loop of course you need a where conditional to make sure you are only updating the record you really want to updates

565155
value	field
if you need external access to individual value of field use getters and or setters

565155
getter	setter
in general you should also find that you need to supply a setter much less often than a getter - especially if you are trying to make your objects immutable - which is a good thing but not always the best choice - but even if not

565158
getter	setter
there s nothing wrong with getter and setter though their verbosity in java can be a bit annoying

565158
getter	setter
edit if the main point for the getter and setter is to configure the game classe i understand your comment that way then your probably don t need the getter it s perfectly fine for a class to access its own private variables without using get methods and you can probably collapse many of the setter into grouping setter that set several variables which belong together conceptually

565168
arbitrary-precision	rational-numbers
gmp is a free library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic operating on signed integers rational-numbers and floating-point numbers

565168
lgpl	gpl
since versioning 6 gmp is distributed under the dual licenses gnu lgpl v3 and gnu gpl v2 .

565168
solaris	aix
gmp s main target platforms are unix-type systems such as gnu linux solaris hp-ux mac os x darwin bsd aix etc

565168
32-bit	64bit
it also is known to work on windows in both 32-bit and 64bit mode.

565181
instances	private
if you intend the onclick function to represent a class seems unlikely this is appropriate as both an indicator of that and as means to expose instances properties since a variables declared in a class instances will effectively be private

565185
python	java
easier way to run python code in java is to use jython

565189
traceroute	packet
lots of hops in a traceroute do not indicate closeness just devices the packet routes through

565189
traceroute	lan
if you are on a lan or you get a tie with bgp then fall back to traceroute

565190
select	union
then of course you ll have to select max id from union of these two tables

565192
child-process	spawn
i won t be reading writing to these files directory directly i just want to make sure they exist before i spawn a child-process

565193
callback	methods
then store the information with an ajax call using prototype and the callback functions of the jquery methods

565196
getter	setter
your question is framed in the context of java where it seems that getter and setter are generally thought of as a good thing

565196
getter	setter
thus in java it is usually best to use getter and setter religiously so that if you need to you can override access to the variables

565196
python	java
this doesn t make python necessarily better than java just different.

565200
arguments	default
additionally the default behaviour of vim is to display an error message if you try to go beyond the last file in your arguments list so losing anything is not very easy in vim

565204
getter	setter
the presence of getter and setter tends to indicate a smell if you are into that sort of primary school language that there is a design problem

565204
getter	setter
trivial getter and setter are barely distinguishable from public fields

565204
getter	setter
in some cases getter and setter are fine

565204
getter	setter
but as a rule a type with both getter and setter indicates design problems

565209
tab-completion	zsh
the tab-completion works as intended for when using the default mac os x zsh 4.3.4

565209
tab-completion	zsh
but with the macports zsh 4.3.9 the tab-completion only works for other folder and not for

565212
getter	setter
just fyi in addition to all the excellent answers in this thread remember that of all reasons you can come up with for or against getter setter performance isn t one as some might believe

565212
getter	setter
the jvm is smart enough to inline trivial getter setter even non- final ones as long as they aren t actually overridden

565216
boolean	int
to fill the table i run a query that returns int a1 int a2 boolean b3 and runs multiple data checks

565222
value	field
a simple transfer object or parameter object may have the sole purpose of holding some field and providing their value on demand

565222
constructor	object
however even in that degenerate case one could argue that the object should be immutable -- configured in the constructor and exposing only get .

565222
put	get
but every time you re inclined to put in a value and expose both get .

565227
getter	setter
what i m trying to say is that discussing getter setter vs public fields often obscures bigger problems with objects manipulating each others internal state in an intimate manner and hence being too closely coupled

565232
profiling	trace
the profiling trace puts it into perspective

565270
getter	setter
is it on a getter or setter or is it on a field

565272
protected	public
as a minimum each identifier with public or protected access should have appropriate javadoc tags and a description

565272
code-coverage	cobertura
i currently have junit code-coverage reports and failure conditions using cobertura so something similar to that for documentation would be perfect

565277
expression-blend	silverlight
i get an exception error when i f5 build any silverlight project within expression-blend 2

565287
getter	setter
getter and setter are very very evil

565287
getter	setter
unfortunately the language has enshrined the use of getter and setter in the javabeans specification so java programmers are forced to use them even when doing so makes no sense whatsoever

565287
getter	setter
but if there s one thing i d get rid of in java its the over-dependence on getter and setter

565290
getter	setter
getter and setter enforce the concept of encapsulation in object-oriented programming

565290
getter	setter
the only ways the object can be manipulated are through exposed public methods such as getter and setter

565290
getter	setter
there are a few advantages for having getter and setter

565290
getter	setter
one of the big advantage of using a getter and setter is that once the public methods are defined and there comes a time when the underlying implementation needs to be changed finding a bug that needs to be fixed using a different algorithm for improving performance etc. by having the getters and setter be the only way to manipulate the object it will allow existing code to not break and work as expected even after the change

565290
value	field
if the value field were public there is no easy way to come back later and add a counter that keeps track of the number of times the value was changed

565290
getter	setter
therefore having getter and setter are one way to future-proof the class for changes which may come later

565290
getter	setter
another way getter and setter come in handy is to enforce the ways the object can be manipulated therefore the object is in control of its own state

565290
getter	setter
exposing the variables of an object will allow it to be manipulated in ways which aren t intended but only exposing certain ways getter and setter the object can be manipulated in intended ways

565290
getter	setter
i suppose having getter and setter would be more important for classes which are part of an api that is going to be used by others as it allows keeping the api intact and unchanged while allowing changes in the underlying implementation

565290
getter	setter
with all the advantages of getters and setter said if the getter is merely returning the value of the private variables and the setter is merely accepting a value and assign it to a private variables it seems the getters and setter are just extraneous and really a waste

565290
getter	setter
if the class is going to be just for internal use by an application that is not going to be used by others using getter and setter extensively may not be as important as when writing a public api

565303
contains	elements
add overflow auto on the contains elements

565330
filesystems	fileinfo
if you use the non static fileinfo operations be aware that this object will cache its view on the filesystems

565337
hash	md5
otherwise you should use a different hash -- md5 sha etc will work correctly

565344
getter	setter
i ve been programming in java for few monts ago and i ve learned that we should use getter setter only when it s necessary for the application

565350
qt-jambi	lgpl
note that qt-jambi is currently in the process of being migrate to lgpl

565379
triggers	insert
you write a triggers which initiates a backup script on each insert or update and stores it on a seperate harddrive

565382
double	int
for very simple objects int strings floats double which are represented more or less as simple c-language types you can simply calculate the number of bytes as with john mulder s solution

565392
margins	padding
to give a cell padding you can use auto sizing and set the margins on the appropriate child element

565392
order	add
just be sure to add such rectangles or borders to the grid before any of the other children or explicitly mark them with the zindex attached property so their z order puts them behind the main content

565402
value	field
each database might have to have a discriminator so that you could distinguish among the various combinations of null value in the two fk field

565406
dictionary	arrays
at circa 1m entries the dictionary underlying arrays will inevitably end up in the loh

565406
contains	any
any references they contains should not point into the gen0 or gen1 heaps

567068
put	get
from my understanding i need the synchronized block in addtomap to prevent another thread from calling remove or containskey before i get through the call to put but i do not need a synchronized block in dowork because another thread cannot enter the synchronized block in addtomap before remove returns because i created the map originally with collections.synchronizedmap

an object can be treated like a map or associative arrays with strings for keys - i believe that s what you want to do

567304
data-access	nhibernate
by defining a repository interface for data-access jeffrey palermo has a number of blog posts on this and both the apress and wrox asp.net-mvc books show this as well we can use linqtosql llblgen nhibernate etc

prior to each execution of the vcbuild step the scripting sets the environment variables and touches a file in the app to ensure that the prebuild step is executed

567824
streamreader	streamwriter
and that is only thread safe if you maintain a lock which is easy enough if you directly create a filestram with appropriate read write and then pass that with a streamreader or streamwriter wrapper to the load and save methods

catransform3d is a core-animation structure that can do more complex 3-d manipulations of calayers

567936
core-animation	catransform3d
catransform3d has the same internal structure as an opengl model view matrix which makes sense when you realize that core-animation is built on opengl calayers are wrappers for opengl textures etc.

567936
core-animation	catransform3d
when it comes down to choosing which do use ask yourself if you re going to work with views directly in a 2-d space cgaffinetransform or with the underlying core-animation layers in 3-d catransform3d

567936
core-animation	catransform3d
i use catransform3d more frequently but that s because i spend a lot of time with core-animation

double	int
first compute as an int 1000 10000 0 in this case and then cast this to double

568239
double	int
what actually happens is the division is done and truncated because both numbers are int and then the final result is cast to a double

568240
order	add
the other possibility is that it will somehow add the col1 that you order by to the projection columns include it in the other operations and then remove it before returning results

568240
aggregate	grouping
however that would run foul of mixing aggregate and non-aggregate without a grouping by clause - so i think the optimizer will ignore it or reject the query

csv	tsv
pack the ids into for example csv tsv

568298

how should css margins and padding be used for vertical inter-paragraph spacing

568561
margins	padding
can the vertical spaces between paragraphs be defined using padding and or using margins

568561
margins	padding
do you tend to define non-zero padding and non-zero margins and if so then how much of each

568561
margins	padding
the example of margins padding and borders explains in theory what the difference is between margin and padding i m questioning how much of each to use in practice to rendering a normal good-looking page

568561
margins	padding
what would prevent this empty paragraph s margins from collapsing and the empty paragraph therefore being invisible is it non-zero padding which does this

568567
triggers	insert

568567
logfile	tail
if you just want a simple easy-to-implement way to see what s going on though enabling the gql and then using running tail -f on the logfile would do the trick

568580
sql-server	mysql
if you ve got the enterprise library installed and already know how to connect to sql-server databases connecting to mysql databases is not any harder

568598
publishing	release
try the obvious things first use publishing or test instead of debugging shift-f12 or ctrl-enter not ctrl-shift-enter to compile release code double-check that there are not flash built-in functions you can use instead of actionscript use functions to share code add local-variables to reduce common sub-expressions

568604
margins	padding
there are many cases where you would define non-zero margins and padding

568604
margins	padding
i tend to prefer additional margins when padding isn t needed and then pad when margins doesn t work

568607
contains	any
this work folder as its name says contains classes used for work sometimes access to some of these files can be blocked for any reason

my question can i assume that dom is ready .when my scripting runs and run my scripting immediately or that dom is not ready and attach to dom ready event or document load

568625
.when	ready
if i cannot assume for sure either my question is how can i tell if dom is already ready on the different browsers .when my scripting runs

568665
windows-xp	windows
the problem lies in that windows-xp does the job and there s 0 cost in moving forward as obviously its already in place and working whereas vista windows 7 would obviously cost money and time in the short term but i believe in the long run we ll all be more productive in either a vista or 7 environment

568680
margins	padding
to answer your first question it generally does not matter if you use margins or padding to add spacing between elements however if you apply a border to an element and use padding to make a spaces it will push out the border that far

both opensuse and ubuntu are well documented and have good support forums

568705
digits	zero
all tags listed there that have a revision number that contains a zero as the last but one digits are branches

boost	stl
i think a beginner is better off understanding how the basic work before moving up the food chain using higher level tool libs like boost or even stl

569379
arrays	loops
i guess the reason why i want to do the first one is that i don t like to repeat associative arrays access all over my code it would seem better optimized to copy the values that are used a lot in a loops for example into a local variable plus it s much easier to type name than somearrays name

569387
assign	add
add an event handler to the change event of the colorpicker and assign the selectedcolor property as the color style of the application

i was wandering if for the run-time licence it would be a good idea to have as part of say an md5 hash for the licence key the calling assembly s or executable module - not sure company info or perhaps it s own strong name hash key

569423
selected	button
that button should trigger an event that adds the selected accessory to a memorylist

569423
having	select
the problem i m having is this - i cannot reliably identify on which row buttonaccessoryaddtomemorylist is clicked since the row that the button is on is not set as the selecteditem for the listbox if the user doesn t first select the row and then push the button - and honestly who does that

569427

additionally if you know which revision you are comparing you can do an svn diff and you will see which files have changed and how between the two revision

569513
perl	c++
you could use json as a lingua-franca between the two languages i suggest json xs on the perl side with subroutines implemented in c c++ for performances then you can read back in php the json with this extension

569551
header-only	boost
as for dependencies a great deal of boost is header-only

569553

569595
contact	submit
i have a contact form open in thickbox i want when user click on submit form data submit to my php that will process that data and show sucessfull msg back to thickbox

569601
constructor	object
i think i understand the basic object constructor injection model but i m confused as to how this scales up the dependency graph

569617
any	set
since the scripting s scope is the global scope any variables set or commands in your profiling will happen in the global scope

569618
udp	tcp
the udp protocol does not establish a connection like tcp does

569621
stderr	stdout
another question is is there a way to use import logging import logging.handlers to capture command stdout stderr

569630
spawn	exit
in the servicebase.onstart override spawn whatever new thread etc you need to do the work main needs to exit promptly or it counts as a failed start

569635
instances	private
create a managed class managedfoo which contains a single private instances field of type foo

569636
ubuntu	debian
beware that the common lisp packages in debian and ubuntu are often outdated and rather different from upstream

569648
profiling	debugging
better debugging and profiling

569648
getter	setter
with aptana pdt... and usage of plugins for the eclipse platform with features not shipped with flexbuilder code-snippets with cfeclipse dynamic snippets auto-code for getter setter with monkey scripts...

569650
progress-bar	progress
my idea have the threads emit a qtsignal when the progress is updated that triggers some function that updates the progress-bar

569672
.when	ready
then work on trunk as normals .when you re ready for a release merge your changes from trunk into release

569679
dependency-injection	service-locator
if so go for a service-locator instead of dependency-injection

569685
constructor	object
following douglas crockfords simple constructor pattern i would make a constructor-function that uses the object literal instead of new

569702
expression	evaluation
other tools as the xpath visualizer correctly highlight the text of the name element when evaluation this xpath expression

569731
32-bit	64bit
i didn t install mysql 64bit because i have an 32bit install of php and since mysql 32-bit seems to work fine i assume that s not the issue

569749
contains	any
if i remove the max-height property from the frame the animation works fine but as the frame could contains any number of messages i really need it to have a max height and to be scrollable when it exceeds that height

569755
.when	ready
i might be missing something here but the idea is that a run-time licence key is generated by the customer .when their software is ready to ship - built and ready to go - this then makes the licence application-locked as opposed to the machine-locked developer licence key used for developing the application

569755
hash	md5
and a hash sha then not md5

569765
order	add
if you do you ll need either to add this field you want or which is more preferable add a fake order autoincrement field and still use guid s as primary keys

569783
children	tree
closing the windows and being confident that you have released all resources to it and any of its children will cause all well behaved elements in the logic tree to be garbage collected

569800
initializer	getter
i can access the static class window1 but not its initializer hence making a getter for it gets me no further

569801
httphandler	httpmodule
in our asp.net 2.0 app we are using httpmodule and httphandler to calculate some metrics via cookies

569801
subtract	time
to calculate network transfer time httpmodule endrequest stores transferstart in the cookie and httphandler processrequest uses datetime.now to subtract the transferstart to determine overall network time

569801
httphandler	httpmodule
request httpmodule onstart httpmodule onend httphandler processrequest

569807
linux	unix
since this is tagged vbscript i ll assume you re running on windows so you might want to look into something like this to get access to unix filesystems for windows although that s a linux ext driver

569813
required	checked
weak_ptr is a weak-reference to a shared pointers that required you to checked to see if the pointed-to shared_ptr is still around

569818
command-line	cmd
when you do the secure copy manually from the windows cmd-line you put your unix username into the cmd-line cmd but then you have to type in your password at the prompt so it s interactive

569825
contains	elements
edit i corrected my post to use the scalar function to retrieve the size of the arrays and also add some checking in case the arrays does not contains an even number of elements

569830
required	checked
i do a simple checked in onprepareoptionsmenu to disable the items that required an item to be selected

569836
thickbox	jquery
make sure you have jquery and thickbox loaded by putting this in the html head of your document

569854
rounding	currency
be aware that this fpu mode rounding is applied to floating-point operations in situations that might not be obvious when thinking in terms of the currency type which is a fixed-point type scaled 64bit integer

569854
rounding	currency
a small imprecision in intermediate floating-point calculations such as 82.000000000000001 will end up rounding up even when the value as currency is anticipated to be 82.00

569875
message	alert
according to the api docs an alert view is used to display an alert message to the user . you shouldn t be using it for input

569886
directory	folder
only the main web application folder will have the installation dialog so if you want to customize the virtual directory names then you will need to add a screen and set the property of the web custom folder to be the same as the field name on the screen you add

569906
required	checked
depending on how severe the problem is you could invent a source control process that could range from oppressive and painful to relatively lighting weight that could help guarantee this for example you could required developers to checked in changes only to a branch until the port is done on both platform at which time you merge them both.

569931
copy-constructor	constructor
however this in turn breaks its usage in containers because requirements state a certain behavior of the copy-constructor of elements of containers which is incompatible with this so-called moving constructor behavior of these smart pointers

569931
decrement	increment
intrusive_ptr is like a shared_ptr but it does not keep the reference count in a shared_ptr but leaves increment decrement the count to some helper functions that need to be defined by the object that is managed

569940
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
lecture 08 is related to an assignment to build a uinavigationcontroller based app that has multiple uiviewcontroller pushed onto the uinavigationcontroller stack

569950
worksheet	excel
i use visual basic code to instance the control in an excel worksheet

569972
web-applications	client-server
at my place we are devloping an intranet applications but we are using both web-applications and client-server using arcgis explorer and custom-made client app

569985
arguments	default
most of the time you omit this arguments so the context default to the current html document

569991
any	set
.visible is set to true when page renders but anyway it still be invisible.i do not see any obvious reason why

570013
any	set
any ideas how to set the project to create the required lib file

570020
perl	php
i m on a windoze box but can ssh into my webhost and run php maybe perl

570020
numeric	digits
filename pattern ab12345.html numeric portion varies from 3-6 digits

570031
markup	xhtml
a lot of the system predates xhtml with inline stylistic markup javascript function calls no unit-testing predates hibernate etc

570031
tapestry	wicket
some apps they have been looking at include wicket struts tapestry and possibly grails

570040
dbd	dbi
i have the latest cpan versioning of both dbi and dbd postgresql

570041
communication	messages
i ve often logged such communication as notice messages

570057
print-preview	printdialog
there must be some solution to getting the print-preview dialog and then being allowed to use the printdialog control

570071
.when	ready
.when a release is ready for qa we merge the branch back into the trunk and create a new branch for the next release

570083
icollection	ienumerable
the alternatives include returning it as an ilist icollection or ienumerable for more flexibility or a whole different way as the code below.

570088
administration	account
also remember that the permissions are resolved on the remote server machines so local grouping users and administration membership may not include the user account running on the client

570104
enumerator	any
one potential negative consequence of returning an ienumerable is that any exception-handling that get thrown upon enumerator would come from an area of code that could be quite far away from the code that actually built the object making bug tracking harder

570125
show	next
the next time a query starts to do this to you log onto mysql do show full processlist and record what s there

570148
ssl-certificate	ssl
therefore i can force ssl but if the user doesn t enter www.example.com into their browser the ssl-certificate appears invalid

570148
revision	svn
i think i found the svn revision that almost worked for me but not quite

570150
value	field
new and dispose will ensure that the name and value field of the record are properly initialized and finalized or cleaned-up

570154
hide	show
the table is larger than my page so i have a control to show hide some of these grouping to fit on the page

570156
innodb	myisam
innodb does not have full text myisam has no tx support

570166
postgresql	mysql
i ve dabbled with mysql and personally i find it vastly inferior to better rdbmss like postgresql

570166
postgresql	mysql
i m getting increasingly frustrated by these apps that i want to use but they only work with mysql and i won t bring myself to use it because personally i find postgresql a much better database and because i personally feel that your database should enforce it s own constraints instead of doing this only at the code level

570168
put	get
edit darnit richard s approach use put from the backing arrays of bbuf_src won t work if bbuf_src is a readonly buffer as you can t get access to that arrays

570172
perl	php
in any language xslt php ruby perl anything how can i get the xpath or other path or identifier to the element containing the largest number of tags

570175
bison	yacc
consider using yacc antlr flex bison coco r gold parsing generator etc

570182
google-chrome	firefox
does it render correctly as compared to the 3 major browsers ie firefox and safari google-chrome

570183
scripting	shebang
but it doesn t work on the shebang line in a scripting

570184
environment	building
basically this is a completely tested and building package which will link the software and give you a full develoment environment

570196
insertafter	appendto
append appendto prepend prependto after before insertafter insertbefore

570209
command-line	cmd
you can get that using the svn cmd-line tools and the log cmd

570209
revision	svn
see also the svn book section on revision dates

570216
xsd	xml
since it s a complicated xml document that is written by hand mainly some kind of configuration elements classic validation by xsd or dtd is not enough and i have to return to the user that the xml document is not valid

570223
postgresql	mysql
i also greatly prefer postgresql but i think if you re planning to use other peoples php applications forums blogs etc it s just a reality that you re probably going to have to run mysql to support them

570225
specifications	w3c
cross-domain ajax requests using the xmlhttprequest activex object are not allowed in the current standard as per the w3c specifications

570225
jsonp	ajax
however there s 1 technique of doing ajax requests cross-domain jsonp by including a script tag on the page and with a little server configuration

570226
postgresql	rdbms
on the other hand you had postgresql called postgres back then which was much slower complicated to install and mantain but provided full power of real rdbms

570226
postgresql	rdbms
the thing is that the web apps didn t really need full power of rdbms so mysql gained huge popularity while postgresql was used by few

570247
postgresql	mysql
you re right postgresql has much better support for sql and other advanced features so there s a very good case for why postgresql is superior to mysql

570247
postgresql	mysql
however mysql is so much easier to install and manage for someone who is just getting started that it gains a lot of adoption relative to postgresql

570247
postgresql	mysql
simple tasks like configuring a login and giving it specific privileges are very confusing on a postgresql server compared to mysql

570247
postgresql	mysql
also there were a few years early on where mysql offered native binaries for windows but postgresql did not

570247
postgresql	mysql
by the time postgresql did support windows natively mysql had a substantial lead in market share and name recognition

570253
double	int
for example if you wanted to have an add methods that accepted an int object and double

570283
c++	lua
lua is currently the fastest scripting language out there and its not so much slower than c c++ for some sort of programs on par when doing pidgits 1 1 however lua scores really bad in a few benchmarks against c c++

570297
c++	lua
lua is currently the fastest scripting language out there however lua scores really bad in a few benchmarks against c c++

570299
binary	hex
edit try to find a binary hex dump display in fiddler so you can find the bytes

570300
hide	show
i added conditional to hide the control if the text was empty and show it if it was not empty

570302
subtract	add
if you need to subtract or add members to the interface lots of stuff will break

570311
c++	lua
lua is currently the fastest scripting language out there and its not so much slower than c c++ for some sort of programs on par when doing pidgits 1 1 however lua scores really bad in a few benchmarks against c c++

570317
malloc	free
i d like to hear your feedback on the best way to free the allocated memory in case the second malloc fails

570332
javascript	dom
javascript for instance can naturally handle viewing the html dom and there are libraries such as prototype that would make quick work of it

570357
spaces	output
is there a way to extract arguments to get the following arrays output using regexp and stripping white spaces

570418
arrays	loops
it s not pretty but it s quick and doesn t have any loops or arrays

570423
exception-handling	try-catch
i m currently trying to debugging why an application has an unhandled exception-handling in a try-catch block yes unhandled inside of a try-catch that only manifests on certain os machine builds and not on others

570434
export	report
users that export the report to excel notice that a decimal appears after the value

570437
ubuntu	debian
this works only on debian ubuntu et al check your system documentation for others

570441
internet-explorer	firefox
the problem is ie-only because you are probably trying to set something like min-height which exists in a proper css implenting browser like firefox but not in a demon spawned fiend of a browser like internet-explorer

570450
python	java
i know it would be easier to use python perl or good ol expect but my boss wants to utilize what we are trying to get back remote log files and running scripts within an existing java program so i am kind of stuck

570460
external	host
alternately consider connecting directly to the host server from native java code rather than running an external application

570462
required	checked
this would have the same effect as your code and does not required the checked for blank cells

570464
administration	account
every request even to the built-in administrator account a new account in the administration grouping or even a new account not in the administration grouping but given access to remote dcom the wmi namespace as described in the microsoft document all return error code 0x80070005 access is denied

570469
executable	jar
basically the jar file contains in instance or for multiple platforms instances of the mysql server executable

570472
put	get
parsing are not complicated if you know how to build them but they are not the type of thing that if you put in enough time you ll eventually get there

570487
webserver	nginx
one solution i found would be dns load balancing distribute these persistent connections across a bunch of nginx webserver

570507
export	report
what i ve done for some of my users is create one report with no formatting specifically for export and one report with all the bells and whistles of cr

570552
checkbox	textbox
i have a listbox whose datatemplate is created in code using 3 frameworkelementfactory objects a stackpanel with 2 appended children checkbox and textbox

570552
selected	listbox
the listbox supports 3 modes single selected multiselected and multicheck

570552
selected	checkbox
the mode i m trying to implement is multicheck so that the ischecked property of the checkbox is bound to the selected property of the item object

570552
selected	checkbox
this creates a behavior where the item is only considered selected when the checkbox s ischecked property on the listboxitem is true not when the wpf listboxitem s isselected property is true

570552
checkbox	listbox
if there is a multiple selection on the wpf listbox then all of the checkbox in the range would be toggled to the value of the checkbox that was clicked

570566
firefox	safari
cosmetic web bugs involving styling in various browser o s configurations a page looks fine in windows and mac in firefox and ie but on the mac in safari something gets messed up

570566
firefox	safari
these are annoying sometimes because they require so much attention to detail and making the change to fix safari may break something in firefox or ie so one has to tread carefully and realize that the styling may be a series of hacks to fix page after page

570571
any	set
do you have any other elements anywhere else on the page with a name attributes set to

570586
gethashcode	equals
since your equals methods uses structural equality make sure you override gethashcode with an implementation based on your fields as well

570589
32-bit	64bit
my question is would moving this 32-bit app to 64bit windows allow it access more than the 1.5gb or so memory it can now

570592
virtualbox	vmware
another free solution is virtualbox from sun which is able to install on windows-xp home which vmware server will not

570607
32-bit	16-bit
if your app was to access more memory then you would need some sort of segmented memory architecture like we had in the 16-bit days where apps used 16-bit pointers and offsets to access the full 32-bit memory space

570616
32-bit	64bit
basically what it does is say that if it s loaded on a 64bit version of windows then it will get 4gb the limit of 32-bit pointers

570623
web-services	webserver
if you are planning on using web-services xml message passing you can use gsoap which has an included webserver sample application which uses thread pools

570624
windows	wow64
wow64 allows using 32-bit windows application on 64-bit windows translating 32-bit pointers to real 64-bit pointers

570644
buffering	streaming
the real problem however was that the the streaminghandler s buffering was not flushed until after stdout was reset to its original output streaming resulting in the log messages not appearing in junit s output for stdout

570649
directory	folder
enable directory browsing and you can click the folder of the last build and so on

570651
google-chrome	firefox
20 in firefox google-chrome

570652
exception-handling	error-handling
i don t want to start writing error-handling logic based on the error messages so is there some way to get at the original exception-handling instead of the jscript error object

570659
groovy	java
i m trying to call a methond on a java class from a groovy class

570659
groovy	java
the java method has a string array as a parameter and i have a collection of strings in my groovy class

570659
groovy	java
how do i convert the groovy collection to a java string array

570663
specifications	w3c
before we continue we should dispel some of the misinformation in a few books and on the internet contrary to what some have said there is no legal way to use the name attributes from such tags as div or span according to the w3c html 4.01 specifications

570663
selected	button
you must confine the usage of this attribute to such tags as input img frame iframe form map param meta object a selected applet textarea or button

570668
administration	account
interpolation for your case if the d drive were a network drive running the bat file as say the local administration account on that machine instead of a domain user account would likely fail to have access to d

570680
httphandler	httpmodule
in our asp.net 2.0 application we have the an httpmodule and httphandler

570680
httphandler	httpmodule
httphandler processrequest is not entered on every httpmodule endrequest which seems like incorrect behavior since my understanding of the flow of events

570680
httphandler	httpmodule
httpmodule beginrequest httphandler processrequest httpmodule endrequest

570681
put	get
i was writing some code a few days ago based on hallvard s hack #10 and it made me wonder how many events tend to get put on things

570701
onchange	onclick
maybe if you use onchange on the selected and not onclick on option

570705
webforms	asp.net
should i be reconsidering webforms or stick with my gut and use asp.net mvc

570707
boost	stl
stl boost is a tool for the job

570722
panels	grid
a second option would be to list just header information in the grid and when the user double clicks a row you would display an editor with the editable aspects in a secondary panels or windows similar to how asp.net-mvc editing works

570722
panels	grid
for each row you need you can add a grid panels or stackpanels or something similar created at runtime according to your rules

570723
scheme	let
i assume this is a business thing in which case it s your job to do what the business needs to the best of your ability and to let people know what the best of your ability is and what functionality costs in the overall scheme of things.

570725
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms is very much like winforms and allows for rad rapid application development

570739
distance	polygons
assuming no distance falloff i should be able to use the point on the polygons i ve found and compare the normal at that point to the angle of incidence on the lighting to figure out my illumination value

570746
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms are heavyweight and drop a crapton of stuff on your webpages both in html javascript and serialized viewstate

570746
webforms	asp.net
asp.net mvc is harder to code initially but is so much easier to develop than webforms

570746
asp.net-mvc	webforms
with asp.net-mvc you can t get away with the state nightmare that is so common to webforms development which means that means your webpages are meth-addict slim

570746
webforms	asp.net
if on the other hand you code as early man did against the asp.net webforms model response.write in page_load my comments apply

570753
asterisk	ivr
i have deployed several ivr s with asterisk and what i usually do is test them on my machine by setting up asterisk with just sip having one sip user which i set up on x-lite

570753
asterisk	ivr
start asterisk run x-lite and dial the proper extension and it will be just as if you call your ivr in deployment

570753
recording	audacity
record some prompt yourself with audacity or whatever recording software you have at hand doesn t matter how lousy they are it s just so you can move forwarding and make demos mockups

570762
solaris	unix
i need to run perl applications i develop on cygwin windows on hp unix solaris hosts

570762
solaris	unix
however would having an other linux installation help would this be possible easier between different flavors of unix like package perl on linux and then deploy to solaris hp

570770
multiprocessing	twisted
there are two generally recommended ways to get around the problem that you are experiencing use twisted or use a module similar to the multiprocessing module introduced in 2.5

570770
linux	osx
only downside is that you would need python 2.5 installed which is fairly new and inst included in most linux distros or osx by default

570776
required	checked
for example in cases where it is required to perform some action security checked at the time when the field is read

570781
python	c++
note both methods above are members of a c++ unicode class that wraps the python api

570787
multithreading	memory-leaks
multithreading memory-leaks anything requiring extensive mocks interfacing with third-party software

570801
selected	button
i have a selectededitemtemplate but i don t want to use an asp button or asp linkbutton to selected an item

570805
radio-button	selected
so i create the package just like i did before but this time i specify the already-existing database name as the destination database and i selected the radio-button called drop any database on the destination server with the same name then continue with the database transfer overwriting existing database files.

570808
webforms	asp.net
one thing that the asp.net mvc has over asp.net webforms in terms of performance is that it doesn t make use of a control tree

570808
webforms	asp.net
the flip side of this is that you can t use all of the handy out of the box controls that you get with asp.net webforms and you ll probably end up doing more client side javascript development so the initial development budget would probably need to be greater if you choose asp.net mvc over webforms but you would have a superior solution for the long term

570809
swing	awt
often it happens to work but you are not allowed to do anything with swing components unless you are in the awt worker thread

570816
asterisk	pbx
will you set up asterisk just for this or is it will it be doing other stuff such as pbx ivr etc

570816
asterisk	ivr
if you are doing other stuff with asterisk then set up a hidden extension one not advertised on the ivr menu which you can dial once you re connected

570818
jeditorpane	jscrollpane
i have tried it with a jeditorpane inside a jscrollpane append to the content via the editor kit s read methods

570823
json	xml
xstream library provide an exceptionally good way of dealing with serialisation including support for xml json and supporting custom converters

570825
inverse	cosine
to calculate alt text therefore you simple use the inverse cosine on the dot-product

570829
asterisk	ivr
i use asterisk for ivr implementations

570829
asterisk	ivr
i currently have an ivr with 8 e1 links 240 channels with asterisk and a sangoma card works pretty well

570865
httphandler	httpmodule
if i understand correctly httpmodule would get executed for every request which comes to your application while the httphandler would execute only for the registered extension

570880
double-quotes	single-quotes
using the above you are essentially forcing the passing of the double-quotes on to cmd.exe instead of bash eating them away. the outermost single-quotes instruct bash not to interpreter or touch in any way what s inside them

570886
revision	svn
we ve never had merge issues as a result and we have over 10 000 revision and 100 branches in svn

570901
ip-address	hostname
to help eliminate dns issues from the equation specify the host s ip-address in the tnsnames.ora file for your connection instead of a hostname

570918
gridview	listview
i have a windows using a wpf listview gridview bound to an observablecollection

570922
mapping	unique
why not have a session-scoped map mapping unique sub-session ids to maps for the attributes of the sub-session

570923
visual-c++	dev-c++
for windows i ve used dev-c++ in the past but nowadays microsoft visual-c++ seems a better solution

570944
credentials	account
in other words how can i programmatically access that directory via unc and send in the domain user account credentials necessary to access the resources in that drive

570945
push	pull
i d like to clone a pure git repo off this and then use git push pull to move changes between the git-svn tree and the git tree while also using git svn dcommit rebase to move changes between the git-svn tree and the svn repo it s based on

570986
ref	out
in the book i am reading on f# it actually points out the c# equivelant of using ref as doing the same thing in c# to return multiple parameters

570989
getter	setter
i didn t make a setter for imagebyte but i made a getter that does the following

570996
keyboard	mouse
it has color-coded highlights for different types of events mouse keyboard etc.

570997
asp.net-mvc	webforms
with asp.net-mvc you can t get away with the state nightmare that is so common to webforms development which means that means your webpages are meth-addict slim

firefox	opera
acutally most browsers are pretty good in supporting the open standards including some of the oldest browsers in the world like opera which is like 15 years old and firefox which is to some extend based on netscape which is like also from 1993 or something i think

571020
xsl-fo	xslt
as long as you can make sure to use proper xhtml you could also use a product like alt-soft s xml2pdf to convert xml xhtml into pdf by means of xslt xsl-fo

571029
rewrite	rule
got the zend rewrite rule from here and ensured short_opentag on in my php-ini

i use gentoo and ubuntu for development

571051
sql-server	oracle
what are the most reasonable ways to move table data from sql-server to oracle on nix on a regular basis

571055
sql-server	oracle
java probably within oracle but optionally at the os using odbc or sqlj to access sql-server and possibly oracle

571055
sql-server	oracle
sql-server scheduled to export to csv oracle scheduled to import from csv

571055
export	csv
in the case of ssis dts or csv export scheduled within sql-server

571064

leave the existing db fixtures files untouched and create another set of yml files contains the constant data in the same vein as db fixtures but usable by both test and production development environments when doing a rake db load schema initialization

571067
folder	dir
getresource some relative dir will look for anything inside of the web-app folder

571069
sql-server	oracle
you can have sql-server interface with oracle directly through ssis or dts for 2k

571070
host	dns
if the server doesn t have a domain-name setup at a dns server then add it s ip-address and name to the host file on the server

571075
asp.net-mvc	webforms
keep in mind that there s a fundamental difference in protected resources between webforms and asp.net-mvc

571095
gentoo	ubuntu
any of ubuntu slackware gentoo should be fine as a development environment

571095
openbsd	freebsd
if you are at all interested in making better code i also recommend dual booting or running a 2nd computer into a non-linux system such as openbsd freebsd opensolaris etc

571118
xlsx	xls
spreadsheetgear for .net gives you an api for working with xls and xlsx workbooks from .net

571145
header-only	boost
there is also a header-only library present in boost that have neat tools to deal with floating point datatypes

571176
deployment	install
ai and other install for that matter can install and manage windows services prerequisites and so on and in the long run you ll save a lot of time by using a tool like this to help with your deployment

571188
constructor	object
my guess is that you ve got code in the constructor that throws an exception at design-time probably because it s using an object that s only available at run-time

571199
vbscript	vb6
when i wanted to handle byte arrayss from vbscript like a blob coming from a database i made a general vb6 com object that could perform operations on the byte arrays

571200
.net	wcf
i wrote my own json serializer using datacontractjsonserializer in the system.servicemodel.web.dll assembly which is a component of wcf included in .net 3.5 as a standard assembly and in the .net 3.5 sp1 client profile in .net 4.0 and silverlight 4 it s been moved to system.runtime.serialization.dll

571213
hypertable	hbase
there are a few very good free open source alternatives to these namely hadoop apache hbase and hypertable

571218
environment	execution
in your dev environment you can output your queries and execution time to the bottom of the page - reduce the number of queries and or optimize those that are slow

571243
innodb	myisam
innodb doesn t support fulltext indexing and myisam doesn t support transactions

571245
multicast	packets
however udp does support multicast so the same packets can be delivered to one or more hosts

571255
put	get
the way to get the best of both worlds is to put the fixed-length fields everything except the post text in one table and the variable-length fields the post text in another

571256
perl	c++
there are bindings for c++ java python perl c# and ruby

571259
sql-server	oracle
i had success creating a linked server from within the enterprise manager i think to oracle on the sql-server side

571259
sql-server	oracle
try hard to use the latest possible oracle client on the sql-server side though

571285
webforms	asp.net
after converting an asp.net webforms v3.5 to use a master page i started getting a strange javascript error

571286
ip-address	hostname
i want to validate that a hostname ip-address is on the public internet

571295
any	set
additionally if i wanted to have a dirty flag i can easily put the flag being set in the onpropertychanged sub and easily determine if i need to save any user changes or not

571296
value	field
rather what s happening is that when going back none of the browsers will reload the form from your server with the defaults filled in from the session variables. some browsers however will be nice about it and remember themselves what value the form field last had when that particular form was last submitted and fill them in for you

571306
selected	button
there is a close button available but i d prefer to just selected all the services i want to stop or start and perform a single command on all of them at one time

571306
windows-xp	windows
is there an easier way to start and stop multiple windows services for windows-xp

571312
silverlight	wpf
databinding is the only way to implement a model-view pattern in wpf silverlight

571315
webforms	asp.net
i have a legacy haha asp.net webforms web site project in visual studio 2008 sp1 that i would like to gradually introduce some mvc functionality into

571315
webforms	asp.net
most of the information i can locate on how to integrate asp.net mvc with webforms seems to assume the use of a web application project

571321
command-line	cmd
you could write a cmd batch script that uses the cmd-line service controller sc.exe

571327
constructor	object
first - how do object constructor work in vba

571356
bad-request	http-status
the request failed with http-status 400 bad-request

571366
shutdown	exit
also note that the reason why there is a delay between issuing a stop command to a windows service and the time when the process actually exit is due to the fact that the windows service controller waits up to 30 seconds to allow services to shutdown properly

571376
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval are both deprecated

571377
specifications	w3c
new w3c recommendations are being standardised to allow cross-site requests between trusted parties via the access-control for cross-site requests specifications

571379
value	field
i have since discovered that submitting any form where a field value starts with the string http causes the problem

571381
shell	bash
bash s -c option allows you to pass a shell command to execute according to the man page

571419
treeview	listview
just first thoughts is why not use a treeview instead of a listview if you re going to have nesting

571434
sql-server	oracle
i am working with a team that develops an application which works on sql-server and oracle

571443
c++	lua
or look at the median and quartiles to get a better impression of how the set of c++ measurements compares to the set of lua measurements

571443
c++	lua
or there s a whole set of measurements where programs are forced to use just one core - lua compared with c++ - and if you take a look at those lua pi-digits programs you ll see that they use the c language gnu gmp library

571469
streamreader	binaryreader
basically i would like to know whether there s any specific benefit to either methods besides the obvious one of being able to use the binaryreader streamreader classes with the synchronous calls

571472
order	add
this is what i had to add to my devenv.exe.config in order to get my wcf test client to work with a very large service

571489
system.web	wcf
is system.web caching even available to wcf when it s not running in asp.net compatible mode

571490
simplemodal	jquery
i have a page that has two tabs created using jquery and i am also using eric martin s simplemodal plugin

571491
order	join
if you have large tables using hash join and merge join you ll need sort_area_size and hash_area_size for efficient join and order but you can decrease db_block_buffers as you ll not be able to cache these tables anyway

571493
continuous-integration	nant
i ve just written a blog on using resharper and stylecop together and enforcing it via continuous-integration using nant

571499
c++	lua
or look at the median and quartiles to get a better impression of how the set of c++ measurements compares to the set of lua measurements

571499
c++	lua
or there s a whole set of measurements where programs are forced to use just one core - lua compared with c++ - and if you take a look at those lua pi-digits programs you ll see that they use the c language gnu gmp library

571505
c++	lua
or there s a whole set of measurements where programs are forced to use just one core - lua compared with c++ - and if you take a look at those lua pi-digits programs you ll see that they use the c language gnu gmp library

571508
sql-server	oracle
in ms sql-server and oracle

571512
compact-framework	.net
are there any libraries which exist for accessing audio mp3 wmw metadata using the .net compact-framework

571526
factors	primes
if you know all primes factors of n how to calculate number of divisors of n

571545
synchronous	.when
as others have pointed out the allocation of another thread to your process will impact you .when you use the synchronous methods as you increase the number of simultaneous connections

571551
callback	methods
whereas the begin methods will not tie up a thread but will instead use a callback on an appropriate i o signal the call back will then run on a thread from the pool

571561
global-asax	web-config
as long as you setup the routing in web-config setup the necessary directory structure and add the correct routes in global-asax you could theoretically add asp.net-mvc items to any web project

571562
asp.net-mvc	webforms
well for starters adding asp.net-mvc to a webforms project is pretty simple to get the features in vs 2008 for asp.net-mvc takes a little bit more work still easy

571562
webforms	asp.net
asp.net mvc does play nice in the same project as webforms

571579
environment	building
you should be able to grab a project from source control and building it with no further intervention on a clean machine disconnected from the rest of your building environment

571592
contains	any
after doing so the developer s view should not contains any deltas with the version-controlled source

571607
bluetooth	usb
i have written apps that use usb bluetooth serial ports and have never had an issue

571613
contains	elements
i m not certain exactly what you re trying to do but to get all the elementss that contains an elements that has the taskbox class you can use

571622
linux	bsd
note that the -print0 -0 and -c2 options are not portable will work fine with the gnu variants of the find xargs and grep programs most linux bsd etc

571652
constructor	object
up until this point i ve been passing all of these object around as references into my class constructor

571652
constructor	object
this gets tedious fast because each time i add a utility object that all of my classes need to access i have to go and change the constructor everywhere

571654
debian	linux
linux particularly debian ubuntu

571654
solaris	linux
update the reason for the question is that i am developing on mac os x and linux for deployment to different linux and solaris and i don t have root on some of these systems and in the case of mac os x i don t even have a compiler afaik

571654
deployment	install
so what i want to know what modules i have available in all four deployment without further install

571676
debian	linux
some linux distributions such as debian etch and lenny ubuntu and arch include the suhosin patch in their php package so on those systems you ll often find it s turned on by default

571693
lgpl	gpl
my feeling is that this is possible with lgpl license but is it also possible with gpl license

571696
constructor	object
the nice thing about making state object into singletons is that you no longer have to pass const references to them into all your constructor anymore

571697
constructor	private
the pattern is similar to the traditional singleton except that with the singleton purists will insist its constructor also be private to prevent independent construction whereas my pattern allows independent construction as necessary ie my singleton templates doesn t require the singleton class s constructor be private

571701
lgpl	gpl
there are no provisions in the gpl or lgpl that prevent you from making money on your code

571701
lgpl	gpl
broadly speaking the restrictions say that you must give others the same opportunity using your code if you choose to release it under a gpl lgpl license

571708
permission-denied	denied
oh shoot access denied not permission-denied

571721
.when	ready
with async calls you can beginread for every one of them and .when data from some one is ready it will be processed by one of the pool threads

571728
dependency-injection	service-locator
this article introduces both dependency-injection which you are currently using and service-locator

571730
contains	any
however if you release your code under gpl and you accept contributions any branch of the code that contains these contributions is gpl licensed to you

571730
licensing	gpl
in broad sense licensing a product under gpl does not prohibit anyone from selling that product for money

571730
licensing	gpl
you should talk to a copyright lawyer for the actual legal implications of licensing something under gpl

571744
perl	php
i found the question serving large files with php which is identical to my situation but i m using perl instead of php

571744
perl	php
does perl have an equivalent to php s readfile function as suggested with php or is there a way to accomplish what i m trying to do here

571754
digits	base
so for gridbox you are basically taking i and j and interleaving their digits in base square

571754
digits	base
where n signifies the digits base scale

571758
value	field
owner names and other text value are stored in multiple field in multiple related tables for each owner

571773
perl	php
answering the original question does perl have an equivalent to php s readline function .

571773
perl	php
answering the updated question does perl have an equivalent to php s readfile function .

571797
emacs	vim
for various reasons i don t use vim emacs though i don t suffer from terminal-phobia

571801
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome still doesn t know what it wants to be safari or firefox

571801
google-chrome	safari
both safari and google-chrome were failing so i figured hey once i fixed the safari problem google-chrome would be fixed automatically but oh no no

571815
hash	md5
there is a site called that takes a md5 hash of your email to load a profiling picture

571850
directory	folder
i m currently trying to get all images from a set of disorganized folder and write them to a new directory

571859
sharpdevelop	monodevelop
you might want to take a look at monodevelop as well sharpdevelop which has been mentioned already

571866
ubuntu	linux
p.s. i am using boost 1.32 on ubuntu linux

571912
callback	methods
using microsoft s .net usually most exception-handling thrown during async calls are raised within the async callback methods except few cases

571912
callback	methods
to handle the rest i usually set a timeout callback methods

571914
attributes	properties
i decided i ll just set the x key attributes on the datatemplates and just bind the templates properties onwards to the staticresource of the x key

571945
calloc	malloc
also i needed the arrays to be initialized to zeros so when i googled malloc i discovered that calloc was perfect for my purposes

571945
calloc	malloc
malloc calloc also has the advantage over allocating on the stack of allowing me to declare the size using a variables

571974
space	input
if you just want a label input control and a space just add the controls to the page with no formatting whatsoever

571979
any	set
thus in your code any time before you configure log4net set the desired value of this property

571981
any	set
ultimately what i want is one property where if it s set on a parent user-interface element all children user-interface elements that knows about the property will share the same value overriding any prior value setting

572011
swing	awt
generally you re supposed to use swing or awt if you want access to the keyboard which is silly

572014
perl	php
i guess in response to the does perl have a php readfile equivelant and i guess my answer would be but it doesn t really need one

572042
put	get
modelmaker is like any other good productivity tool - the more you put into it the more you get out of it

572074
revision	svn
i may be missing something but when i ve used svn merge i ve always had to get the revision numbers right if i wanted it to work correctly

572083
typedef	struct
your original typedef if you look had typedef struct bucket bucket

572107
button	popup
i want that when user doesn t provide username the popup message will come please enter the username then if i press ok button cursor should go in txtusername textbox

572107
button	popup
but in my programming the popup message is coming but after pressing ok button cursor is not placing in expected position please somebody modify my code

572152
any	set
once you create a cookiejar and set it to the request s cookiecontainer it will store any cookies that come from the response so in the example above the cookie jar s count will be 1 once it visits google.com

572177
expression	evaluation
because the act of evaluation any expression could have altered the results of the others

572177
expression	evaluation
if you add an expression to the watch windows which does a function evaluation and then do a step operation the value will be staled in the watch windows

572177
expression	evaluation
it s very common for a user to type many expression in the watch windows and it s definitely not rare to have a function evaluation

572203
click	mouse
i m creating a firefox add-on and i have a situation where if someone click on a specific item in my toolbarbutton menupopup i want to display some text to appear beside the mouse for a couple seconds

572214
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
for more sophisticated date calculations such as the number of days within the ten million seconds after 3pm on january 19th in 1983 you would use the nscalendar class along with nsdatecomponents

572225
spawn	exit
your versioning does not work because ... spawn a new subshell in which the exit is executed

572243
perl	php
you could install perl or python or ruby or php and write the script fairly easily

572249
any	set
since the compiler will ignore any unreachable branches of code you can just set when you do a release build and the print statements will be excluded from your bytecode

572253
highlight	selected
the list receiving focus is different than the selected row not highlight

572258
web-applications	scalability
i would like to suggest that we identify the scalability requirements of enterprise systems and how they differ compared to web-applications

572262
google-chrome	firefox
my page is working fine in google-chrome and firefox

572266
perl	awk
this is a good candidate for awk perl and the like stateful parsing these will run in both windows s cmd.exe provided you have perl and or awk sed in your path as well as of course on linux and other unices

572279
pointers	stack
btw a nice compromise between these two is allocating the object on the heap and allocating a smart pointers to it on stack

572289
malloc	free
you may see the time it takes malloc new and free delete to return increase 10-fold

572295
mapping	unique
if you keep a mapping the session name unique value used as session id of the front-end and back-end sessions then you can easily find the back-end session it can be saved on files or database and then delete the session record

572296
keyboard	mouse
here i have done all move moving as well as mouse clicking opereations by help of remoting concept here keyboard operation is pending in that i could send keyboard values to corresponding focused controls.

572314
textbox	button
mainform.designer.cs contains the designers automatically created code including the clear button and the textbox i would like to clear

572476
oracle	mysql
most pages are written in perl as most of the data ingested processed and displayed on the site comes in the form of flat-files which then have to be meticulously regexed and databased in our mysql and oracle databases

572476
oracle	mysql
mysql has most of our data but new projects have begun using oracle more and more for gis data

572476
perl	php
my question to the community is what are the pros and cons of the following languages for the above-defined web dev environment perl php java python and --insert your favorite language here--

572492
arrays	loops
if you want to loops over variables then there are arrays

572519
perl	c++
i m doing research that involves a lot of coding writing hundreds of throw-away perl scripts c++ binaries that get used until i find some better approach large amounts of data that gets preprocessed in different ways where some new preprocessing makes the old way obsolete -- until i find out that the old way was actually better and so on

572533
python	php
i m not familiar with php enough to know its regex features but given your choices i would go for python

572541
perl	php
when i learnt php i d done some perl years ago and picked up php in no time at all

572541
perl	php
plus with apache servers you already have your environment set up and you can probably stage any development as a mix of perl and php reasonably easily

572551
contains	set
in the c programming language static is used with global variables and functions to set their scope to the contains file

572560
shared-objects	.so
.so a.c and b.c can have different foo s and foo is not exposed to shared-objects

572574
contains	any
the top frame contains a tree list of the tasks and sub-tasks i d need to do while the bottom frame contains any useful project information notes etc

572577
put	get
threads should get jobs from a queue and put back results on another queue

572577
job-queue	queue
this way a single job-queue and result queue can also be used by a grouping of worker threads it routes all the information from the threads into the main gui thread

572584
methodology	legacy
it seems that your problem is more legacy code and informal development methodology than the language per se

572584
dbix-class	dbi
modern perl offers a lot in terms of good practices and powerful tools testing is emphasized with the test modules and www-mechanize data base integration can be done through plain dbi but also using orm modules like the excellent dbix-class oo with moose is now on par with more modern languages mod_perl gives you access to a lot of power within apache

572584
perl	php
and if you have trouble finding developers that are already proficient in perl you can always hire good php people and train them that shouldn t be too difficult

572604
methods	extend
i m trying to extend the arrays.push methods so that using push will trigger a callback methods then perform the normal arrays function

572622
ubuntu-server	debian
i highly recommend debian or ubuntu-server for domain-0

572622
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu use the apt package manager

572624
callback	methods
while i m telling you how to do it you might be better served with using a different methods that performs the callback then just calls push on the arrays rather than overriding push

572637
internet-explorer	opera
but another solution could be firebug lite which works for internet-explorer opera and safari

572640
push	pull
for this purpose they setup a shared git repo and exchange their work using pull push commands

572640
git-branch	git-rebase
this happens because git-rebase operation rewrites history of the local git-branch and it becomes impossible to push into the shared git repo and pulling from it often leads to conflicts

572644
google-chrome	firefox
works on ie and google-chrome fine so ideally should work on firefox

572655
void	main
static void main string arguments

572662
project-management	project
it s our experience that using a project-management tool actually makes your project less agile

572694
put	get
so put your memory to one side get yourself either a really quiet space or a pink noise generator and dive in

572705
friend-function	friend-class
you would use a friend-function for the same sort of reasons that you would use a friend-class but on a member function rather than entire class basis

572707
python	c++
i use it mostly for python development but it can only be better for c c++

572725
value	field
escape replace lucene reserved characters during indexing and store original value in separate field in schema

572725
value	field
depending on the type of indexed field you d be able to query for exact value if it is plain string or for tokens if it has analyzer

572727
protected	public
sometimes public private protected protection level is not quite enough for real world situations

572739
mac-address	lan
if you could combine the ip-address approach with a hardware based check mac-address of nic this would eliminate the ip-address approach being too restrictive due to nat within a lan

572740
authentication	login
use it if you absolutely have to but you should consider such a session only weakly authentication and force a new login for anything that could be of value to an attacker

572740
sniffing	packets
by intercepting it over an unsecure line packets sniffing session hijacking

572751
punctuation	words
the idea of parsing the file using a dictionary your only other option really apart from randomly inserting spaces and hoping for the best and inserting spaces at identified words boundaries a real problem when dealing with punctuation plurals that don t alter the base words plural etc would i believe be a much greater programming challenge than correctly parsing the pdf in the first place

572754
credentials	security
you can only force them to identify themselves by providing unique credentials like a social security number i think this is often used in korea a passport number or similar

572770
spacing	layout
pdf doesn t only store spaces as space characters but also uses layout commands for spacing so it doesn t print a space but moves the pen to the right

572782
distributed	failover
one thing you should keep in mind is that it is very hard to cluster or replicate lucene indexes in large installation like failover scenarios or distributed systems

572784
contains	elements
firstly the specifications for html 4.01 and xhtml 1.1 specify the minimal content model for the option elements to be cdata - meaning it can contains nothing but text no child elementss

572792
contains	elements
it probably isnt working because height fails unless the contains elements has some definite height applied to it

572796
expression	evaluation
what s the best algorithm for evaluation a mathematical expression

572799
sin	pow
- but it wouldn t be hard to change it to return the result instead and introduce more operations like sin pow etc - presumably by mapping them directly to public methods on a helper object via expression.call

572800
message	alert
alert box should be generated automatically on page view plus the title and message of the alert box should change with each page refresh from expandable library

572808
png	gif
side note the chart should be exportable to png gif whatever

572817
selected	checkbox
it allowed the user to do simple joins and where clauses and selected clauses simply by toggling checkbox dragging table icons into view and connecting joins by drawing lines

572849
firefox	opera
helps with older versions of firefox and opera aswell occasionally

572853
xsd	xml
the following code helps me validate an xml file with an xsd schema

572854
contains	sorted
i have an input xml file which i need to copy 1 1 to the output except for one subelement which contains subitems that need to be sorted

572866
streamreader	writer
i have tried using .net streamreader writer which messes up with the encoding and the â sign

572872
debugging	trace
according to the log4j website valid levels in order of importance are trace debugging info warn error fatal

572876
google-chrome	firefox
i build it for google-chrome then i optimize for firefox most of the time its just little things then i go into ie 8 and then i go into ie 7 since most bugs i will have eliminated by then

572878
bazaar	cvs
all files under version control cvs at that time but look at svn or bazaar for example

thickbox	jquery
or you can use jquery thickbox

572885
lightbox	thickbox
i d try the lightbox thickbox approaches mathieu recommended

572891
freebsd	linux
it s should be highly efficient as it uses sendfile underneath the hood but not entirely portable only linux freebsd and solaris are currently supported

572909
jar	war
it was a hideous mess including one war that had the weblogic jar inside it

572936
linux	unix
i have used dos windows pc s all my life switched my main laptop to mac two years ago and have used numerous flavors of unix linux bsd while studying for my comp.sci

572938
keyboard	mouse
i guess think i can do this by registering every mouse movement or keyboard movement when users are doing on every page of my application

572946
keyboard	mouse
events are dispatched in a predictable order the runnable objects enqueued by invokelater are dispatched from the same event queue as mouse and keyboard events timer events and paint requests

572946
protected	public
whenever the toolkit calls a methods that might be implements in client code for example any public or protected methods in a public class the toolkit must save its state and release all locks so that the client code can grab locks if necessary

572946
click	mouse
once the gui is visible most programs are driven by events such as button actions or mouse click which are always handled in the event-dispatching thread

572959
perl	php
if you are doing php or lamp perl python ruby then linux is probably the best way to go

572962
simulated-annealing	traveling-salesman
i m currently writing a simulated-annealing code to solve a traveling-salesman problem and have run into difficulties with storing and using my read data from a txt file

572978
boolean	double
completed it for boolean double and datetime

572988
automake	gnu
look into the gnu autoconf automake toolchain

572996
constructor	object
just think of constructor functions as classes and the properties of the prototype ie of the object referenced by the constructor function s prototype property as shared members ie members which are the same for each instance

573010
put	get
i am currently trying to put together an url where i specify some get parameters

573031
glassfish	weblogic
otherwise the big name web environments apache tomcat spring glassfish ruby-on-rails jboss gruby-on-rails weblogic ... are all commonly deployed on some flavor of nix

573040
silverlight	wpf
completed uninstallation reinstallation of vs 2008 sp1 + msdn .net 3.5 framework sp1 silverlight sdk wpf toolkit - january 2009

573068
flotr	flot
i ve used flotr before which is heavily inspired by the above mentioned flot but instead of jquery it uses prototype

573076
autotools	gnu
eventually this was automated by gnu with their autotools package

573076
scons	cmake
alternatives include the already mentioned cmake boost.build boost.jam scons and more

573095
csv	xml
you can pass data to it in xml or csv format or in case you use asp.net there s a control wrapper which supports data-binding

573106
executable	jar
a lot of your concerns disappear if you make your jar executable and add a manifest including classpath

573109
dialog	pop-up
we were using word automation but it s painful because word will do crazy things like pop-up a modal dialog which will break your code

573120
emacs	vim
but you should also probably specify what vim version you re using and how that thing in emacs works

573121
authentication	login
how do i implement site authentication using gmail yahoo or facebook ids not openid login

573160
having	select
having assembly versions also allows you to maintain one or more copies of an assembly in the gac simultaneously letting your program select which version of the assembly it wants

573193
internet-explorer	firefox
error on firefox and internet-explorer

573267
data-manipulation	extraction
it must do something with data-manipulation and extraction

573305
actionscript	mxml
if i include a an external actionscript file in a flex mxml file i get different behaviours at compile time depending on the method used

573307
crypt	hash
the old app used crypt in perl to hash the passwords

573355
nsmutablestring	nsstring
immutable classes such as nsstring but not nsmutablestring don t need to offer an actual copy because they cannot be altered

573357
.net	wcf
if you interested in using rest with wcf and .net i would recommend endpoint.tv

573382
entity-framework	ado.net
also just fyi be sure to look into ado.net entity-framework before committing to linq to sql

573382
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework overview

573399
xsd	xml
does anybody know of a command line tool for validating xml with xsd schema

573400
primitive	int
you must use get the primitive numeric value then cast it to an int primitive

573412
sql-server	oracle
create a database link from oracle to sql-server heterogeneous connectivity

573417
shell	bash
for bash it needs to be put into .bashrc not .bash_profile .bash_profile is also only for login shell

573418
javascript	dom
a you can have a javascripton file or an xml file where you define title and contents for your container and a javascript function that once the page is loaded get randomly the title and content and insert them in the right dom element

573422
filtering	sorting
this will allow you to do the filtering sorting at the controller level while maintaining a strict correlation between the client and its data

573424
python	c++
that last link discusses more about the parallels between c++ and python style

573424
python	c++
that s rather difficult because at the least you ll have to convert any python exceptions that occurred during object instantiation into a c++ exception

573428
json	xml
xml json rendering would likely render everything you pass into the viewdata regardless of whether you intended it to be publicly visible or not

573455
substitution	replace
use the find and replace dialog and create a regular expression that will do the substitution for you

573472
firefox	gecko
however i would guess that this should be possible in an air app may be by asking the user permission like with gecko in firefox

573479
virtualization	vmware
for a free virtualization solution check out vmware server

573493
profiling	trace
profiling s trace files or trace tables by themselves won t say here s what you need to fix in order to avoid this error any more than a dump file will tell you here s the bad line of code - you ll still need an experienced dba to interpret the results

573498
click	mouse
when the user will click the button it will add a mouse handler so that i can draw a div element

573523
click	mouse
basically it will be character video with transparency and only non-transparent parts should be able to accept user input mouse click all other events should be passed through to underlying windows

573531
perl	c++
if you have perl installed the following one liner will convert a c++ source file to use forward slashes saving the original version in a file with extension .bak

573535
file-access	filesystems
regarding file-access times you might want to check the filesystems you use on how it behaves if a directory contains a lot of files

573535
hash	md5
you could then use the md5 hash of some field like filename to sort this into the right directory hash fabe063e.

573543
constructor	private
constructor must be private only

573545
swing	awt
the java launcher is not swing or awt specific

573550
nhibernate	llblgenpro
you want to use typed business entities instead of data tables to more naturally access your data and aren t already using something like nhibernate or llblgenpro

573558
scala	java
i don t know if you ve seen scala a newish language created by one of the original authors of java which runs on the jvm

573564
versioning	upgrade
i would be furious if large parts of an enterprise application just wouldn t compile because my team upgrade to a newer versioning of java

573566
linux	unix
under linux it may use abstract namespace unix sockets which are the same except they don t physically exist as visible files in the filesystem

573568
grouping	sorting
this might be sorting projection applying a predicate grouping etc

573582
function-pointers	member-functions
assuming a function-pointers has 8 bytes not uncommon especially for member-functions and the placeholder has one byte see logan s answer for why then we could have needed 9 bytes for the bind object

573583
groovy	scala
well i have to say regardless of whether the c# scala or groovy fans would like to agree or not i think some of the suggestions here are completely daft

573583
constructor	object
this is what constructor are they are factory methods that create instances of the object

573586
callback	methods
for instance handling an async callback can be defined inside the methods that initiates it

573590
push	pull
git-clone pull merge push operations

573593
getter	setter
i understand the reason for it but over the years having to call setter and getter and the like has made code huge and noisy

573597
constructor	private
constructor must be private only

573597
constructor	private
make all your constructor private

573597
groovy	java
probably not modifying java language but supporting more and new languages like groovy ruby python jruby or xruby jython etc and enhancing the jvm each time more

573610
delphi	c++
i just built an updated version of sdl.dll an open-source c dll that my delphi project uses with the express edition of visual c++ 2005

573624
implements	extends
and this worked because the locator class would return the stubs class which in addition to extends org.apache.axis.client.stubs also implements the addfunction interface class

573633
constructor	object
what is your threshold to use factory instead of a constructor to create an object

573634
versioning	upgrade
there are several different algorithms for comparison so if the default doesn t work for you try syntax aware or some of the other algorithms now i am using versioning 8 and haven t upgrade to versioning 10 so ymmv but i doubt that the xml diff has gotten worse

573638
hide	show
well why don t you get rid of sidebar and squeeze the table so it is without show hide effect

573650
python	php
there are numerous open source filters that do this for php python etc

573650
textile	bbcode
another way to handle it is to allow the user to enter comments in some kind of simpler markup like bbcode textile or markdown stackoverflow is using markdown perhaps in conjunction with a nice javascript editor

573653
mediawiki	bugzilla
i d say i believe powershell is a scripting language as soon as bugzilla or mediawiki are implemented as powershell scripts running on a webserver

573657
xquery	xslt
from there i imagine it s possible to write some sort of transformation via xslt or xquery into whatever end result you desire

573658
export	csv
you can chain the built-in cmdlets together to do just about anything that you could do at a unix prompt and there s some additional goodness for doing things like export to csv html tables and for more in-depth sysadmin types of jobs

573661
firefox	safari
the website i m building for escondido arts gallery has all of it s text in each element left-aligned in firefox and ie but for some reason everything is center aligned in safari

573668
perl	ruby
for your predicament you might be better off with a scripting language that others could get behind perl like you mentioned or others like ruby or python

573677
strict	let
specifying a strict rather than transitional doctype may also help in getting more uniform behavior from the browsers and let s be honest here can we really claim to still be transitioning to html4.01 or xhtml1.0

573680
python	java
have you used java c# perl python any other server side language

573682
icollection	ienumerable
generally you should pass around ienumerable t or icollection t depending on whether it makes sense for your consumer to add items

573693
32-bit	64bit
using x64 or ia64 you will have 64bit allocatable memory instead of 32-bit

573697
google-chrome	firefox
the center align property must be cascading from some other element because it s not only safari google-chrome which also uses webkit but also opera that shows the things center aligned and both safari google-chrome and opera are more standards compliant than ie and even firefox

573703
python	php
for example you might try python scipy though i don t know how hard it is to mix php and python

573710
any	set
kriging is one of the more flexible methods and is useful for gridding almost any type of data set

573712
revision	svn
you can also use svn co to get all projects on their latest trunk revision if you like

573723
arcgis-server	arcgis
desktop arcgis arcengine arcgis-server or what

573724
stderr	stdout
is there a fairly simple way to redirect stdout and stderr to a text control or other visible place

573733
freopen	stdin
you can redirect stdout stderr and stdin using freopen

573741
subtract	time
depending on the total number of servers you could almost opening them simultaneously and define the first response as winner subtract the time your client requires independently to process each query

573752
stderr	stdout
when you create a process using createprocess you can choose a handle to which stdout and stderr are going to be written

573758
ostream	std
or you can do that with a std stringstream or some other class derived from std ostream

573759
build-server	nant
however my build-server fails this test when it runs through nant which is executed from cruisecontrol.net

573762
put	get
you need to create pipe with createpipe then attach stdout to it s write end with setstdhandle then you can read from pipe s read end with readfile and put text you get from there anywhere you like

573763
subtract	add
in fact because you can add or subtract elements from a list i would argue that this makes the return value more mutable than an arrays

573768
twitter	tweets
i m writing an application that searches twitter for some search term say youtube and counts happy tweets vs

573779
oracle	mysql
i ve worked jobs where we started out using mysql for monetary reasons think a startup and one we started making money wanted to switch to oracle

573786
perl	awk
it has been long enough since using awk must be 18 years since later i just used perl so can t really comment

573786
filesystems	fileinfo
psh s strength here isn t so much of what it can do with filesystems objects and it gets full information here dir returns fileinfo or folderinfo objects as appropriate is that is the whole provider model

573810
positioning	slider
so frame a probably needs to be the initial positioning and rotation of the object when the slider is at one end and frame b the final positioning and rotation of the object when the slider is at the other end

573811
animation	rotation
purpose of animation 3d rotation

573813
webserver	host
but you have to configure your webserver to deliver the right content without a specific host name

573824
google-chrome	safari
in webkit safari google-chrome you can simply do

573826
look-and-feel	substance
i m having a bit of a problem with the substance look-and-feel

573826
look-and-feel	substance
i ve already got my gui written and it works fine but when i use a substance look-and-feel it requires all gui initialization to take place in the edt thread event dispatching thread or something

573833
jquery-plugins	jquery
note google s cdn version of the jquery files don t work for me all of the jquery-plugins themes i use don t work with google s versions anyway who says that they can successfully use google s cdn is lying.

573837
dictionary	arrays
in particular a class called timeentry in a mutable arrays called monday in a dictionary called termtimes in a class called pool and then in a mutable arrays called pools

573843
icollection	ienumerable
an arrays inherently supports ilist as well as ienumerable and icollection for that matter

573848
windows-media-player	embed
you could embed windows-media-player on a form

573849
contains	set
my change set is quite big and not only it contains modifications it also contains new files and deleted files as well

573861
put	get
let us know where we are falling down on the job or where you don t have a tool you need and we ll put it on the list and get to it

573861
windows-server	windows
shortly after windows 7 windows-server 2008 r2 ships we ll make v2 available on all platforms xp and above

573869
firefox	opera
debugging one browser is hard but debugging ie 7 ie 6 firefox opera safari.

573873
dialog	pop-up
after you do that vs will pop-up a dialog asking if you want a different product id

573897
hosts-file	hosts
this means make an entry in your hosts or configure your own dns server if possible so that blah.mysite.com goes to the site but that is not available on the internet

573901
any	set
like you can access your information with any combination of values in any order assuming you set up all the intermediate classes

573901
dictionary	arrays
its wordier than a multidimensional arrays or a tuple-keyed dictionary but i think will give you far more elegant code

573902
search-engine	web-crawler
whether this is search-engine web web-crawler or sites aggregating information available from microformats or screen readers for blind people or any of the dozens of other tools that need to be able to read your site you ve no guarantees they ll be able to parsing your site if it s a random tag soup

573902
javascript	dom
will jquery or other javascript libraries be able to figure out your weird non-standard dom

573902
contains	any
it s hard to use that for anything useful if your site contains 50 html errors in any case

573918
swing	awt
after learning on here that the java console doesn t support keyboard input a great deal i switched to swing and awt

573928
inherited	subclass
inherited by a subclass but is not

573936
swing	awt
i am familiar with java awt and swing so no need to explain these concepts to me

573949
abstract-class	derived-class
a good example is you have an abstract base class a and a derived-class b and b also needs to be a kind of serialization class so it has to derive from let s say another abstract-class called serialization

573957
implements	extends
if you re a c# and java programmer every time you use a class that extends a base-class but also implements a few interfaces you are sort of admitting multiple-inheritance can be useful in some situations

573963
buffering	streaming
however this should really not be an issue with c streaming as they usually do buffering

573970
environment	building
java tm 2 runtime environment standard edition building 1.5.0_14-b03

574006
filtering	sorting
sorting and filtering by cck fields in particular can be slow because cck doesn t automatically add indexes beyond the primary keys

574016
export	csv
yep - you can export csv from google and import that into quickbooks and presumably into other account packages

574063
subtract	time
the browser is using the local time of the client computer so if you are using the server time to create a date be sure to subtract at least one day to be sure that it has actually passed in the clients local time

574078
methods	extend
or you can use the add methods to extend the vector without explicitly giving a size

574080
user-interface	drawing
therefore most guser-interface frameworks have user-interface threads that handles the event loop and some drawing activities but most user code takes place in another thread

574082
json	xml
i figure i can either use the same project check the http headers for each request and respond with either xml json or html as required much like ruby-on-rails

574089
relational-database	rdbms
conclusion ms-access is being used as a true rdbms relational-database management system - please no flaming about ms-access being inferior and unstable - it has been running fine for more than 10 years

574108
webforms	asp.net
anyway i am using asp.net webforms and maybe this isn t how webforms is intended to be used but i like to construct and populate html elements manually

574108
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
i use sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader set sql string etc

574108
webforms	asp.net
as i see all the tutorials videos about the asp.net mvc i think it suite my needs as with the mvc you have to construct everything or most of it by your self which i am already doing right now with webforms

574117
constructor	private
well in terms of your single instance dialog if it s modal you don t have to worry you can make the constructor private and provide a public static method to access the form

574135
virtualenv	buildout
i am additionally using buildout for managing my deployment and development sandboxes together with virtualenv

574138
jsonp	ajax
using standard version you can get quite client-side experience inside php - there are dom events json support even ajax with jsonp

574197
python	php
just install php and run php filename.php similar to how you would execute a python script

574201
host	dns
a registrar or web host may update dns within a second or 2 of a customer making a change in the control panel or it may take minutes or hours if they make updates in batch mode

574223
video-streaming	streaming
i have the video-streaming in from youtube so i would really like it if it were on the fly streaming not i have to save it to a temp directory and process it there though that is acceptable. thanks isaac waller

574232
directory	folder
i have another db that is in the mssql data folder should that be placed in same directory as well

574238
photoshop	layer
think of the layer blending modes in photoshop or just lookup blend mode.

574248
nested-class	accessor
if you give an inner nested-class private fields the compiler will add use accessor methods as the vm does not allow classes to access fields in another class even though java does

574249
ironpython	ironruby
also consider that you can write applets in any .net language including ironpython ironruby perlnet etc

574252
ubuntu	linux
i want to go learn web programming but besides names and a little of html i don t know anything.so i ask you what programming languages you recommend why what can be done with it tools to learn etc.i don t know if it matters but i program in a linux enviroment ubuntu

574256
python	ruby
some support ruby and python and you might choose that path if you want to learn those languages

574262
display	width
than the display width in an integer

574262
display	width
from the rough figures you quoted it doesn t look as though you are exceeding the display width on any of the id columns

574262
integer	digits
i would hazard a guess that the original author of the database perhaps thought that int 4 meant an integer with up to 4 digits whereas it actually means an integer between -2147483648 and 2147482647 displayed with at least 4 characters left-padded with spaces if need be

574276
python	ruby
to get a little more advanced you can also try python or ruby

574276
javascript	dom
for javascript ajax you ll probably want to start by using firebug or firefox s dom inspector to learn the relationship between the html of a page and the dom object which javascript uses to interact with it

574285
directory	folder
first of all i d to establish that i do have the text file in my folder directory

574300
xargs	cut
another thought if you re going to use the xargs formulation offered by other posters cut might well be more efficient than awk

574303
selected	textbox
when the date range is selected and the control is closed then the range is shown in the textbox

574303
button	popup
i don t think that i can get a combobox to behave this way and i think that i need to use something along the lines of a textblock button and a popup

574305
solaris	linux
i have been using bash since the time i have been using unix- linux solaris

574317
centering	fixed
a right and a left fixed column with a fluid centering

574319
bash	zsh
i m partial to zsh it s like a blend of ksh and bash

574325
shell	bash
bash in my experience most people use bash partly because it is the standard shell in most linux systems

574327
clisp	sbcl
i don t know enough to give you a detailed answer but i noticed that sbcl was considerably faster then clisp when i was working with cl for my ai class

574327
clisp	sbcl
i ve heard that clisp is easier to install and is more portable than sbcl which has lots of processor-specific optimizations but if you re using linux they re both easy enough to fetch from the package manager

574335
attributes	properties
this isn t exactly what you are looking for but if you apply the attributes to the getter setter of the properties it will prevent the debugger from breaking on the properties unless explicitly setting a breakpoint on the line

574338
click	mouse
you will have to handle the mouse click event on the panels determine if you are on the edge of the panels within a 2-3 pixels and then handle the drag events and change the size property of the panels

574341
click	mouse
you could intercept the mouse location and the click

574343
jsonp	ajax
to get the data from your server you can use jsonp lots of stuff on so as well which is an ajax technique for cross-domain communication

574344
hide	show
i know that i can manually initialize destroy everything on the show and hide events but is there an easier way

574357
document	element
you can traverse the dom to find the parent document element but that s not what you mean right

574368
directory	folder
so should i still stick with the trunk branch tag folder convention even if i m fairly certain the branch tag directory will go unused for the smaller projects

574381
webforms	asp.net
i work in a shop that has a number of very good c# developers who have been using asp.net webforms and would like to move to a mvc framework

574405
content-length	content-type
you will also want to set the content-type to text plain and content-length to the size of the file

574408
shell	bash
in my experience there are very few goodies in standard unix shell where that means to me csh sh ksh that are not also present in at least an equivalent form in bash

574408
shell	bash
it is not in the classic bourne shell bin sh but be aware that bin sh on some machines is not the classic bourne shell but bash in disguise nor in the c shell

574421
processor	cpu
vectorized instructions are not limited to cell processor - most modern workstations-like cpu have them powerpc x86 since pentium 3 sparc etc...

574423
firefox	safari
i can reproduce this with both ie6 and ie7 but not firefox or safari

574440
firefox	safari
i don t get this error or any other error when running the same application on firefox or safari

574451
arrays	loops
what you should be doing is putting the filenames in an arrays and simply replacing that variable inside a loops

574452
actionscript	mxml
i am referring to whether you can use mxml markup in an actionscript 3.0 file in flexbuilder 3

574455
32-bit	16-bit
i ll use java 32-bit ints and produce enough data to check the last 16-bit of the number - that s 2048 hexadecimal int values

574461
linux	unix
most often in the unix linux world names like have_stdio_h indicate that the code has been autoconfiscated which is the official term used to describe the state of having been made to work with the autotools such as autoconf

574465
windows-xp	windows
update looks like one of the better ways to accomplish this if running windows 7 is using windows-xp mode to set up multiple virtual machines testing multiple versions of ie on one pc at the ieblog

574468
implements	extends
in flex you have the option of extends the sprite class or implements the iuicomponent class

574487
aggregate	grouping
grouping by enables you to retrieve various aggregate based on your query such as number of items in category etc...

574498
internet-explorer	firefox
firefox has an add-in that will render a webpage the same as if it was in internet-explorer 5.5 6 7 8 beta 2

574520
json	xml
i think the web service will handle converting these objects to xml for the third parties using it many may not be using .net also some things will be script callable from ajax calls on the web app using json

dunno if you ve already found the answer to this question but in regular svn server on apache you can get to a particular revision with

574782
implements	extends
as i understand it you want to get a global access to some instances of player but would not need to extends some other class or implements some interface to do so which means you don t have to inherited any behaviour you just want access to one object

574782
methods	extend
you can implement as many interfaces as you like but only extend one other class but you have to reimplement all functionality since you cannot write any code into an interface just define what attributes methods a class implementing that interface must provide

574785
constructor	object
you can create a object of your player class and pass it to the other objects via constructor or method which accepts player type

574788
constructor	object
why not just pass this player object in the constructor of the other classes or in the methods that you call

574803
swing	awt
also note you should always use swing components on the awt event dispatch thread

574806
static-classes	inner-classes
you can have static-classes as inner-classes but this doesn t help your problem due to the first point

574811
child-process	spawn
because the forkbomb code you provided dies if it cannot spawn a child-process the parent processes do not actually hang around but the fact that the children keep creating new grand -children keeps the process table full

i am unit testing code written against the ado.net entity-framework

575192
boost	stl
a subset of c++ and in particular the subset which it uses in its own implementation so that it can compile itself then you should avoid using stl and boost in your implementation because the stl and boost are implemented using templates so if and only if you use them then you will have to include implement support for compiling templates

575419
duplicates	contains
a set is a collection that contains no duplicates elements and whose elements are in no particular order

575426
dynamic-cast	subclassing
but still it s ugly kludgy and less correct than identifying subclassing using a dynamic-cast

if you are going to key retrievial of data by one of those field it would be advantageous to use that assuming value aren t significantly fragmented which can slow down insert performance

575493
directory	folder
pdfcreator has examples for different languages in the com folder of the install directory

575498
textbox	button
how this would work is that there is a textbox with a lookup button on a form

575498
textbox	button
the user can either type in a value for the textbox or can choose the lookup button

575498
selected	textbox
what i d like to do is allow the lookup windows to pass back the selected gridview value to the textbox on the first page and disable the textbox

575573
getter	setter
as mentioned most properties must have both a getter and setter

to answer your concurrent parent question you will need to have the parent set up a selected loop to handle possible responses from any of its children at any time

575641
intranet	lan
on intranet sites where all the users have high-speed lan access to the server but the ram available for holding session data is limited it may make more sense

575781
linux	unix
note solution is unix including linux only

575810
updating	updates
however when updating i d have to map one property back to the original column in the original table plus updates a few copies of that column in the denormalized tables

575879
factors	primes
what we need to see is that the problems given n and k find a primes factor p of n with 1 p k and show that no such p exists are both in np the first being the decision variant of the factors problem the second being the decision variant of the complement

575879
factorization	primes
second problem given a complete primes factorization p_1 ... p_m we can quickly check that their product is n and that none are between 1 and k

575879
factors	primes
since the smallest primes is 2 there is at most log_2 n primes factors in any valid factorization

575879
factors	primes
so if n doesn t have a primes factors between 1 and k there is a short polynomial-size proof which can be verified quickly in polynomial time

575897
checkbox	textbox
the usual way of allowing the end user to add a new record to a database is through presenting the user with a set of controls to fill in and or select from a number of labelled textbox listbox checkbox etc

there s nothing else you have to do -- you simply don t pull from or push to the libraryb repo any more

575934
bittorrent	irc
it comes with a lot of features such as an irc and bittorrent client which is important to me at school where there is a quota of 50 megs on disk spaces

575934
firefox	opera
most of opera s features are eventually available copied to firefox as plugins but i still prefer opera at home because the text looks better

575958
google-chrome	firefox
for some others especially many reading stackoverflow.com it might be flawed because their expectation is that google-chrome can also seamlessly import their firefox or whatever other plugins which was not part of google-chrome s original features

575971
linked-list	arrays
a dynamic arrays is not really the same thing as a linked-list though

575972

575995
linked-list	nodes
why does the clear method in java s default linked-list implementation bother to walk the list and unhook all the nodes

576000
key-value	key
that would allow you to catch the duplicates key error and replace it with your own error number that means duplicates key on insert to your code and it can include the actual key-value s

576018
if-statement	loops
you have to consider if-statement and while and for loops the loop body might never be executed and every branch of a select or switch statement

576084
button	popup
then bind three properties on the popup button

576084
button	popup
you can t bind the popup button directly to the udc because the popup button needs one of your model objects.

576084
dictionary	arrays
you could also try binding the pop-up button s content binding to the isoname s and content-values binding to the fullname s of the dictionary in the arrays but i m very distrustful of using primitive objects as model objects

576084
button	popup
user changes the value in the popup button

576084
button	popup
the popup button changes the value of its selected-object property

576084

if you are writing a c library where you don t want to expose some internal data-structure it can be good to go an extra route and hide implementation with a unspecified struct typedef

576130
any	set
if you want to do this you need to set up an httphandler to work through having all of the code run prior to sending any information back to the client

576144
constructor	object
if the parameterless constructor should not initialize members to default values use an immutable object

576152
hide	show
if you are making it so a user can only see certain info after selected a drop down you can hide it in a panels and only show that panels when the drop down is selected

576152
having	select
this is the most useful if you do not mind the user having to select from drop down each time

576160
any	set
you will also want to protect any attempt to key press in the textbox or set it where enabled true

576207
subclassing	base-class
exception-handling can be subclassing and often you ll want to catch a base-class of many exception-handling but might not be able to handle all of them

you re more than likely to find something that solves your problem in the jeffrey richter s power collections library which has lists tree most data-structures you can think of

576227
configuration	logging
since you can specify the logging configuration file on command line now i suspect it will become even leaner and if you re starting a new application i d definitely agree with his statement that you shouldn t even bother wrapping the logger

576240
contains	elements
note insert does not create a child of the elements you call it on. and then after disabling the submit button i need to call the contains form of the submit button submit call as ie will not submit after you disable the button

576266
negative-number	zero
so somewhere along the line i m taking a square root of a negative-number or dividing by zero

576271

576296
data-structures	skip-lists
they have written tutorials this one implementing a rather unpolished skip-lists in c# and discussing other types of data-structures

576296
data-structures	dictionary
there s a better skiplist at codeproject which is very polished and implement the interfaces in a well-behaved manner. they also have a few data-structures bundled with .net namely the hashtable dictionary and hashset

576296
binary-search-tree	skip-lists
a bloom-filter a skip-lists and random binary-search-tree

i still think wcf is the way to go but it would require .net 3.0 at least

576324
configuration	environment
simple configuration reconfiguration on various environment

576330
default	reset
the proper way to reset is to set to default

576347
configuration	logging
it s ability to customize logging at run-time by changing the xml configuration file is very handy when an application is malfunctioning at run-time and you need to see more information

576350
.when	ready
add the new column alter-table populate it and drop the old ones .when you are ready to do so

576368
constructor	object
a constructor must always return a new object never a previously allocated object

576375
export	report
sql-server report services would be the best way to export data from an application into excel

576384
export	csv
depending on whether csv is sufficient for your excel export you could just format the data and send it back setting the contenttype as hunter suggests or use the primary interop assemblies which would require excel on the server to construct a real excel spreadsheet and serialization it to the response stream

576387
waveform	music
as for music cds gracenote works by analyzing the actual waveform data of every track on the cd

576405
arrays	loops
i ve encountered this kind of improvement often enough to be mistrustful of counting loops for any but the most trivial uses traversing an arrays

576405
arrays	map
the arrays and map algorithm is essentially

576407
assign	add
the consumer would be responsible for setting up those properties and inside of your viewcontroller s loadview methods you would add both of those views to a new view which you would then assign to the view property of the uiviewcontroller

576418
graphics2d	jcomponent
however defining a methods with the signature with paintcomponent graphics2d like the following is legal but it won t ever be called as it is not overriding any methods that is defined in jcomponent

576418
swing	awt
painting in awt and swing

576420
compact-framework	.net
i have to join the chorus recommending log4net in my case coming from a platform flexibility desktop .net compact-framework 32 64-bit point of view

576429
children	nodes
this is because queryselector behaves o n under ie where n is the size of the entire dom - that is you will pay the penalty of traversing the entire dom even if you call queryselector on a leaf nodes that has no children

576431
conditional	operators
in perl and other languages a conditional ternary operators can be expressed like this

576456
web-config	app-config
all of it is configurable in app-config web-config

576457
checkbox	button
i would like to have an option during installation maybe radio button or better checkbox to have an option to choose both that would say install epson drivers and install canon drivers

576458
constructor	private
how do i setup the unit test if the constructor is private .net

576461
decimal	hex
in the file there are packed decimal so the hex could contains let say a x 001500001c but when i upload it mainframe mistook it as a new line

576464
perl	php
in dynamically typed languages perl python ruby php etc a function can decide to return a value of any type each time it is called

576465
constructor	private
you can do it directly in each test or by creating an accessor class that wraps all of the private methods properties including the constructor

576472
constructor	private
by making the constructor private you re saying that its behavior is not part of the public api of the class

576489
instrumentation	trace
the reason that i prefer log4net to using trace one of targeting - with log4net i can independently instrumentation different layers of my application data access services business logic etc and different subsystems authentication processing etc and turn on off the logging of each subsystem independently

576489
logging	trace
the static-methods provided on the trace class such as traceinformation don t provide any way to specify which subsystem the logging is from so this isn t something easily provided by writing my own tracelistener

576489
configuration	logging
by contrast last time i looked at it the logging application block reparsed its xml configuration for every message logged making the block very heavy and slow

576499
constructor	private
in java and this assumes the only constructor is the private default constructor otherwise checking of the arrays is required

576499
constructor	private
typically i ll only do this for code coverage if i make a constructor private it s generally to avoid instantiation

576509
object-reference	instances
now i compile and end up with this error object-reference not set to an instances of an object

576519
constructor	private
but i ve yet to run into an instance where i had to make a constructor private and i had to unit test it

576531
environment	building
we have a local 1-click building that is required to be run before check in an integration building also runs in a separate environment every check in...

576535
any	set
what if we set the cookie to path subfolder1 will the cookie will be made available to any page or subfolder beneath the folder

576540
strtol	atoi
plus there s already an atoi function and if you don t want to use that because it s outdated a strtol function you can recast as an int if you have to

576544
contains	any
using codedom avoid any problems with having to know where the compiler executable is but if your code can t be contains in one file without any dependency it s unusable and calling the compiler then executing the result is a better option

576561
any	set
if we set the cookie to path subfolder1 will the cookie will be made available to any page or subfolder beneath the folder

576568
value	field
pluggable listeners sounds like appenders - there are lots of them and in fact i even hacked the rolling log file to always end in .log for file associations added a cc field to the email appender and have finally tuned my favourite value for the colored console appender

576568
debugging	trace
customisable trace switches log4net only comes with fatal error warn info debugging in order of increasing verbosity

576570
licensing	gpl
i am getting very tired of people recommending berkleydb without qualification - you can only distribute bdb systems under gpl or some unknown and not publicly visible licensing fee from oracle

576571
business-objects	data-access
the data-access is encapsulated in basic business-objects

576580
python	c++
the server could be in any language c c++ python erlang etc... and the client could be a 50 line php class that uses the socket_ functions

576584
ip-address	hostname
the hostname or ip-address of the server

576596
revision	updates
i d recommend changing the default context menu items to have updates to revision on the main context menu

576596
revision	updates
updates to revision

576599
subclassing	base-class
a subclassing for each supported database server with an init methods that assign to the base-class member variables

576649
development-environment	platform
the cdt c++ development tools project provides a fully functional c and c++ integrated development-environment ide for the eclipse platform

576665
value	field
i assume you tried directly setting the object value of the text field

576667
python	java
since the python code in ironpython and jython run on the .net clr and java vm respectively they enjoy the great threading support built into those libraries

576667
ironpython	cpython
in addition to that ironpython doesn t have the gil an issue that prevents cpython threads from taking full advantage of multi-core architectures

576689
button	popup
i d like to agument my code so that if the user clicks on the button to pick a date when the date is currently nil i first set it to now and then show the popup

576713
groovy	java
note this is java you may have to adapt it slightly to groovy

576715
height	frame
it seems obvious that apple doesn t particularly invite mucking with the default height of the uipickerview but i have found that you can achieve a change in the height of the view by taking complete control and passing a desired frame size at creation time e.g

576718
exception-handling	try-catch
for exception-handling that you are catching in try-catch - you really should be expecting them and handling them

576750
solaris	unix
i have some applications and standard unix tools sending their output to named-pipes in solaris however named pipes can only be read from the local storage on solaris so i can t access them from over the network or place the pipes on an nfs storage for networked access to their output

576761
arrays	map
but if we could use mem_map to map all 4gib physical memory if we have so much physical memory available on x86-32 then the mem_map arrays would occupy 32mib that is not a lot of kernel memory or am i wrong

576763
wicket	jsf
another team which developed a project on jsf is now thinking to shift to wicket after our success with it

576768
latitude-longitude	location
i know it s possible to start the iphone maps application by calling openurl on a google-maps url with parameters saddr and daddr with location strings or latitude-longitude see example below

576779
basichttpbinding	was
the root cause turned out to be that the wcf service was bound using wshttpbinding whereas silverlight only supports basichttpbinding

576780
perl	php
preferably i d like to do so with some bash shell scripting maybe some php or perl and a mysql db

576791
32-bit	x86
kernel low memory is the real memory map addressed with 32-bit pointers on x86

576803
entity-framework	ado.net
i am having some problems with linq to entities in the ado.net entity-framework

576807
cos	sin
h t a cos wt + i b sin wt

576807
cos	sin
using the fact that exp iw cos w +i sin w

576823
perl	php
bother php and perl would be perfectly capable of downloading the rss feed and insert the data into mysql

576823
perl	php
set the php or perl script up to run every x number of hours days whatever with a cronjob and you d be done

576831
factors	digits
karatsuba s method is pretty neat cut the two factors in half by digits a1

576843
python	tcl
i m noticing a pretty strange bug with tkinter and i am wondering if it s because there s something in how the python interacts with the tcl at least in win32

576843
python	tcl
i am wondering if there is perhaps some breakdown in the object model at the tcl python layer

576850
jcifs	ntlm
are there any alternatives for jcifs ntlm library

576853
static-classes	static-class
i mean what are benefits of using static-class and how clr deals with static-classes

576862
python	ruby
if like in python a ruby class is defined when executed i think it is then you can do this

576864
constructor	private
pre c# 2.0 you could just have a regular class with a private constructor

576867
contains	any
all members of a static class has to be static members so if you forget to add static before any of them your code won t compile it also makes your code more readable as anyone who will see that the class is static will understand it only contains static members

576867
static-classes	static-class
the best use for a static-class is for utility functions you could also use them to keep the global methods and data in your application i use static static-classes very often in almost any project

576876
priority-queue	heap
fibonacci heap which perform most of the priority-queue operations in amortized constant time thus improving the runtime of dijkstra s algorithm and other problems

576876
priority-queue	heap
the algorithm uses soft heap a variant of the traditional priority-queue except that some corruption might occur and queries might not be answered correctly

576877
constructor	private
previously the best way was to define the methods within a class whose constructor was private and have none of the functions within the class construct it

576883
unsigned	short
on wince when using printf what are the qualifiers for various data types - short unsigned long etc

576886
radio-button	selected
that means that when you selected one radio-button every other radio-button in the same container is automatically changed to unchecked state

576886
selected	button
as you can see the radio button should be grouping by column selected one of the radios should clear the rest of the column but should have no effect in the other column

576886
alignment	layout
but the layout problems related to horizontal alignment between the radio button and its text are just killing me

576886
alignment	layout
i would like to redesign the layout by using a tablelayoutpanel with three columns in order to simplify the alignment related issues but that means that i cannot use the automatic radio-button grouping-by-container feature

576886
radio-button	selected
specifically is there any canonical or known way of subclassing radio-button or go all the way down to win32 apis so that every time the control is checked by using the mouse keyboard enter space bar and any other way that i could not be aware of selected them i can trap the event and manually update the state of every other control on my form and in a way that the automatic grouping feature is well known to be de-activated

576903
show	next
great desktop apps show little reminders next to the button that have accelerators when you hold down the appropriate modifier keys and wait a fraction of a second

576926
plugins	add-on
it all should be current and up-to-date i know there are plugins or add-on i can use which requires me zero-coding

576937
configuration	logging
is it possible to use log4j.properties configuration for weblogic server logging or can i only change the log4j configuration with java code

576939
communication	messages
if the old hardware is communication via rs232 then write a class that wraps the rs232 commands and make the class inject the messages the old hardware would respond

576940
python	php
i know php python what else do i need or are the better options available

576954
tuples	set
writing queries like this where implicit tuples unpacking is used to work with the result set has typically been more effective for me than trying to worry about matching python variables names to sql column names which i usually only use to drop prefixes and then only if i m working with a subset of the column names such that the prefixes don t help to clarify things anymore and is much better than remembering numerical column ids

576959
put	get
just define a keyword then put in the url to which the incoming sms request will be routed you ll get the info such as mobile number and sms text in query string parameters then whatever output your web scripting generates you can use any web scriptinging language platform will be sent back to the sender

576964
silverlight	wpf
does anyone know of a simple wpf or silverlight framework which enables you to define some database tables in sql-server compact database and then the framework automatically creates the windows classes etc

576968
windows-xp	windows
the exe on the new pc is on 30 or so other pcs that i know of ranging from windows-xp sp1 2 3 windows vista and windows embedded

576979
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

576982
having	select
then procedure a would call procedure c which only does do some interesting things and then do its required select and procedure b could also call procedure c and do its select rather than having the overhead of a second select and a temporary table that is only used as a dustbin

576994
boolean	int
use a boolean flag to indicate whether you are inside a comment afaik there is no bool type in c so use an int with 0 or 1 or more ideally two symbolic constants like inside_comment and outside_comment

577001
account	api
first thing you need to sign up for an account sms gateway most of them also give you example code how to send and receive sms using their api

577004
cursor	row
it lets you set a function that takes the arguments cursor and row and return whatever you d like

577007
getter	setter
so no setter getter wastes anymore it s stunningly simple to add notification also in a single place etc

577024
scons	bjam
hence there are tons of makefile generators autotools cmake or makefile alternatives scons waf bjam ....

577030
question-answering	semantics
dimitrov above you ll have a good beginning at getting some semantics into your system since prolog gives you a very simple way of maintaining a database of knowledge and belief which can be updated through question-answering

577031
double-quotes	spaces
to escape paths with spaces use backslashes single or double-quotes as your shell requires

577065
directory	folder
make sure all the dependent dlls are in the path path meaning not the directory where your assembly is because asp.net copies your assembly away into a temporary folder but rather a directory that s included in the system path environment variables

577076
message	alert
i develop a windows form application that shows message like msn alert at the right corner of desktop

577077
children	nodes
you might consider taking godeke s idea further and instead of subclassing the treenode tie the nodes to a business object collection - storing your local data in properties of the collection children

577088
having	select
textfield - how to prevent mouse right click menu from appearing a menu having copy paste select all etc options

577129
binary-tree	tree
could you not traverse the entire tree and insert it into a new binary-tree

577138
radio-button	button
as radio button use the name attribute to grouping themselves this means you will not be able to create groupinging of radio button setting the groupingname property will not have the desired effect as the repeater will override this and create unique names for each radio-button

577167
ref	out
i think the asp.net team took this approach rather than a using the function s return-value this meaning that if a function has a logical return-value that would have to be dealt with through ref out parameters or b setting a flag on the request

577185
put	get
i d put the unversioned files up on a web or file server accessible to everyone using the project and add a scripting to automatically wget scp etc. download the files zipped if needed and extract them to svnignored folders so that they don t get picked up by subversion

577190
value	field
if i added another field to the page table which always contains the value page i could do

577199
symbolic-computation	maple
the versioning of matlab you are using uses mupad as it s symbolic-computation engine but they used to use maple

577199
put	get
i have the most recent version of the maple version of the symbolic toolbox and when i put your expression into it i get

577203
profiling	trace
am i either mis-reading the profiling trace in which case how should i interpret the above or is there a good reason for this

577205
children	nodes
i want to build a tree with one root nodes and multiple children nodess with some weight on each branch

577207
double	int
my guess is that in the first case there wan an implicit conversion of double to int

577216
filesystems	fat
the ability to chain files together in what we now call file grouping was a way to work around filesystems limitations and allow dbs larger than 4gigs on fat based installs

577217
webforms	asp.net
if no match is found the routing engine passes the request on to iis to handle normally - this is also how you can intermix asp.net webforms and mvc in the same application

577233
any	set
i would like to set up a sql-server 2008 alert to notify me when any procedure executes for 1 second or longer just an example

577254
any	set
this is something i can do quite easily with a single element since any contentcontrol can have it s verticalcontentalignment property set but then you only have a single child element to play with and i m back to square one

577271
webforms	asp.net
it s a term which can be used to describe a variety of things it is commonly used by critics of asp.net webforms where if you are making heavy use of pre-built webcontrols you have little control of the generated html which in many cases appears bloated large and unclean messy etc

577279
contains	any
last do as other suggested - make a copy of the table that contains rows that are not to be deleted then drop original rename copy and recreate integrity constraints if there are any

577287
silverlight	wpf
you can get the silverlight chart controls running on wpf they re quite nice and free

577291
constructor	object
with the code above your webpart is portable because there s no hardcoding and runs in the correct security context while disposing of all unmanaged sprequest object created by the spsite and spweb constructor

577302
widget	button
i have a function that is called when a button is pressed which does various tasks and a textview widget which i write to after each task is completed

577303
filtering	sorting
grid controls tend to be fairly bloated because they expose functionality for sorting filtering binding templating etc

577332
order	add
add order to datacontext orders

577332
order	add
do i still need to add the order line to the context.orderline collection

577347
rollback	commit
a failure before the first commit completes everything rollback

577348
arguments	default
ie the function takes any arguments and doesn t do any conversion aside from the default argument promotion

577349
stored-procedures	ssis
it seems that when using the ole db command within ssis problems occur when handling stored-procedures that return xml view bug description

577354
widget	button
i don t know how to connect this button to a separate function since it sits in a widget called dialog-action_area

577388
assign	add
no in almost all cases it is not needed if you attach assign to property or add to collection of entity it to an attached object on that was pulled from the db

577395
selected	button
if you can spare the space i think that two lists perhaps selected items on the left and the collection of items on the right with affordances such as checkmarks or button are great

577398
access-specifier	inherited
protected access-specifier is applied only to the events which are in inherited relationship isa

577401
memcached	apc
zend_cache with apc or memcached backend

577409
base-class	inherited
if inheritedance and protected members are your goal inherited from a base-class instead

577435
any	set
you can set a max-width on any block level element so combining that with epatel s media declarations get s you the following

577439
double	int
stop using double and use int instead

577439
double	int
or if you have to use double in the order arrays you need to decide how to round any non-integer value that may be found in order to a int

577442
private-members	object
an object of a class can access the private-members of any other object of the same type

577446
double	int
well the arrays subscripts x and y are not of an integral type like int but of type double

577450
put	get
get the highest even number below x and put this in y

577454
mootools	extjs
i don t use libraries myself but dived into some like prototype yui- extjs the seemingly omnipresent jquery mootools to learn from them and extjsract some of the functions or patterns they offer

577455
contains	set
in wpf themes are simply a set of xaml files each contains a resourcedictionary which holds the style and templates definitions that apply to the controls used in the application

577457
put	get
you can then either put this 2 into one of your pieces giving you the answer you suggested or you could split it out evenly and add get two pieces of 15 as suggested in one of the comments

577460
dictionary	arrays
as far as i can tell the dictionary doesnt maintain insertion order like php associative arrays right

577464
double	int
not sure why you are working with double but wanting int division semantics

577466
firefox	opera
it works fine in firefox opera camino and safari

577475
contains	set
containment allows precise control over what is exposed and what not by get set functions and you can still let it give you a copy or reference to the contains naked c struct object

577486
termios	fcntl
if you want it to also work on unix-like systemd you can try this solution using the termios and fcntl modules

577515
exception-handling	try-catch
that being said you need to wrap your makestep methods in a try-catch and log the exception and of course any innter exception-handling

577534
configuration	environment
you should look into a way the developers can override settings in this files via personalized configuration files in the user s home-directory or maybe environment variables

577566
include	ssi
the actual problem is that php works a bit different than other frameworks because it works in a ssi server-side include way - every request is handled by http server and if it requires running a php scripting its interpreter is initialized and scriptinging loaded parsing compiled and run

577589
constructor	object
one proper use of the this keyword is to chain constructor making constructing object consistent throughout constructor

577590
tuples	any
when i wrote this code i wondered if there are already functions in the .net that do the same thing and do it not just for pairs but for any size tuples

577608
entity-framework	ado.net
binding in code-behind with ado.net entity-framework

577615
command-line	cmd
under the windows cmd-line interpreter cmd.exe there is support for the start cmd

577621
fortran	pascal
added i ve seen plenty of apps written in assembly language and the main speed advantage over a language like c pascal fortran etc

577632
show	next
if a false is returned it show an error message next to that field

577634
windows-xp	windows
i am looking for an elegant way to get the os version like windows-xp professional service pack 1 or windows server 2008 standard edition etc

577635
poptoviewcontroller	dealloc
now in viewcontroller3 if i do a poptoviewcontroller maincontroller dealloc is called only for viewcontroller3

577639
textures	fbo
actual solution is to drawing the application on a fbo and draw a rotated scaled rectangle with the textures on it

577641
object-reference	instances
it can be used as a object-reference which refers to the instances the current methods was called on return this

577641
constructor	object
it can be used as a object reference which refers to the instance the current constructor is creating to access hidden fields

577656
unique	words
if you are going to roll your own you will need to create an index file which is sort of a map between unique words and a tuples like file line offset

577656
data-structures	prefix-tree
of course you can think of other in-memory data-structures like a trie prefix-tree a judy arrays and the like.

577681
javascript	dom
i have a button on my webpage that invokes a javascript method which looks through the dom gathers the data and sends it off to the service

577693
for-loop	arrays
i would like to use for-loop to go through each param and insert them into my own arrays

577697
entity-framework	ado.net
binding in code-behind with ado.net entity-framework

577709
any	set
i almost always start my selectors with the closest #id that i can because it simultaneously limits the spread of the selector to exactly the elements that i want and automatically overrides any global css rules i may have set in the document

577740
value	field
if i now access the cell s value it is of a type field

577740
selected	cell
if i selected different item from the combo the cell s value becomes a string

577760
reflection	runtime
use reflection at runtime

577765
selected	button
its best not to use it as it causes issues with form elements especially input button and selected boxes

577793
installation	upgrade
store the installation location in the registry enabling upgrade to find the correct location

577793
deployment	install
on release builds we version our install copying the msi file to a deployment directory

577802
textbox	button
one cheeky hack i have used is to create a normal .net button along with textbox etc

577817
16-bit	8bit
although c is close to the low-level manipulation of 8bit 16-bit 32-bit 64-bit data there are a few mathematical operations not supported by c which can often be performed elegantly in certain assembly instruction sets

577817
32-bit	16-bit
fixed-point multiplication the product of two 16-bit numbers is a 32-bit number

577817
32-bit	16-bit
but the rules in c says that the product of two 16-bit numbers is a 16-bit number and the product of two 32-bit numbers is a 32-bit number -- the bottom half in both cases

577822
binary	hex
for the binary hex data however it does not get entered into the registry correctly

577824
python	ruby
i am also learning qt4 with ruby which is where this code originates from i translated it from ruby to python

577843
visio	dia
dia - a diagramming tool that does the same sort of thing as visio

577843
linux	unix
it is released under the gpl linux unix and windows versions are available

577843
linux	unix
again this runs on windows linux unix and mac osx

577843
linux	unix
as far as i am aware it uses xlib so it s quite closely bound to x and only runs on x-based platforms such as linux unix or cygwin

577844
altera	xilinx
however since the configuration memory can be corrupted in a sram-based design xilinx altera lattice you have to worry about that too

577866
dynamic-linking	static-linking
if possible i would prefer dynamic-linking not static-linking as used above

577872
dictionary	arrays
keep in mind the contents of the arrays are the pointers to your nsmutablearrayss--those are what can t change in the immutable dictionary structure

577875

the place where i ve seen this is in webworks where a single class had tons of getter-setter methods -- the setter used for dependency-injection url arguments passed to the object upon execution and the getters for making value accessible to various page templates i think it was jsps

579496
getter	setter
so the breakdown grouping stuff logically assuming the class was called myaction there was myactionbasicarguments fields and setter for basic cgi arguments extended by myactionadvancedarguments advanced-option arguments extended by myactionexposedvalues getter extended by myactiondependencies setter used by spring dependency-injection non-cgi arguments extended by myaction which contains the actual execute methods

579503
databound	gridview
i have a gridview that is databound in the code-behind using a stored procedure

i d recommend using something like the ie developer toolbar if you prefer internet-explorer or firebug if you prefer firefox to inspect the html output and find the id of the radio button you want to manipulate in javascript

579605
radio-button	selected
then you can use document.getelementbyid radiobuttonid .checked from javascript to find out whether the radio-button is selected or not

579608
radio-button	selected
selected the customize radio-button and click the customize button

579612

579995
sql-server	mysql
im not sure what you are asking in how you would work with the server but im assuming you are asking about how you develop build the databases with sql-server it has a client program to manage the database whereas with mysql there is an open source php tool for management

580300
python	c++
linux most things are in c many userland apps are in python kde is all c++

580304
shell	bash
the linux kernel is mostly written in c and a bit of assembly language i d imagine but some of the important userspace utilities programs are shell scripts written in the bash scripting language

580304
python	c++
as paul said python and c++ play important roles

580310
getter	setter
4 personally i hate naming my getter setter getx and setx but prefer to lean on the overloading mechanism and use xtype x const for getter and void x xtype newval for setter

580317
onchange	keyup
it counts every keyup key down press as an onchange event meaning that you can t navigate a redirect selected list via keyboard killing accessibility for users who can t use the mouse

580317

more interesting might be modular addition over a grouping of size n where n has primes factors other than just 2 or size p where p is a primes

580377
g++	gcc
you use -lpthreads when using g++ just as you would with gcc

580379

580437
exception-handling	try-catch
edit note if you are going to put any other code in the try block make sure to specify that the only exception-handling the catch should catch is the exception-handling thrown by convert.toint32 if when it fails - otherwise you could end up with a nasty problem if something else in that try-catch should fail

580445
instances	self
for instances in your methods it would be ok to throw sqlexceptions all around if the code it self is the implementation of the jdcb layer

580450
bazaar	git
if commits will happen to both repositories maybe a distributed versioning system such as git bazaar or mercurial is more up your alley

580450
push	pull
git for one even lets you pull from and push to a subversion repository directly

580466
version-control	git
if you don t have to use svn you may be better to use a distributed version-control system such as mercurial or git

580487

yet this is a legal and commonly used edit templates for databound gridview

580489
boost	stl
rather than using shared_ptr with standard stl containers take a look at the boost pointer container library

580496
selected	listbox
this worked properly until i made the contact property into a dependency property so that i could bind it to the selected item in a listbox

580500
push	pull
you could also make a branch of the mirrored repository and use that as your checkout then your commits are also a local-only operation and when you re ready with a batch of commits you push them to the remote svn repository and pull other user s changed back similar to an svn update command

580500
bazaar	git
other than that i second using bazaar mercurial or git as others have suggested

580512
derived-class	base-class
i would suggest adding a constructor to your base-class which takes a const reference to the derived-class explicitly with a forwarding declaration

580522
click	mouse
for a mouse click you can assume the current selected page is the one that got the click

580552

580584
directory	folder
i really just want the filesystems to set newly created files and directory with a certain permission if it is in a certain folder

580588

you should then make sure everyone runs with umask 002 or 007 or something of that nature---this is why debian and many other linux systems are configured with per-user groups by default

580593
postgresql	mysql
what i m looking for is a way to convert the access database to an open-source database such as mysql or postgresql

580597
versioning	upgrade
as you upgrade to new versioning of the other vendor s dll you will need to extend the mock dll to support any new entrypoints that your application uses

580597
versioning	upgrade
in both cases you will need to revisit this every time you upgrade to a new versioning of the other vendor s sdk

the copy constructor is used for creation of object based on another s instance of the same type

580641
click	mouse
it all works fine when click the eventhandler fires off correctly but it requires too much precision from the mouse pointers

580643
copy-constructor	shallow-copy
the problem with the auto-generated implicit copy-constructor in your particular case is that it will only perform a shallow-copy of myarray where it shares the same pointer value but hasn t allocated its own section of memory for myarray

580645
toolchain	gnu
i m porting a standard gnu toolchain project to iphone os and using xcode to do it

580674
postgresql	mysql
either mysql or postgresql will work fine as a replacement data store for your access data

580690
boolean	int
the commented-out line as it is should work just use int values of 1 and 0 in your data to represent a boolean

580692
boolean	int
sqlite has no built-in boolean type - you have to use an int instead

580692
boolean	int
also when you re comparing the value to true and t you re comparing it to those values as strings not as boolean or int and therefore the comparison will always fail

580718
put	get
not all devices will store their information in the same column either so you may have to put some logic into your wmi results to get he format you re looking for

580723
revision	updates
as a result the designers of this revision decided to put the entire page inside of an updates panel sigh

580754

that s because the property nodevalue returns null for elements nodes so you return innerhtml instead which is gonna contains the whole html code inside an elements

580754
internet-explorer	firefox
in internet-explorer your target is assigned by event.srcelement and hence is an element node while it s a text node in firefox

580768

all the scripting seem to be made for display content in a static width div element

580798

580808
any	set
then set the content-type header appropriately e.g image gif and send back a 1 pixel image or any other sized image you like

make sure to check your project references after you upgrade from 2005 to 2008 for some odd reason the upgrade wizard does not upgrade references to microsoft.visualstudio.qualitytools.unittestframework and leaves references to versioning 8.0 of this assembly

580951
external	root
i d personally set up an svn external in my libs folder of the flex project root

580951
buildpath	libs
then i d add a reference to the source path by going to root_project_folder properties flex buildpath source path add folder - then add the libs folder which should then be relative to your project

580952
display	width
instead of display none you could try visibility hidden and setting the width and height to 1px each

580968
put	get
you may get a warning if you put the value of isprimitive directly inside the if-statement

580978
mouseleave	mouseenter
i ve made an event-handler that display the pop-up when the mouseenter but i m struggeling a bit with when the mouseleave

restart	reload
another huge benefit you can configure mod_wsgi to reload your application if the wsgi application scripting is touch no need to restart apache

581155
lighttpd	apache
nginx and lighttpd are commonly used for webservers either by serving python apps directly through a fastcgi interface don t bother with any wsgi interfaces on these servers yet or by using them as a front end in front of apache

581155
pylons	django
if you look at pylons you can see their idea of best-of-breed wsgi components and a framework that makes it easier than django to choose your own components like templating engine

581211
development-environment	platform
anyway if you want to target iphone the best move would be to change to a mac platform which can natively run xp for smoothing the switch in order to get xcode the mac and iphone development-environment

581314
tapestry	wicket
you ll probably want the aid of a web framework jsp groovy tapestry wicket spring asp.net-mvc etc

581393
wamp	php
it s a wamp server joomla 1.5.9 php 5.2.8

581402
copy-constructor	constructor
because a templates constructor is never a copy-constructor the presence of such a templates does not suppress the implicit declaration of a copy-constructor

constructor	object
templates constructors participate in overload resolution with other constructors including copy constructors and a templates constructor may be used to copy an object if it provides a better match than other constructors

581458
configuration	environment
managing multiple configuration file environment

581467
if-statement	loops
this way you re not executing an if-statement for every iteration of the loops when you only care about doing the work once

581489
command-line	cmd
does that cmd not do what you intended when you ran it from the cmd-line

581525
firefox	safari
it seems that firefox and ie will happily render a png image from s3 even though it has the wrong content-type header whereas safari doesn t like this at all and consequently won t render the image

581543
google-chrome	firefox
firefox safari and google-chrome see the first object and use the quicktime plugin if installed to render a control

ip-address	hostname
why not just assign a new ip-address to the server instead of messing around with hostname

581753
entity-relationship	diagram
looking at the actual entity-relationship diagram - the entity-relationship_lp url in the question - the tbl prefix seems a trifle unnecessary

581786
methods	extend
you could extend system.collections.objectmodel.collection and override the insertitem methods to get the behaviour you want and it also implements ilist

581824
any	set
any tips on how to a get this algorithm actually returning the right answer i think i m at least taking a workable approach and b improve the performance as it clearly exceeds the one minute rule set out in the project euler faq

581830
exception-handling	try-catch
no there aren t but why not just put in a try-catch yourself and log the exception-handling when it occurs

581853
solaris	linux
the biggest issues will be with the non-posix non-standard options you ve used to the gnu tools provided on linux that are not in the solaris standard commands

581855
click	mouse
if i use the hwnd of the internet-explorer_server then it works correctly for example when i click with the mouse on other tabs internet-explorer reacts normally

581855
click	mouse
when i click with the mouse on the tab of interest it plays the windows d oh sound and doesn t do anything

581873
value	field
i ve so far been using default value in the class so that a field is never null but is that a good way of doing things

581876
webforms	asp.net
these is my step-by-step guide based on steps we have taken at my company during our move from a classic asp.net webforms to asp.net mvc

581876
webforms	asp.net
planning - moving to mvc from webforms in asp.net requires some careful planning

581880
value	field
instead ie uses the value â utf-8â as an alternative list of encodings for if a field can t be encoded using the usual default encoding which is the same as the page s own encoding

581892
physics-engine	bullet
for a simulation game i would start with experimenting with some physics-engine such as bullet

581896
freebsd	linux
it may not be a bad first step to deploy into a lx branded zone think freebsd jails or linux vserver for a comparison as the lx branded zones can run linux binaries and are explicitly centos rhel based

581932
boost	stl
boost interprocess takes care of that part and you can use stl containers like trees lists etc

581945
selected	listbox
i m displaying a listbox on the left with all available items and a listbox on the right with currently selected items

581945
selected	listbox
easiest would be to delete all the currently selected items and reinsert the items from the selected items listbox

581957
show	next
my problem is i cannot work out how to show the next match dependent on what the current date is so for example for now i want the site to show all the games that will happen over the weeken of the 25th april 2009 and then once that has gone the fixtures for the next weekend

581960
arguments	default
the constructor can set these invariants either by having compulsory arguments or by setting default value

581962
firebird	oracle
i m a long time firebird user and it has a feature called generators i think oracle also has it and it s called sequences

581965
subclassing	base-class
c++-cli differs from most other .net languages in that it s event sugar allows subclassing to raise events declared on the base-class

582007
versioning	upgrade
for example your wxs files specify the product and its contents which files you install whereas you would use your wxi files to specify product versioning upgrade codes common paths etc

582016
if-statement	loops
common solutions are to loops through and put a comma after each item then remove the last character or to have an if-statement to check if you at the begining or end of the list

582021
execl	fork
if you roll your own system using fork and execl you won t get that

582025
instances	private
lambda expression which don t capture any variabless including this are cached in a private static variables so that only one instances of the delegate is ever created

582030
lwjgl	jogl
jogl and lwjgl both seem to provide access to a tinting mechanic

582030
lwjgl	jogl
i found this spaces invaders tutorial useful as its a nice rosetta stone between java2d and jogl lwjgl

582065
put	get
so if you put 5 objects in and your templates on the read take matches all 5 it is unspecified which one you will get

582070
put	get
we had a defect where objects being put into a remote cache would get overwrite because of this

582108
json	xml
here is a minimalist example in python...parsing the xml json and summing the counts is left as an exercise for the reader

582111
touch	drag
on the touch up action click on the circle button and drag a connector to the object representing the class where you put the buttonpressed methods

582119
contains	any
i am a bit short of time but if you look on the .net for any tutorial that contains the words regex and lookbehind you will find good stuff if a regex tutorial covers look ahead behind it will usually be pretty complete and advanced

582126
firefox	safari
it s a nightmare to get it to work properly on mac safari and mac firefox thanks liveconnect

582126
selected	button
it s a pain to click n-times the browse button when you want to selected multiple files in a folder

582157
document	element
custom namespaces are perfectly well-formed in xml but â validâ has the specific meaning that every element and attributes used is declared in the document s schema

582157
any	set
some of these â my-languagesâ are well-known like â xhtml+mathml+svgâ but it s still not xhtml as such and if your client is dead set on â œvalid xhtmlâ you can t use any of them

582186
png	gif
try png jpg or jpg2000 which can be lossless or gif

582187
vb.net	vb6
i have some vb6 code that i am converting to vb.net and came across this section

582195
ms-dos	dos
in ms-dos 5 1991-1994 temp sometimes pointed to c dos so removing all files in temp would cause great problems to say the least

582197
required	checked
another consideration if a field is required or has a limited range perform the checked in the constructor

582205
.net	wcf
there are some great examples on the .net for both scenerios but if decide on the wcf solution here are some of the resources

582210
linked-list	nodes
instead of the .removeallnodessafter nodes method i would opt to make a .splitafter nodes method that returned a new linked-list starting with the next nodes after nodes

582219
spaces	output
you ned to create spaces in the output to hold the results

582233
javascript	dom
i suppose i could use javascript to move the drop-down div to another part of the dom but i d rather not do that if i can avoid it

582250
constructor	object
a question i have been thinking about for a while - would stackoverflow users commonly implement significant functionality in a constructor specifically in classes derived from the system.web.ui.page class or should we keep the logic here as simple as possible and instead implement functionality in onpreinit using the constructor to simply instantiate object values that are required for the functionality in the rest of the page to function

582257
directory	folder
hence i wanted to deny access to that folder or move it to a directory that is not served as content by the webserver

582263
value	field
if you could rig up a clever way to have a randomized field name autocomplete wouldn t be able to pull any previously entered value for the field

582281
python	php
if you wanted to get store information server-side though you can certainly make an ajax call to a php asp python etc

582287
object-reference	instances
i get an object-reference not set to an instances of an object

582315
nested	order
i am designing a threaded message display for a php mysql application - like comments on slashdot or youtube - and am wondering how i should go about order the comments and separating it into pages so that you can have say 20 comments to a page but still have them nested

582315
contains	any
comments in my app can be nested unlimited levels and this structure is represented using what i believe is an adjacency relation table a separate table contains a row for each pair that has any ascendent descendent relationship

582349
sftp	ftp
it is serverless - you do not need a daemon installed on the server hosting the repository even if you are accessing it remotely ie it can work just as an ftp sftp share

582366
vb.net	vb6
vb6 as any in vb.net

582388
populate	row
the other way i was thinking of doing this was having a row in the products table correspond to the regular product entity single and then have the related table with other package levels for that product and on the user-interface which i haven t given any thought to yet as i m trying to architect a proper data model do an auto suggest type of deal where if you type acm1234 it will display that along with the bx and ct variants and you can choose the one you want and get the appropriate values populate by it

582404
value	field
threads to show all threads here a couple of threads has exception-handling field value with various exception-handling-handling

582423
contains	elements
some of these elements contains a lot of data to be passed as arguments to subreport

582423
export	report
the problem is when i export the report to excel it wont open in excel because of the cell max character limit

582423
export	report
i am wondering if its possible to disable remove certain columns from this report when export to excel

582434
sbcl	ecl
linux - use sbcl or ecl or abcl or cmucl

582434
sbcl	ccl
mac - ccl or ecl or sbcl

582434
sbcl	ecl
other - abcl or ecl or sbcl

582446
any	set
imo it ll be best to have a set of raster tiff to use as a benchmark a raster comparison tool and then you can fire anytime using any printer and run a diff

582447
libxml2	libxslt
i uninstalled libxml2 and libxslt and am re-installing them fresh so we ll see what happens

582448
javascript	dom
all of the popular javascript libraries have a dom loaded event you can use for this

582449
python	ruby
not that there is anything wrong with ruby i just wanted to use this project as a good way to teach myself python

582453
http	ssl
for development - there are ways to generate an ssl certificate locally so that tests with http can be done in an environment that you have total control over

582457
.net	wcf
if you ve previously done things with .net remoting or web services then wcf is definitely the way to go for the future

582462
command-line	cmd
however after giving it unlimited power it still won t execute svn cmd unless i call it from the command-line

582462
wamp	php
to clarify my question how can i execute svn from php through wamp

582481
typedef	struct
what if the conversion was to a custom struct and what about typedef

582485
any	set
at least when the mouse event handling is a responsibility of the holepattern to set it on up each hole the ellipse that is the visual of the hole it is abstracted away so that any consumer of my holepattern will get this functioanality automactically

582485
gridview	listview
the point is i have designed a way to create a margin of error when picking something on a canvas with a mouse and then reading the hole that the selected ellipse belongs to and then i can read the holepattern that the hole belongs to and my entire ui listview textboxes gridview fo coordinates are all updated by the existing xaml binding and the canvas is updated with one call to an existing method to regenerate the canvas

582486
google-chrome	firefox
i have already run into problems with old javascript code which i thought was standards compliant by firefox or opera standards - which are pretty good but google-chrome was even more picky

582491
any	set
are there any built-in ways to make the menu drop left from the dropdown button or do i have to set the menu s positioning by hand and manually show hide

582497
singleton	facade
the devicemanager is a singleton that functions as a facade for other classes

582519
contains	any
it does not contains any import of java.util.logging.logger there

582523
selected	button
they should be positioned on a grid but a user should be able to drag them somewhere else after releasing the mouse button or the finger in case of an iphone the selected uicontrol should snap back to the next position in the grid

582545
versioning	upgrade
despite the fact that i d already upgrade libxml to the appropriate versioning which has been a problem i ve had to address previously when installing postgresql it was not working with libxslt

582557
children	nodes
i know i can use logicaltreehelper class to find children nodes for every element searching it by name

582570
subtract	time
the minutes methods returns an integer i believe and subtract time object yields another time object

582585
orientation-changes	portrait
if your main concern is accidental orientation-changes mid-activity that you think the device s sensors and software won t cope with well for example in a tilt-based game consider supporting landscape and portrait but using nosensor for the orientation

582585
portrait	tablet
this forces landscape on most tablet and portrait on most phones but i still wouldn t recommend this for most normal apps some users just like to type in the landscape soft-keyboard on their phones and many tablet users read in portrait - and you should let them

582585
portrait	tablet
this allows for upside-down portrait which is quite common in tablet usage

582604
minimum	max
i want the columns of my html table to be the max of a certain percentage of the screen or a minimum number of pixels so if the user has a 1024x768 display the table columns won t be all scrunched up and may require some scrolling and if a user has a 1920x1600 screen they can get more information

582613
any	set
i will be happy to learn any reasons others have to explicitly set the ref to null

582631
directory	folder
i do have django in this directory but it simply isn t getting executed i have _ init _.py in all my directories under the tech folder and this is a copy from my own personal computer which ran off of the django test server so i don t think that s the problem

582648
instrumentation	debugging
instrumentation helps you debugging leaks though not all of them - it s not really that useful for crashes

582665
32-bit	64bit
the 64bit c++ application unmanaged is started by a 32-bit .net application and crashes immediately afterwards with an access violation error

582697
debugging	trace
after watching only your debugging trace i ve just come out with two possible problems

582746
communication	messages
let me add in this bit - i have kids decompiling my games and changing editing the messages sent back and forth through tools that manipulate the http communication - and this is just for games that have no outside value

582751
decrement	increment
can t you just carry a tls variables around with you called depth and increment it decrement it every function

582781
compare-and-swap	atomicity
you might be able to turn the loop inside out using compare-and-swap to get an atomicity lock free increment

582788
postgresql	mysql
usually i say to hell with dbms independence and do it with sequences in postgresql or autoincrement columns in mysql

582812
constructor	object
and if you can t using constructor parms you should use a builder object to create one only releasing the object from the builder when the object is complete

582812
constructor	private
if this is not possible then i try to have an private init method that all constructor defer to

582823
google-chrome	safari
for some reason safari runs a combo of border-radius with box-shadow just fine but google-chrome doesn t render the combination correctly

582824
firefox	opera
just remove the overflow auto part and close the inner div correctly with a closing tag that way it works in ie6 ie7 firefox 3 and opera probably all browsers

582841
debugging	trace
otherwise you typically need to build your project with debugging information debug symbols enabled which isn t recommended for production as it makes your program bigger and easier to reverse engineer and debugger commands like where or trace will list the program lines you re at

582861
compact-framework	.net
although this article is not about the compact-framework it s about the micro version it shows a comparison between the micro and compact-frameworks noting that the .net compact-framework has a memory footprint of 12 mb

582862
compact-framework	.net
the .net compact-framework uses available ram up to a limit specified by the device to cache generated code and data structures and then frees the memory when appropriate

582868
png	gif
it basically creates gif like substance for ie6 and a real png with alpha transparency for better browsers

582886
function-call	inline
as a bonus a lot of templates code can be easily inline to eliminate even the most basic function-call overhead

582896
windows-server	windows
the machine is running windows-server 2003 with the .net installed in the default directory c windows microsoft.net v2.0.50727

582898
base-class	inherited
one thing to keep in mind is that you don t necessarily have to use anything in a base-class if you go the inherited route

582907
composite	visitor
visitor is always fun for examining nodes within a composite object

582922
command-line	cmd
but help from the command-line on cmd if for set and call covers much of avaialble syntax

582932
function-call	inline
by using for example an alternative to the usual function-call mechanism such as â â inline substitutionâ â

582946
getter	setter
inline can be used for small and frequently used functions such as getter or setter methods

582955
llvm	gcc
there s been talk about adding support for link-time optimizations to gcc for quite some time especially since llvm came along

582977
opensolaris	linux
for example your choice of operating systems includes numerous linux distributions microsoft windows server and opensolaris

582987
triggers	insert
i have two triggers after insert or update and instead of insert

582987
triggers	insert
i have verified the correct operation of z_updatestagetable stored procedure and the instead of insert triggers

582987
triggers	insert
removing the instead of insert triggers doesn t have any affect

582987
triggers	insert
the after insert update triggers was working correctly at one time i haven t made any changes to it

583002
compact-framework	.net
for comparison the next smallest .net implementation the .net compact-framework running on windows ce needs about 12 mb

583002
i2c	spi
supports common embedded peripherals and interconnects including flash-memory eeprom gpio i2c spi usb

583004
directory	folder
as well i have found that you can create sub folder in the views directory when you return view you simply supply the path as a parameter

583004
directory	folder
all i need now is to figure out how to add sub folder in the controllers directory

583012
rewrite	rule
you can let the server append the slash you need automatically by defining a rewrite rule

583018
triggers	insert
why do you have 2 insert triggers 1 instead 1 after on this table

583032
triggers	insert
you can add print statements to the triggers and manually insert from managementstudio enterprise manager to see where the triggers fails

583041
any	set
my vista s uac is off and i did not set any privileges for those services i described

583045
versioning	upgrade
you have to upgrade to the newest versioning of the blog module and then under module options for the blog you can check enable social bookmarks

583055
round-robin	jobs
as your j jobs seem to be having equals priority may be you are looking at round-robin - time sliced scheduling algorithm

583075
launchd	daemons
what s supposed to happen is that this will launchd the server daemons mongrel and i ll see the output scrolling by every time i look at that tab

583085
directory	folder
i added a sub folder in my controllers directory and called it subfolder

583096
push	pull
so ignore what you found in googling about push and pull and merge -- there s a lot of nearly right discussion by people who act as if push and pull and merge are the same in git and svn

583111
filtering	grouping
you could create a sub report for each grouping - each sub-report would select the same records except filtering them to show only the particular grouping

583116
jquery	.post
i have seen this .post jquery ajax with asp.net webmethod returning entire page which had my same symptoms but i am still having a problem

583120
function-call	inline
inline is effective in one case-when you ve got a performance problem ran your profiling with real data and found the function-call overhead for some small functions to be significant

583121
firefox	safari
we have developed the application against the two most popular standards compliant browsers - firefox 3 and safari 3 then made necessary fixes for ie 7

583121
firefox	safari
firefox 3 safari 3 ie 7 will cover 85 of our target audience -- according to urchin stats during a brief adwords campaign

583127
calloc	malloc
it is unlikely that the dll is using a client supplied buffer as both client and server would need to know the base address of that buffer and you can t ask calloc or malloc for a preferred address at call time

583138
value	field
since the action_date never really gets set to null then the value in the datetime field reverts to 01 01 1900 12 00 00am and that s a pain in itself

583147
firefox	safari
if you ve developed and tested against the latest versions of firefox and safari you re going to get a lot of other browsers for free i d say

583152
selected	button
if by does not work you mean that the text is wrong as far as i know you can only selected from the set of predefined button types that the api provides

583152
any	set
i don t know of any way to directly set that text

583159
webforms	asp.net
i m writing a custom control in asp.net 3.5 webforms using asp.net ajax

583163
inlining	inline
personally i don t think you should ever inline unless you have first run a profiling on your code and have proven that there is a significant bottleneck on that routine that can be partially alleviated by inlining

583228
slidedown	slideup
instead of slideup slidedown you ll want to use animate

583248
order	add
you could perform selective queries in order of the most common efficient indexed etc parameters and add pk s to a temporary table

583255
scheme	ada
admittedly part of the reason i like this style probably has to do with all the years i spent coding modula-2 and ada both of which have a similar scheme with specification files and body files

583258
directory	folder
other files folder to avoid checking are the obj directory and the ncb file

583269
operators	keyword
the explicit keyword will make sure that the constructor will not be used as an implicit conversion operators - you have to call it explicitly when you want to use it

583271
boost-asio	boost
for example how to reduce compilation times with boost-asio which is seeing a 14s compile of a single 1k file with boost included

583271
header-only	boost
as a final point when using boost as an example of header-only code a huge detail often gets missed

583292
delegation	dealloc
your application delegation should keep ownership of the loginviewcontroller and release it in the app delegation s dealloc methods or when you re done with your login and have moved on to another view

583323
bazaar	git
or alternatively move to a dvcs like git or bazaar or .

583329
single-sign-on	security
how did i turn sso on there are for sure multiple options this is how to enable ltpa-based sso with basic settings was 6 go to admin console - security - global security - select ltpa as authentication mechanism - apply then security - global security - authentication mechanisms - ltpa - single-sign-on - enabled - apply then save all and restart

583331
versioning	migrate
is there any easy way of migrate files versioning from sourcegear-vault to tfs

583337
gnome	kde
i m not sure what the term service menu means in kde land but if you want to add to the context menu of gnome s file-manager nautilus then this link maybe what you are looking for

583359
boost	stl
if it s good enough for boost and the stl it s good enough for us

583367
reliability	scalability
i could chuck in scalability performance latency reliability the list of ilities goes on but without knowing what it is you re setting out to assess you may be wasting your time and your client s time

583368
wavefront	.obj
bill dudney has posted source code for a wavefront .obj modeler on the iphone that may help in that regard

583377
carbon	cocoa
we primarily use the xcode ide for building cocoa carbon applications

583404
subtraction	time
why waste time with subtraction or ternary statements

583405
attributes	properties
if you wish you could also change the way your class model references the foreign attributes with properties

583409
perl	php
and it lists known perl php pear and coldfusion libraries

583418
sql-server	oracle
i have transparently developed a schema on sqlite then implemented it on ms sql-server and later ported to oracle

583450
variables	boolean
that is the code i want to be able to parsing through it and find certain rows that have a certain boolean set to 1 and then edit other variables in that row accordingly how would i do this i tried making a for each row nested in a for each table but when i tested it the repeater never populates with data.

583473
arrays	loops
how can i convert the following xmllist to an arrays of strings without using a loops

583486
markup	xhtml
also for textual markup xml s traditional forte like xhtml docbook xml is better

583486
json	xml
in fact i would suggest considering json instead it is based on object or struct since there s no behavior model rather than hierarchic xml or relational sql models

583496
python	ruby
we all know ruby or python is just flipping ones and zeroes but we don t have to think of it that way

583514
json	xml
one more possibility jettison can expose json via xml parsing interface stax xmlstreamreader which allows integration with systems that only understand xml

583514
json	xml
but the question itself is bit vague while you can always convert from one to the othe it is a very trivial thing to do really xml and json are not equivalent there is no one-to-one lossless generic mapping

583527
json	xml
frontend sends requests to a controller and receives back json xml ... responses

583530
python	java
i can t qualify myself fully under that handle but i did spend a while writing some an interesting python mini-game after having spent many years writing java

583540
gridview	listview
do i use the listview 3.5 html table gridview repeater etc

583563
arrays	map
also you could consider using one of other parsers from json.org s list most of them allow your json objects and arrays to map natively to java.util.maps and java.util.lists

583563
boolean	int
which allows for mapping to list map int string boolean null as well as to real beans pojos

583566
required	checked
in order to work with the asp.net web-config settings that allow anonymous access or required a user to be signed in you need to create a module that hooks httpapplication.endrequest and checked for http error 401 this means authentication is needed

583580
vb.net	vb6
i have this bit of code that is being converted from vb6 to vb.net

583584
constructor	object
you wouldn t be able to use arrays of abstract classes or interfaces or any object which doesn t have a default constructor

583606
web-services	api
i can find lots of examples for doing this using the object model api but i can t seem to find a straightforward way of doing this using web-services

583615
put	get
once i get it into text then i m going to use a program i m writing to parsing it and put the data into a database

583629
show	next
this means the signatures while they show up on result.pdf have an icon next to them that state invalid signature.

583640
textbox	button
your itemtemplate would have your textbox s and optional a save button per row

583651
python	ruby
wonderful script flavor.cause you can use the scala console or even write scripts just like ruby or python

583651
scala	java
you feel in home cause you don t need to change you environment or rewrite existing applications to migrate to scala talking about java

583651
scala	java
if you come from java you can start playing with scala after reading some articles

583654
constructor	object
if i manage to get to msdn i have to wade through a page describing every .net technology to see how their syntax references the same object and then i have to find the appropriate page from there class name constructor for example

583660
member-functions	inline
often i ll put trivial member-functions into the header file to allow them to be inline

583661
subclassing	base-class
if this is really the case then what you have here is subclassing of a common base-class something that can be modeled in a db pretty easy and handled elegantly with nhibernate for instances

583661
subclassing	base-class
the broadcast base-class has common methodss that both subclassing use like the getcommand methods which returns a specific command-line arguments to launch a vlc process

583661
implements	abstract
subclasses have to override and implements that methods because it s abstract

583661
contains	any
any logic that is common to both is contains in the superclass broadcast

583668
perl	php
i don t know php so i ll pseudocode it in perl

583668
if-statement	loops
the if-statement inside the loops unnecessarily clutters the loops logic

583684
cos	sin
when doing some heavy number crunching and you want to avoid wasting cycles on computing sin cos you replace sin cos with a lut

583684
cos	sin
and any floating point operations like sin cos killed my performance

583689
key-value	key
so that for every key-value pair there d be a name and a dropdown list that would house each key s value

583701
transfer-encoding	chunked
firebug reveals that transfer-encoding is chunked and content-type is application x-www-form-urlencoded

583705
rewrite	rule
i do have the rewrite engine up and running because i have another rewrite rule currently running

583742
execute	prepare
db- prepare allows you to replace patterns on php.net the example is putting a colon in front of the field name using bindparam or an arrays on the pdostatement- execute

583742
value	field
from examples 3 and 4 instead of naming the field value

583781
boolean	int
for example if you have int 1 field in db representing boolean state and use checkbox in html that results in empty string or on in _post or _get arrays you cannot just assign one into another

583782
reverse-proxy	stunnel
found a workaround using stunnel reverse-proxy

583785
command-line	cmd
this behavior is by design and is intended to ensure that any cmd line tool you elevate is not affected by any path modifications in the non-elevated cmd-line

583799
sql-server	mysql
linq to sql is for sql-server only but there are third-party linq providers for mysql - here s one that looks promising although i haven t used it myself

583802
python	ruby
this holds true for both python and ruby code

583804
vbscript	jscript
on the other hand if you already have all the required functionality available in the web app running on the server then you could probably set up a scheduled task that starts a script vbscript jscript which in turn calls a page of the web app

583811
union-all	union
i d say you need to add union-all io just union to make this query work

583820
perl	awk
the available tools are bash awk sed some old version of perl ruby not 1.9 and python 2.5

583840
keyvaluepair	key
the individual dictionary items that you re binding to are keyvaluepair foo list bar which has a key property and a value property to access the foo and list bar respectively

583840
user-controls	itemtemplate
if you ve got a lot going on in your itemtemplate then it can be useful to move the contents out into a user-controls

583851
entity-framework	ado.net
can someone please outline the process of building a sql-server reporting services 2008 report based on a ado.net entity-framework entity data model

583852
put	get
objects are stored as key value object object pairs so the interface would be a bit like hashtable get put

583857
authentication	login
the snippet django snippets require login across entire site suggests how to do site-wide authentication but i expect it will lose the get component of the string namely because request.path does not include it and definitely lose the post data

583866
ruby	php
i am now working in ruby php and actionscript the least dynamic of the three instead of languages that i would prefer like java and c#

583887
value	field
and see if the field even has a value

583896
linked-list	tree
can you build a faster fundamental datastructure linked-list hashtable set skiplist bloom filter red-black tree etc. on a multicore machine by taking advantage of the fact that you ve got more than one cpu

583900
object-reference	instances
this one throws exception-handling at the foreach loop - object-reference not set to an instances of an object

583903
internet-explorer	firefox
watin is developed in c# and aims to bring you an easy way to automate your tests with internet-explorer and firefox using .net.

583906
any	set
is there any way to set a widget s opacity in pygtk

583913
put	get
if you keep this updated whenever someone does put or get you can efficiently track access order and use order

583927
children	tree
override visualchildrencount to return the number of children in the adorner visual tree

583934
jquery-plugins	jquery
there are a few really nice looking jquery ones here jquery-plugins #22 and #23 which would definitely be worth a look

583953
command-line	cmd
as a last resort you can use the windows taskkill cmd to nuke the process from a cmd-line or a scheduled task

583968
compact-framework	.net
is there some standard way to do this or pattern for implementing it in .net compact-framework

583969
double	int
cvvideowriter_ffmpeg open char const int double cvsize bool in cvcap_ffmpeg.o

583969
double	int
cvvideowriter_ffmpeg open char const int double cvsize bool in cvcap_ffmpeg.o

583986
for-loop	loops
when the loops is broken the for-loops prints out all of the li s

584014
callback	methods
the methods i was thinking of was for callback paging sorting

584018
haskell	erlang
less sharing that s what erlang haskell languages emphasize

584018
communication	messages
making it easy and inexpensive to transfer small messages inter-thread communication looks more like function-calls with parameters and less than shared-memory

584042
external	embed
when i write stuff for example a variables or arrays in an external javascript file and embed it with vstudio 2008 intellisense does not show any of the variabless .

584050
iprincipal	iidentity
i m using a custom iprincipal and iidentity to do asp.net authentication

584055
compact-framework	.net
most of the members of the tcpclient class class in system.net.sockets namespace are implemented in the .net compact-framework

584079
dictionary	arrays
if you re implementing an algorithm that uses associative arrays think .net dictionary you re almost always going to duplicate some work somewhere between threads

584087
quirks-mode	doctype
stick at the top to use the nice and compact html5 doctype which will prevent browsers from going into quirks-mode

584128
udp	tcp
udp has a much lower overhead than tcp

584129
udp	tcp
originally nfs was probably used on low latency networks where there was very little possibility of error so the overhead of initiating the 3-way handshake to set up the tcp connection together with the bi-directional acknowledgement of all messages outweighed the simplicity of using a connectionless protocol like udp

584131
udp	tcp
udp is the default for nfsv2 which nobody should really use these days but nfsv3 use tcp by default

584131
udp	tcp
tcp mounts are more reliable and you know you have a network problem much faster than with udp

584137
having	select
i m having an issue trying to not select a tablerow with the function

584137
populate	row
basically it finds all tablerow and adds click functionality that will open a edit modal that has a row with textbox that are populate with info from the tablecells

584170
selected	textbox
when other is selected the dropdown has triggered the partial postback and renders the update panel with the additional other textbox for the amount

584170
textbox	button
outside this update panel i have a additional server control form fields such as textbox and a button for submission

584170
selected	button
the bug i run into is when other is selected the button onclick event fails to fire a full postback

584187
nstextview	appkit
on os x appkit drawing is clipped to the dirty areas of the nstextview as of 10.3

584191
wpf-controls	tabcontrol
i am creating a user-interface in which a tabcontrol has a series of standard tabitem s with ordinary wpf-controls as their content

584191
user-controls	tabcontrol
specifically the tabcontrol is bound to an arrays of user-controls s except for the last object which is a button

584198
pdfbox	itext
start with pdfbox as it s text extraction abilities are better than itext s

584225
pdfbox	itext
we have found many examples of pdfs that pdftotext cannot extract from but java libraries such as itext and pdfbox can

584240
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
question assuming all the target users have excel or openoffice.org or can be told to get a copy has anyone out there tried using a spreadsheet as an input form for a live web application

584248
itemscontrol	tabcontrol
i m new to wpf xaml and the insight i just had is that in the case of an itemscontrol like tabcontrol a datatemplate lays out the content of each item but says nothing about the overall layout of the item itself which is managed by its controltemplate

584253
postback	ajax
ajax causes some funky behavior with postback session etc

584274
http	ssl
then append ssl to any link in the webpage for which you want to force https and nossl to any link for which you want to force regular http

584275
json	xml
for reference the prototype included implementing crud functionality the x-http-method-override header custom translation of any errors into a standard error block support for both xml and json as both input and output formats authentication and authorization of the caller and dependency injection of any internal services into the outward-facing services

584275
asp.net-mvc	wcf
so my personal recommendation and the one my company has gone with on the basis of my research is to steer well clear of wcf for restful services and go with asp.net-mvc

584276
debugging	trace
realistically that s a far greater risk to your production site than accidentally enabling trace or debugging compilation

584285
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is that ie6 supports hover psuedo-class only for anchor elements and ie7 does support it for all elements as firefox google-chrome etc

584287
ip-address	proxy
if you have a large pool of proxy you can use then i suppose you could switch between them but otherwise no you generally can t just renew your ip-address whenever you feel like it

584289
version-control	git
using git for personal version-control makes it completely non conflicting as far as i have noticed with the tortoisesvn foundation services or any other version-control you can think of

584289
rollback	commit
it works wonders for me just yesterday i did a new application from home got this morning to work and its here because of the syncing independently i can commit rollback diff at any time with git from any machine not having to worry about the server service from other machines

584296
unpivot	pivot
now i use pivot unpivot

584317
coding-style	indentation
fxcop tends to focus more on design rules and stylecop is focusing on coding-style casing white space indentation etc

584326
host	dns
i run a bind server on freebsd as well as host domains and dns at godaddy

584330
search-engine	seo
for better seo search-engine optimisation put the page name before the site name

584333
asp.net-mvc	wcf
i would second greg s advice to favour asp.net-mvc over the wcf rest starter kit

584338
perl	php
i m talking your good friends php python perl ruby those fullas

584342
macros	vba
i want to add bookmarks to all section number header locations using a macros or a vba script

584342
macros	vba
my question is what approach with a vba script or a macros would i need to take that would make this happen

584346
arrays	loops
which we can unroll into a pseudo basic using only size n arrayss of integers and booleans and the operations of 1 arrays indexing and indexed arrays assignment 2 integer math including comparison 3 if then else and 4 one single loops of o n

584358
spring	seam
finally i know that there are a couple of frameworks spring webflow springs to mind that will save your request state let you do the login and redirect you back to where you were going in the first place pretty seamlessly which reminds me i think seam can do this too

584370
google-chrome	firefox
however the browser google-chrome and ie - not tested on firefox yet only refreshes at the end of the function so the color simply changes from black to white

584381
setinterval	settimeout
note setinterval and settimeout execute code on the single same user-interface thread

584388
zipfile	archive
i m looking for a way to add or remove files to from an existing zip archive or any other archive format for that matter as long as there are cross platform apis without having to rewrite a new zipfile with new files added to it or sans items deleted from it

584421
msbuild	nant
vs only allows you to hook into project level build events so if this isn t enough you can use a build scripting msbuild nant etc to build the solution which will give you full controll over what happens before and or after the build

584422
administration	account
once this was changed to be the administration domain account instead the problem was resolved

584423
subclassing	base-class
i use subclassing of this base-class in two different configuration dialogues

584439
pointers	stack
you could be trashing your own stack by accidentally misusing a pointers somewhere else - if you can find a repro machine try running your app under application verifier with all the memory checks turned on

584448
variadic-templates	templates
i expect that compiling templates code will be speed up with having variadic-templates rvalue references

584455
arguments	undefined
the section describing the behaviour of o_creat doesn t say what will happen if you omit the necessary third arguments which means the behaviour is undefined - anything is possible

584475
click	mouse
by adding a mouselistener or alternatively a mouseadapter if you don t need to override all the mouselistener methods to each of your colored boxes when an event such as a mouse click occurs the mouselistenermouseevent 3 which can be used to obtain the component that was clicked

584494
functional-programming	imperative
so for veterans of functional-programming when you program in imperative languages what ideas from fp have you applied successfully

584497
contains	any
using apache derby with java j2me but i don t think that makes a difference is there any way of checking if a database already exists and contains a table

584499
dialog	pop-up
if you post asynchronously your javascript handler could recognize a login required response code and then display a pop-up dialog requesting login

584504
jndi	jmx
a common best-practice is to limit your external dependencies to what is offered by the j2ee dogma the j2ee api use of servlets ejbs jndi jmx jms...

584525
tiff	gif
it support tiff tif animation gif and many more

584526
any	set
you can think of any type as a set along with a collection of operations

584530
numeric	zero
in c the convention is that a null pointers is the numeric value zero

584540
boolean	int
null is a sentinel value that is not an int not a string not a boolean - not anything really except something to hold and be a not there value

584581
mersenne-twister	generator
the mersenne-twister algorithm is a fairly fast pseudo-random number generator that produces quite good results

584589
configuration	environment
i work in an environment where a separate server team performs the configuration of the qa and production servers for our applications

584589
configuration	environment
we have configuration files stored in the war file that are named by environment ex

584591
contains	elements
the methods createemailparametermap returns a map contains the elements and the data to replace them with

584592
buffering	streaming
getbuffering will return the internal buffering used by the memorystreaming and its length generally greater than the length of the data that has been written to the streaming

584592
stream	send
this will avoid you to send garbage at the end of the stream and not mess up some strict image decoder that would not tolerate trailing garbage

584598
httphandler	httpmodule
do you have any httphandler or httpmodule that do any kind of request filtering or re-writing

584599
instances	destroy
should i allocate memory in a separate initialization routine instead and check for failures and then destroy the class instances gracefully

584616
required	checked
so checked which order of transformation you required

584628
click	mouse
control click opens context menu like clicking the right mouse button

584639
fclose	fopen
i am using fopen fseeko64 ftello64 fclose etc

584649
order	add
also if you want to order the results add order by 1 asc on the end

584659
low-level	hardware
i have read or heard that mac os x is written mostly in objective-c with some of the low-level parts such as the kernel and hardware device drivers written in c

584690
lighting	quad
simple stuff like line quad lighting etc

584697
multiplying	transpose
as others have indicated - swapping the order of the multiplication is equivalent to multiplying by the transpose

584715
packets	ping
keep in mind that the latency is going to be at least twice of what you d see for a ping if you end up making a tcp query to measure latency because you ll need the three way handshake and the termination packets at minimum two round trips rather than one

584724
configuration	installation
i would add the suggestion of making the external files relative to the installation path of the war file - that way you can have multiple installations of the war in the one server with different configuration

584724
installation	building
the advantage is that each installation of the application is autonomous and you may have different building of the .war using different versions of the libraries concurrently

584724
installshield	nsis
i would build an automated install for the common libraries in this case using installshield or nsis or equivalent for your operating system

584724
downgrade	upgrade
something that can make it easy to tell if you have the most up to date set of libraries and upgrade downgrade etc

584769
constructor	private
currently the instance of the private field is created in the constructor

584792
constructor	object
sub-class your class in a unit test and supersede your private variables with a mock object in it by adding a public setter or in the constructor

584799
oncreate	recreate
when you switching orientation the activity is recreate and oncreate is recalled so you have to use the bundle to save your current state and restore after an orientation change

584807
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
if you instantiate a uinavigationcontroller with the initwithrootviewcontroller initializer you can pass it your first uiviewcontroller

584807
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
the uinavigationcontroller will automatically set up the uinavigationbar and back button you are looking for

584814
value	field
you will probably end up changing a lot of the text selected field to hidden field with pre-set value to keep it simple for end-users

584814
value	field
the server handling the request won t know the kind of field it came from just the value and name

584822
implements	super
if you are simply trying to design a super small language that can be implements in the course of a single semester then the story is different

584829
methods	extend
we ll extend this class and override the findasset methods so that we can wrap the created assets with the wrapper class

584838
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
aside from obfuscation it is almost worthless even microsoft scottgu etc basically say that people with the right amount of intent and ability will reverse engineer an application and in .net a basic defense is licensing and ip instead of trying to guard your code through obscurity or some other means of preventing reverse-engineering

584855
keyboard	mouse
is the a programmatic way or something more simple to map some keyboard key to the same action windows-wide as the left mouse button in windows-xp vista

584868
filehandle	stdin
i want to reopen the stdin and stdout and perhaps stderr while i m at it filehandle so that future calls to printf or putchar or puts will go to a file and future calls to getc and such will come from a file

584871
subclassing	inherited
i presently only have two subclassing types circularholepattern and singlelineholepattern that inherited from holepattern but i expect to have more as my app grows

584882
machine-code	disassembly
so to reverse engineer your algorithm get the machine-code and run standard disassembly tools on it

584887
setinterval	settimeout
using settimeout or setinterval as proposed by some of the others here works around this by returning flow control to the browser and requesting it to call you back in a specified number of milliseconds

584890
pagespeed	yslow
in my testing so far google s pagespeed addon is far and above much better than yslow

584890
yslow	cdn
it gives much more detailed analysis and smarter advice rather than recommending a cdn for small websites like yslow

584892
show	next
the first view is to let users input name and password the second view will show his information to let him confirm and the third view will show him a list of options so he can choose what to do next

584903
value	field
for instance if the user is typing a value in a field on my document and then click to the preview windows or chooses print or save from the menu

584904
traversal	parent
i can find all the children of a given record in a hierarchical data model see code below but i m not sure how to traversal back up the parent child chain with a given child id

584910
constructor	object
the canonical object-oriented way however is to use constructor and prototypes but this isn t really dynamic in that each object you construct will have the same methods

584917
abstract-class	subclassing
unfortunately microsoft neglected to make many of the bcl objects easily mockable as they tend to use abstract-class and .net classes are closed by design in other words for a methods to be overridden by a subclassing it needs to be explicitly marked as virtual whereas java is open by design that is a subclassing can override any methods unless they are marked as final

584917
typemock	moq
typemock isolator may be able to help but i don t believe moq can in this case

584930
file-descriptor	stdin
more specifically you can dup2 the stdin file-descriptor to another file-descriptor do other stuff with stdin and then copy it back when you want

584943
freopen	stdin
i d encourage you to stick to situations where you re willing to abandon old stdin and stdout and can therefore use freopen

584946
bmp	png
iecapt is a small command-line utility to capture internet-explorer s rendering of a web page into a bmp jpeg or png image file

584950
subtract	add
generally mod 100 then if 50 add else subtract

584957
put	get
if your code is that sensitive put it where nobody can get to it

584970
implements	extends
as an example of explicit use i recently implements bentley and sedgewick s ternary-search-tree in haskell and i needed to extends the character type with one additional value meaning not a character

584974
temporary	rvalue
the lifetime of the temporary object also known as an rvalue is tied to the expression and the destructor for the temporary object is called at the end of the full expression and when the destructor on stringbuffer is called the destructor on m_buffer will also be called but not the destructor on m_str since it is a reference

584974
temporary	rvalue
the pedagogical example for moving rvalue s is temporary strings and i ll show assignment in a constructor

584985
json	xml
what are the advantages and disadvantages of json vs xml for ajax requests

584987
debugging	exit
now while doing editing and testing via debugging mode i found that when i exit a lot of weird crash will happen sometimes

584992
json	xml
you may want to read json the fat-free alternative to xml

585012
json	xml
in summary json which can be thought of a subset of javascript is a lot leaner than xml

585012
json	xml
json is smaller than corresponding xml

585013
json	xml
json smaller can represent all unicode characters xml can t in utf8 at the least by its own spec

585013
jsonp	ajax
its also trivial to make use of it in ajax applications because of javascript s eval function especially more advanced features like jsonp responses invoke callbacks

585022
json	xml
you have in this article the ajax response xml html or json

585022
json	xml
a secondary advantage is that scripts for json data are slightly simpler and slightly more in line with the rest of the javascript language than scripts for xml data

585022
json	xml
while this is also true of xml json s welter of complicated-looking syntax like the at the end of the data snippet may frighten the newbies and make for complicated debugging

585022
json	xml
from the comments json is considered faster to process than xml

585025
handler	service
most ajax scenarios i ve seen really should call a web service or separate script handler not a page

585047
appdata	temp
type b originates from horn.core.dsl.domain versioning 1.0.0.0 culture neutral publickeytoken null in the context default at location c users paul.cowan appdata local temp 1vt2usw2.rxf horn.dsl.specificatioin assembly dl3 1d5ed945 7c19e429_1a97c901 horn.core.dsl.domain.dll

585053
functional-programming	imperative-programming
while it s true that you can mimic the behavior of functional-programming with imperative-programming you re never gonna get that tidy syntax which you ll wanna have for lambda calculus

585053
haskell	erlang
i suggest you look at pure functional programming languages such as haskell or erlang

585089
json	xml
to reformulate yoru example a get images 23 votes would return in xml but you can reformulate it in json

585090
oracle	mysql
i m new to oracle and having a problem with one of mysql queries

585091
xcopy	cmd
is it possible to use xcopy to copy files from several directories into one directory using only one xcopy cmd

585091
directory	folder
i want to copy all .xml files from the directory root source including sub folder to root destination

585101
.when	ready
i thought the jquery ready function would run after the document html was fully loaded so why does it appear that the radio-button isn t checked .when read runs but is checked later .when i do the hover

585107
fwrite	fread
im programming win32 using fopen fread fwrite in c

585124
variables	boolean
depending on your architecture the flag can be anything from a boolean variables in your code a special entry somewhere in your database to a temporary file

585140
any	set
these cas are entities that have a set of cryptography keys that can be used to sign any certificate often for a fee

585148
safari	opera
not sure about safari or opera

585149
windows-server	windows
i have a c# windows service running on the .net 3.5 that is exhibiting a constantly growing number of gc handles seen using system monitor on windows-server 2003

585153
value	field
you may also get the value of the field by using

585188
double-quotes	spaces
should surround f with double-quotes otherwise it will fail copying file names with spaces

585214
compatibility	platform
if your contract implies that binary and source compatibility is to be maintained for say 5 years a short period of time for os platform apis then you have little choice but to go with an entirely new interface adding methodss to an interface will break code implementing it either at compile at type validation or at methods invocation depending on the strictness of the type loader

585267
void	main
you can put this in you static void main methods

585270
value	field
i am now considering keeping the validation data either in the database or in a yaml file and then performing the validations manually for each field based upon the minimum maximum format value stored externally from the model

585271
ssl-certificate	ssl
when you connect to a webserver using ssl the server will send you its ssl-certificate including the public key and other meta data all of which is signed by the ca

585303
user-controls	treeview
i m not really sure how am i suppose to bind the treeview inside my user-controls with a property of an object which is a datasource of the containing formview.

585313
decrement	increment
if you want to be able to nest them keep a counter instead increment in the constructor decrement in the dispose call

585351
windows-server	windows
if the component is not installed either 1 install the windows sdk for windows-server 2008 and .net 3.5 or 2 install microsoft visual-studio 2008

585367
wlan	lan
how can i detect if the communication is done through wlan or wired lan

585367
wan	vpn
the next step is to determine if the access is over a wan vpn connection but the primary question is the first one

585371
for-loop	loops
for example if i read usr share dict words with a for-loops and a while loops and have them sleep when they re done i can use ps to see how much memory the process is consuming

585376
progress-bar	progress
this bean should kick of your long running background task and provide information about it if it is running and maybe stuff like when did it start who started it and if you could the progress so you could display a progress-bar as well

585415
difference	count
then you just need to take the normal difference removing weekends and subtract the count of items between the results of the binary searches

585418
variables	boolean
there can be dozens of variables configurable different types boolean integer float at least maybe string

585442
bamboo	hudson
i ve administered both bamboo and hudson and i would recommend hudson

585442
bamboo	hudson
and it s statistics hudson for ease of use and third-party support is better regardless of dollar amount it is free bamboo is not

585447
xcopy	cmd
you can also use xcopy cmd like in this example old is a directory

585453
ruby	php
i m looking for a pure database solution but if there is a way for ruby and php - it will be great too

585455
keyboard	mouse
you can traverse that outline using either the keyboard -- with enter to selected -- or the mouse -- clicking to selected to examine places those uses

585457
perl	ruby
i read somewhere that ruby is the love-child of smalltalk and lisp with miss perl as the nanny

585457
perl	ruby
i have a lot of respect for ruby s parents but i m not sure i like the influence miss perl had on the child

585473
puts	gets
when you destroy list object - python puts it to that arrays and when you create new list - python gets last puted list from this arrays

585482
versioning	upgrade
i add a property that lets me detect when we are running a new versioning for the first time and try to upgrade from the previous settings

585507
numeric	nan
some value types have this extra information for instances many numeric types have a nan constant

585533
environment	building
at the end i found out that a gui toolkit isn t enough - i need a complete platform independent solution providing me the building environment ide integration and low-level functions like network sockets and file i o

585533
lgpl	gpl
you can use qt as commercial user with professional support like me or just start your own projects under gpl and with 4.5 with lgpl which allows commercial use

585534
linux	unix
windows 2000 xp vista osx linux other unix variants

585536
children	tree
looks like a straightforward algorithm find the root of the search tree in the game tree and check whether the children of the search tree are a subset of the children in the game tree

585545
command-prompt	cmd
this question is w.r.t this is there a cmd to refresh environment variables from the cmd-prompt in windows

585568
administration	account
if you remember the unfortunate incident with a twitter administration s account being hacked a little bit ago it was allowed to happen for several reasons that could have all been easily resolved

585578
postgresql	mysql
mysql vs postgresql is an endless war

585581
serialization	marshalling
it s inheritors are not serialization but passed by reference marshalling proxy-ed instead

585598
fwrite	fclose
family fread - fopen fclose fread fwrite

585615
row	col
internally you could represent it as a 1d arrays and compute offsets for the row col coordinates

585639
postgresql	mysql
as someone who recently switched a project from mysql to postgresql i don t regret the switch

585669
packets	lan
it is quite possible for packets from your machine to go over a wired lan and return packets to go across the wlan

585737
void	main
could be swingactions could be threads could be public void main could be inside a loop as in your example

585751
attributes	properties
10.1.3 using properties attributes dontdelete

585771
arguments	default
however many instructions online simply say to add -s to the end of the default grub boot arguments which leaves a graphical boot progress display in an endless loop and never enters the single-user mode console

585772
constructor	object
however if all of these values are just constructor parameters for thing object i d have to agree with ck that you should really have dostuff return a or

585779
logout	login
how can i login without logout from current user to another active directory user with c#

585779
logout	login
edited i want login with another user and get this user s permissions without logout from my current user in c#

585784
smalltalk	lisp
using images in lisp is very similar to what smalltalk systems do

585789
webforms	asp.net
if you are good with html give up webforms and use an mvc framework like asp.net mvc or fubu mvc

585789
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you are not good with html learn html give up webforms and use an asp.net-mvc framework

585792
binaries	install
is there a way to get native binaries which i can then package with an install

585807
pascal	delphi
the only time i ve handled a reader for this format was in delphi pascal and it s messy ill-defined difficult to process and tends to have lots of variations such that although i managed to get my reader handling models exported from 3d-max itself just fine it rejected many models from other packages that claimed to be in 3ds format but were not properly formed

585809
postback	ajax
you may want to investigate techniques that will allow the user to make all their modifications and then submit them all together such as using javascript on the client side to maintain the distribution of attribute points or alternatively look into using ajax to asynchronously postback the modifications to the server resulting in a smoother user experience

585809
attributes	properties
this will allow you to have just the one event methods for each button which can decided which attributes to change and how from these properties

585835
resource-files	resx
you want to look into resx resource-files

585835
localization	translation
these are xml files that can contain texts and images and they have standardized handling of localization translation

585842
contains	set
personally i tend to gravitate towards a simplified nested set model by default as it contains less redundancy than ar

585852
hide	show
my idea was to let the tab-buttons link through to #tab1 and #tab2 and then let jquery pick up the #tabx and show hide the relevant tab

585866
decrement	increment
one suggestion that i would make is to look at using javascript to increment decrement your counters in your markup then do the updates to your model using the value of the textbox on form submission

585866
user-interface	flicker
as andy suggests you could also do the updates via ajax to reduce visible user-interface flicker but given the simple rules you have i think doing it client-side and posting back once is the way to go

585868
mp3	wma
if it were a mp3 or wma file i would play it using a mediaelement but i don t want to have to make it into a file as this would put a crimp on applying dynamic effects to the audio

585870
display	width
you could try adding a width to the submenu ul currently ie8 sorry no ie7 display each item horizontally

585896
mp3	wma
however it won t let you intercept samples to perform effects on wma or mp3 presumably for drm reasons so you would still potentially need to write your own decoder

585932
derived-class	base-class
however you can explicitly introduce the base-class functions into the derived-class namespace

585956
any	set
i call it on keyup on every field that is required and check for values in all of the fields and any other validation i want to do and then as long as everything checks out i set the submit button to be enabled otherwise i set the submit button to be disabled

585965
centering	fixed
honestly for vertical centering issues and well any vertical-alignment issues with the items aren t fixed height it s easier just to use tables

585992
order	add
no matter the order i add entries to the dictionary when i call dictionary.keys the keys are returned in the order specified by the implementation for the key s type

585997
profiling	trace
when you re doing profiling trace of a database you may try to filtering activity based on the database

585999
order	add
once you add enough items into the table and force sufficient rehashes the keys will not be order

586009
base-class	inherited
the pointers are designed to point at the base-class and so can point at any inherited class as demonstrated in the example

586044
dictionary	map
what i m inclined to do is map a dictionary where each element in the dictionary represents a column in the table that way it will be 100 dynamic with regard to adding columns in the database and i would only need to update the mappingfile with which table to use if i m integrating versus a different system

586064
properties-file	jar
but another approach might be to store it in a properties-file in the jar

586076
uitableview	uiview
now i understand that navigation controller can swith not only from uitableview to uiview but also from uiview to uiview

586087
getter	setter
when generating setter and getter in eclipse one of the options is to use the getter and setter within the class rather than accessing the class-members directly

586108
value	field
for getters you may instead of accessing a field compute a value when you change representation

586110
highlight	selected
highlight that selected a project name and then ok

586121
linux	unix
another thing you need to consider is platform independence - if there is a possibility that you you company need to migrate your cad software to linux unix of course for bussiness decision it will be quite painful

586125
export	report
edit i would like to add that report services does in fact have a full gui for development visual-studio and it allows for export of reports into many different formats such as word excel pdf html etc

586131
shell	tcsh
here is how to set the path for c or tcsh shell asuming you installed the tool in opt checker-0.160

586143
postgresql	oracle
i know of oracle postgresql 8.4 most likely the porformance will be worse than doing two queries

586144
constructor	object
note the use of an anonymous object to specify constructor arguments

586159
defined	declare
i know somewhat that they are used to declare external linkage for functions functional defined in different source file.but would like to know in detail how this works

586164
attributes	properties
you may even have a run-time error thrown as you will try to access a properties length on a null object hascover in case the attributes doesn t exist

586164
attributes	properties
if you want to test if the properties exists and the value is set you should try both starting with the hasownproperties so that the value test eventual run-time error gets ignored in case the attributes doesn t exist

586177
windows-server	windows
in other words for each windows box that we run memcached on we have to buy a copy of windows-server and those costs add up

586179
checkbox	textbox
this grid has one checkbox column and one or more textbox columns

586179
selected	checkbox
when a row or many rows are selected and you press space the checkbox should be toggled

586179
click	mouse
i have thought about using a flag but not sure where i can put it since i can t really know if it was a double event or if it was just the user using space and then click with the mouse

586179
click	mouse
is there a way to see if the cell was click by mouse or by space

586191
pdf-generation	printing
pdf-generation and printing

586191
perl	php
even perl php python ruby has com support

586202
configuration	environment
i have configuration files and various documents that i want to copy from the dev environment to the dev-server directory using maven2

586207
log4net	nlog
in my current project i m using two libraries where one is using log4net and the other nlog for its logging

586207
log4net	nlog
i m not knowing much about log4net so i m asking what would be the best way to programmatically forwarding all the messages from log4net to nlog

586207
log4net	nlog
there is a post about a log4net forwarder at the nlog forum but it looks like no one had done this before

586215
command-line	cmd
the problem for mergetool is that it deliberately uses a cmd-line interface to initiate a merge session and then waits for the invoked cmd to return to determine when the user driven merge has completed

586225
cvs	git
fortunately for those of us who are still forced to use cvs git provides pretty good tools to do exactly what you re wanting to do

586225
cvs	git
use git cvsimport to clone the cvs revision history into a git repository

586225
cvs	git
once this process is completed you will have a master branch that should reflect cvs s head with the exception that git cvsimport by default ignores the last 10 minutes worth of commits to avoid catching a commit that is half-finished

586225
.when	ready
in practice i recommend always making changes on branches and only merging to master .when you re ready to export those changes back to the cvs repository

586225
cvs	git
the git cvsexportcommit command allows you to export a single commit out to the cvs server

586225
cvs	git
due to the way cvs commits come back through with different commit ids as described above you don t want your cloned branch to track the central git repository

586229
message	alert
i know that the client side javascript is being written to the page and have placed an alert random message as the first line in the validator function that only appears if it is validating a textbox not when it is validating my custom control

586233
log4net	nlog
create a custom log4net appender that logs the messages to a nlog logger

586233
log4net	nlog
this may be at least the solution if you just want to pass the log information to nlog instead of replacing all occurences of log4net logging with nlog

586235
.net	wcf
i m sorry if this is an obvious question but i ve been mostly a .net 2.0 person up until now so i know very little about wcf

586257
buffering	streaming
however to preserve memory and improve overall performance i d rather handle the document as a streaming and read one page at a time into a buffering

586278
multiplication	algebra
but the biggest problem is that it makes it harder to read and maintain code and you will most likely end up with people abusing it creating one giant line of code to do multiple things think back to high-school algebra and those gigantic lines of additions subtractions and multiplication you always seem to end up with at some point that is what people will do if you let them

586285
javascript	dom
how do i use ie8 developer tools to browse the dom css javascript of a frameset site

586294
netmsmqbinding	was
i have created a wcf service with netmsmqbinding and hosted it in iis7 using windows activation service was

586294
host	root
but the same setup code iis security queue security etc. does nothing when i try to use the root app instead of the myservice app to host the service

586297
.net	wcf
supposedly .net 3.5 sp1 has support for ado.net entity framework entities in wcf contracts

586302
factors	primes
your method of finding primes by comparing every single element of the arrays with every possible factors is hideously inefficient

586302
addition	division
besides doing far fewer comparisons it also uses addition rather than division

586314
arrays	loops
then you can for instance loops and build a list of integers that are prime before finally converting that to an arrays to return

586326
hide	next
when the next button is click hide and undock the previous panels then show and dock the current panels

586331
droppable	draggable
setup which cells are droppable inside your draggable s start event

586332
build-process	release
however i do add generated files and binaries when i m 1 making a release and need to preserve the exact released files or 2 the files are difficult to build and i don t want other developers to deal with the build-process

586359
instance-variables	local-variables
make ruby completely message sending based get rid of everything that is not a message send local-variables global-variables instance-variables class hierarchy variables constants magic globals magic constants builtin operators builtin keywords even literals

586361
text-editor	editor
i implemented the yahoo rich text-editor yui editor in a ruby-on-rails application using the yui_editor plugins

586369
element	dynamic
worth reminding or mentioning that as you layout these divs and spans to use ids to help you locate that element within your gwt code and populate it with your dynamic controls

586378
postgresql	mysql
since it uses mysql or postgresql you can update your dns on the fly with php or just about anything else

586382
jquery	.post
using jquery you are mainly going to go to http get or http .post

586387
lightbox	thickbox
i also found thickbox but i couldn t figure out how to trigger a lightbox effect pop up window by clicking on a c# imagebutton control

586403
directory	folder
i was looking to do the same thing but it did not work so i decided to do the opposite as you know the web.configuration can be inherited so i pointed iis to a folder containing the client configuration connection string file path etc files and the website files i put them on a virtual directory with the rest of the webconfiguration where it load dll and other application files needed

586416
freopen	stdin
the right way to use freopen is to omit the assignment freopen newin r stdin

586425
directory	folder
example code is in the com folder of the install directory

586430
contains	sorted
the file contains code for sorting a table on the client-side and uses the â ² and â ¼ characters in the scripting to indicate which column is sorted and in which direction

586441
simplemodal	jquery
have you tried the simplemodal plugin for jquery

586442
credentials	account
if i use my own network credentials i get the results back as i am set up with full control permissions in the search server instance but when i use an alternate domain account for this mydomain queryuser i get this error

586472
autotools	cmake
usually this kind of portability problem are left to the build system autotools or cmake in my case which detect specific of the system

586476
arrays	loops
in that case arrays would become self . you can also optimize it by assigning to a variable before the loops and using that variable if you desire

586476
arrays	loops
if you just want to loops over an arrays backwards you can use a for in loops with but it s likely a bit more efficient to use -enumerateobjectswithoptions usingblock

586490
stderr	stdout
remember that stdin stdout and stderr are file descriptors 0 1 and 2 for every newly created process

586492
xsl-fo	xslt
it s also possible to automate pdf creation for large sets of documents by converting them to xml and using xslt and xsl-fo

586502
delphi	basic
it supports c++ java vb.net c# php delphi and visual basic code generation

586511
python	php
for weeks after reinstalling i was missing one little app or another some php or python module wasn t there stuff like that

586517
export	csv
also how do i tell the user to export as csv data

586527
internet-explorer	firefox
this code works in internet-explorer but does not work in firefox

586547
keyboard	mouse
i m looking for some code preferably c# that will prevent keyboard and mouse input

586555
case-statement	case-when
you may also want to consider the case-statement as a methods case-when name daves then dave else name but i really don t like this methods especially if you are proposing to use this for anything else then a one-off report

586559
contains	elements
in some cases p tags should contains other elements such as anchor a image img and other in-line elements because they relate directly to the content of the rest of the paragraph and it makes sense to grouping them that way or the text of the rest of the paragraph provides a more in-depth description

586559
contains	elements
in general a paragraph is supposed to contains one paragraph of text and any directly related or described elements

586562
output	mode
openoffice.org can be run in server mode without any gui can read rtf files and can output pdf files

586565
png	ico
by the way all icons come in png ico bmp format and a conversion utility

586569
swing	swt
i m relatively new to swt programming former swing programmer but encountered similar situations in which the layout wasn t properly updated

586582
value	field
assuming you wanted to store a none value for missing field

586586
pointers	stack
i d imagine instantiating the object should give the pointers 1 then i suppose maybe pushing it onto the uinavigationcontroller s stack might bump it up one not sure about that though

586609
arrays	loops
i have a loops written in c++ which is executed for each element of a big integer arrays

586620
scrollbar	widget
a rule of thumb if you have added or removed a control or otherwise done something that requires a relayout walk up the widget hierarchy until you find a composite with scrollbar and call layout on it

586643
svnadmin	dump
2. or use svnadmin command svnadmin dump

586647
indesign	acrobat
changing a pdf is much more difficult than generating it so you need to use a pdf editor like nitro pdf untested or why not acrobat illustrator indesign

586649
python	java
since the heavy hitters all do oop in a similar fashion java .net python i would guess than anything done would follow those similar methodologies

586659
loading	gif
i m trying to use a loading overlay on top of a windows form that adds a 50 opaque layer on top of a windows form with a loading gif while it does what it needs to do in a background thread

586659
loading	gif
the loading overlay will appear show the first frame loading gif then just freeze

586680
selected	button
beside the drop down list there is a button which i am using to add the selected item from the drop down list to a gridview which also exists in the insertion templates

586680
selected	button
my problem is that when i click the button to add the selected item from the drop down list the selected item index or value from the drop down list are not available

586704
contains	elements
but while that does cast happily as ihtmlstyle3 it doesn t seem to contains the style as it s been applied to the html elements

586707
value	field
if you re using check_box in the context of a form then the checkbox will show whatever value that field has

586719
32-bit	64bit
the strange fact that it worked on a 32-bit machine and not a 64bit o s is also a clue

586719
32-bit	64bit
also in a 64bit machine the kernel space may be larger than the 32-bit machine and eating some available memory space that was in the user part of the memory space for 32-bit o s

586719
32-bit	64bit
your problem is likely in strncpy though i don t know why the 32-bit - 64bit o s change would matter

586721
debian	linux
since you expressed interest in rsync here s an article that covers how to make a bootable backup image via rsync for debian linux

586733
openoffice.org	uno
java if using jodconverter or any language that can interface with openoffice.org s uno

586733
apache-poi	itext
itext + apache-poi

586733
openoffice.org	uno
jodconverter java the library takes care of spawning openoffice.org in headless mode and talking uno to it on your behalf

586733
.when	ready
you provide jodconverter with an input and output file name as well as the input and output types rtf and pdf and .when it returns to you the output file is ready

586733
openoffice.org	uno
c++ you can fork+exec one or more for load balancing openoffice.org instances in headless mode soffice will listen for uno requests on a socket port 8100. from your application use uno cpp to instruct openoffice.org to perform the conversion the same way jodconverter does see the jodconverter source code for how to do this.

586737
keyboard	mouse
have a look at this article processing global mouse and keyboard hooks in c# a

586760
processor	cpu
although it is true that sse is specific to some processor sse may be relatively safe sse2 much less in my experience you can detect the cpu at runtime and load the code dynamically depending on the target cpu

586774
user-permissions	administration
i m creating an administration page where the admin can modify user-permissions where permissions is stored as an integer and i would like the permissions field to be a drop-down box that automatically submits and updates when the administrator click on the option he wants the user to have

586775
32-bit	x86
ntohl for instance converts a 32-bit unsigned long from big endian network order to host order little endian on x86 machines

586781
postgresql	oracle
can i perform some type of postgresql equivalent to an oracle analytic function

586785
configuration	environment
if i double click it i get the server configuration editor and on the environment tab there is a system properties section with some name-value pairs

586818
postback	ajax
the update to the textboxes does not cause a full postback only an ajax postback that does not do anything with the results the postback updates the value on the db but the return actionresult is an emptyresult as there is nothing i need to update on the ui

586818
postback	ajax
the only answer that comes to me so far is to scrap the javascript code that calculates the total on the ui and instead have the ajax postback return the new total for that view

586827
callback	methods
in the tutorial the server just replies to the client using a callback methods instead i m storing a reference to the client in a list of subscribers

586833
temporary	copy
so if you must seek a lot within a big file jump randomly around within a 500+ mb file it might actually be faster to first copy the whole 500 mb to hd into a temporary file which will be done in sequential fast reads perform the operation on the temp file much faster since much faster access times on hd and delete the file again if you are done with it

586834
postgresql	oracle
when dealing with cost-based optimizers oracle postgresql etc. you need to make sure to periodically run analyze on your various tables as their size increases by more than 10-15

586834
postgresql	mysql
i had mentioned that in our rails application all select queries dropped below 100ms after switching to postgresql whereas some of the complex joins generated by activerecord would occasionally take as much as 15s or more with mysql 5.1 because of nested loops with inner table scans even when indices were available

586848
external	host
you basically have two choices if you want to host transcode and stream flv files and don t want to buy a video transcoding application you can call out to ffmpeg mencoder or you can use an external web service

586883
hash	tie
if you can tie the version number to your build system or a hash of the file that would be extra sweet

586883
apache	squid
squid 2.6 will often fool apache into not gziping stuff when it should and worse it will cache the uncompressed versions and feed them to browsers that can handle gzip d content

586896
udp	tcp
a port is part of socket end point in tcp and udp

586896
udp	tcp
they allow the operating system to distinguish which tcp or udp service on the host should receive incoming messages

586898
value	field
if you want the exact behaviour you outlined in your code the only way to achieve this is to change the contents of your foo instance overwrite each and every field with the updated value

586900
firefox	opera
however none of the images are loaded and instead alt text are displayed in firefox ie and opera

586915
udp	tcp
in ip terms a protocol number is the value assigned to the layer 4 protocol carried within ip 6 for tcp 17 for udp as often found in the etc protocols file on most unix systems

586915
udp	tcp
a port number is used within the udp and tcp headers to represent different higher level protocols carried within those protocols 25 for smtp 80 for http etc per etc services

586919
put	get
how do i parsing it so i can get the out put like this

586937
callback	methods
i typically have a join methods where i get a guid for the client and grab the callback there

586953
streamreader	writer
use a profiling to see if you have streamreader writer objects around that you do not think you should have

586967
exception-handling	try-catch
don t forget to put a try-catch around your close and log errors if the close throws an exception-handling

586988
radio-button	checkbox
on the other hand if the options themselves differ by only a few words and lose meaning if they are truncated a list of options like peanut butter and grape jelly sandwich with carrot sticks and soy milk and peanut butter and boysenberry jelly sandwith with carrot sticks and 2 milk maybe you would be better served by displaying all the options sequentially accompanied by a checkbox or radio-button as appropriate

586994
parallels	vmware
you might try vmware fusion instead of parallels

587008
execution	jobs
i have encountered get this kind of problem in modular avionics systems where you are apportioning jobs to nodes and there you do know the expected timing and memory requirements for their jobs prior to the jobs execution

587010
cryptography	security
optionally a message footer fixed size could be added with a checksum or even a cryptography signature depending on your reliability security requirements

587019
children	nodes
a typical query for the current nodes and all children would look like

587026
openbsd	linux
looking at man 3 printf on linux os x and openbsd all show support for z for size_t and t for ptrdiff_t for c99 but none of those mention off_t

587026
32-bit	64bit
suggestions in the wild usually offer up the u conversion for off_t which is correct enough as far as i can tell both unsigned int and off_t vary identically between 64bit and 32-bit systems

587031
search-engine	serp
the link appears as a hit for queries that typically produce a serp search-engine results page that s full of junk links

587061
32-bit	64bit
a 32-bit application will get an address space of something close to 4gb and a 64bit application will get a huge address space - 7tb to 8tb depending on the platform 64bit builds set the bit by default

587067
internet-explorer	firefox
on a mac and in firefox everything is fine but on internet-explorer 6 the head is just gone.

587074
interpreter	runtime
infragistics as much as i hate their suite of controls has a fully functional c# formula interpreter runtime evaluation engine that works great with their grid controls

587106
constructor	object
in the second one a temporary object is created first and then is copied into the object x using myclass s copy constructor

587116
temporary	copy
in the case where you have copy initialization with the same type the compiler is allowed to elide a copy so it can construct the temporary you create directly into the initialized object

587116
constructor	private
i.e if you have a private copy constructor that code is invalid if the code in which it appears has no access to it

587116
constructor	object
the compiler creates a temporary object of the type of myclass then when there is a constructor that takes an int

587140
python	java
you can generate and compile java code in java python code in python c# in c# even lisp in lisp etc

587153
google-docs	spreadsheet
lloyd cotten correctly comments that google-docs is an example of a spreadsheet built with html javascript

587189
command-prompt	runas
if i open a command-prompt at the server and do a runas user servername i_usr sqlcmd.exe that works fine but running from the asp page still doesn t work

587208
updating	updates
you say updates the outline of the button but it s really updating the cell behind the button

587276
revision	svn
if so it would probably work best if you made your production branch from a corresponding revision in the svn trunk so that the repository knew there was a shared history

587278
constructor	private
to prove that just move the copy constructor in the code above to the private section of the class definition

587279
prerequisites	inno-setup
i am trying to use inno-setup to bootstrap a number of prerequisites to my windows-installer installation package and am having pretty good luck with this

587287
dictionary	arrays
powershell has some pretty nifty formating modules for displaying objects arrays collections dictionary and tabular data

587301
show	next
i m going into a meeting with the guys proposing this next week and if there is a problem would greatly appreciate some pointers to reference material with which i can show that the design is insecure

587303
arrays	loops
you could loops through the string doing charcodeat and do your associative arrays on the integers

587310
system.out	system.in
you also could read and write text to the console by using system.out and system.in

587322
variables	boolean
i ve always used a global boolean variables like buserpressedcancel along with doevents within a loop

587327
any	set
so when you are in this loop you ll need to set a module level variables anyway as you ll need to check for it in a queryunload of the form and in any event handler

587327
hide	show
just hide one and show the other

587341
business-objects	data-access
the major categories of business-objects with related data-access layer objects are

587354
emacs	vim
for people who don t use emacs or vim i d like to add that you can open excel and use its autofill feature and text concatenation function to generate such code

587360
restart	exit
i could set this up to exit after 1000 iterations and restart via a crontab shortly thereafter but that feels like the coward s way out

587367
solaris	linux
if you replace native with windows solaris or linux there will be platform specific code in those directories

587372
void	main
is validnumcheck suppose to return a value and then exit in the void main methods

587395
markup	xhtml
my instinct tells me that xhtml markup is our friend not our enemy

587422
oracle	mysql
if i was using mssql or oracle i d simply put together a user-defined function but my experience with mysql is more limited and i ve not constructed a udf with it before although i m happy coding c

587432
markup	xhtml
measure a baseline xhtml page and the same page with 20 controls on it that emit the same markup

587444
bluetooth	usb
due to interesting race conditions for usb to serial bridges and bluetooth to serial bridges changing the speed is a very tricky problem

587451
deployment	install
you can also use clickonce deployment to allow normal restricted users to install the app locally

587467
shell	bash
old school unix way bash shell syntax

587468
attributes	properties
using a custom control may be a good choice if you intend to re-use the code or if you wish to define custome properties or attributes on the code but it makes little sense otherwise

587486
implements	extends
with interfaces you have to implements the combinations s functionality yourself except one class you can extends

587498
virtual-machine	virtualization
i ve looked at several objects in the root virtualization name space but i have not been able to find where hyper-v stores the path to the config file for a given virtual-machine

587510
webforms	asp.net
i m using asp.net webforms on .net 3.5

587532
hide	show
this bit works fine - i m using javascript to show and hide the divs which contains the large images but as the page first loads it starts loading all of the images at the same time

587532
hide	show
ideally i d like to use my current setup - just show and hide divs - and have the hidden divs start loading their contents as soon as the first panels has completed

587580
logout	login
how can i login to ad without logout from current user and get new logged user s rights

587587
python	java
python java and plenty of others allow you to write on one platform and run on many

587587
cross-compiling	lgpl
if you still want to use c++ gcc gives you the option of cross-compiling and if you combine that with qt which will soon be available under the lgpl you should be able to get something working

587608
constructor	object
at least you won t get memory leaks because you passed self to the constructor so at least the form will take care of destroying those object

587623
udp	tcp
as you are probably aware when a tcp udp message is sent on the wire the data being sent is wrapped or prepended with a corresponding tcp udp header

587623
udp	tcp
however if you re using regular sockets to send and receive your data the ip headers as well as the tcp udp headers are stripped off you don t get this information from the socket

587623
udp	tcp
use the ip and tcp udp headers to filtering the data based on your client and server sockets ip addresses and port numbers

587641
rollback	commit
commit or rollback if failed

587642
contains	any
if you want lines contains any of argument

587663
postgresql	mysql
when i made the migration from mysql to postgresql several things really got in my way

587672
directory	folder
3 builds the code in the default directory which is the precompiledweb folder its a web app

587689

presumably you specifically mean an integer represented as a string with leading zero

587695
getter	setter
there s alot of talk about getter and setter being evil and what not

587703
.when	ready
the problem is that bluetoothsetservicestate returns as soon as the driver install begins not .when the device is actually ready for use

587703
.when	ready
what i m looking for is a way to hook that ready to use event .when driver installation has actually finished so i don t make my communication library calls prematurely

587718
getter	setter
i don t believe that that is what is meant when people talk about getter and setter because this is not simply setting a member to the given value

587718
getter	setter
i don t care for setter and getter but mostly because i think of my objects as higher-level entities in the codebase

587758
value	field
you should probably have an account object with a balance field and possibly a convenience methods modifybalance on it that takes a positive value to increment or a negative value to decrement the balance

587765
cvs	git
in addition to brian phillips answer there is also git-cvsserver which functions like cvs server but actually access git repository.

587774
getter	setter
if you have getter and setter for all fields and everybody and his dog have access to the object then that is very bad as there is essentially no encapsulation of the data

587775
getter	setter
setter and getter are generally accessor methods for private variables properties

587787
3des	aes
i know asp.net 1.0 used 3des but newer versions generally use aes by default

587829
xlsx	xls
there are many tools to read xls and xlsx workbooks including spreadsheetgear for .net which reads both

587833
linux	bsd
boot the computer with a bsd or linux cd and mount the filesystem

587840
stream	send
i cannot have the scanner send sentinal characters as the scanner is being used by other applications and adding a sentinal character stream would mean modifying other code

any	set
now are there any general advice for how to set up a system with a nas-unit running subversion and have it accessible in a secure fashion from the internet and having backups made on regular basis

587849
stderr	stdout
either freopen stdout and stderr with con or do the other linker compile workarounds there

587856
datagridview	listview
i guess i really should be using a datagridview or listview but i wanted more than just a line of text and a small icon per row

587868
margins	padding
you could also add a padding to the div or margins for the image to add extra padding between the rounded border and the image

587869
deployment	install
ensure the productcode property of your deployment project is different so subsequent install

587873
iteration	set
the n-th column will contain 1 in if this node is reachable on the n-th iteration from our designated start vertex or start set and zero otherwise

587874

587879
synology	nas
i m using a synology ds101j for a home nas

587885
hide	show
you can create your own alert component subclassing titlewindow and then use popupmanager to show hide them

587886
any	set
it is rendering all of the text applied to it just fine but is not rendering any the style properties that are set

587887
versioning	upgrade
note that this was working in versioning 1.2.6 and represents a possible upgrade issue

587888
value	field
update table set field value where field2 identifier

587888
value	field
or you could use the linq equivalent where table field field2 value and identifier should be replaced with specific names to suit your database

587892
windows-applications	wpf
what is best practices in architecting wpf windows-applications

587896
e-commerce	product
i m building an e-commerce website with a large database of product

587906
subclassing	base-class
if you want to do something that only should be done once for each class that subclassing your class why i have no idea but you might have a reason to use a dictionary in the base-class

587918
lighttpd	apache
file downloads done right have some links that describe how to do it for apache lighttpd mod_secdownload security via url generation nginx

587918
perl	php
there are examples in php ruby rails python which can be adopted for perl

587918
content-disposition	content-length
generate valid headers for the redirect in your perl app content-type content-disposition content-length

587922
postgresql	mysql
i dunno how mysql does vacuum s innodb tables innodb is mvcc like postgresql and so needs to clean up .

587946
url-encoding	url
it looks likes it s coming from an url although the url-encoding is gone

587956
web-config	app-config
web-config app-config are not options in this scenario

587978
order	join
usually it means that the query isn t using an index it s supposed to or using a bad join methods or a bad join order or doing a bunch of string-conversion comparison

587979
treeview	expander
i m noticing that sometimes frame and form units which normally have an associated dfm file do not always show the dfm file underneath accessible via the little + treeview node expander underneath them

587981
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
so let s say i have a site and i do not have a crossdomain.xml or clientaccesspolicy.xml on it

587987
lookup	any
when you re fetching the data ad hoc from your database any joins or correlations between tables will result in further lookup scans index loads etc

587994
compact-framework	.net
is there any library or code samples to convert an image to text in the .net compact-framework

588019
factors	primes
0.1 cannot be represented as accurately in base-2 as in base-10 due to the missing primes factors of 5

588025
contains	any
but i know that the contains function is working because i get results when i run any of these

588031
show	next
next time you need to show an alert don t create a new one - grab the one you ve already created and set its properties then set visible to true again

588039
contains	any
it is not possible to calculate the aic from a confusion matrix since it doesn t contains any information about the likelihood

588048
.when	ready
in some browsers it now takes over the role of document.onload and fires .when the dom is ready as well

588048
.when	ready
it is called .when the dom is ready which can be prior to images and other external content is loaded

588051
change-password	logout
at any rate i am using asp.net s membership framework for login logout change-password etc

588065
default-value	default
regarding the default statement in particular this is used because annotations and interfaces can t have constructor so this is the only way to have a default-value for an annotation attributes

588065
default-value	default
this is done by following its empty parameter list with the keyword default and the default-value of the element

588065
default-value	default
thus changing a default-value affects annotations even in classes that were compiled before the change was made presuming these annotations lack an explicit value for the default element

588065
document	element
note that the document says in annotations with a single element the element should be named value

588068
triggers	insert
triggers must be able to process multi-record insert updates or deltes and some people have been known to do this through the use of a cursor rather than through the use of set-based language

588088
hash	md5
i take the raw tex and run it through the md5 function then i insert the hash into the database along with the current timestamp and use the hash .png as the filename

588089
firefox	safari
this works fine on ie firefox and safari

588109
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome are flawless

588135
methodology	waterfall
it is called a waterfall methodology and as such it is a bit antiquated early 90 s

588151
constructor	object
as far as i understand the problem of partially constructed object is only a problem within constructor

588151
constructor	object
in other words within a constructor if an object references itself including it s subclass or it s members then there are possible issues with partial construction

588151
constructor	object
the compiler can choose to a allocate the memory for the new helper object b write the address to myhelper the local stack variables and then c invoke any constructor initialization

588154
arrays	loops
not the most efficient python will build an arrays with a billion tuples but this is a single loops

588160
stderr	stdout
redirect stderr to stdout

588178
display	width
assuming you have added a datagrid named dguserattributes to a form named form1 in the form designer you can test how the datagridtextboxcolumn width property changes the width of the column in the display datagrid using the code below

588186
output	mode
mode ajax output json then passthrough.php

588186
output	mode
mode ajax output json path methods all in one go

588187
frame	width
for 6 frame stripes the image will have a width of 6 16 and height as 16 pixels

588214
jndi	jdbc
we re also building scripts that will create domains based on our baseline configuration jdbc jndi etc

588243
websphere	ibm
what benefits do i gain by using ibm websphere application server community edition over apache geronimo

588253
lighttpd	apache
apache process or lighttpd for

588267
apache-mina	mina
i m not concerned about the design of the underlying methods that i m calling and not storing the return-value because the actually implementation is coming from a third-party networking library mina and i have no control over the api

588267
easymock	mockito
i dumped easymock because it wasn t easy and went for mockito

588269
ironpython	ironruby
in addition to being free they are also a good way to get support for lesser-known clr dlr languages like boo ironpython and ironruby

588275
put	get
type p4 user to see your user configuration and then under reviews put the filespec of the area in depot where you d like to get notified on a check-in as in

588285
value	field
you can also get each field of the form and get its value using the document.getelementbyid function and passing in the field s id

588321
configuration	environment
this application reads two environment variables for its configuration which server ips to talk to and it seems like we d also want to push this configuration via a gpo style setting or login script to all the desktops

588323
contains	elements
is a block-level elements that should contains a paragraph comprised of text inline elementss that modify that text etc. and images

588325
message	alert
also i ve not worked out a way to play the default message alert - or a sound file

588345
windows-server	windows
if you want a fast development platform you should install windows-server 2008 on your pc convert your windows 2008 server to a workstation and install hyperv

588345
windows-server	windows
the reason you need windows-server 2008 or windows 7 beta is that the os supports virtualization natively

588353
message	alert
i just found this works nicely for vibrate but i still need to know how to play the default message alert

588356
spaces	output
the html above will output the â œhelloworldâ string without a spaces between â œhelloâ and â œworldâ however in the following example

588356
spaces	output
the html above will output a â œhello worldâ string with a spaces between â œhelloâ and â œworldâ

588381
linux	unix
different flavours of linux and unix have different approaches to packaging software

588381
freebsd	linux
freebsd for example is based off the ports system where you compile from scratch although there are binary packages pre-built for much of it whereas it s often the case in mainstream linux distributions that you ll find a completely pre-prepared binary package for something popular

588381
any	set
alternatively it may simply be that one packager decides it s reasonable to set things up with a standard configuration and run some common initialisation steps on your behalf whereas a more hands-off packager will leave it up to the end user particularly if the software is in any way complicated or requiring any consideration before deployment system services

588414
rollback	commit
i have a remote git repository and i need to rollback the last n commit into cold oblivion

588429
multi-module	subproject
some of these projects are multi-module projects as well and in some cases they build the same subproject

588438
spline	smooth
a smooth regression spline to this data

588438
spline	smooth
connecting the centroids to form a smooth spline is proving to be difficult but the centroids obtained is passable

588438
spline	smooth
to clarify the problem the data is not a time-series and i m looking for a smooth spline which best describes the point cloud i.e. if i were to project this 3d spline on a plane formed by any 2 variables the projected spline onto 2d will be a smooth fit of the projected point cloud onto 2d

588442
terminal	prompt
1 open a terminal prompt

588445
nsurlconnection	nsxmlparser
what it basically does is getting some data from connected another device and send that data to the server periodically using nsurlconnection and read data from the server periodically and visualize that data as a graph using nsxmlparser

588457
authentication	login
upon login an attempt is made to authentication against the domain controller and create or update the local cached version of the user profiling

588457
crypt	hash
you can do this easily enough with a sha-1 hash and a secret or you can use full-fledged cryptography providers available on your platform or in java if using java. you do not need to crypt it as long as no secret information is stored inside

588479
order	add
alternatively but still assuming an order series you may want to find a linear fit a line through the heart of the cloud and then add to that some sort of probably polar function based on the perpendicular projection from the points to the line

588490
least-squares	regression
in other words you have a set of basis functions splines parametrized in a certain way and then you use least-squares or some other regression technique to find optimal coefficients

588496
3des	aes
another solution is to send the password between your programs encrypted with something like 3des or aes

588509
thickbox	jquery
i know how to load simple content into a div with jquery but i am stuck on how to load external content to a div in a page preferably via onload event and have that div act like thickbox and retain the functionality and appearance without the popup thickbox window

588535
document	element
is only permitted in the section of a document document relationships the link element

588546
streamreader	writer
are there any cases in which calling close on a streamreader writer actually throws an ioexception

588564
jax-ws	cxf
one of our projects uses apache cxf s wsdl2java tool to generate jax-ws stubs for a set of wsdls

588565
windows-xp	windows
this is how microsoft has used the term on the windows team in recent years windows 2000 windows-xp windows vista

588566
subclassing	base-class
now remembering that methods overloading can be used to invoke different methodss depending on the runtime type of a parameter i quickly came up with a brilliant solution elegant as it was simple i could create a base-class with an empty implementation of handleevent event and simply have subclassing receive the events they are interested in by creating a methods handleevent unitgainedevent unitgainedevent for example

588597
return-type	arguments
if your function significantly changes behavior like changing return-type based on an arguments then it should probably be two functions

588599
superclass	subclass
you need to invoke the overloaded methods on the subclass not the superclass

588599
subclassing	superclass
can you instead write handleevent methods for the specific event subclassing without having a handler for the event superclass

588613
void	main
public static void main string arguments

588622
python	c++
for the following questions answers may be for c c++ c# or python

588622
ncurses	conio
i would like the answers to be cross platform if possible but i realize i will probably need conio or ncurses

588674
windows-applications	wpf
wpf is microsoft s new framework actually it is a subsystem of the .net 3.0 for writing rich windows-applications

588683
magento	cart
magento is well engineered but it was engineered to be a shopping cart solution that other programmers can build modules on top of

588683
ruby-on-rails	django
third magento mvc is very different from the ruby on ruby-on-rails django codeigniter cakephp etc

588684
contains	elements
you cannot attach methods properties in they way you have demonstrated because as you said the jquery object is just a wrapper around whatever dom elements it contains

588712
versioning	upgrade
not only does it break all precompiled binaries making it unnecessarily difficult to use precompiled binaries if you happen to work for a software company that makes use of third party proprietary libraries then whenever they upgrade to the latest versioning of visual studios - your company must now do the same thing or the code will no longer run

588715
revision	svn
we re in the middle of a large import at the moment 20k revision 18gb svn root and i m curious as to what kinds of problems you experienced in your initial tests

588718
jquery-svg	raphael
i m working on an interactive interface using svg and javascript jquery and i m trying to decide between raphael and jquery-svg

588718
svg	vml
i don t need the vml ie support in raphael or the plotting abilities of jquery svg

588721
google-chrome	firefox
other modern browsers like firefox and google-chrome provide better support

588726
png	gif
one thought i had was to write the list to an html table with the punjabi converted into a gif or png file

588729
typedef	struct
although it s probably a lot more complicated than this in the standard you can think of it as the compiler knowing about struct cell on the first line of the typedef but not knowing about tcell until the last line - that s how i remember that rule

588732
selection	highlight
i don t know how major of a glitch this is because apple doesn t want you to persist a selection highlight on a tablerow they ve been enforcing this lately during the review process

588737
order	join
nhibernate will do join for you in order to populate the entity even if you don t have explicit join in your query

588745
boost	stl
particularly useful is the algorithms header which you can probably begin using immediately without many problems with legacy code. if you re writing a lot of new code it s far better to use the stl and boost if you can than to write your own utility classes and algorithms

588749
launchd	daemons
relatedly are there any common tools for setting up the daemons for running on boot as appropriate for the given platform init scripting on linux services on windows launchd on os x

588753
ironpython	cpython
for ironpython 1.1 support whose syntax mirrors cpython 2.4 i successfully built and install the sample from the visual-studio 2008 sdk 1.0 with the professional edition of visual-studio 2008 sp1

588753
ironpython	cpython
for ironpython 2.0 whose syntax mirrors cpython 2.5 there is currently no good way to write and debugging under visual-studio 2008 and unfortunately it would be a significant undertaking to adapt ironpython studio to host ironpython 2.0--one of the big updates in ironpython 2.0 was to base it on the dynamic language runtime and this breaks the tricks for enabling intellisense that were used previously such as static compilation

588759
adplus	dump
if you have pdb files from components install try getting dump with adplus

588762
python	java
on the same theme some databases allow you to write stored procedures in languages such as java ruby python and others

588769
constructor	object
otherwise for the best encapsulation pass in a class with the properties you need into the constructor for each object that needs to consume those properties

588773
directory	folder
put all of the files that you obtained into the lib site-packages simplejson folder under your ironpython installation directory

588777
updating	updates
there is then a technical debt task to updates the documentation - so in the end you do the detailed documentation twice or more likely you never get around to updating the documentation and it remains out of date and somewhat useless

588780
any	set
it will run any application monitor run pid files create them when necessary provide ways to stop the daemon set process user grouping ids and can even background your process

588784
google-chrome	firefox
this should do the trick tested in ie7 firefox google-chrome safari

588814
ubuntu	mint
if i statically link an executable in ubuntu is there any chance that that executable won t work within another distribution such as mint os

588816
updating	updates
here the dlls can be updates by updating the dll in the winsxs folder and the loader loads the right dll

588820
contains	set
set up your data layer to inherit from a base class which contains 4 properties for those values

588834
actionscript	mxml
the thing to remember when using actionscript instead of mxml is that the style properties are not accessed as properties on the object but through the getstyle propertyname method

588835
debian	linux
on linux systems the system s package manager portage for gentoo aptitude for ubuntu debian yum for fedora etc. usually takes care of installing the program including placing init scripts in the right places

588885
any	set
it always return a fully initialised objects any get set of a property on one thread must complete before another can access it

588890
order	add
i believe the left joins happen based on the order you add fields onto the query designer canvas

588890
order	add
as long as you add customer fields then order fields then charge fields you should be right

588890
profiling	debugging
you can verify the actual query that was run using sql profiling which is very handy for debugging these sorts of things

588891
stderr	stdout
stdout and stderr

588904
daemons	systemd
to answer one part of your question there are no tools i know of that will do daemons setup portably even across linux systemd let alone windows or mac os x

588904
linux	bsd
using autotools configure or distutils easy_install if your project is all python will go a long way to making it easier to build packages for different linux bsd distributions

588914
contains	lookup
somehow add dates into the viewpermission lookup table so that i can build an index contains the dates as well as the permissions

588923
contains	set
so you want one set of results that contains the contents of both tables

588926
nested-loops	loops
for example if you have three foreach loops nested in each other trying to find a piece of information you could do break 3 to get out of all three nested-loops

588927
sql-server	oracle
oracle and sql-server both allow null foreign keys and it is easily understandable why this is necessary

588928
order	add
copy the value you are going to order by into to viewpermission table and add it to your index

588930
silverlight	wpf
wpf has virtualizingstackpanel which would solve this problem unfortunately silverlight doesn t have this element

588938
tabcontrol	expander
when i place this control on a tabcontrol page or expander control it appears as if data binding only occurs when the control becomes visible for the first time therefore i never receive any of the routed events until i swap to the tab the control is on or expand the expander

588942
delphi	c++
you d need to either programatically populate or use a third-party component i ve used developer express in the past with c++ delphi components they are fantastic

588972
jquery	dojo
however if you re able to use an ajax library like jquery prototype dojo yui etc that s probably your best bet as they already have the abstractions built in

589004
contains	any
that being said it should work on any other similar kernel of the same architecture if you statically link on a machine running linux 2.4.x the loader vdso is going to be different on linux 2.6 vdso being virtual dynamic shared object a shared object that the kernel exposes to every process contains loader code

589016
32-bit	64bit
if you re running on windows the 64bit and 32-bit systems may have different page protection mechanisms that cause it to fail

589039
abstract	extends
basic use case i have abstract tests which have to extends testcase but are being run by intellij s test runner and failing with no tests found..

589040
superclass	inherited
it makes sense then to move a lot of that to a parent superclass which both the new and the old components can then inherited from

589053
sql-server	oracle
not sure if this is the same in oracle but in sql-server the first thing i d check is how many indexes you have on the table

589068
children	nodes
you should be able to cast the xmlelement to an xmlnode then and get it s children nodes using something like xmlnode.childnodes

589069
32-bit	64bit
64bit vs 32-bit may not matter but operating systems usually do

589079
command-line	cmd
the core cmd you would run from the cmd-line would be

589080
mouseover	mouseout
events are attached on mouseover and mouseout to switch the css class

589081
deployment	install
we were also using the setup and deployment projects in visual-studio so there was an option to detect whether or not it was already install

589085
mouseover	mouseout
css menus can also take advantage of the hover property on the anchor tag which will work in the same fashion as a mouseover mouseout event

589092
linux	bsd
you can t statically link a program for say linux then expect it to run on bsd or windows

589092
linux	unix
bsd and unix don t present or handle their system calls in the same way linux does

589113
temporary	copy
if you use a temporary variables to assign the name as in your sample code you will eventually have to copy the string to your monkeyfish object in order to avoid the temporary string object going end-of-scope on you

589125
constructor	object
you cannot declare the name member as a reference because you must initialise a reference member in the object constructor which means you couldn t set it in setname

589126
temporary	copy
this is only suboptimal because the temporary itself could have been used instead of its copy

589141
implements	extends
the game has a custom haxcanvas class which extends gamecanvas and implements runnable

589141
frame-rate	fps
it s run methods calls repaint and then sleeps for 50 ms resulting in a frame-rate of 20 fps

589141
callback	methods
however after reading up on j2me system threads i realized that putting a methods with the potential to run for a while in a callback is a bad idea

589152
continuous-integration	teamcity
what i am trying to do is to setup a continuous-integration server using teamcity pro so that whenever i checkin new code i will get a new build deploy to a remote iis server and then run tests on the testing server

589179
base-class	inherited
in addition to changing base-class of tmyframetreeview to tmybaseframe change the first word in the dfm file for tmyframetreeview from object to inherited

589189
checkbox	button
of any table we are able to generate a checkbox list containing fields of the selected table and allow user to select field s of his choice.on pressing show data button we are able to show the corresponding data in grid view.now my question is how can i am able to display this data in crystal report using asp.net c#

589196
postgresql	oracle
in oracle postgresql you can you single char wildcards _ for single chars

589213
mstest	nunit
do automated web acceptance tests using watin or selenium - this would still be written in your testing framework of choice mstest nunit etc

589239
udp	tcp
if you google and find some tutorials on ethernet in general the structure of packets how tcp and udp data gets from point a to point b etc then the information wireshark presents will make sense naturally

589276
shell	bash
in my gnu make 3.80 this will give an error since it uses the shell instead of bash to execute the commands

589282
stderr	stdout
you re not making a call when you use popen you re running an executable and talking to it over stdin stdout and stderr

589289
versioning	upgrade
if you ever outgrow their ad-sponsored services you can upgrade to a premium versioning that doesn t include ads

589292
datagrid	listbox
i was planning on adding 20 new clients to my model and have a datagrid listbox bound to this

589294
initializer	getter
all objects return their class if use the class getter so to initializer an object that is the same class as an existing object like this

589309
javascript	dom
if that is not possible you don t control the content you can write a small javascript function to change the css properties in the pages dom and execute it by calling

589311
font-size	width
i could adjust the width in the javascript configuration but then there would be a gap left on the side of the dropcap i m using it on and the fact that i m integrating it with a wordpress theme that automatically applies sifr other than the one in the example meaning that each can t be adjusted by changing the width or font-size

589312
stderr	stdout
of course you should check stderr too or else ask popen to merge it with stdout

589312
stdin	pipe
one major problem with the above is that the stdin and stdout pipe are in blocking mode so it s easy to get stuck waiting forever for output from the shell

589312
stderr	stdout
update after looking at the related questions answers it looks like it might be simpler to just use python built-in selected module to see if there s data to read on stdout you should also do the same for stderr of course

589321
shell	bash
you can call bash directly within your makefile instead of using the default shell

589326
keyboard	hid
granted you ll need a barcode scanner that supports the usb hid pos and isn t just a keyboard wedge

589361
contains	set
the change set will contains lists of newly insert update and delete operations

589362
keydown	keyup
otherwise in keydown keyup events set the e.handled property to true which will tell the box that you want to handle the input yourself and don t want the message to filtering down

589363
implements	extends
you can extends httpservlet and implements runnable

589366
sql-server	oracle
i don t know about sql-server but in oracle you can overcome this by using the dbms_transaction.local_transaction_id system package to return the id for the current transaction

589374
webforms	asp.net
i am trying to work out a way to use dependency injection with asp.net webforms controls

589392
getter	setter
if you are writing your own setter getter atomicity nonatomicity retain assign copy are merely advisory

589392
any	set
with atomic the synthesized setter getter will ensure that a whole value is always returned from the getter or set by the setter regardless of setter activity on any other thread

589392
getter	setter
that is if thread a is in the middle of the getter while thread b calls the setter an actual viable value -- an autoreleased object most likely -- will be returned to the caller in a

589392
getter	setter
if thread a is calling the getter simultaneously with thread b and c calling the setter with different value thread a may get any one of the three value returned -- the one prior to any setter being called or either of the value passed into the setter in b and c

589437
postgresql	firebird
you can choose between sdac for direct access to sql server or unidac direct access to sql server oracle mysql postgresql and interbase firebird

589440
subtract	time
subtract file s modification time from now yielding d

589450
execution	jobs
quartz can be used to create simple or complex scheduling for execution tens hundreds or even tens-of-thousands of jobs

589463
modifiers	final
modifiers otherwise the last vxx grouping would not match unless we ended the string with a final

589470
base-class	inherited
that will inject any control that inherited from that base-class uses structuremap

589471
children	tree
this will enumerate the tree in a breadth first fashion it will yield the parent element first then it s children and then the children of those children

589472
delphi	c++
you can get turbo delphi and turbo c++ builder explorer editions for free and you can develop with them native application that you can have only .exe file without any dependencies on any windows version from win98 to win7 both of them include more than 200 components and you can use more without installing to ide that the only restriction and you develop with them free and commercial software

589472
delphi	c++
delphi is the most rad rapid application development ide that you can use to produce windows application in very easy and efficient way you get fast developing application with fast execution time compared to speed of c++

589472
linux	unix
another option to use lazarus ide which based on freepascal compiler so you can have your application running on windows linux macos unix and more

589474
handler	service
call the service then.add a request handler fault handler to your service

589477
bug-tracking	trac
but for svn access and bug-tracking we use trac alongside and link to the trac page from the wiki

589478
url-rewriting	query-string
ditch the query-string and use url-rewriting to handle your sections

589503
vb.net	vb6
in the middle of converting vb6 code to vb.net i need to replace the following code that intends to close all open forms remaining in the application

589544
jndi	jdbc
java applications typically use jndi to look up jdbc data sources mail sessions and for authentication and authorizing users

589569
revision	updates
it has all the features updates files based on deltas options to recover or restore old revision of files

589575
32-bit	64bit
i know that it depends on the architecture 16-bit 32-bit 64bit and the compiler

589575
double	int
i tried to find without much success reliable information stating the sizes of char short int long double float and other types i didn t think of under different architectures and compilers

589583
double-quotes	single-quotes
use double-quotes instead of single-quotes in the json you are sending to the service

589585
mocking	stubs
when using a mocking framework always try to use stubs and state based testing before resorting to mocking

589586
unsigned	integer
you can expect std size_t to always represent the unsigned native integer size on current architecture

589586
32-bit	64bit
16-bit 32-bit or 64bit

589586
integer	short
there are five standard signed integer types signed char short int int long int and long long int

589586
unsigned-integer	int
for each of the standard signed int types there exists a corresponding but different standard unsigned-int type unsigned char unsigned short int unsigned int unsigned long int and unsigned long long int each of which occupies the same amount of storage and has the same alignment requirements

589589
getter	setter
make it private name it perfectly and give getter and setter public

589617
asciiencoding	utf8-decode
you can use asciiencoding utf8-decode or any of the other xxxencoding classes in the system.text namespace instead

589618
filtering	grouping
for my purposes i predict that most nodes are visible to most users so i feel that it is acceptable to simply to make the grouping by use the index as the filtering doesn t need it so badly

589618
order	join
the join then deals with the entire list which is already order and only those not visible to the current user which will be a small proportion are removed by the inner join

589619
firefox	safari
jquery takes a lot of the pain out of coding for the incompatibilities and quirks between ie firefox and safari

589650
mocking	stubs
martin fowler speaks about it in mocks aren t stubs especially why mocking reduces dependencies between tests

589664
put	get
then when i put this code into my cvs clearcase i notice that these files get hijacked when a call is made to my service

589674
virtualization	vmware
vmware is going a bit more open by pushing an open virtual appliance format ovf so at some point in the future you might be able to run the result on other virtualization platforms too

589680
pascal	basic
as far as i know it was not required in older versions of say visual basic and pascal

589684
unsigned	short
unsigned short 0 to 65535

589685
32-bit	64bit
for 64bit systems the primary unix de facto standard is lp64 â long and pointer are 64bit but int is 32-bit

589685
32-bit	64bit
the windows 64bit standard is llp64 â long long and pointer are 64bit but long and int are both 32-bit

589698
google-chrome	firefox
this is working well in google-chrome ie but causes a problem in firefox when i right click on an element my function that handles the left click is surprisingly called and then my function that handles the right click is called

589702
javascript	dom
as alessandro mentions in the comment there is a javascript active and since mshtmled.dll is related with dom element manipulations may be that javascript does trigger those mshtmled calls

589708
required	checked
anyway you can actually checked when invoke is required because there s a property for that

589709
cobertura	emma
for code coverage i use cobertura but emma works too emma had an annoyance that cobertura didn t have.

589718
32-bit	64bit
the strange string format on datetime fields on sharepoint list items is a variant of such a 64bit value encoded as two 32-bit hex values

589727
jpedal	pdfbox
pdfbox and jpedal also offer text extraction methods

589728
plasticscm	accurev
try accurev www.accurev.com or perforce www.perforce.com or plasticscm www.plasticscm.com

589739
delphi	vb6
that means that postmessage is the correct way to access a true windows on windowss no matter what you are using vb6 delphi .net or whatever but the different programming languages provide wrappers to make life easier for us

589783
signals	sigint
i had defined my own signals handler for sigint

589786
any	set
if you have access to the server also you can set up healthmonitoring for example which will record any errors which occur on the server side like you posted the 500 internal server error

589795
contains	any
it can cope with any object graph including those that contains enums

589803
order	add
you could add an upload timestamp then order by say

589813
canvas	pixel
your problem is that everything is time based you don t get a callback every time the canvas moves one pixel you get a callback every time a frame is rendered - and the system doesn t even try to hard to render the frames at a constant rate

589816
children	nodes
usually knowing the fitness of a nodes you can deduce the range or even just worst to best case range of fitness of the children

589828
.when	ready
i have a button which .when click should call the jquery dom ready function

589836
malloc	free
i decided to try it out myself and it looked like all i had to do was change a few malloc statements to new statments and replace free with delete

589841
daemons	systemd
i know that ubuntu and fedora uses upstart istead of the classical systemd v init daemons sysvinit

589842
.when	ready
or if you want to call a function only .when the document is ready put the function-call inside

589852
export	report
in our applications we make html documents as report and export

589857
malloc	free
the last line could also be some error with your imagedata but since you said it worked in c and you only replaced malloc free with new delete it s unlikely that something is wrong there anyway you should check this too

589866
puts	gets
if the compression puts a heavy load on the server and or the compression ratio is poor a 20k page gets compressed to 19k then i would consider switching it off

589881
any	set
how the browser deals with any particular file stream even when you set the content type is entirely up to the browser

589888
callback	methods
george since you are using async ws calls you must implement exception-handling in the callback methods

589906
entity-framework	ado.net
i d like to start a reference for people who want to move from linq2sql to linq2entities and the ado.net entity-framework in here called l2e

589906
entity-framework	ado.net
- .net - ado.net entity-framework linq to entities

589909
getter	setter
for a bean it is expected to have getter setter for all member variables

589927
graphviz	doxygen
graphviz is used by the popular code documentation tool doxygen to automatically draw various diagrams for its generated documentation

589938
pointers	stack
primitive value parameters are copied to stack as well as pointers to objects

589955
canvas	scale
3 - use the built in translate and scale methods - possibly the most elegant and fastest solution however it is not intuitive at all it might be difficult to understand how it is being done latter on by me or someone else these methods work on the full canvas first you would translate and scale on the canvas and afterwards everything you draw gets magicly translated and scaled

589956
contains	set
i have a table that contains a set of images stored in blob that require processing

589957
shell	bash
i am compiling from the directory where i created the example file using a simple bash shell command line g++ -wall example.cpp

589959
in-clause	udf
you could pass the list of guids as a comma-separated string parameter and use a table-valued udf to split them into a table to use in your in-clause

589963
parallels	vmware
i haven t tried it with a parallels port but vmware workstation 6 running windows-xp pro on top of a real xp pro host allows me to talk to the serial ports just fine

589968
getter	setter
this is a good approach for me because it means i can call my getter and setter with the type and token methods during serialization deserialization

589974
queue	fifo
do you know any good examples or would you write your own lexer using regular expressions and parsing them using a fifo queue for the embedded messages

590001
python	perl
and nothing in it relies on perl or python so you can easily remove them and install whichever version of python your app prefers to use

590018
selected	checkbox
edit i would only want the selected checkbox to be added to the arrays

590020
double	int
numeric types int decimal double byte 0

590044
postgresql	mysql
all major database engines that is oracle ms sql postgresql and mysql should should in theory support sql-92

590051
unsigned-integer	int
the integral value types byte 1-byte unsigned-int short 2-byte signed int int 4-byte signed int and long 8-byte signed int

590060
multiplication	subtraction
you can solve this with a program exactly the same way you solve it by hand with multiplication and subtraction then feeding results back into the equations

590060
multiplying	subtract
they are the same equation multiplied by two so you cannot get a solution from them - multiplying the first by two then subtract leaves you with the true but useless statement

590067
attributes	properties
we have some xsds in our project that define types that use attributes as well as elements to specify properties values

590070
google-chrome	opera
thanks to web standards all the other browsers you might want to target ie7+ firefox2+ opera safari google-chrome konqueror are generally close enough to intercompatibility that you will rarely need to do much browser detection

590071
hardware	monitor
even if you are dedicating new machines to memcached you ll want to run some other software on them for system management monitor hardware support etc

590071
32-bit	64bit
having said that you will definitely want a 64bit os if you re running memcached - using a 32-bit os is not clever and will mean that most of your ram cannot be used you ll be limited to around 3g depending on the os

590074
solaris	unix
most unix like platforms support the posix api some more some less and if you limit yourself to posix functions the solution will work in linux bsd mac os x solaris and similar oses

590074
linux	bsd
the problem is that not even posix is really offering a set of functions to solve your problem here - the way how a posix tool like ps gets process information is entirely different on a linux system compared to a bsd system for example

590077
any	set
i have a box with some year numbers in them ranging 50 years back and currently when i click on the box the options will reach to the very bottom of the screen is there any way to set the max amount of options a selected box should show before resorting to a scrollbar to show the rest

590079
value	field
i want to find the highest autoincremented value from a field

590099
any	set
when user selected any item from master table we should set updetails.visible true

590107
postgresql	mysql
you will find that some database store datatypes differently for example mysql stores booleans as 1 and 0 and postgresql stores them as t and f

590108
postgresql	mysql
as for dbs popular with php it not that hard make sql portable between mysql sqlite and postgresql

590113
gzip	zip
even a weak cpu like one in a mobile device can effectively decompress gzip zip deflate and so on within almost no time at all

590119
onmousedown	onmouseup
how can i get the id of a html control just by specifying the coordinates of a triggers event like onmousedown onmouseup onclick etc..

590143
type-conversion	int
in php compares values and performs type-conversion if necessary for instance the string 12343sdfjskfjds will become 12343 in an int comparison

590144
contains	elements
if you want to get the html elements where a user clicked without specifying a click event handler on each elements simply specify a click handler on a top level elements one that contains all the other interesting elementss - maybe even document and then look at the mouseevent s target property - it will specify the html elements that received the click initially and not the elements where you specified the onclick event handler this can be gotten to simply by using the this keyword

590147
postgresql	mysql
you don t mention which database you are using so here is a link about information_schema support in mysql postgresql and mssql oracle etc

590148
actionscript	mxml
edit if you re writing the class in actionscript instead of mxml you can apply the metadata tag directly to your class

590154
contains	any
in principle yes file extensions are just part of the filename and can contains any character

590187
headless-browser	htmlunit
htmlunit is a scriptable headless-browser written in java

590197
contains	elements
i don t know jquery but i do know that if you get the selected elements it contains an options object

590214
checkbox	textbox
it has got a few textbox some checkbox and a multiple options dropdown i.e multiple options can be selected

590214
selected	checkbox
someone here told me that i can get values of all selected checkbox using

590214
arrays	loops
then i can loops through all the values returned by the above code assign them to an arrays like this

590216
ironpython	cpython
one of the pros of ironpython is that unlike cpython ironpython doesn t use the global interpreter lock thus making threading more effective

590225
windows-vista	windows
when running my application i am getting a pup-up windows in windowss-vista environment with office-2007 having button ok and cancel button to proceed

590228
configuration	environment
you have to do special things to your environment such as editing configuration files to run it

590231
superclass	subclass
i d like to guarantee that these variables get overridden assign something useful in the subclass that inherits from this superclass at compile time

590257
implements	extends
when i implements an rmi server implements an interface that extends java.rmi.remote is there a way to get information about the current rmi request context specifically the remote client s ip-address

590267
value	field
it s not necessary to iterate over each field to get the form value

590282
url-rewriting	rewrite
one option maybe to use url-rewriting you can add a http module to rewrite the urlsâ on the way out

590289
selected	textbox
a textbox on my form may change depending on what s selected in various drop down lists

590301
javascript	dom
it s the built-in javascript debugger and also lets you examine the dom of your page

590309
firefox	safari
i m doing something similar dragging from the parent doc to drop targets in the iframe and can see the onmouseover events fire for the targets in ie and firefox but not safari

590311
any	set
for any cookies that are used for purposes other than authentication these can be set without the http only flag if you want scripting to be able to modify or read these

590324
hide	show
but if you want to show only accordion heads then hide only contents dd or div or whatever did you use with display none

590345
firefox	opera
the page looks the same to me in firefox 3.0.6 and opera 9.62

590349
revision	svn
each project is under revision control svn

590354
webserver	upload
when users are upload files to your server through a web form and some php script the disk access on the server happens with the user id the webserver is running under usually nobody www-data apache _httpd or even root

590354
.when	ready
some of those problems you may have addressed in your upload scripting but then again understanding of unix file-permissions and where they apply comes usually waaaay at the beginning .when learning about security issues which show that you are probably not ready yet to tackle all of the possible problems

590356
32-bit	64bit
on most cpu architecures 32-bit is faster than 64bit all else being equal

590356
32-bit	64bit
64bit pointers require twice as much bandwidth to transfer as 32-bit

590364
any	set
if you re following the post-redirect-get pattern for your login form already then this setting and checking of the cookie does not add any additional requests - the cookie can be set during the existing redirect and checked by the destination that loads after the redirect

590371
derived-class	base-class
i have a base-class and a derived-class

590371

in a regexp backslash should be double escaped to be correctly interpreted in a string regex

590844

boost	stl
the only argument for increasing productivity with stl i can think of would be a possibility of integrating other libraries easily - boost arabica soci etc

all you need to do to load ruby-on-rails and get access to all your models etc is put require .. .. configuration environment.rb at the top of your file then you re away

592078
buffering	streaming
using a buffering you can asynchronously write to both streaming assuming the streaming support proper asynchronous access

592078
buffering	streaming
as far as i m aware there s no way to copy from one general streaming to another without using a buffering of at least one byte

592092
foundation	cocoa
to add to what others have said much of the foundation is shared between cocoa touch and cocoa

592092
cocoa	uikit
so uikit the cocoa touch framework counterpart to appkit in cocoa makes extensive use of properties

592100
getter	setter
however if you want to perform the formatting in the model you can use wrapper methods for the getter and setter and avoid having to use the value option entirely

592104
communication	messages
the best way to reduce network latency whether database or not service calls for example is to communication in messages rather than crud

592104
profiling	debugging
the debugging book for .net has some info on profiling but it is not very deep

592118
webserver	nginx
additionally you could also try using nginx a webserver which is extremely efficient at serving large files

592125
emacs	vim
having said all this i find emacs meta keys approach a little uncomfortable and a little daunting plus i have spent a lot of time learning to do things in vim

592125
emacs	vim
and if so has anyone else made this switch or used both vim and emacs and have an opinion about which they prefer and why

592161
subtract	time
i m not aware of the specific tools to do this but the basic idea is that you take parallel time slices of the input and output and you subtract the wave form of the output from the input

592163
reflection	runtime
however if you wanted to use an attributes to specify information and access it during runtime via reflection you could do that

592163
reflection	runtime
see creating custom attributess c# programming guide for attributes creation and accessing attributess with reflection c# programming guide for runtime access

592167
javascript	dom
chase is right it doesn t matter how fast you can generate the html via javascript it s the dom insertion that will kill you

592169
json	xml
differences between libraries and platforms are more significant a good xml parser is faster than bad json parser and vice versa

592177
contains	elements
componentgroup elements can contains componentgroupref child elements

592192
web-config	app-config
edit if the idatareader instance is not a sqldatareader then you might be missing the provider attributes of your connection string defined in your app-config or web-config

592196
basic	vba
vba otoh is a very evolutioned basic but still a big pain to do it right

592204
expression-blend	designer
if you are looking for a book from the designer s perspective the best book out there currently is foundation expression-blend 2 by victor guadioso

592231
versioning	upgrade
at work we upgrade a tool when our versioning reaches end of support lifetime

592231
versioning	upgrade
we upgrade to the next-older versioning

592247
contains	any
it doesn t contains any information and it s kind of the base class behind everything

592256
freebsd	linux
however some simple benchmarking shows this is dramatically slower than the pid_exists function on unix-based platforms linux os x freebsd where we re using kill pid 0 with a 0 signal to determine if a pid exists

592262
command-prompt	cmd
i am looking to open up a cmd-prompt and pass in a copy cmd some switches and the source file plus destination

592265
emacs	vim
using emacs doesn t mean you have to stop using vim

592265
emacs	vim
you will always be using the best editor for the job if you re able to choose between vim and emacs

592265
perl	php
i use vim for ruby python perl php bash plaintext and almost everything else

592265
emacs	vim
the only way to know if you like vim or emacs better is to invest time in both so you can make an informed decision

592290
contains	any
i recommend you use the arrays version of exec to avoid handling of quoting should any files or directory contains spaces - or double-quotes - in them

592292
aquamacs	emacs
a very good emacs for mac os x is aquamacs

592297
configuration	installation
trying such stunts like establishing a brand new asp.net web site project copy-paste the source text on it on the same machine - doesn t help or move the project on the second machine with the same vs2005 installation it helps project works normally i m nearly sure there is nothing wrong with my code but with my vs .net configuration

592319
directory	folder
you might want to at least consider putting them in a new folder in the documents directory

592359
windows-xp	windows
i have a connection to an access database that implements msdatashape that works perfectly on windows-xp now when i try to run it on windows vista it game me an error

592370
triggers	insert
if you don t want sql replication you might instead consider writing the insert update deletes from 2000 into a separate table within the same database via the triggers

592386
communication	messages
i think the only way is to create a certificate to use for safe communication security at messages level

592388
jquery	.post
in this case jquery issues a .post request

592409
keyboard	mouse
similarly for input we just substituted the event loop that checked for keyboard and mouse events with the corresponding windows event loop

592410
buffering	streaming
if you are happy to limit your concurrency to the rate of the slowest streaming then this is pretty simple and requires no additional buffering i have written it from memory so might have messed it up a little

592415
instance-variables	local-variables
the internal functions effectively instance methods will have access to the local-variables effectively instance-variables but they will be isolated from the rest of the scripting

592420
firefox	opera
i am using a javascript called facelift 1.2 in one of my websites and while the script works in safari 3 4b and opera omniweb and firefox it does not in any ie version

592424
perl	php
use cgi python php perl or some other method to control the serial port from a page on the webserver

592425
click	mouse
we have a rule in our shop that we never ever ever provide deliverables to a customer that were not produced by a fully automated zero or one step build that means that it took no more than 1 mouse click by a human to baseline build package and release the thing. these fully automated one-step builds work by recognizing when a change is made to your source code control system and automatically triggers the build script.

592428
binary-tree	nodes
what about a full binary-tree where first round starts at the leaf nodes and then moves up

592445
triggers	insert
i m also using a triggers to insert some data when a new item is created

592450
any	set
in the following example it allows us to pass into the addshapetoset methods a set defined to containing any superclass of shape - and we can still insert a shape into it

592455
pascal	delphi
part delphi 1 part turbo pascal

592465
spring	grails
i have just started using grails on a new project...not having to write any xml files yet still have the power of spring and hibernate is truly amazing

592466
python	java
perhaps it would be best to use some of python functional capabilities to try and approximate the existing stylesheet or look into the feasibility of using java instead

592479
innodb	myisam
just checked myisam locks innodb doesn t lock

592481
triggers	insert
there are cases where i might use a triggers to insert some additional data auditing comes to mind though i would tend to avoid this and insert all of the data from my application

592487
export	csv
i am export the table in to the csv file

592487
value	field
the output file will have some extra field along with the normal column value that were returned from the query

592495
access-control	authentication
on windows you ll have to use the various authentication functions to make an acl access-control list with the proper permissions

592496

592508
registration	login
my registration form resides on the same view as the login form

592508
value	field
so when the register action handles the post it no longer finds value for the registration form field and instead returns null

592536
filtering	grouping
if there will be null values of theese fields in table that will became an issue to filtering out useless grouping

592559
fatal-error	crash
for a general guide have a look at these two links fatal-error log troubleshooting and crash course on jvm crash analysis

592566
ip-address	proxy
since your ip-address is in each ip packet that goes over the network and it is required for you to get the response back you cannot prevent your real ip-address from being detected at the server other than by putting a proxy in between

592576
http	ssl
if you d like to read more on flipping over from http to https and vice versa - do take a look at at my writeup on selective ssl -

592592

it supports tcp and udp alike

592595
rhino-mocks	nunit
i just coded this with nunit and rhino-mocks 3.5 to make sure it works

592605

how do i make sure that all the inherited activerecord functions in the derived-classes append the type_id column to the conditional hash on any queries that are executed by the derived-class

592606
logfile	tail
tail -f path to logfile

592618
firefox	safari
alas css does not support rotating images in any way shape or form unless you count css transforms which are only supported by safari 4 and firefox 3.1

592618
svg	vml
your best bet is to use raphael s image and rotate which should support all semi-modern browsers using svg and most versions of ie using vml

592653
base-class	subclass
with your base-class having an initializecomponent methods and your subclass also having one someone is overwriting someone else

592654
any	set
all you have to do is set autopostback to true and if your checkbox is within the updatepanel you shouldnt have any problems

592655
datagridcomboboxcolumn	datagridtemplatecolumn
but any updates to any of my templates columns datagridtemplatecolumn or combobox columns datagridcomboboxcolumn don t work the underlying datasource never gets updatess

is there a way to determine all the dependencies of an .m file and any of the dependencies of the files it calls using a cmd in a script cmd-line

592684
selected	button
i want to do this in html but an example of this are the top left button in the program audacity where you selected the cursor tool mode

592705
radio-button	selected
if the radio-button is selected render background-a else background-b or use a sprite

592706
installation	environment
during installation we specify environment that we are installing on

592716
checkbox	button
using this jquery user-interface plugin you can customize radio button and or checkbox to look however you want

592722
tabcontrol	treeview
in vs 2008 i am attempting to design a windows form that is similar to a set of property pages but uses a treeview to selected the page rather than a tabcontrol

592738
value	field
it doesn t actually set the field of the enum to flaggable value

592740
windows-vista	windows
the core visual basic 6.0 runtime will be supported for the full lifetime of windows-vista windows server 2008 and windows 7 edit and now windows 8 which is five years of mainstream support followed by five years of extended support

592740
windows-vista	windows
the visual basic 6.0 ide will be supported on windows-vista and windows server 2008 as part of the visual basic 6.0 extended support policy until april 8 2008

592742
configuration	logging
for example the log4net logging framework offers such a mechanism for its configuration file

592757
put	get
i am happy to put this text data in the datatable or in the datagridview after binding but i can t see a way to put this text data in either as the column formats for both require numeric data - i get a can t put a string in a decimal error for both

592779
user-controls	ascx
when the user clicks radio button different user-controls ascx files should be injected inside the form hopefully using ajax

592783
gridex	janus
i ve used the janus gridex for this type of non-standard behaviour

592787
environment	building
you can set up building for your different environment

592799
rollback	commit
all the online resources i ve found are either syntaxical references or dummy tutorials explaining that a transaction begins with begin tran and ends with a commit or with a rollback

592807
double-quotes	single-quotes
yes it is just escape your single-quotes inside of the double-quotes that you have in your javascript

592830
firefox	opera
i have tested this on firefox opera and seamonkey

592837
javascript	dom
no nor is it guaranteed you can fiddle with dom objects prototypes in javascript in general

592870
sql-server	oracle
for sql-server inside sql-server 2009 mspress is where i got enough detail to know most of the time i do not need that level of detail and also working with people with decades of oracle specialisation

592890
external	host
i m now looking for a way to host this app external so that other organisations who don t wish to host it themselves can use it each new client would have their own installation

592892
administration	account
he should be able to add modify delete these account kind of like the theory of how a google-apps administration manages the account for his company you are a regular user but also create destroy other users.

592906
dictionary	arrays
that s because the arrays and dictionary live beyond the scope of this method

592906
dictionary	arrays
the arrays and dictionary class methods create autoreleased instances of nsarrays and nsmutabledictionary objects

592911
selected	listbox
is it possible to always keep selected item in the middle of a listbox

592912
order	join
i assume if you use a list hibernate assumes that the order is important and it will deduce the order of elements from the rows returned but if you join with a nother table hibernate will get each campaign multiple times which confuses hibernate

592913
put	get
the get and put principle that julien cites is a great answer to this question but i don t think it makes much sense unless you see it in the context of an example. here s my take at an expanded version of the get and put principle for when to use wildcards

592922
background-image	background-color
they define their own background-color but not background-image overriding the color in the body

592923
python	ruby
same goes for ruby and python

592932
push	pull
there are only two secure ways that i can think of use svn by way of an ssh tunnel or use svn to pull push via ssl-enabled http via a webserver

592957
background-image	background-color
background-image and background-color are sub-properties of the background property

592957
firefox	safari
css3 allows you to set the opacity of the background using the rgba expression but ie doesn t support this firefox 3 and safari webkit do

592960
any	set
any class in the project that may need to set or retrieve a user preference from a persistent store is to call the static-methods on this class

592963
versioning	upgrade
one of the other good things about the abl is that it is extremely backwards compatible no vb6 nightmares when we upgrade versioning although some may say this backwards compatibility is a fault

592976
configparser	configobj
for the revised question of how to read in configuration parameters i d strongly recommend saving yourself some time and effort and use configparser or my preferred tool configobj

592990
contains	any
i haven t checked to see if the pre-release .net 4.0 bits contains any apis like pure or immutable in the contracts apis

592995
account	api
this way you use a jabber api to send messages on one account your local jabber account and then the server will pass through the gateways to the various protocols

593003
any	set
however i believe not tested that this would apply to any text inside the elements as well so you would likely need a second class to set the opacity back to 1 for the text inside the table etc

593014
destroy	self
be aware that there are additional complications with shared pointers in particular in multithreading environment your reference counting must be atomicity and self assignment must be handled to avoid increment the internal count such that the object is never destroy

593030
compression	streaming
i believe that the classes in the system.io.compression namespace are fine for compression decompression a single streaming of data but there s nothing built into the framework to cope with actual zip files

593034
binary-serialization	deserialization
perhaps it is being binary-serialization or deserialization somewhere

593038
constructor	object
for example when you have an object that may be either created via a constructor or from a another object like a dto via a factory method

593038
constructor	object
lately i ve moved to only using default constructor and using property settors to initialize the object

593049
attributes	properties
is it possible to create properties or attributes for a class in visual basic i am using visual basic 2005

593094
wicket	lift
however i strongly prefer wicket and or lift especially the latter

593109
favicon	web
well a bookmarklet that needs to be tied in to whatever domain for the current page you are watching cannot be also tied in to a favicon on your own web site

593147
uilabel	uiview
my first impulse is to create a semi-transparent uiview place a uilabel and a uiprogressindicatorview inside it and add it to the view hierarchy.

593147
calayer	uiview
should i roll my own progress indicator that animates a calayer instead of a uiview

593151
attributes	properties
a framework such as wpf can optionally map one of its properties to xaml s x name by using the runtimenamepropertyattributes on the class that designates one of the classes properties as mapping to the x name attributes of xaml

593151
value	field
all x name means to xaml is generate a field to store the value in the code behind class

593153
javascript	dom
if you re executing javascript on page you have access to the entire dom

593160
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
while the sqldatareader is being used the associated sqlconnection is busy serving the sqldatareader and no other operations can be performed on the sqlconnection other than closing it

593160
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
thus i donâ t see how or why sqlconnection should still be serving sqldatareader object

593161
deployment	install
amongst other components it included a deployment project which built a couple of executables plus dependencies including this library into an windows install msi

593161
deployment	install
clicking yes opens up the url specified in the deployment project and clicking no cancels the install

593171
contains	any
does my person class need to implement any interfaces for list t contains t to work properly

593179
debugging	trace
if you mean the output to the debugging trace windows you can capture this at runtime with debuggingview without running visual-studio

593184
gethashcode	equals
you should override equals and gethashcode methods

593224
bison	yacc
you can use normal context-free parsing generators such as yacc bison to generate regular language parsing even if the atoms are not characters

593265
contains	elements
the lists usually contains very few elements between one and five but are sometimes as long as fifty elements

593266
value	field
and you can set and access the field value by the properties of the objects

593289
zend-framework	cakephp
click this zend-framework or that cakephp or maybe even this recess framework

593306
attributes	properties
i then made the attributes to go on each properties

593306
attributes	properties
in my case all this is hidden away in a base class so in the subclasses you just put the attributes on the properties

593306
attributes	properties
finally you set the attributes on the affected properties

593310
sql-server	oracle
i doubt theirs stand up to oracle s or sql-server s

593316
32-bit	64bit
if you re on 64bit os you need to create a 32-bit odbc data source the 64bit odbc data sources are invisible to access which is a 32-bit app

593395
authentication	login
if the sha-2 signatures match then you can assume that the user is authentication otherwise force the user to login again

593395
ip-address	proxy
moreover a user accessing the internet from behind a pool of proxy or using tor may be kicked out by your system every time a different proxy or exit node with a different ip-address forwards a request

593397
moss	wss
in fact sharepoint doesn t really have it s own authentication mechanisms at least assuming we re talking about wss 3 moss here

593411
fontfamily	font-size
i have a problem on some controls such as label where i have set font-size fontweight fontfamily etc

593411
fontfamily	font-size
all value are working as expected except font-size and fontfamily don t seem to be working correctly at runtime

593411
fontfamily	font-size
at design time font-size and fontfamily seem to change to the value i have set.

593411
fontfamily	font-size
i have tried to capture the style of each control at runtime and i found that the value of font-size and fontfamily are correct same value as i have set

593415
postgresql	oracle
database independent - by using inline sql or a generate dal both ansi compliant it is easier to switch from oracle to postgresql to sql server etc

593424
asterisk	pbx
asterisk the open source pbx uses the spandsp library to implement faxing

593452
payment	billing
in an electric company where i was hired temporary we have to implement an upgrade of the billing and payment system the current system is a dbaseiii system

593452
payment	billing
the company served several towns and have billing and payment centers in selected towns

593459
vb.net	vb6
visual-studio did all of the necessary service plumbing setup for the framework and i found c# very easy to learn migrating from vb6 vb.net and c

593461
firefox	safari
alas they re not yet present in all released browsers i think the latest betas of safari firefox and ie have support for some of these features but i m not sure which browsers support which apis

593462
object-reference	instances
i get this error object-reference not set to an instances of object error when i execute this piece of code

593463
waveform	pcm
what i would like to do is extract the actual waveform pcm of an mp3 file so that i can play it using the soundcard of course

593472
contains	set
would you consider summing up the list of values to obtain an integer which can be used as a precheck of whether different list contains the same set of values

593498
global-variables	call
and in another class i want to call this global-variables

593507
common-lisp	lisp
i am not firm in emacs lisp but as far as i know a big difference from common-lisp is that it uses dynamic scoping throughout

593508
double	int
you are taking two int values and storing it in a double without typecasting.

593510
telnet	ssh
the handler is not being called if i ssh telnet into the machine where the module is loaded

593518
pointers	stack
you can read proc child-pid stat to get a lot of low-level process information including the current state the amount of user kernel time the process has been scheduled the current stack and instruction pointers etc.

593519
return-value	undefined
when you use the parentheses you re actually invoking the function and you re sending the function result in this case undefined because myalert doesn t have a return-value as the parameter

593531
installshield	orca
it provides invaluable low-level knowledge using visual-studio setup projects and orca that applies no matter if you re using wix installshield or any other tool to build msi files

593577
cos	sin
for instances instead of sin a or cos a if your application doesn t necessarily need angles to be very precise maybe you represent angles in 1 256 of a circle and create arrays of floats sine and cosine precalculating the sin and cos of those angles

593580
deployment	install
not to start a flame war but i ve standardized on using wix for all my deployment packages outside of doing old-school com interop type stuff since that s a brunt of work to get to install correctly

593591
blockui	jqmodal
i did proof of concept modal dialogs with both jqmodal and blockui and i can say without a doubt that blockui is the thinnest of them

593594
silverlight	wpf
considering it sounds like you will be programming on a windowss based system and have deployment access to windowss server based hardware why not either build a silverlight application or build a wpf application that s hosted in an ie windows

593605
firefox	safari
i m using some asp.net controls in my project especially webcombo grid for inline editing and i face t working good in firefox and ie6 but not in safari throwing exceptions

593608
contains	elements
isn t iter supposed to be a pointer to an elements of the type that it s containser is supposed to contains

593627
click	mouse
using javascript how can i distinguish between a left and right mouse button click in ie and firefox

593655
decrement	increment
to clarify further on msn s answer you can think of the iterator as a wrapper to an individual item of the containers but it also has some smarts for increment ++iter decrement ++iter etc

593664
decrement	increment
decrement and disable only if 0 increment and enable if 0

593666
value	field
in your delegate respond to the textdidchange message too lazy to look up the exact name by taking the text field s new value and converting it to a number

593666
value	field
on every key press the label will be updated so the user will feel as though she is editing the formatted value when she is really editing the hidden text field

593673
ruby-on-rails	django
have you seriously looked at what tdd ci pair-programming and a solid rapid development framework basicaly django or ruby-on-rails can offer to you as a developer vis-a-vis the way you write and design code

593697
arrays	loops
it s hard to tell what compilers will do with that kind of thing but usually having less loops iteration variables arrays indexes will end up with better asm output

593705
numerical	matrix
show them some example programs with a view to things that will be helpful for math numerical methods matrix multiplication etc

593717
spring	grails
we are using grails + on the web layer + java with hibernate and spring on the service layer

593737
show	next
function - show next span if next

593738
profiling	debugging
run btrace scripts to add run-time profiling debugging advice to your code

593752
contains	any
you could also try giving an explicit securitydomain and probably applicationdomain so any contains classes are seperate as well in the optional loadercontext parameter to loader.load to try to prevent it adding event listeners outside if you don t trust the clip not to and avoid forming any references to anything from the clip so it can be garbage collected - but apparantly it might still not unload in some cases

593755
triggers	insert
we use the following oracle triggers snippet to determine what to do with the surrogate key on insert

593760
windows-xp	windows
i m using windows-xp but a solution for any windows machine would be welcome

593762
configuration	environment
as it says you can enforce overflow checking more globally via a compiler setting or environment configuration

593763
sql-server	oracle
there is also an article on simulating oracle sequences in sql-server here

593764
telnet	ssh
screen provides several virtual ttys you can switch between without having to open new ssh telnet etc sessions

593781
value	field
the closest way to emulate the oracle methods is to have a separate table with a counter field and then write a user defined function that queries this field increments it and returns the value

processor	cpu
in terms of changing the amount of cpu resources a process can use if you don t mind the granularity of per-core limiting of resources task manager can change the processor affinity of a process

593790
processor	affinity
if the development machine has many cores but the user machine only has one then rather than allowing the process to run on all the available cores set the process processor affinity to only one core

593807
host	dns
i am running a blog at posterous.com and they can host my domain name if i create an a record to their ip in my domain registrar s custom dns tool

593808
stored-procedures	ado.net
one disadvantage i see is that it adds another layer of code and my understanding is that it has slower performance than using stored-procedures and ado.net

593823
javascript	dom
the task you re looking to do is straightforward in pure javascript but if you re doing any additional dom traversal jquery is going to save you countless hours of frustration

593823
children	nodes
it looks for any element with an id of nodes then returns its children

593830
bmp	png
java can display png jpg a some other picture formats but i have to display a bmp file in a jlable by getting the file path

593830
png	gif
imageicon support the typical png gif jpg images

593848
user-stories	waterfall
i didn t put in user-stories as this would probably have been a bit too airy fairy for people with a traditional waterfall background

593853
constructor	object
if that s what want you can just compare the object s constructor to the constructor that you think created it

593853
constructor	object
javascript doesn t have a type system like c# does that guarantees you that a variables will have certain members if it s created by a certain constructor because javascript is a pretty dynamic languages and anything that an object gets from its constructor can be overwritten at runtime

593857
rewrite	rule
alternative idea if your dns registrar provides free-of-charge web service in addition do the redirection there add a rewrite rule to translation the request path to a scripting arguments and for each request generate a simple page with an iframe accessing the real content

593873
python	java
it support c++ java and python

593879
getter	setter
how do i unit test a property with a setter and a getter like surname in the example

593879
getter	setter
writing a test that uses the setter to test the getter and vice versa is not good because if there is a fail i won t know which methods to blame

593898
put	get
this will be combined with a bigger query but for now all i need is this to get started i ll try to figure out how to put it all together on my own

593901
put	get
the only problem with that is you can t put in something like hibernate without qualification as you get too many false positives

593903
getter	setter
don s waste your time on writing silly tests for getter and setter

593924
profiling	debugging
the debugging and profiling system of the xdk is also an amazing tool which is not available using xla

593931
boost	stl
stl and boost may seem logical to some and should be part of most but i worked with mfc for years before ever using templates

593932
if-statement	for-loop
while you do have the full power of python in sage the reality is the odd for-loop and some if-statement is really all of the programming most mathematicians will do with sage most of the time though there is a significant minority who will do a lot more

593932
maple	sage
they mostly use maple and mathematica but most of this work translation to sage

593932
python	java
i recognize that this is java and not python but their are a lot of advantages to this approach

593943
google-chrome	firefox
both work fine in firefox and google-chrome

593945
getter	setter
testing getter and setter is an absolute waste of time unless there is something complex going on behind them....which is rarely the case

593963
32-bit	64bit
another thing worth considering would be if you are ona 32-bit platform port to a 64bit system and get a box with much more addressable ram

593988
display	height
but if i just set the height of the row to the height that the details will have according to my style the display of row with details will be cropped on top and make the row slider behind the row or header above

593989
getter	setter
if we had setter for name and surname but only a getter for fullname the test could look like this

593992
bmp	ico
imag4j can convert bmp and ico files to bufferedimage objects you can display in java

593995
xml-binding	jibx
i am using jibx as a java object to xml-binding tool

594010
microsoft-cognitive	bing
the old bing search api has been retired in favor of bing image search api from microsoft-cognitive services from which you can perform 1000 queries for 1 month for free then at least 3 months for 1000 queries other paid options available

594010
json	xml
you ll have to first get an api key from the search developer center and then you ll be able to run queries such as this one that returns json or this one that returns xml

594019
filtering	sorting
i want to have different sorting and filtering applied on my view

594019
filtering	sorting
i figured that i ll be passing sorting and filtering params through query string

594019
filtering	sorting
i want when user pressed sorting link after he applied some filtering - filtering is not lost so i need a way to combine my params

594024
decrement	increment
you could decrement count until it reaches zero instead of increment i until it reaches count but it s arguable whether that would be an improvement or not

594065
webserver	host
no you can t do this with dns - the result of the dns query doesn t change what happens in the http layer so the originally entered domain name will always be the one that s sent to the webserver in the host header

594079
persistence	hibernate
is it possible to use hibernate as glassfish s persistence provider and if so how

594088
sqldatasource	gridview
i want to insert a new row to gridview while i click new button with out using the sqldatasource

594093
stream	send
but this is fairly hairy stuff - you have to cope with how you send the keystrokes on you affect every process in the system because your code is effectively inserted in the input stream it involves writing a native dll.

594094
gnome	kde
it could probably be done using a canvas or textbox component in a full-screen windows on whatever windows manager you are using kde or gnome

594109
contains	elements
std vector does call the destructor of every elements it contains when clear is called

594115
hard-drive	floppy
when the user inserted the floppydisc into another computer and rebooted without remembering to remove the floppy the virus was run and infected the hard-drive bootsector thus permanently infecting the host pc

594120
stored-procedures	ado.net
if you later see that some areas of the application are to slow you can analyze these parts and in some cases even swap some linq queries with stored-procedures or ado.net

594120
stored-procedures	ado.net
in my opinion debugging linq2sql is much easier than both stored-procedures and ado.net

594127
sqldatasource	gridview
here s a good sample how to easily insert row in gridview with sqldatasource

594161
python	perl
perl python offer better utility

594162
traffic	packets
one would be monitor all traffic and just selectively work with the syn packets doing nothing with the rest

594214
windows-xp	windows
the setup experience provides a consistent user interface ui and seamless installation whether the target operating system is windows-xp or windows vista

594253
delphi	c++
i am a developer working on visual c++ but in my project there are some delphi components

594262
google-chrome	safari
also my javascript focus request is currently not working with safari google-chrome browser so what is most compatible way to request focus and keep it

594267
uitableview	uiview
as usually at the navigation based template show uitableview page at first but i would like to show other controller page at the starting of this app that uiview page

594277
sql-server	oracle
the db backend will be oracle or sql-server that s a political decision to be taken at the top our department has no influence on it

594278
click	mouse
i need to know what was the mouse button click when a qlistview click signal is emitted

594294
tokenize	parsing
where parsing could be defined using ply pyparsing builtin tokenize parsing ast

594297
contains	any
the container.addcomponent methods would not need to be called as there would have been some initial step that did some auto wiring by looking in a known directory for any dlls contains classes that implemented isomecomponent and registered them with the windsorcontainer

594306
web-config	app-config
when using configurationmanager i m pretty sure it is loading the process appdomain configuration file app-config web-config

594312
wikipedia	scrape
another theoretical approach you could scrape the random wikipedia article page and return the n-th word of the article

594323
value	field
so in my app i have different value in nonce field while in firefox this field is the same

594323
value	field
on the other hand i have same value in nc field while firefox increments this field

594342
integer	short
in short the variables a points to an integer whose value you cannot change

594342
void	main
void main is not a standard signature for main in c or c++

594378
contains	any
they may contains any

594379
integer	zero
it sounds like you just want to remove leading zero unless there s only one left 0 for an integer or 0.xxx for a float where x can be anything

594391
put	get
my activex control is coded in c++ and i already know how to create properties by implementing hard-coded c++ get and put functions

594395
windows-xp	windows
i found this when i was searching for similar thing for windows-xp i think this should apply for windows 2003

594436
double	int
in this case there is an implicit-cast from int to decimal or double - because there is no loss of precision when you do the cast - so the compiler doesn t complain but the value you get is always 0 presumably since trackbar.value is always less than 5000

594443
contains	set
the initial text is static a short set of instructions how to use this field so that there is no obvious possibility for an attacker to construct an url contains malicious javascript for this textarea

594444
keyboard	mouse
using the mouse and keyboard rather than watching is what builds muscle memory and ingrained responses

594444
environment	building
you might need the right environment variables set up to properly building the code or whatever

594446
mouseleave	mouseenter
ajax bind functions to the mouseenter mouseleave events of every main cell there you use ajax to get the detail table from the server and display in a positioning preferably on a fixed place or maybe a few pixels to the right of the cursor if it s a small table

594463
ruby	php
is this the same for ruby or php

594463
ruby	php
do you need to learn two languages technologies to make web applications not including xhtml css xml or do you just learn php ruby

594463
ruby	php
for a beginner to start with php ruby rather than asp.net and c# vb because you can spend your time learning one rather than two languages

594464
javascript	dom
all attacks are client-side and other than social any client-side attack that could modify your dom or call javascript on your page doesn t need this to do xss

594466
double	int
so i asked myself can a double be faster than a int

594469
ruby	php
this is just like php and ruby

594470
sortedlist	hashtable
edit while trying to attack this problem from a different angle i am changing my master hashtable to a sortedlist

594500
double	int
about int vs.double may be gpu does faster arithmetic with double then regular cpu but i doubt it does double arithmetic faster then int since int arithmetic is just registers arithmetics

594541
textbox	button
i am a newbie in programming and i want to write a program in visual-studio with using c# language which uses a textbox and a button only

594541
textbox	button
when the user writes string a in the textbox and presses the button the program shows integer 5 in a messagebox

594542
environment	building
stl however is not guaranteed to be present in all building environment

594544
webforms	asp.net
you can t use webforms controls in asp.net mvc in a trivial manner because they rely on things that are stripped out in mvc

594546
any	set
now i want to access any elements in this row and set the color of that row based on values

594552
double	int
you could say that adding two int takes this many cycles adding two double takes this many cycles etc

594573
google-chrome	safari
unfortunately i don t know enough about integration with safari or google-chrome to help you with your second question

594582
cout	cin
i m taking some c++ tests and they are littered with cin and cout s

594583
multiplying	subtract
you convert the character insertered a b or c to int subtract 70 multiplying it with -1 and display the value in the messagebox

594590
cout	cin
yes as long as console applications exist cout and cin will exist

594598
.when	ready
was work on the trunk only started .when it did because the project plan said the current release would be ready to ship therefore it was shipped

594601
cout	cin
no such questions are not very relevant but yes people use std cin and std cout all the time

594615
cout	cin
if you only ever write gui or web-applications in your career you probably won t have much use for cin and cout

594636
python	ruby
you should take a look at python ruby or groovy

594639
32-bit	64bit
at the cpu level there are no bytes only words which are 32-bit or 64bit nowadays

594639
variables	boolean
in order to avoid this most compilers will actually use a full word of memory for all smaller variabless so even a boolean variables takes up 32 or 64 bits

594640
constructor	object
of course you can t implement java like this because the library unfortunately exposes constructor for string s and most other immutable value object

594665
micro-optimization	benchmarking
and ditto to what daniel said - don t go looking for micro-optimization like this until you have benchmarking your code and discovered that it s worth doing

594670
listbox	textbox
in the first we needed a consistent valuechanged event so that we could easily implement a dirty flag on our forms without a massive switch statement to choose between a textbox s textchanged event or a listbox s selectedindexchanged etc

594670
put	get
all three have the same effect in the end you get a new type of button to put on your forms

594692
any	set
is there some way in which i can set it to 0 if the the yaml file doesnt contain any value for that instance variables

594692
callback	methods
is there some callback methods that is called on object after it has been loaded from disk

594714

594730
data-members	instances
all instances of this class will now have the same shared data-members

594730

how do i do a git-status so it doesn t display untracked files without using gitignore

594766
revision	updates
which is why it is vital to updates the revision numbers when you add to the interface

594766
basic	vb6
optionally you can opt to store strings as vb6 like most basic variants can freely convert between numbers and strings

594768
filtering	sorting
your data sounds quite relational and the data stuff has a lot of filtering sorting linking functionality

594778
specifications	w3c
according to the w3c specifications

594778
checkbox	button
checkbox and radio button are

594782

594792
silverlight	wpf
the is stuff that is related to xaml and can be reused on other frameworks like wf silverlight wcf where as the contains stuff purely designed for wpf

594804
aggregate	grouping
in aggregate and grouping expression the selected clause can contains only aggregates and grouping expression

594812
hide	show
i was looking for that as well and i now just got used to using full screen shift+alt+enter which hide a little too much which you seem to think as well but does in fact still show the menus

594820
selected	checkbox
i need to analyze the posted info only if they selected a checkbox

594821
google-chrome	firefox
this code works 100 ok with firefox and ie7 but google-chrome and safari do not seem to move the focus at all

594822
put	get
overall i think you need to put your foot down and get them to code it right without stifling their creativity

594828
contains	lookup
when you selected one it populates the rest of the form with a lookup contains additional items

594828
worksheet	excel
there s no vba code no macros no data connections and only one worksheet displayed in excel while the lookup code references a sheet1

594860
arguments	default
in other words if there isn t an arguments on the lang variables you can just set it to be eng automatically and so the first page will default to english every time unless told otherwise

594868
ruby	php
form as php or jsp or ruby or ..

594870
jquery-plugins	jquery
i get this problem in ie7 when running a piece of code that uses jquery and 2 jquery-plugins

594871
selected	checkbox
you could write your own function which checks whether said checkbox is selected and applies the validation manually

594916
controller	routes
note that routes don t have to map directly to controller action but it keeps things simple

594933
rhino-mocks	nunit
i m not familiar with rhino-mocks but i can tell you how to do this with nunit s built-in mock library nunit.mocks

594944
attributes	properties
i don t even remember the much of the details of default properties - but i think vb6 clients support them well and all you had to be was set some attributes in your idl odl file

594945
linux	unix
also for my particular needs just the whole system font being different has caused numerous scripting issues b w windows and unix linux

594955
any	set
take into consideration that the set is not sorted it is a set after all and this is the given each isinset n operation takes o n as well bringing you to o n 2 for the entire operation if you choose any algorithm for prodding the set at certain places.

594957
scalar	min
note how the gauges are remarkably similar they all take a scalar value from somewhere and represent it by moving a needle to a positioning between min and max

594970
selected	cells
in excel 2007 selected one of the cells with the drop-down click on the data tab in the ribbon click on data validation in the ribbon and see what you have

595017
conditional	operators
use a regular if conditional rather than the ternary operators

595048
lighttpd	apache
apache for dynamic and lighttpd for static content is one typical example

cygwin	gnu
if you re missing a lot of linux -- and you need to stay on a windows box to interact with your team and your work application -- install cygwin and the gnu win32 tools

595058
children	nodes
if at any point you reach a nodes which has no children mark it as a root

595067
duplex	was
when we wanted to programmatically find the speed and duplex settings on network cards it was very difficult

595084
haskell	ocaml
my understanding is that haskell ocaml etc

595086
javascript	dom
various javascript frameworks have utilities to tell you when the dom is ready

595093
contains	elements
this means you will have to modify your selected elements to contains the department ids as the options values

595095
arrays	loops
it simply does the checks i would do anyway to be sure and the size value usage makes dry automatically implemented for example i use the size in loops so that future changes of the arrays declaration will automatically work

595106
cvs	git
what are your best practices and tips for using git to interface with a cvs repository

595107
contains	set
one nice option would be for the hosting company such as discountasp.net to set up the master.config or a higher level web.config to support asp.net-mvc so that my web.config would only need to contains my simple application settings

595108
visual-studio	release-mode
it was compiled with visual-studio 2008 in 32-bit release-mode using o2 optimizations and run on vista x64

595179
protected	public
can someone please explain to me what is the difference between protected public inner-classes

595179
protected	public
but from what i can tell there is no difference between using protected or public modifiers

595179
protected	public
all of this compiles and is valid whether i declare innerfoo protected or public

595179
protected	public
please point me out a case where there s a difference in using protected or public

595186
protected	public
in the example show the public and protected will have the same effect as they are in the same package

595202
pointers	stack
the variables myclass is a pointers which is a local variables that is defined on stack

delphi	basic
in this about.com article you can find a basic explanation of pointers in delphi

595223
silverlight	wpf
this really relates to creating a library that works across both wpf and silverlight

595223
silverlight	wpf
the wpf toolkit includes an implementation of the visualstatemanager included with silverlight and if the visualstatemanager can do what the multitrigger in wpf does that solves my problem

595234
pascal	delphi
this applies to many languages including object pascal delphi

595268

595274
.when	ready
i want the user to .post an image to the server and load it back into the page .when its ready all this without leaving the page

595285
pagination	filtering
you have to store the filtering in the popped up page so they can be resent along with pagination information

595285
postback	ajax
what i would do to solve this is create a static page that has the filters in place and work out the ajax kinks separate from having the page postback to a parent page

595295
scp	ssh
you can just scp 1 a git repository to your local machine if you have ssh access to the machine on which the git repository resides

595297
contains	any
not having any experience with this type of problem but i think a very naive implementation would be to tokenize the search term and search for matches that happen to contains any of the tokens

595336
order	add
we have a free simple tool you can use as well - it is called scripting executor - the community edition allows you to add individual scriptinging and folders contains scriptinging order them and execute

595344
difference	zero
the gains you d get by not doing it are likely so small that they would make zero difference even in a mobile environment

595345
bison	yacc
looks like it shouldn t be too hard to generate a simple parsing using yacc and bison and integrate it into your code

595350
sql-server	oracle
i need to sync data between sql-server and an oracle

595351
cout	cin
i ve worked on many professional applications and we ve not used cin or cout on any of them even for logging debugging

595365
firefox	safari
iâ m assuming itâ s a windows bug rather than a browser bug since firefox and safari both support it as long as itâ s not on windows

595388
data-access	nhibernate
i like to keep my data-access simple typically using an or m like nhibernate so i don t want to do anything goofy there that might change my expectation of how the data-access layer works as a developer i would expect all calls to the dal to actually hit the db and not a cache unless it was the or m s cache and that s an implementation detail i don t care about

595389
sql-server	oracle
from memory they introduced rowid when they wanted to support different db engines - oracle sql-server et al - from the 4gl which implies that there is more in a rowid than a recid

595406
lookup	any
if your application does any thing with gui xml rendering internet connections or other external manipulation your ll find that these activities dwarf the simple mathod lookup by a huge factors

595421
getter	setter
for classes that have several setter and getter besides other methods is it reasonable to save time on writing unit tests for the accessors taking into account that they will be called while testing the rest of the interface anyway

595426
solaris	bsd
is there anything alike for free .net open bsd solaris windows

595434
authentication	login
when an user clicks a link in my site that requires authentication the browser is redirected to the login page

595434
authentication	login
the problem is that if the user authentication using openid the providers redirects the user back to the login page and doesn t include the returnurl parameter which is pretty boring because i redirect the user to the home page instead of the page that was tried

595439
stripes	grails
web client write once any asp.net-mvc framework will work stripes struts even grails if you are brave rememder to keep it thin..

595441
samba	vfs
a simple solution is to use the native smb client for each of your target platforms then use that to mount a custom samba filesystem implemented using samba s vfs api

595441
linux	unix
custom nfs servers have been used to implement cross platform unix virtual file systems but smb is a much better choice to support windows and linux

samba	vfs
if you need the vfs to access client-side resources you must run the samba server with your vfs on the client and then use a loopback or localhost network to mount the drive

595443
getter	setter
if the accessors are simple getter setter i d say testing them is wasting your time

595461
swing	awt
stick to updating swing components and swing text objects in the awt event dispatch thread edt

595470
javascript	dom
this is part of some sort of javascript library that i ve been working on so if you find working with javascripton + dom try searching google code for jdatastore

595473
value	field
when the user presses the button you have two choices a let the browser do its usual thing so send the value in the form field to the page specified in action in this case the url is defined by php_self which is the current page.php

595474
font-size	height
i would like to adjust the height each textbox based on the number of lines it is holding the font-size and the font in order to avoid using scrollbar on each textbox

595477
contains	any
not contains any code that might break

595477
getter	setter
when they are not simply generated getter and setter

595500
debugging	exit
when i run the program in debugging and exit when i return to the form in visual-studio it has my three columns plus all the columns in the table it s linked to

595500
show	next
if i don t remove these the next time i run the program they show up on the form

595502
web-services	webserver
for the swing framework you have two options access the businesslogic through web-services you could use rmi or whatever but i wouldn t the logic is on the same webserver that serves the webapp i d probably prefer that

595507
getter	setter
i m working in vs2008 and c# and i m looking for a free code generator tool to generate a property with getter and setter as well as the backing private field to go with

595513
contains	elements
from the javadoc for contains nullpointerexception is thrown - if the specified elements is null and this collection does not permit null elementss optional

595529
python	c++
if you want to get out of the c++ programming pool there is scapy for python

595537
getter	setter
how to generate getter and setter in visual-studio

595540
virtualization	vmware
you can either use a virtualization product like vmware or just have a secondary box to multi-boot for windows and linux

595569
temporary	copy
typically to update a program which is running you would copy over any of the files that are to be replaced to a temporary folder

595569
temporary	copy
this allows for minimal down time of the application since the longest part is usually the copy and the file move is very fast if the temporary folder is on the same logical drive

595588
json	xml
what i would suggest you consider is to perhaps use client side json or an xml data island as the data source to store all the changes the user is making and then once they hit the main submit button send this payload to the server and handle all the database updates in a single batch or round trip

595606
integer	zero
to be sure that would be true to the zero is false interpretation of integer results but it would complicate the logic of sorting because having established that the two strings were not the same you would still need to learn which came earlier

595618
authentication	login
in my asp.net-mvc app i have a user controller with authentication action which handles login requests

595626
contains	any
the only exception-handling is that the compiler still generates initialization code to load floating point constants so any structure contains floating point numbers ends up in a writable section

595638
udp	tcp
if a few bits were flipped in the ip header during transit and a packet changed course but the ip checksum was still correct the tcp udp stack of the redirected receiver can still know to reject the packet

595639
shell	bash
why don t you execute a non-interactive bash shell which runs ruby from your .net application

595641
perl	php
while jsp was clearly built to be the view or presentation part of a java webapplication with as little controlling logic as possible php started out as something like perl but far more focused on web development

595646
arrays	loops
let s say i have an arrays of objects and i want to loops through them to see if the objects contain certain values and if so i want to stop the loops

595646
for-loop	loops
which is better practice - a for-loops with a break or a conditional loops

595649
dictionary	arrays
you must create real model objects not just pass primitive objects arrays of dictionary around

595649
instance-variables	accessor
you must only change properties of your model objects by their properties or by accessor messages never by direct instance-variables access

595649
instance-variables	accessor
obvious exception-handling for accessor methods themselves if you ve written your own because they must access the instance-variables directly.

595660
solaris	unix
on linux and i believe solaris and other unix operating systems java s file.renameto method will overwrite the destination file if it exists but this is not the case under windows

595663
order	add
if you want a specific order you either need to add an order by clause that will use some scoring methods you create or you must order them in the program that receives the records

595667
extends	super
it s also super easy to use and super easy to extends

595686
cvs	git
git cvsimport uses this to access cvs history

595686
cvs	git
we found that for a large project inital set-up was much faster by taking a full copy of the cvs repo onto your computer and doing the git cvsimport locally

595691
nested	order
unfortunately the query is complex due to nested selected that are needed to enforce the desired rownum order by precedence

595693
for-loop	loops
i would choose for-loops when there is known number maximum number of iterations before loops starts

595694
dialog	pop-up
say you want to pop-up a confirmation dialog before sending an email

595701
collapse	sidebar
in outlook when the panels is collapse and the sidebar is click it used to popup the selected navigationitem content

595714
while-loop	loops
note that i would still avoid using break in a while-loops however as this can muddle the loops condition and make it confusing

595714
while-loop	loops
if you ll allow me to use a foreach loops i consider the code below to be a lot easier to read than its while-loops brother

595729
dictionary	arrays
auto release on my dictionary arrays is happening thus my app crashing

595729
put	get
coming back to your actual question that of a deep-copy you need to get the sub-elements of every element and put them in each element s dictionary

595729
dictionary	arrays
basically you need a recursive method or a queue but that s harderâ file under premature optimization until you ve proven you need it that takes an element and returns a dictionary and then you need to call this method on each of your element s child elements and collect the results into an arrays and put that into the dictionary you re creating

595731
for-loop	arrays
but in your example you want to walk an arrays of bounded length and using a for-loop makes it easy to do that and guard against running off the end

595731
variables	boolean
of course some purists will argue that break and continue should not be used and that you should use if-else and boolean variables if needed rather than continue or break out of a loop

595732
arrays	loops
while loops tend to result in tighter code and so for loops were only ever considered if you knew you were going to iterate over every element in the arrays every time

595734
dialog	pop-up
if your users dont read the dialog pop-up and they say ok i might consider asking a second time

595738
bsearch	strcmp
you might also look at the parameters for quicksort and bsearch which require compare functions much like strcmp

595741
dialog	pop-up
you can make the pop-up dialog on unload to save form automatically even before the dialog is displayed

595766
google-chrome	firefox
and it does work fine in firefox but not in ie google-chrome safari opera they return all properties methods of the native arrays object as undefined using this test

595767
getter	setter
in interest of full disclosure i am one of those people that only adds a setter or getter when it is proven necessary

595768
firefox	safari
been working on this site for some time now works perfectly on mac and pc firefox as well as safari

595771
for-loop	loops
and it s nice to have everything you need to know grokwise about the loops rules in a single line at the top of the for-loop

595792
emacs	vim
the problem is if you want to open the executable in say emacs or vim or whatever it s not a matter of the executable so much as the editor doesn t know any other way to interpret it

595796
click	mouse
i don t want to say your wrong but when i can click and drag the background images with my mouse cursor that means that you are using an img tag to show the background instead of or in conjunction with the background-image attributes

595800
parentheses	operators
first of all typeof is an operators not a function so you don t need the parentheses

595803
sftp	ftp
i am sending files from a windows system to a unix sftp server using jscape ftp client

595805
attributes	properties
i d be tempted to develop a custom attributes that gets applied to each of the properties that i care to track and then use reflection to enumerate the properties with that attributes applied

595818
c++	lua
there are many lua c++ binding tools

595834
javascript	dom
losing event handlers is imo a bug in the way javascript handles the dom

595856
quirks-mode	doctype
also as mentioned before add a doctype - ie will render the site in quirks-mode if there is no doctype

595858
ruby	php
for folks coming from dynamically typed languages like python ruby php etc. this can be slightly bumpy transition

595870
profiling	trace
run a profiling trace with say the stored proc name

595870
persistent	transient
query-cache locks are transient and don t persistent for any length of time

595890
callback	methods
you can t gaurantee when your callback methods is actually going to execute

595897
order	add
essentially you order all the numbers and add up all the possible sequences in order such that you minimize the number of additions

595899
postgresql	mysql
sqlite supports limit mysql postgresql

595899
sql-server	mysql
also see emulate mysql limit clause in microsoft sql-server 2000

595930
unsigned	short
well you could pack it all in an unsigned short that s 2 bytes 5 bits for day 5 bits for hour 6 bits for minute .

595930
unsigned	short
edit use unsigned short - not signed short .

595936
web-applications	enterprise
the issue that i currently face is that the service has traditionally naively relied on the user s source ip remaining constant as a hedge against session hijacking - the web-applications in the enterprise are not directly available to the public and it was in the past perfectly acceptable for me to require that a users address remain constant throughout a given session

595956
external	root
and i ve learned from experience that it just plain sucks to move pages out of the root and into a sensible structure once they have external links

595959
unsigned	short
6 bits for the minute equals an unsigned short

595963
any	set
so you have a set of a s and a set of b s and you need to pick a a b pair from this set such that some f a b is the highest of any other a b pair

595966
value	field
if you want to use shifts and masks to get the data in and out take log2 of the number of possible value for each field round up to get bits add the results to get total bits divide by eight total bytes w

595966
value	field
if you want to get the fields in and out by multiplying adding dividing modulo multiply together the number of possible value for each field and take log2 of that divide by eigth and round up

595968
variables	boolean
maybe you could use a boolean variables which you flag while your waiting for the ajax method to complete and check before you run the code in the onselectedindexchanged event method

595969
multiplication	division
do a bit of multiplication division to convert the value using the following formula as a guide

596006
base-class	inherited
if you want it for multiple classes i believe you can add the teardown methods to a base-class and inherited from that in every test class that needs the teardown behaviour

596008
value	field
if we don t want to be doing modulo arithmetic to access the value each time we need to be sure to store each in its own bit field

596010
contains	set
the result set may contains multiple entries for the same account number

596010
contains	set
i also want to get some aggregate information such as how many distinct account are contains within a particular result set

596019
background-image	width
there is no pure-css way of doing that but one solution using css is to make a background-image of sufficient width for the largest screen width you could have and make it stretch to the current browser width

596019
background-image	transparency
another way if it s all the same color is to make a background-image in gif that is more and more transparency and set a background-color of your choice

596029
value	field
alternatively adding a month field would make the total possible days value go from 366 to 31 -- down to 5 bits with 4 more bits for the month

596030
value	field
try specifically formatting the summed value as a datetime in the field properties and it will probably show correctly

596047
handler	service
if you look inside the service reference code that is generated it ensures that the completed event handler is called from the user-interface thread

596065
32-bit	64bit
i read in the ms documentation that assigning a 64bit value on a 32-bit intel computer is not an atomic operation

596065
value	field
this means that if two people simultaneously assign a value to a static int64 field the final value of the field cannot be predicted

596075
getter	setter
and the answer is when you don t need a setter getter for the field

596076
solaris	linux
like the question says we are building on linux using the gnu linker and on solaris using the solaris ld

596078
local-variables	hoisting
it s completely non-issue for local-variables that are not hoisting as a consequence of being closed over in a closure or an iterator transformation and are used by a single function and thus a single thread at a time

596104
32-bit	x86
on a 32-bit x86 platform the largest atomic sized piece of memory is 32-bits

596104
32-bit	64bit
that s just one possible race condition with 64bit assignment on a 32-bit platform

596106
32-bit	64bit
if your registers only have 32-bit in them and you need to store a 64bit value to some memory location it s going to take two load operations and two store operations

596121
bug-tracking	fogbugz
i have a little experience with bug-tracking systems such as fogbugz where help tickets are issues are or can be bugs and i have some experience using a bug-tracking system internally completely separate from a help center system

596121
bug-tracking	mantis
my question is in a company with an existing home-grown help center system where replacing it is not an option how should a bug-tracking system probably mantis be integrated into the process

596121
put	get
right now help tickets get put in for issues questions etc and they get assigned to the appropriate person pc tech help desk staff or if it s an application issue they can t solve in the help desk it gets assigned to a developer

596124
httphandler	webrequest
right now i am just using the httphandler to make another webrequest to the wcf service but would like to get away from that

596129
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
if you don t control the developer s environment enough to force them to format with a case-sensitive filesystems then i think your only options are a pre-commit hook that checks for duplicates case-insensitive comparison obviously file names in the same directory or to modify your project to not use files with the same name and different case in the same directory

596144
constructor	object
note urlloader does not accept a plain string as its constructor argument you must wrap the string in a urlrequest object

596155
getter	setter
when you are binding to a particular field you have to use reflection to find the setter and getter for that field of the personobject

596155
any	set
- you may want to set an updated flag or store the original so that if you iterate through all the binding components you can tell if any updates need to be saved enable the ok button

596170
keyboard	mouse
from a physical point of view he is comfortable with a keyboard mouse and can put together lego sets with relative ease so following directions with a fun outcome works for him

596178
aes	rsa
most of our applications are a good fit for 112 bits of security so that corresponds to triple-des or a small bump up to 128-bit aes for symmetric ciphers and a 2048-bit key for rsa

596186
windows-vista	windows
every time i perform this action i click the same dialog boxes in windowss-vista to setup the dual screen and position the windows

596187
contains	elements
the trgbquad elements describes a single pixel but the bitmap does of course contains more than one pixel

596193
contains	elements
add an id to the contains dom elements

596199
value	field
now in your code anywhere you need that list of field value

596203
build-server	publishing
this is so that the version of mstest.exe that is able to publishing the unit test results back into tfs is installed on the build-server

596231
defined	declare
if you use a pointers you can forwarding declare the class and only include the header file that defined the class in the source files that need it

596231
pointers	stack
on the flip side if your users create a lot of instances of your class for use on stack it would be advantageous to use objects instead of pointers for your member variables simply because heap allocations deallocations are slow by comparison

596233
constructor	object
the really easy solution just pass a string object to the constructor of someclass that says what the type is

596284
32-bit	64bit
this shows that 64bit fields are treated like 32-bit fields by the runtime that is 64bit operations are non-atomic

596285
constructor	object
edit note2 i can t alter the constructor to take in parameters because of how the would-be data layer instantiates the domain object using reflection not my idea

596298
put	get
so my solution sort of sucks in that regard but it s kind of nice being able to use carray for a lot of different scenarios and it turns things like stringlists and datasets into things you can put a watch on and check for when you get to a specific value

596302
put	get
whether you put it on the second server or not what cf could do if you can get away with it you could put report requests into a queue and email them to the users as they get processed

596312
version-control	git
distributed version-control solutions like git don t have this problem

596321
base-class	inherited
the entity inherited from a base-class that has the following isvalid methods that will ensure each object meets the validation criteria

596327
gentoo	linux
i run the synergy server on my mac and the client on both a vista machine and a gnu linux gentoo box

596333
nested	order
i realized while developing it i needed to duplicate the filtering clauses in both the sub selected and the nested selecteds in the where-clause in order to get the correct results

596335
contains	any
and that it canâ t contains any space characters

596351
selected	button
i have two radio button and want to post the value of the selected one

596365
connection-pooling	pool
sp_reset_connection seems to be called by sql-server connection-pooling to ensure that connections reused from the pool have most of their settings reset

596378
constructor	object
what you can do is either let the service give the domain object the appropriate info or have a delegate in the domain object which is set by a service or in the constructor

596384
default	reset
it will reset all set options to the default value

596389
rabbitmq	activemq
activemq rabbitmq and it s publisher consumer system is something i m looking for

596389
python	java
the supported programming languages for this should be at least c# java and python

596404
.when	ready
then use the movieclip.onload handler to capture .when the movieclip is ready to receive function-calls

596479
firefox	safari
how compatible is the ms report viewer control with browsers like firefox and safari

596483
any	set
i don t think there s really any need to be concerned about it being fair based on the subject matter or trying to present consistent situations to different candidates if you maintain the right evaluatory attitude -- that it isn t about whether they got the right answer or jumped through the right set of hoops but what sort of effort problem-solving communication aptitude and flexibility they showed

596507
methods	extend
if you extend a class and add a couple of innocuous methods to it then check to see whether some object of the subclass is equal to an object of the super class even if the objects are equal in all important aspects you will get the surprising answer that they aren t equal

596507
superclass	subclass
if you put a member of the superclass in a hashtable as the key and then look it up using a subclass instance you won t find it because they are not equal

596520
contains	any
how can i disable this caching for any request where the useragent contains the string jnlp

596528
firefox	safari
i have not noticed any real issue with it being displayed in firefox or safari

596532
boost	tbb
tbb boost thread

596532
boost	tbb
the way you describe it i think either intel tbb or boost thread will be fine

596549
ref	out
is there a good use for inout ref in c# byref like out parameters in vb.net parameters in .net

596590
linux	unix
how can i return that information at the command line on linux unix

596591
ref	out
ref and out parameter-passing modes are used to allow a methods to alter variables passed in by the methods caller

596591
ref	out
each parameter-passing mode ref and out is designed to suite different programming needs

596593
dictionary	arrays
you need to tell it it s an arrays when returning the dictionary although this won t work for a top-level arrays

596600
order	add
that should work if you flip the order of the models remove the manytomany and add a foreignkey field to publication in pathology

596619
exception-handling	try-catch
you have only java s try-catch finally for exception-handling

596628
default-value	return-value
where the return-value is a notion of success or failure or perhaps an error code and defaultedoutput is a value that comes in with a default-value

596628
ref	out
did you know that there is no real difference between out and ref at least as far as the clr is concerned

596670
pointers	stack
the notation says that what s being pass on stack is a pointers ie address of something

596685
updatepanel	gridview
in this particular instance i am also immediately running out to find a corresponding updatepanel so i can add a dynamically rendered gridview to it

596688
callback	methods
instead just schedule the job and indicate a callback methods

596698
callback	methods
you could create a version of the methods that takes a delegate to callback

596702
show	next
user-controls if the controls always show right next to each other this might be the right thing to do

596703
video-player	flv
convert your video to flv i use avidemux but many tools are available then use any embedded flash video-player

596744
margins	padding
i am looking for a firebug like utility that allows me to move my mouse around the form to see different controls highlight and see what their size padding margins etc are set to

596764
dialog	pop-up
the pop-up is working well but after dragging it to a different location then clicking the test partial postback the dialog is recentered to its default location

596785
contains	any
this sets the environment variables ua_is_jnlp to some value for any request whose user agent header contains the string jnlp there is also a case-insensitive variant browsermatchnocase

596797
principles	srp
should we worry about the srp principles in the case of viewmodel class or not

596807
web-applications	webserver
it is a specification for webserver and application servers to communicate with web-applications though it can also be used for more than that

596815
shell	bash
finding running bash or bourne shell scripts

596828
superclass	subclass
the latter essentially implies that no subclass must extend the superclass s state but can only add functionality or fields that are irrelevant for the object s state and behavior such as transient or static fields

596828
superclass	subclass
implementations using getclass do not allow comparison of sub- with superclass objects not even when the subclass does not add any fields and would not even want to override equals

596829
directory	folder
when the command is called the destination folder files are wiped and replaced with the result of the new build assembly file are created as well as some marker files .as my website is getting bigger and bigger i have to transfer to the server all the assemblies in my bin directory and keep in mind which other files i may have modified

596832
hide	show
there is a jquery onchange event that fires and generates the list for step 2 and hide the step1 div and show the step2 div

596832
hide	show
there is a jquery onchange event that fires and generates the list for step 3 and hide the step2 div and show the step3 div

596832
selected	textbox
user selected the type from a dropdown list and enters text into 3 different textbox

596862
any	set
i ve seen techniques to make sure that an app respects the mute switch but is it possible to set the iphone to mute no sounds from any apps using the sdk

596872
ubuntu	linux
ruby 1.9.1p0 jruby 1.2.0 ubuntu linux

596876
any	set
is there any way to set firefox and ie to print background images

596882
interface-builder	iboutlet
iboutlet is a symbol that indicates to interface-builder that an object instance variables delcared as

596887
while-loop	loops
if it has a loops counter use for like while while-loops does

596914
contains	elements
given a pair of ranges where one is known to contains elements of another

596915
javadoc	doxygen
this allows documenting in a javadoc syntax which i really wanted and doxygen then parsing the source to form various output formats html xml chm etc.. which is working well

596918
logfile	tail
when running phusion passenger you ll have to tail the logfile yourself

596924
early-binding	late-binding
with late-binding you can trap for both of those conditional but with early-binding your whole access app simply breaks

596937
value	field
for reference we are able to insert field value that don t contains the padding using the sql management tools and query analyzer so i m pretty sure this is occuring at the jdbc or odbc layer of things

596942
contains	elements
i am interested in finding out the number of ways in which i can combine elementss of this partitioning so that each combination contains exactly one elements of each class

596952
fiddler	charles
charles and fiddler are http proxies that can throttle your speed among other things

596988
pylons	django
if you go further you might come to pylons or turbogears or django after that maybe zope but it grows bigger and maybe the pain as well as you always buy into the opinions of that framework

596999
profiling	trace
when i launch an swt application via an eclipse launch profiling i receive the following stack trace

597008
variables	boolean
by definition a boolean variables can have only two states while a string can have any number of states

597008
variables	boolean
logic is less-than-explicit regarding current and available states there are actually four possible states for the form not-started started completed started-but-canceling - maintenance will require careful observation of the potential interactions between button text and boolean variables states to determine what the current state is should be

597008
variables	boolean
string comparison is much much slower than a simple test of a boolean variables

597014
.when	ready
moving to a more targeted driver may fix your problem all together or at least it will provide a production ready solution .when you do fix the bug

597030
vbscript	vb.net
you can use vb add reference c# vb.net add reference com tab vbscript wscript.createobject and of course c++ too

597034
traffic	packets
does anyone else have any benchmarking on how many packets per second this nic can receive without dropping any udp traffic

597056
average	minimum
statistical look at minimum maximum and possibly the average of unique values in all numerical columns and attempt to perform a match

597062
exception-handling	try-catch
without changing the type stored in objs to a type that can be copied and manage obj itself you need to add a try-catch block to cleanup objs if an exception-handling is thrown

jquery	.post
the ajax request is created using jquery s .ajax call with a .post message when running on a server that uses https

597073
google-chrome	safari
it works on all other browsers i ve tested osx windows google-chrome safari ie7.

597088
contains	any
strictly speaking it s not possible to copy the contents of a graphics object anywhere using any methods because a graphics object doesn t contains anything

597111
children	nodes
cdata is its own nodes so the category elements here actually have three children a whitespace text nodes the cdata nodes and another whitespace nodes

597125
linux	unix
vi is guaranteed to exist on all unix systems and exists on most linux ones as well

597138
32-bit	64bit
most libraries support both 64bit and 32-bit compilation or require only minor modifications to work under 64bit

597138
32-bit	64bit
vs.net is extremely unhelpful in this case if you add a c++ library and c# library to the same solution and the c# and c++ libraries have both 32 and 64bit targets your solution will contain an any cpu target a mixed platforms target a x64 target a x86 target which is what c# calls 32-bit a win32 target which is what c++ calls 32-bit and maybe more

597138
32-bit	64bit
the obvious behaviour shouldn t be that tricky if i have a c# project referencing a c++ project then it should be somewhat obvious that the 64bit version should reference the 64bit version and similarly for 32-bit

597138
32-bit	64bit
is there a simple way to make a .net executable with platform-specific references that can run both in 32-bit and 64bit mode loading the appropriate assemblies as needed

597140
emacs	vim
of course the emacs crowd says the same thing regarding emacs-style thinking but i gave up on learning emacs because vim was simpler and did the job for me

597152
textmate	vim
i m personally a very happy textmate user now after years of using vim gvim

597152
emacs	vim
if you do nothing else learn the basic navigation controls for both vim and emacs since they pop up all over the place

597158
linux	unix
note that under posix unix linux macos etc you can open and create a file with any permissions you choose including 0 no permission for anyone and yet still write to the file if opened for writing

597187
logout	login
i was calling the functions on the login and logout events but with facebook.connect.isuserconnected function facebook keeps an eye on this for you

597211
any	set
i read through the docs and used the commands outlined however for some reason i dont seem to be getting any symbols just a series of unknowns in the function column of the summary table for everything except the topmost set of the app i was trying to debug..

597211
contains	set
i set the enviromental variables to the microsoft server and the direcories contains the pdb s for the app

597223
jquery	.post
is there any examples on how you jquery submit a .post delete form with rails

597227
delphi	c++
i wouldn t recommend c++ for writing complex windows guis - language library combos like c# or delphi are so much more productive

597236
http	ssl
to get urllib2 to open http urls you need python with ssl support

597238
debian-based	linux
the message also naturally occurs if the public key on the server has been explicitly changed which can happen for a number of legitimate reasons - a vulnerability in debian-based linux distributions in the not-so-distant past necessitated key regeneration for many people for example

597248
getter	setter
for most accessors mutators getter setter you do not have to

597248
getter	setter
or use getter setter if you like them and don t mind bit more verbosity

597250
virtual-functions	base-class
are you asking if you can add virtual-functions to the base-class without recompiling

597256
google-chrome	firefox
ie and firefox have solved this problem for the most part but google-chrome and safari are both based off of webkit which does not have a solution

597265
multiplication	division
for example a lot of people that started at a higher level have no idea why shifts are so much faster than multiplication and division or the impact of branching etc

597268
google-chrome	firefox
the function is below works in firefox and google-chrome

597284
methods	extend
next we will create two more classes truck and car both of which will inherit all of the methods of the vehicle class and extend it with methods that are unique to them

597284
methods	extend
oop we simply extend the vehicle class with a bus class and add the methods numberofpassengers

597284
methods	extend
oop we change the color methods in the vehicle class and because the car truck and bus classes all extend or inherit from to put it another way the vehicle class they are automatically updated

597284
methods	extend
oop we extend the car class with a nissan class and a mazda class and add methods for each set of unique information for that car make

597287
python	java
now i use java and python on -- well -- i have really no idea

597312
perl	php
most database access layers like php s pdo or perl s dbi have different calls when preparing query than they do when they just execute sql

597312
activerecord	datamapper
i don t know the size of the project but it might behoove you to put queries in a common place or develop some layer based on a common pattern like activerecord datamapper table row gateway

597316
buffering	streaming
the c stdout streaming internally buffering data

597316
fflush	stdout
try a fflush stdout

597320
oracle	mysql
that assumes sql server but i m sure oracle mysql etc allow similar setups

597343
stderr	stdout
think about it - in some shape or form the names stdin stdout and stderr refer to global-variables too

597356
shell	tcsh
it was a good attempt to make a better shell than the c-shell and its derivatives like tcsh allowing you to use bin sh syntax for scripting or for interactive use but adding some of the nicer features of csh like history and so on

597356
shell	bash
the korn shell and bash have a lot in common in concept anyway

597356
bash	zsh
now i use either bash or zsh

597358
configuration	environment
i haven t done this on the iphone yet but on a desktop environment the easiest way to handle this is to keep your configuration data in a separate database

597369
detect	move
the first is to detect when the mouse move and draw a line to where the mouse is shown here

597373
value	field
then the client of this code can only request things in the enum and you the author of this module become the field provider by mapping their requested enum value to a known string

597373
value	field
option3 if the field change over time and you don t want to lock in with an enum can you send the string value into the database for confirmation

597384
gridview	listview
how do get the paging functionality like we have in asp.net gridview in listview control

597391
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
the dynamic-sql you are generating is subject to something called a sql-injection attack

597391
value	field
imagine for example that the value of field was the following string

597391
value	field
if the value of field is ever specified via

597391
value	field
then you need to validate the data to make sure it is a valid field value before running any queries

597415
background-color	display
i don t know that i d use a progress-bar to control the volume but to display the volume level you could use a user drawn control or you could just resize a label with a background-color that last methods is kind of kludgy though

597421
web-services	api
that means most esbs take care of data transfer security logging protocol translation event systems api exposure via web-services etc

597425
gethashcode	equals
the first thing i would look for is to make sure that you have explicitly implemented equals and gethashcode

597425
reflection	runtime
failing to do this means that the runtime implementation of each of these does some very expensive operations to compare two struct instances internally it uses reflection to determine each of the private fields and then checkes them for equality this causes a significant amount of allocation

597429
hide	show
this methods is also helpful when you want to hide a column that is in the bound datatable but you don t want to show then you set width 0

597460
emacs	vim
it s definitely worth learning either vim or emacs

597465
value	field
which produces all combinations of field value

597483
python	java
i ve looked at pystone s code and garbage collection doesn t seem to be turned off but i would expect java s gc to be at least as good as python s.

597483
environment	building
i am using jython 2.5b1 trunk 5903 5905 jan 9 2009 16 01 29 java tm se runtime environment building 1.6.0_07-b06-153 and java hotspot tm 64bit server viewmodel building 1.6.0_07-b06-57 mixed-mode on macos x 10.5

597522
oracle	mysql
the code is written for mysql but it s very easy to adapt to oracle

597528
environment	execution
there is a trick you can use to find the folder contains the currently execution scripting but in my case i had an environment variables i could use so i just used that

597536
rewrite	rule
you can use nginx rewrite rule like this

597545
standard-library	boost
boost is the most standard-library for c++ that is not in the official standard

597547
silverlight	wpf
xaml wpf and silverlight are the focus and microsoft

597557
python	perl
similar question from back in september how do you translate this regular-expression idiom from perl into python

597608
put	get
if i remove the which i was told to put there i get an invalid escape character error on the s

597616
forwarding	port
my question is how can i forwarding a port to redirect it to a directory

597620
webserver	nginx
you ll need to run a webserver on the vps such as apache or nginx

597625
host	root
for apache you can define a new listening port create a virtual host on that port and point its document root as desired

597655
python	perl
perl python lisp are prevalent for lightweight applications automation light computation

597655
linux	unix
i see a lot of perl at my work computational em since we like unix linux

597690
order	add
i have problem with setting the formula in particular field.i am using sql database have been added from- add new item- sql database.i have order table with following field

597698
tuples	set
design each queue to be a lexicographically ordered set containing a tuples of operation type data arrival time

597704
javascript	dom
my biggest complaint while using javascript are the dom bindings but those are not really the fault of javascript so much as each browser implementing it their own way

597704
javascript	dom
as a language i like javascript a lot and any complaints i have on it are overshadowed by its interactions with the dom

597704
safari	opera
there are debuggers in opera and safari that i use if either browser is having particular issues

597709
typedef	struct
i think you d be better off defining your own types and then mapping them to the api types with wrapper struct classes and typedef

597726
deep-copy	object
the reason your deep-copy is having problems is because you re ending up with circular object references

597726
deep-copy	object
if you need a deep-copy of an arrays of object with circular references i believe you re going to have to code your own method to handle your specialized data structure such that it is a multi-pass clone

597737
directory	folder
then in vwd express 2008 i created a new tab in the toolbox i chose the .dll from the unzipped folder i used the control all is fine try it i recommend it but when i backed up my code copied the site and tried to run it on another computer i got a bunch of error all indicating that its looking for the dll file on my desktop but when i checked under my bin folder in my website directory the dll is there..

597741
postgresql	firebird
the php version currently supports an amazing number of databases thanks to the wonderful adodb community mysql postgresql interbase firebird informix oracle ms sql foxpro access ado sybase frontbase db2 sap db sqlite netezza ldap and generic odbc odbtp

597741
informix	sybase
the sybase informix frontbase and postgresql netezza ldap odbtp drivers are community contributions

597750
windows-server	windows
for windows home server or windows-server 2003 works with winxp too the windows-server 2003 resource kit tools comes with utilities that can be used in tandem for this called instsrv.exe and srvany.exe

597750
windows-xp	windows
contrary to the name it works with both windows 2000 and windows-xp as well

597754
instance-variables	accessor
to create accessor for instance-variables the simple way use attr_accessor

597765
instance-variables	accessor
define general purpose controllers instance-variables with accessor methods where to store current model class and instance

597767
value	field
this is also motivation for display validation dynamically as value are changed but for not limiting the users movement between field

597770
uibutton	uilabel
and if it s not a uilabel it may be a uibutton which contains a uilable etc

597772
javascript	dom
â javascript â urls â eval â for everything browser-specific dom access.

597781
classnotfoundexception	noclassdeffounderror
difference between classnotfoundexception and noclassdeffounderror

597808
firefox	safari
this isn t guaranteed to work as __proto__ isn t a standard variables but it works at least in firefox and safari

597813
ubuntu	linux
note i d like this to be cross-platform but since from the first answers this doesn t seem to be possible i m working under macos and ubuntu linux so bash

597841
arrays	loops
you could do this without an arrays by merely using a while loops to remove every last child from the sprite or movieclip that you added the thumbs to

597841
.when	ready
.when you are ready to add the new thumbs you must clear out previous thumbs

597844
export	report
whenever we export the report to excel format the file which is created in

597846
checkbox	textbox
the form has a text field some checkbox a set of radio buttons and two textbox

597847
adventureworks	northwind
talk about sql-server 2005 adventureworks is better than northwind

597859
base-class	inherited
in principle a derived class inherited every member of a base-class except

597868
triggers	insert
in the after insert triggers of the log table you can fire an event let s call it new_log

597879
dbase	dbf
the dbf might well be a dbase file which is easy enough to read and the .bak is probably a backup of one of the other important files or just a backup left by a text-editor

597879
binary	hex
if this doesn t give you a good result try opening them in a binary editor that shows side by side hex and ascii with control characters blanked out

597886
compact-framework	.net
i have an existing vs 2005 std .net compact-framework application that i want to do some major refactorings on

597903
linux	unix
i know it is possible to monitor files on windows using pywin32 and there are packages working on linux unix but does anyone know about a cross-platform one

597912
children	tree
it depends on if you want to retrieve a subhierarchy as well so all children of item x or if you just want to grab the entire set of hierarchies and build the tree in an o n way in memory using a dictionary

597922
margins	padding
remove the margins padding etc from the div to simplify

597933
any	set
search tagcollectiontag for instances containing the specific set of tags and then find data rows with any of those tagcollectionid s

597934
gnome	kde
there s no single standard terminal command on linux - the ones available depend on which gui is present whether kde or gnome etc

597936
shell	bash
most linuxes uses bash as a shell but to keep on the safe side you should restrict yourself to bin sh

597955
windows-explorer	autorun
you can use the utility autorun by sysinternals now part of microsoft to disable windows-explorer extensions such as extensions which add themselves as right-click menu items

597957
linux	unix
each shell is basically a command interpreter that understands linux commands gnu unix commands is more correct i suppose...

597962
linux	unix
for unix linux based systems you should use file alteration monitor python bindings to libfam

597967
sql-server	oracle
oracle has tools for that so i guess sql-server does too but you ll need a schema

597972
centering	fixed
i want to create a border layout for a webapp where there is a fixed size header and footer a sidebar and a main centering content that expands to fill the remaining spaces

597972
centering	fixed
think of it like your browser where the toolbar and statusbar have a fixed size the sidebar can change size but the website in the centering expands to fill the remaining size

598000
javascript	dom
as a slight but related asside if you use a javascript library such as jquery v1.3 to do your dom manipulation you can make use of live events whereby you set up a handler like

598011
contains	set
most older systems used a basic isam which had one file per table that contains a set of fixed length data records

598021
webforms	asp.net
you can always mix asp.net webforms with mvc

598037
contains	any
is there any way to add a line item contains a negative amount to an existing invoice

598048
factors	primes
keys are just primes factors of a really big number oversimplified for easy understanding

598048
credentials	account
so george must have his own account login to the svn server the repository must be shared by both account and george must use his own credentials to login to the server

598057
triggers	insert
i.e. while i insert a record for the first table this same record also is inserted in the second table using a triggers

598062
selected	button
i realize that i may be being a bit lazy but does anyone know of a visual-studio macros where i can select some text inside of the visual-studio ide click a button and have it wrap the selected text with tags

598072
dbase	dbf
as others have suggested i recommend a hex editor if you can t figure out what those files are and that dbf is probably dbase

598074
interface-builder	iboutlet
from a code point-of-view and iboutlet is only a hint for interface-builder

598074
interface-builder	iboutlet
but interface-builder can scan your code for iboutlet so when you right-click on an object in ib you can see all the outlets that you could connect to other objects

598079
alignment	spacing
using the alignment features of text fields etc. you can thus arrange an acceptable layout though the extra spacing required for the localization with the largest strings often causes a less-than-ideal layout for the language whose strings are shortest

598081
loading	gif
the loading bar is just an animated gif file

598085
loading	gif
where loading is the id for the div contains the loading gif image

598093
locale	hebrew
when in an rtl locale arabic hebrew etc. firefox implements text-align right

598093
children	nodes
specifically when traversing the dom with opera i have to worry about empty text nodess when browsing a nodes s children

598105
required	checked
or operatorss like we seem to recommend here - this required the arguments members to have both less then and equals operatorss just to do a less then checked on a class contains them - using just the less then operators is enought and will save you redundancy and potential defects in the future

598107
shell	bash
when you perform ls in a bash shell sometimes there are colours to indicate different resource types and you can enable control this with the --color argument

598130
iteration	tuples
it provides a few data-structures lists tuples and iteration macros

598133
children	nodes
as the nodess are constructed in reverse topological order you are guaranteed to have constructed the children of a given nodes before constructing the nodes so creating an immutable representation is possible

598159
arguments	undefined
yields undefined behavior because the order that function arguments are evaluated is undefined and in the more general case because if you read a variables twice in an expression where you also write it the result is undefined

598167
haskell	python
i write lots of code in dynamic languages javascript python haskell etc. but i m now learning c for graduate school and i have no idea what i m doing

598177
callback	methods
and put in domainobject a callback before_save with my special methods which basically stripes all tags like h1 from the string attributes of the object

598193
mousedown	mouseup
to draw a selection rectangle from the mousedown mouse move then remove it on mouseup i currently do the following

598210
rhino-mocks	moq
refactor your code to interfaces then develop fake classes to implement those interfaces or mock them with a mocking framework such as rhino-mocks easymock moq et

598218
any	set
while editing in ib it is just a proxy of the object as with any object you drag to the nib but when the nib is loaded it will be set to the windows controllers you created

598221
versioning	upgrade
if you use common language idioms then you ll see all the benefits of fast prototyping and clean design and your code will naturally run faster as new versioning of python are released and the computer hardware is upgrade

598227
expression	evaluation
perhaps the if-statement expression evaluation is slightly more expensive than the simpler try-it-and-fail

598236
autotools	gnu
i also rarely use the gnu autotools

598250
javascript	dom
in javascript xmlhttprequest.responsexml returns a dom document object

598250
json	xml
reaons for asking i need to measure browser-based xml deserialisation performance with the aim of comparing this to json deserialisation performance

598276
mouseleave	mouseenter
so mouseenter and mouseleave are fired twice

598276
internet-explorer	firefox
in internet-explorer 7 firefox 3 opera and safari both events are fired only once

598327
arrays	loops
any language that can t fully decide if arrays loops string character indexes are zero based or one based

598376
content-disposition	content-type
we ve alternated between forcing the download using content-disposition attachment + content-type application octet-stream and actually returning the proper mime type

598384
loading	gif
and if i will be pre-loading all the images how do i put one of those loading bars on the screen like you see in flash or a loading gif like i ve seen in ajax

598398
contains	elements
how would i go about searching the mylist list to determine if it contains an elements with n 5

598405
attributes	properties
you should add a __eq__ and a __hash__ methods to your data class it could check if the __dict__ attributes are equal same properties and then if their values are equal too

598407
contains	elements
if you simply want to determine if the list contains any elements that matches and do it relatively efficiently you can do

598418
click	mouse
the first responder is simply the object that will be told and given a chance to respond to an event such as a mouse click in your application

598443
data-structures	tree
the usual analysis of algorithms course is also a data-structures course so a data-structures text might be better if you also need to learn about lists tree etc

598446
zend-framework	codeigniter
this is basically what codeigniter and zend-framework have done with what they have provided

598449
autotools	scons
but if you compare to make alone not autotools scons alone is superiour

598488
panels	grid
do you think the search panels should be visible all the time ie displayed on top of my result grid or available in a separate form which would let me use more place for all the controls

598507
hide	show
you might not need to show it all at once let me expand areas if i want more hide stuff i don t want to use

598518
postgresql	mysql
at the database level by enabling appropriate logging or by looking at the database statistics show table status like my_table on mysql select sum avg_width from pg_stats where table_name like my_table for postgresql etc. for the average row size of the tables of interest provided that the database supports it you need to specify the database you are using otherwise you can compute your own statistics from a database dump

598540
any	set
dynamically edit the set of criteria available at any time

598540
installation	environment
i m a big fan of little text and easy to comprehend icons but such a setup depends on your installation environment

598545
defined	declare
with macros magic you could set things up so there s only one place where f1 and f2 are declare and defined but if this is being generated mechanically there s probably not much reason to do that

598579
arrays	loops
a suggestion that i don t want to code right now is to use a loops an arrays to hold partial results and constants to pick up the bits m at a time

598599
installation	upgrade
not only does this make installation simpler the application remains stable and working the way you expect it to even when other components on the system are upgrade

598605
value	field
in the data viewer the new field value are display as

598616
exception-handling	try-catch
i did this by starting an int pointer at some base address and iterating through memory addresses with a try-catch to catch exception-handling

598616
iteration	set
once i found a set of memory addresses that matched my score i would change my score manually in solitaire and only look through the memory addresses that were found in the last iteration

598617
background-color	height
i have tried setting html and body to have a height 100 and then giving body a background-color but if there is enough content to warrant scrolling the background only has a height equal to that of the browser and when you scroll down the background stays behind

598618
background-image	transparency
you could get the curved arrow ends using a handful of positioning absolute divs with background-image set to transparency gifs.

598643
administration	host
after a lot of research i determined i could get the host to run by building going to the bin folder and right-clicking on my executable selected run as administration

598646
plugins	add-on
there are so many cool plugins and add-on but to be honest i lack the time and experience and it wouldn t really fit into my work needs

598682
background-color	height
the solution is to use a wrapper div that has 100 height and a separate content div that will extend if the content inside is long enough both having the background-color set

598682
google-chrome	firefox
here is an example tested in firefox google-chrome and ie7

598683
contains	any
a dataset or a datatable can do that but it could basically be any kind of list contains objects that has properties

598696
python	java
c++ java python are not

598699
firefox	safari
i am trying to load an xml file using javascript and i have yet to find a good function that works in ie firefox and safari

598702
reference-type	generics
allegedly the native code is shared for instantiated generics types when it is instantiated with a reference-type but not for value types

598703
silverlight	wpf
does anyone know of a definitive guide or guides that tells us the differences between wpf and silverlight

598703
silverlight	wpf
i know that silverlight for example doesnâ t have all the controls and all the namespaces that wpf has

598713
silverlight	wpf
xaml processing differences between silverlight and wpf

598723
multiplication	modulo
for integers to be a grouping under multiplication you have to be modulo a prime number

598723
multiplication	addition
for floating point value simple multiplication or addition saturates to + - infinity and there are no value which are the inverses of infinity so either the set is not closed or it lacks invertibility

598723
multiplication	modulo
if on the other hand you want something similar to integer multiplication modulo a power of 2 then multiplication will do - there are elements without an inverse so it s not a grouping but it is closed - you always get a floating point value back

598736
continuous-integration	teamcity
continuous-integration tools like cruisecontrol teamcity or hudson can work with version-control repositories to extract latest versions of source code build that code execute and archive test results and package stuff for deployment

598755
rollback	commit
imagine you have two different methods in possibly different dao s that need to be encapsulated in the same transaction commit rollback than you might want have to use the same connection object

598773
solaris	unix
mono can be run on linux bsd unix mac os x solaris and windows operating systems

598774
build-process	ant
if you already have a good build system in place using ant and your dependencies are kept in a easy to access central location and you don t plan on extending your build-process to include any more advanced build management then maybe you should stay with what you have

598775

python	ruby
once you have those down there s also bridges between ruby and python to the cocoa api

598781
ruby	php
objective-c c c++ java ruby python php .

598804
javascript	dom
just as a side note for when you re developing javascript stuff which involves creating elements in the dom

598810
hashmap	arrays
for that kind of access you should really be using an arrays or better a hashmap

598847
cvs	git
the great aptana studio has support via plugins for svn cvs and git via this plugin

598850
getter	setter
you have to have getter and setter

598850
getter	setter
under d2009 didn t check other versioning the parameters to the getter setter can t for some reason be const

598885
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know a lot about how the protocols work something that you definitely need to research or much about what goes on in a browser but a great place to start would be the source of the open-source browsers primarily google-chrome and firefox

598898
compact-framework	.net
i m starting on a windows mobile project no .net compact-framework - just native code

598910
silverlight	wpf
in wpf the obvious solution for such an issue would be to handle the previewkeydown event but unfortunately this is not available in silverlight 2

598920
firefox	gecko
gecko used in firefox

598920
google-chrome	safari
webkit used in safari and google-chrome 0-27

598922
push	pull
stuff get s added deleted renamed automatically and basic syncronization tasks push pull work fine.

598926
json	csv
your domain specific tests may use different formats like simple csv json or yaml i m not an xml fan thought

598937
python	java
the big difference is that in python and other object oriented languages such as c++ java or c# a class can also have functions associated with it that operate only on the instance of the class whereas in c a function that wishes to operate on a struct must accept the structure as a parameter in some way usually by pointer

598941
python	java
you ll probably want to learn about what object-oriented programming is if you want to make effective use of classes in python or any other object-oriented language like java or c++

598943
sharing	share
if you are really doing distributed stuff and sharing pulling from many sources you must be extremely careful not to share any commits that you intend to rebase

598945
python	c++
without taking pages and pages to go into the details think of a c struct as a way to organize data while a python or c++ or objective-c class is a way to organize not only your data but the operations for that data

598948
g++	gcc
question 1 how do i create static library using gcc g++

598948
header-files	makefile
question 2 how to specify it in the makefile linking against static and dynamic libs assuming that both libraries have header-files

598950
command-prompt	command-line
running the command-line manually at the actual command-prompt in a console windows works but nothing i ve tried so far will run it from within a c++ builder app

598951
value	field
i know how to create a long list of if-statement in javascript naming each of the field and checking each value but i don t want to do that if i can get away with it

598951
value	field
what s the easiest way to check if the user has changed at least one of the field value

598969
revision	svn
it is often claimed that the old code parts can always be found again in the old svn repository revision if needed

598969
revision	svn
if the old code is in some unknown old svn revision then it can be quite hard to find

598986
python	java
i m just learning python myself but it seems like there are python libraries that look more like java jdbc drivers

599000
entity-framework	nhibernate
my question is would entity-framework or nhibernate be more suiting or are there other technologies that fit my needs better

599022
boolean	int
if these are not actual boolean but just an int column you only store 0 or 1 in then you should fix your schema

599034
boost	stl
don t write any templates unless you re writing a very very generic library stl and boost are two prominent examples

599038
derived-class	base-class
essentially it allows you to inject statically customized functionality into a derived-class by inheriting from a base-class that is parameterized on the derived-class name

599048
http	ssl
what is the difference between http digest authentication and ssl from a performance security and flexibility point of view

599053
memset	malloc
e.g memcpy malloc memset

599070
build-process	ant
if your long term goal is to migrate to using maven to manage the entire build-process which one might intend to do for new greenfield projects then i heartily recommend using maven pom.xml files to manage dependencies on behalf of ant build.xml files

599097
http	ssl
http digest authentication doesn t do that so when using http digest without ssl you don t really know if the server you re sending your login info to is the right one or an imposter

599102
yslow	cdn
2 things from yslow that will help are a cdn content delivery network .

599118
getter	setter
tests for getter and setter

599122
numeric	digits
decimal is a floating point base 10 numeric type with 28+ decimal digits of precision

599122
digits	base
double uses half as much memory as decimal and double will be much faster because of the cpu hardware for many common floating point operations but it cannot represent most base 10 fractions such as 1.05 accurately and has a less accurate 15+ decimal digits of precision

599124
getter	setter
to clarify the set and get methods referenced above are not getter and setter methods

599125
any	set
for those of you who don t know why apparently the amount of memory reserved for the index of any enum is automatically set to an integer in c#

599132
32-bit	64bit
this is because in the cpu you have 4 registers 32-bit long or 64bit in x64 mode

599134
processor	cpu
cpu is the processor what runs your code against your data

599134
32-bit	64bit
there s always the fact that the cpu always uses entire words int in 32-bit architectures and long in 64bit architectures

599145
.when	ready
being stuck in the runloop for a little while .when i o is ready to be read from the network

599153
functional-programming	imperative
in real world haskell there is a section titled life without arrayss or hash tables where the authors suggest that list and tree are preferred in functional-programming whereas an arrays or a hash table might be used instead in an imperative program

599162
instances	self
for instances you might use the userinfo parameter to pass along a reference to the interested object self

599184
search-engine	seo
i have both seo settings search-engine friendly urls and use apache mod_rewrite working correctly

599184
hosts-file	hosts
also i don t yet have a domain name so i use a hosts alias to get to the site

599184
search-engine	seo
i thought maybe it was a bad idea to only turn on the first seo setting search-engine friendly urls from use apache mod_rewrite even though i can just turn on search-engine friendly urls by itself on my local machine and it works fine

599184
rewrite	rule
nevertheless i tried to modify the rewrite rule from

599188
stream	send
the first test send in a stream that contains only a partials multi-part mime message

599188
stream	send
the second test send in a stream that contains 2 complete multi-part mime messages

599200
selected	cell
i have a navigation-based application that shows a tableview where you can selected a cell and it brings you to a detail view for that cell

599213
children	nodes
both lists and tree are recursive structures the next link on a list is another list and the children of a tree nodes are both tree

599218
json	xml
you essentially have to send a get request to a specific url receive xml or json encoded reply extract a special session token and secret key then generate a response using the token and the key

599219
directory	folder
i created a new extension folder under my development firefox profiling s extension directory

599235
haskell	sml
sml which is also functional but not lazy can use arrays more naturally than haskell but lists are still more common because they map well to recursive algorithms

599238
.when	ready
if a core is waiting on a disk read will that core be the one to run the interrupt handler .when the disk is ready

599245
host	root
i want to host a mod_perl application on a shared rhel server where i do not have access to a root account

599255
processor	affinity
what you re interested in is smp processor affinity

599260
any	set
the line that appears when we set the mask of a masked textbox in winforms for c# does not seem attractive at all to me .i want to know if there is any way i can set the mask of

599280
updating	updates
after updating the model i want to redirect to another page and i want a message such as field x successfully updates to appear on this page

599288
internet-explorer	firefox
what is the correct modern method for tapping into the windows resize event that works in firefox webkit and internet-explorer

599300
arrays	map
the map would be an arrays of values

599304
installation	environment
i m preparing the new partitioning of my laptop so i would like to know how much space are going to take a full installation of this development environment

599304
installation	environment
long time ago has elapsed since my last installation of a full visual-studio environment so my guesses are that these days the minimum space needed will be around 15 gb

599309
tcp-ip	udp
tcp-ip as well as udp packets include some reference to their size

599309
udp	tcp
using the standard run-of-the-mill sockets in windows whether you re using the system.net.sockets namespace in c# or the native winsock stuff in win32 you never see the ip tcp udp headers

599309
binary-serialization	deserialization
from what i can tell it is a binary-serialization deserialization scheme for wcf i m sure that s a gross oversimplification

599314
deployment	install
it is pretty painless to configurationure if you follow the docs so i am not sure what you mean by too complex for your deployment -- if you want apache and have tomcat already it would seem only a matter of slight configuration changes to get mod_jk downloaded and install

599318
javascript	dom
you ve got to worry about tcp ip sockets rendering html using css creating a dom model executing javascript dealing with malformed markup and code and handling all types of files before you can even think about all the things people expect from a browser ie bookmarks history private browsing security etc. it s a huge project

599321
subtract	time
so i am using the logic to get system time when i call the function and time when the function returns a value then by subtract the values i get time it took to complete

599333
pointers	stack
this is why raw pointerss are not normally used in modern c++ you would use a smart pointers which can be a stack based wrapper for a raw pointers to a heap based object

599335
data-members	private
linker errors are related to every single private static data-members of classes i have defined in my own header-files

599340
variables	boolean
this could be handled with just one boolean variables we call it dirty bit handling

599340
value	field
as per the standard practice there is no check if after editing some field if the value actually got changed or not

599340
variables	boolean
you would just need to add onchange eventhandlers to the controls and set the global boolean variables something like isdirty to true inside those eventhandlers

599340
value	field
and i wrote this because you seemed to have an idea to check each and every field by it s initial value to see if it was really altered after edit

599350
arrays	map
for 1 the easiest way of dealing with a tile-based map where each tile can contain multiple objects is to just have a big multidimensional arrays of structs representing each tile

599361
environment	building
i m working on transitioning my current project of about 20 developers to a modern development and building environment

599393
ubuntu	linux
note i am new to ruby-on-rails and fairly new to ubuntu and linux in general

599421
persistence	hibernate
persistence providers hibernate

599421
jndi	jta
list of features ejb 3.0 and 3.1 jta jax-ws jms j2ee connectors jpa jndi

599421
jax-ws	cxf
openejb uses several other open source frameworks such as openjpa to provide jpa and cmp persistence activemq for jms mdb and apache cxf for jax-ws features

599421
jar	war
deployment types collapsed ear war jar

599421
persistence	hibernate
persistence providers openjpa hibernate

599421
openejb	openjpa
limitations openejb uses openjpa to provide jpa and cmp persistence and openjpa currently requires a javaagent to function properly

599421
persistence	hibernate
persistence providers openjpa hibernate toplink eclipselink

599424
checkbox	textbox
i use a model to define dynamic forms made from grouping frame labels textbox numberboxes option buttons and checkbox in wpf

599448
constructor	object
it differs from the msdn stateobject implementation in that it does not include the stringbuilder object the buffer_size constant is private and it includes a constructor for convenience

599451
tokenize	parsing
a potentially better solution is to use tokenize states possibly controlled from the parsing to change how the newline inputs are tokenized

599471
python	c++
we have a heterogeneous environment mostly c c++ for different embedded platforms kernel modules some desktop applications and various python modules as glue code

599471
build-system	scons
scons really shines when you want to add support for your own compilers and niche-tools and need to adapt the build-system to your requirements

599471
emacs	vim
our developers either used emacs or vim and no one wanted to switch to anything else so we fortunately sticked with that

599489
rewrite	rule
i ve added it above the main cakephp rewrite rule but i m getting an infinite redirect loop

599489
rewrite	rule
i m assuming that s due to the qsa flag in cakephp rewrite rules but i was under the impression the l in my rule would stop that from executing.

599492
instances	self
in any case the point is that a bound-methods object is created when you acces an instances methods through self and unless you maintain a strong reference to it it will be deleted

599525
contains	set
you can set up a directory contains the flv files on your webserver that can only be accessed by php then in your php scripting you can authentication the user as usual and simply send a header to the browser telling it to expect an flv then echo the raw flv data

599528
double	int
for example with widening coercions int - long float - double

599535
hash	md5
i guess i could make four md5 hash and merge them but is that really effective

599537
data-members	private
linker errors are related to every single private static data-members of classes i have defined in my own header-files

599558
hash	md5
try uniqid - and perhaps combine with an md5 hash as given in the examples

599559
shell	bash
i ve seen people write some pretty sophisticated programs using the bash shell and others write trivial things using c

599560
python	php
i can t speak definitively for php but i suspect it s the same basic problem as with python 2 had before later adding special support for unicode string filenames

599560
python	php
to get around this problem php would have to do the same as python 3.0 and start using unicode strings for filenames and everything else using the â _wopenâ -et-al functions to get native-unicode access to the filenames under windows

599581
msbuild	nant
for build we re using hudson and codeigniter much better than nant or msbuild

599630
business-objects	data-access
moving this sort of logic outside your business-objects - putting it in your data-access layer - can lead to an anti-pattern known as the anemic domain model

599630
business-objects	data-access
the term repository specifically refers to a data-access pattern that returns fully-populated collections aggregates of business-objects

599633
interpreter	runtime
whether or not the runtime is interpreter compiled jited or whatever doesn t matter

599651
kate	kde
kde seems to have a drawers-like functionality as seen in kdevelop and some other applications kate the editor uses them too but i have never tried to use them in anything i ve written and so would have no idea how to write them

599664
arrays	map
i ve got a static map of identifier struct pairs and each struct should contain some arrays

599675
decimal	hex
now you have a secure number you can just convert it to decimal hex or base64 and use that string

599692
triggers	insert
what i ve been searching is just a simple example on an ajax function that triggers a mysql insert or update

599705
.when	ready
examples call readytodisplay .when the image is ready

599743
notepad++	kate
infact kate or notepad++ or jedit have gui and features you may miss in vim

599743
notepad++	kate
kate s symbol viewer or notepad++ s huge menu bar

599754
document	element
how should i get a reference to a document element by name

599759
any	set
this formreponse is set up with the status of the post and any error messages that were generated so i d like a getactionresult methods which does the scripting noscripting check a hidden form input and either

599773
freebsd	linux
the project is a set of c libraries so no ui or user interaction testing is necessary and aimed at being cross platform with linux freebsd and windows being my first priority and os x planned once the first release is out the door assuming i can get a hold of a machine running os x to test on

599775
constructor	private
but even in c++ if you have set of polymorphic classes which are typically used via pointers or references you usually explicitly forbid copying them like this by declaring operator and copy constructor as private or inheriting from boost noncopyable because of exactly the same reasons as why you don t redefine in c#

599795
emacs	vim
the advantage of using either vim or emacs as an editor is precisely that it s available on virtually any decently configured unix platform and this includes more esoteric systems as well darwin os x

599796
linux	osx
fwiw i use textmate sometimes vim on osx textpad sometimes notepad or even edit on servers not under my direct control on windows and vim on linux

599801
hidden-field	checkbox
it s reusable but relies on javascript to populate a hidden-field with the false response for an unchecked checkbox that html unfortunately does not send

599806
account	api
one possible suggestion would be a twitter account or other free online public service with a simple api

599813
temporary	copy
in an environment webex rdc where you cannot install software or use temporary media you have two choices live with whatever editor they have or copy files back and forth from your system

599818
google-chrome	firefox
this could take you years but anyway there are many open source browsers out there firefox google-chrome

599825
arrays	loops
it also extends proxy so it can be used in for each loops just as a arrays can

599826
keyboard	mouse
i have a timer program that count for inactivity of keyboard mouse

599873
double	int
since some of the numbers will be small and some large the question is whether it is worth checking the length of the number and if it is small use a regular c# int or double and if is is large use the other classes i have or if i am already using the large int and large float classes i should just stick with them even for smaller numbers

599878
32-bit	64bit
if your application is targetted for more people than yourself try to run them on different machines single core multicore 32-bit 64bit platforms and if the platform seems to have a large impact in the time the calculations take use some sort of strategy-pattern to do the calculations differently on different machines

599905
authentication	login
not only that but doing it this way will prevent you from using the authentication attribute on the admin controller or the action to force the user to login and will have to implement custom logic checking which route the action was hit through and decide whether you want to force login or let the user through

599918
environment	building
when building or deploying to a stage environment is a good time to compress javascript

599919
git-rebase	git-merge
squashing a and b into a new commit ab would result in two distinct tree which in most cases is not desirable since git-merge and git-rebase will no longer work across the two branches

599929
dialog	pop-up
when the authentication fails i would like to pop-up my plugins s settings dialog and retry

599934
boost	stl
this works for nested containers but this is for their implementation for stl only and does not work if you are putting a stl container in a boost container

599949
32-bit	64bit
if you really need both versions you can also load both the 32-bit and 64bit library into the gac so the runtime can chose the correct one automatically

599955
communication	messages
1 use a java library such as smslib which allows direct communication with a mobile phone modem to send or receive messages

599963
logout	login
then you need to logout and login again or source the .bash_profile

599972
haskell	lisp
hence many formal verification tools are based on functional languages â for example acl2 is based on common lisp and cryptol is based on haskell

599987
hosts-file	hosts
updates i restart my computer cleared the firefox s cache again and fiddled with the hosts a little bit
