900085
python	perl
i ve needed to do this type of thing many times and am willing to learn a new language perl python or whatever to accomplish this but i just need pointed in the right direction

900089
intraweb	vcl
what i hated about kylix and vcl for web intraweb is that they have components that look like the standard components..

900106
order	add
according to tom kyte unless and until you add order by to a query you cannot say anything about the order of the rows returned

900120
superclass	subclass
the extract class refactoring can help as can extract subclass and extract superclass

900121
callgrind	valgrind
i would use valgrind and callgrind as a base for my profiling tool suite

900122
any	set
when testing if mylabel is null after setting it the result is false so i m trying to figure out any reason why mylabel wouldn t have the same contents of that in the repeater item that i m trying to set it to

900163
pixels	line
the behaviour you are seeing stems from the fact that cocoa s drawing routines draw line centered around the pixels positioning on which you ask them to

900163
pixels	line
let s assume that the line you are drawing are exactly two pixels thick

900163
pixels	line
all you have to do is draw your line one pixels closer to the center of the rectangle

900166
google-chrome	firefox
iirc getelementsbyclassname was introduced in firefox 3 safari 3.1 and has been in google-chrome since the beginning

900166
internet-explorer	opera
i don t know if when it was added to opera but it isn t present in internet-explorer at all

900178
gridview	listview
in a project i was developing i was using a gridview but replaced with the listview as i wanted very specific paging requirements that couldn t be provided by the gridview

900203
lighttpd	thin
if you use things like enterprise ruby and thin you could proxy to either nginix or lighttpd

900203
passenger	thin
i find passenger on dreamhost to give relatively poor performance when compared against running threads by either rack mongrel or thin

900205
compression	streaming
people have mentioned this before the built in .net classes are good a compression streaming not directory structures

900205
compression	streaming
streaming totar string path is a fairly simple and straight forward task unlike implementing compression algorithms

900206
sigaction	signals
sigaction - examine and change a signals action

900221
any	set
it will still implement the list interface but will refuse to execute any add addall set remove operation

900244
xml-serialization	xml
in the answer currently ranked 2nd there the poster drew a distinction between xml-serialization and java xml data binding

900244
xml-serialization	xml
and xml-serialization means creating an xml document from an in-memory object graph.

900244
xml-serialization	xml
is there a difference between java xml data binding and xml-serialization that is worth worrying about

900245
32-bit	64bit
you re on a 32-bit machine or a 64bit windows machine

900272
instances	private
since the class knows about its own implementation - it defines it there is nothing gained in limiting access to other instances since the class implementation declares all the private instances it is already exposed to all of these details

900279
account	userid
when i want to create a portal account for a contact an account is created remotely on a portal application using soap axis and then the contact s portalaccount is populated and the contact is saved local database holds information about the remote account like userid and username etc

900289
packets	lan
there is tcp-ip header information 64 bytes per 1500 byte packets time processing the bufferings in the kernel time spent doing buffering transfers to from the lan controllers chip etc

900296
pascal	delphi
the latest version available from the svn links on the authors website is updated and supports delphi 2009 in addition to free pascal lazarus

900301
double	int
so for basic types char short int long float double you should always prefer pass by value unless you specifically need to use a reference to store a value for use after the function exits

900305
actionscript	mxml
use states to swap out form elements unless the nature of the form itself is highly dynamic in which case you might want to go with a purely actionscript versus an mxml approach

900319
fflush	stdout
i realize there may be a buffering on stdout but shouldn t that be fflush automatically when it s filled

900333
xml-serialization	xml
libraries such as xstream offer xml-serialization rather than xml document processing so that object graphs can use standard java serialization semantics to save restore

900336
multicast	packets
a client that detects a missing sequences number sends out a messge on the multicast grouping hey i missed packets 12345

900336
multicast	packets
you will have to make guesses as to where a packets was dropped and whether the retransmission is most efficiently sent unicast or multicast

900350
32-bit	64bit
you will find some platforms where int is 32-bit long is 64bit and long long is 128 bits but it seems very common for sizeof long to be 4

900352
push	pull
you can pull push between slave clones and master clones like normal since they are well... just normal clones

900352
nested	order
you said that the projects aren t secret public files should not be seen as nested projects but i m suggesting that you make this distinction in order to split them into two directories

900367
transparency	frame
even if the server was able to only send state updates on players within player a s view frame this would still allow player a s hack to show players hiding behind camouflage or cover objects which were presumably transparency in a minor way

900385
cryptography	security
let me give you all my standard caution about rolling your own cryptography algorithms and security systems don t

900444
tuples	any
you can determine the equality of any two iterables strings tuples lists even custom sequences without creating and storing duplicates lists by using the following

900468
pthreads	waitpid
there are various options to waitpid to help you quotes from the pthreads standard

900468
contains	set
if the calling process has sa_nocldwait set or has sigchld set to sig_ign and the process has no unwaited-for children that were transformed into zombie processes the calling thread shall block until all of the children of the process contains the calling thread terminate and wait and waitpid shall fail and set errno to echild

900511
firefox	safari
is there a way to use firefox and firebug but pretend it is iphone s safari by faking the user agent string

900524
private-members	private
if yes then maybe you need to reconsider your naming convention and name private-members with prefix _ for example i think it s the most popular one like _portalservice - then it will be easy to understand that _portalservice is a private member

900527
silverlight	wpf
since silverlight is itself a subset of wpf the games and code you already have would be easily portable into whatever application you set up

900528
hash	md5
take an md5 hash of each image as it comes in

900528
hash	md5
write that md5 hash in the database where you are keeping track of these things

900528
hash	md5
store them in a directory structure where you use the first couple of bytes of the md5 hash hex string as the dir name

900529
firefox	safari
you can fake the user agent string using the instructions great_llama provided but remember that firefox is not safari and it probably won t lay out the page identically

900544
decimal	hex
to locate files among a fixed set of directory alternatively use a fixed maximum-number-of-files n per directory and when you fill up go to the next one the k th photo should be stored at where aaaaaa floor k n formatted as decimal or hex and bbbb mod k n formatted as decimal or hex

900594
webserver	upload
is there any way to write a script that is smart enough to upload only what has changed to the webserver when we execute it don t want it to automatically be upload to the production enviroment we want to execute it manually

900616
.net	wcf
i intermittently get the following exception in my .net wcf service

900626
scheme	lisp
the let construct is similar to the let construct in lisp and scheme

900626
scheme	let
there is a separate letrec construct in scheme for recursive let s

900631
callback	methods
your client script must send its result back to a callback methods on the host object via localconnection swfbridge in this case instead of doing this via return

900643
variables	boolean
we have 128 boolean variables and 128 equations describing the outputs in terms of the inputs which are supposed to match

900654
versioning	upgrade
any change or upgrade to a new versioning of a library can add bugs in very subtle and unexpected ways

900662
kerberos	ssl
the authenticatedstream classes will also impose on you the protocol specific frame size limitations 16k for ssl 12k for kerberos

900666
command-line	cmd
now my understanding of system calls is that they take a string which they enter into a system cmd-line and talk with the os so pause is a dos cmd that pauses the output in the cmd windows

900685
return-value	arguments
first the only way to communicate with the subprocess is by command-line arguments as input and return-value as output

900685
stdin	pipe
popen creates a subprocess and a brand new pipe connecting to the subprocess stdin or stdout

900690
shell	bash
system calls are sent to the shell or command line interpreter of the os dos bash etc and its up to the shell to do what it wants with this command

900698
any	set
you can avoid the separate set statements and move the expressions straight into the query but i don t expect that will improve performance any and make the sql statement harder to read you d definitely want to keep the comments .

900703
gwt-rpc	gwt
right now a lot of my applications use gwt-rpc for retrieving pojo s from a gwt remoteservice which in turn calls a web service soap to get the data

900707
project-management	scrum
it works best if combined with scrum which provides a set of project-management practices

900709
webforms	asp.net
one of the biggest things to think about is the fact that you don t really have control of the form postbacks in classic asp.net webforms

900709
webforms	asp.net
in asp.net webforms you can access the session object

900713
subtract	add
subtract two from the machine number to make it zero based merge them and add one

900720
internet-explorer	google-chrome
it s currently supported by the most recent versions of firefox opera safari and google-chrome but not at all in internet-explorer or konqueror according to quirksmode

900721
cvs	git
source code management tools like git subversion mercurial cvs

900724
contains	any
if helloworld is a package a directory with an __init__.py file it typically doesn t contains any objects

900725
ethernet	packets
it says that ip packets can be disassembled reassembled and therefore bigger than limit on the underling media 1500-byte ethernet resolve ip fragmentation mtu mss and pmtud issues with gre and ipsec

900725
udp	mtu
re udp fragmentation says you should use icmp instead of udp to discover mtu

900725
icmp	mtu
path mtu discovery says that a tcp connection might include implicit mtu negotiation via icmp

900725
packets	ping
so to discover mtu generate ping packets with the do not fragment flag

900728
msbuild	nant
i used to use nant more recently i ve taken to using msbuild

900729
oracle	mysql
oracle or mysql

900732
selected	button
iirc ctrl + click is the correct way to selected multiple items not ctrl + right click unless you re using a one button mouse imac in that case i can t help you

900734
any	set
overall touch tone is a lot easier as there are only a limited set of possible options at any given time

900736
32-bit	64bit
to launch a 32-bit version of explorer in 64bit vista create a shortcut with the target systemroot syswow64 explorer.exe separate

900738
jruby	mri
deploying a ruby-on-rails app with the glassfish gem is very easy and jruby performs better than mri ruby 1.8.x

900743
virtual-machine	vmware
grid hosting usually means that the web space you rent is not located on one potentially shared machine but is more like a virtual-machine think vmware which is hosted on a cluster of servers a grid

900746
c++	lua
you might also need to do something to make sure that the symbol is exported and wasn t name-mangled to a c++ name that will never be found by lua

900747
selected	button
left-click drag to selected and usually the middle mouse button pastes but some terminals may differ putty uses right-click

900747
click	mouse
if you only have two button you click them both together left mouse button + right mouse button

900773
base-class	metaclass
you write your base-class and put abstract true in the metaclass

900781
value	field
if a structure is to be packed to prevent padding accessing unaligned fields comes at a high runtime cost as the compiler has to access unaligned fields using a series of accesses to smaller parts of the field along with shifts and masks to assemble the field value in a register

900782
gridview	listview
sounds like an asp.net gridview listview combination to make a grouping grid

900802
spring	jsf
struts and spring asp.net-mvc are more old school classic asp.net-mvc frameworks whereas gwt and jsf are more component-oriented frameworks

900802
tapestry	wicket
you also have less popular ones like wicket and tapestry

900806
abstract-factory	command-pattern
command-pattern is a little more complex than abstract-factory but is commonly used and powerful

900811
persistence	hibernate
also look at hibernate - the psuedo standard persistence layer

900814
callback	methods
is there a way to hook up a callback methods to be called when an object is deserialized from hibernate

900841
document	element
i believe the element in question is floating to the right of the parent of drag layer_3 once you have made someone an absolute positioning its taken out of the normal document flow

900854
markup	xhtml
so for example the background is solid black for regular xhtml markup then displays slighly lighter inside the php tags to help me identify it quickly

900868
put	get
35 is not a long list as long as you sort it alphabetically when you put it in the list so the user can type the first few characters and get close to the choice they want

900905
button	popup
the first thing that comes to my mind is to use a button together with a popup menu

900907
stream	send
the key difference is that httperf attempts to send a continuous stream of requests at a given speed regardless of whether they are answered or not

900908
hide	show
i have an nstableview and i have the ability for the user to show or hide columns dynamically with a mail-style header context menu

900916
selected	checkbox
you can do this by selected each column individually in ib and disabling the attributes- resizes with table checkbox

900919
submitchanges	datacontext
i want the child objects to be deleted when the parent datacontext calls submitchanges not before

900922
webforms	asp.net
which is the better way to go given that i have experience with asp.net webforms - asp.net mvc or ruby on rails

900940
data-members	instances
an object is similar to a structure with the addition of methods pointers member access-control and an implicit data-members which locates instances of the class actual objects of that class in the class hierarchy essential for runtime inheritance features

900964
twitter	tweets
think of the table cells in a twitter client like tweetsie which show a profiling picture and a tweets

900981
callback	methods
not sure if it could be this simple but i am using jquery to callback json from my web methods

901022
element	dynamic
this will work for pretty much any element where the contents are not dynamic - including backgrounds on panes and such

901041
command-line	cmd
7-zip cmd-line syntax is here 7-zip cmd line syntax

901060
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
i disagree that inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged are ui-specific

901066
order	add
i created a table and set the collation to utf8 in order to be able to add a unique index to a field

901072
user-permissions	userid
i have a table called user-permissions with a fk to the users table by userid and then a string column for the string value of an enum

901077
hash	md5
that said if you actually will use the file s md5 hash in the described way your service will become vulnerable to attacks

901084
dispatchertimer	stopwatch
to set up a dispatchertimer to work like a stopwatch we ll also need an associated timespan representing the time it is run

901099
rewrite	rule
which after the rewrite rule did not work and after i changed it to

901101
kate	vim
have tried many different kate eclipse scite vim komodo each one have some glitches either limited functions or slow and unresponsive

901128
hashtable	set
unordered_set and unordered_multiset hashtable as set

901149
exception-handling	try-catch
in c# will the finally block be executed in a try-catch finally if an unhandled exception-handling is thrown

901178
webserver	host
if you really want to avoid putting a port number in the url for the admin site use a proxy in front of both webserver that uses the host header to redirect requests to for foo.com to one server and admin.foo.com to the other. this separation will help ensure that you don t accidently give regular users access to admin functionality and make the ssl setup easier

901186
versioning	upgrade
what you can upgrade and when is determined mostly by how hard or easy it is to test the new versioning of the system

901191
gethashcode	equals
the system.string overrides gethashcode because it overrides equals and then gethashcode has to be kept consistent

901202
hide	show
i d like to be able to show and hide different entries but they re in the form

901223
hashtable	sorted
so a hashtable lookup will most likely have a search time of o 1 as opposed to o log n for a sorted list or o n for an unsorted list

901224
click	mouse
while in the course of debugging if it starts acting in a way that i don t want it s hard to quit the program since i can t move the mouse over to the terminate button in eclipse and i can t use hotkeys to hit it because the mouse is constant click in another windows giving that windows focus instead

901224
keyboard	mouse
is there a way to listen for keyboard or mouse input from anywhere regardless of what has focus

901233
scons	bjam
while the gnu autotools and gnu make are still popular for open source projects other options include scons cmake makepp and bjam jam

901239
hide	show
i am using a custom title view and would like to show hide a progress-bar in the title view when a thread is working

901242
meta-inf	jar
if i crack open the dwr jar i find meta-inf spring.handlers containing

901244
ruby	php
the problem is that i don t want the installation code to be dependent on a server-side language php ruby - but the app could really really use a dynamic method of collecting the status code in the http request without having hard coded status codes and therefore a necessity for separate installation codes for each error page although we re really only looking at 500s 404s

901246
superclass	subclass
i m having a small project in actionscript 3 and everything would be very much easier if it was possible to call code in the superclass from the subclass

901259
progress-bar	progress
is it possible to show a progress-bar to show the progress of a webservice call

901268
jquery	.post
dave ward has a really interesting .post on creating a simple data repeater asp.net page methods and jquery to display data in a table format

901268
hide	show
to add functionality to expand a row to display detail you can wrap that information in a div tag and attach a click event to show or hide the content

901271
return-value	arguments
you ll need to extend the arrayss to hold 4 members and the return-value of pncompletioncode will be in the last index of the arguments arrays after the call completes

901278
firefox	safari
because the opener property is definitely lost in firefox safari and most browsers when you navigate to a different windows

901295
application-design	business-logic
i consider two alternatives for the application-design use pocos with that adapter in business-logic and make the presentation layer use them or create a service-layer converting between ef entities and dtos

901325
value	field
if the field country is defined as a signed tinyint the maximum value is 127

901325
put	get
you can also put the server in strict mode and get an error if any data is out-of-range

901327
visualvm	jvm
a good tool for inspecting and configuring a single jvm is the jmx protocol and its clients visualvm and the jconsole

901335
arrays	loops
secondly i then need a means of passing this object arrays as a parameter into another function then be able to loops through this object arrays and print out it s contents

901344
administration	account
as an administration take ownership of the directory in question - in windows-explorer - right-click on it properties security advanced owner and from the list under change owner to selected your account

901345
internet-explorer	firefox
internet-explorer 8 has finally been released and firefox is coming up to 3.5

901349
ip-address	hostname
while i don t have specific experience with windows-mobile this error message generally indicates a failure to resolve a hostname to an ip-address

901351
firefox	safari
webkit safari has been supporting it since version 3.1 microsoft since ie4 mozilla since firefox 3.5 browser support overview

901356
memcached	apc
i m currently implementing memcached into my service but what keeps cropping up is the suggestion that i should also implement apc for caching of the actual code

901357
nsstring	nsdata
how do i convert an nsstring value to nsdata

901374
httpwebrequest	webclient
webclient s downloadstring is a simple wrapper for httpwebrequest could you try using that temporary and see if the speed improves

901395
memcached	apc
on our website we use a combination of apc and memcached

901395
memcached	apc
apc to speed up the above mentioned steps and memcached to enable fast and distributed storing and accessing of both global variables precomputed expensive function calls etc that can be shared by multiple clients for a certain amount of time as well as session variables

901395
memcached	apc
if you have a need for multiple frontends somewhere down the line i would try to go with memcached for such caching and storing and use apc as an opcode cache

901407
arrays	map
so like you said for an arrays it s a comparison or a swap for a hash map it may be a manual examination of a key for a graph it s a visit to a vertex or edge etc

901438
toolbar	tabs
also it would be confusing for the user as most iphone apps have a stable set of tabs even if they are sometimes hidden or replaced with toolbar

901439
display	height
display table solves some unsolvable or difficult layouts like 100 height and inside borders without breaking semantics and using actual tables

901446
hide	show
edit if this solution is not appropriate some comments below points out that that this solution is non-standard and only supported by the big-three you might have to re-think whether you should make the non-ajax version the standard solution and use javascript to hide show the information instead of fetching it via ajax

901451
credentials	account
it is an order of magnitude easier to undo checkouts using the same machine and user credentials and working folder than to use the admin account to undo someone else s check outs

901461
arguments	default
command-line arguments default and some rubygems default can be set in

901471
sqltransaction	rollback
the sqltransaction isn t null but it is a zombie can throws an error if you try to do a rollback

901519
perl	ruby
what are the general job prospects of ruby compared to other languages like perl or python

901524
python	java
nope they use c c++ java python javascript i ll go find a reference

901537
dialect	hql
question how to create views on my hibernate entities without relying on a specific sql dialect to keep everything portable or even hql

901556
.net	wcf
there are some good utility classes in the wcf rest starter kit for implementing .net rest clients that invoke services implemented in any platform

901557
profiling	debugging
one of the great things about the xcode debugging tools is that they can be run against an application executing on the device so you can use instruments to do profiling of your application on the actual hardware

901569
3g-network	wifi
is there any inherent limitation of the us at t 3g-network that will block the nat traversal techniques would you be limited to wifi firewall nat traversal

901569
apache-mina	mina
- freecast using mina java network library for nat traversal

901584
json	xml
instead of a link you put a javascript handler that calls a view wich updates the db and returns a json xml object with the new rating for the item

901584
json	xml
the view should update the db accordingly and if it s an ajax call return the json xml response otherwise return the new page

901588
sharpdevelop	monodevelop
n3 for web my preference will be vwd but for other stuff i ll prefer monodevelop and sharpdevelop

901636
.when	ready
.when vss dies and it will tell the boss we have a second repository ready to go

901638
push	pull
you will then see progress bars on clone push pull and other operations

901639
hash	md5
option #3 seems the most convenient to the user but since i save passwords as an md5 hash i don t see how option #3 would be available to me since md5 is irreversible

901667
any	set
if that existed and they couldn t remember any of their details you could set up some sort of automated calling system that told them how to reset their details

901701
lighttpd	apache
in production environment you want to skip this and make your http server apache lighttpd etc serve static files

901712
checkbox	textbox
for example if the age checkbox is checked then i need to show a textbox to enter age else hide the textbox

901733
perl	ruby
about job prospects if you want to work for google it doesn t matter which of python perl and ruby you are fluent at python hackers don t have an advantage over ruby hackers etc

901733
perl	ruby
if you want to do perl or ruby programming a lot google is not the place for you

901733
ruby	php
for example says java is more popular than php which is more popular than ruby

901733
perl	ruby
i ve been programming perl for several years before i started using ruby

901733
perl	ruby
again a few years later i started using python while still doing perl and ruby as well

901733
perl	ruby
in general i tend to be more productive in ruby and python than in perl so i don t do much perl anymore

901733
python	ruby
i like python because it feels like mature well-designed and clean for me compared to ruby which i feel a little bit hackier and i like ruby because i can do powerful operations by typing only a little in contrast python doesn t support assignment in the middle of an expression blocks regexps as first-class objects mutable strings

901733
python	ruby
and the standard library of python is not so versatile the list and dict types have less methods than in ruby

901733
perl	ruby
so for someone new to perl ruby and python i d recommend spending a day with ruby one more day with python and choose which of these two to concentrate on learning

901738
contains	any
strcspn returns the length of the part that does not contains any integers

901738
string-length	integer
we compare that with the string-length and if they differ then there must have been an integer

901759
integer	digits
dammit - store the number as a large integer and send it as a pure digits string

901771
compatibility	platform
i don t see anything in the docs about cross platform compatibility

901779
any	set
this is as fast as proper fields on the entry table it s always up to date and gets set automatically when new data is inserted and we hardly ever need to really use any significant xquery requests anymore

901788
zend-framework	cakephp
i already have the model side down of the asp.net-mvc so i am wondering is it worth using a framework like zend-framework or cakephp or just to code my own view and controllers to work around this problem

901789
button	popup
you ll need to modify the popup button s menu items directly but it s not very hard

901815
arrays	loops
is there anyway to compare arrays in php using an inbuilt function short of doing some sort of loops

virtualbox	vmware
i use vmware workstation at work and sun virtualbox at home

901826
ubuntu	linux
at home w ubuntu linux virtualbox is easier to maintain performs as well as i require and is free

901826
ubuntu	linux
without debating one linux distro s merits over another suffiuce it to say ubuntu meets all my needs

901826
virtualbox	vmware
if vmware delivers only token ubuntu support i ll use virtualbox

901834
polynomials	exponent
but even if there is a polynomials time solution the constants or the exponent could be so large that it would be useless in our problems

901850
cryptography	security
many of them are in cryptography where the security of information systems sometimes depends on tricks like these

901863
json	csv
can t you use json csv or xml

901865
ubuntu	linux
you can test my assertion w any linux distro livecd i d suggest ubuntu 64-bit desktop

901866
textbox	button
the search works fine if the user enters the text in the search textbox and clicks the search button

901866
textbox	button
however if the user enters the text in the search textbox and hits the enter button then the validation for the login control fires off

901886
defined	declare
but really if your going to be consuming an anonymous type outside the methods that it is declare in you should defined a class an have the methods return an ienumerable of that class

901890
put	get
you want to be careful to put the most important options above the fold so they don t get lost

901900
hash	md5
you mentioned you used md5 to hash stored passwords

901908
apache-mina	mina
i would recommend you mina very flexible high level abstraction high performance etc

901919
json	xml
since i get a json string converted from an xml string i may have one or more name nodes there

901980
git-rebase	git-merge
i typically create a topic branch make commits to it then checkout master git svn git-rebase git-merge --squash topic_branch git commit -m summary comment then git svn dcommit

902000
detailsview	formview
the best suggestion i can think of is using something like the detailsview or formview

902030
modifiers	final
additional verification when linking - check final modifiers check for direct subclasses valid fields check constant pool

902059
button	popup
what about using the ajax webmodalanchor to popup a windows with a cancel button

902101
entity-framework	nhibernate
i ve been using linq to sql entity-framework and nhibernate for a while and of the three nhibernate is the most friendly flexible and mature framework

902114
web-config	app-config
same process you should perform with user-interface layer app-config or web-config

902119
entity-framework	ado.net
i would also encourage you to read the ado.net entity-framework design team blog for a list of all the features on ef 4.0 it s an excellent read

902143
datagrid	textbox
i have a wpf screen with a datagrid to the left and textbox to the right of the screen

902143
datagrid	textbox
the datagrid is bound to the observablecollection activities and i can click up and down the datagrid and see my textbox refresh with the correct info

902147
frame	width
image an object in positioning 10 and its width also 10 units which is moving forwarding 100 units per second and due to low frame on each update it should move 80 units

902150
constructor	object
if you are initializing a lot of object or if the constructor code is expensive large this can make a notable difference at load time

902154
windows-vista	windows
windows-vista nvidia using the windows control panel currently

902170
physics-engine	bullet
bullet physics-engine

902171
required	checked
checked in code doesn t required too much effort

902172
grooveshark	last.fm
i d like to code a scrobbling utility for grooveshark using last.fm s api but i don t know if it s possible to get the song information from the grooveshark s flash frontend

902182
default-value	default
you can handle that by passing a default value to the overload registrykey.getvalue name default-value or by using

902192
tinyurl	bit.ly
using ruby how do i convert the short urls tinyurl bit.ly etc to the corresponding long urls

902194
value	field
one thing i ve always had trouble with in cocoa bindings has been error presentation for example when the user types the wrong value into a text field with a formatter attached

902205
sql-server	mysql
my table name is clienteendereco in sql-server but when i make change in my web.config to work with mysql and recompile the program the table name comes clienteendereco

902205
sql-server	mysql
how to make subsonic ignores case in sql-server and mysql

902228
multithreading	wait
however keep in mind that monitor can also wait and pulse which are often useful in complex multithreading situations

902231
shopping-cart	cart
i m working on a shopping-cart in a website and i have my items which have been added to the cart in an arraylist

902242
c-preprocessor	macros
that is a define macros for c-preprocessor

902256
app-store	apple-id
i signed up for the iphone developer program now awaiting approval using a new apple-id this id is different from the one i used on my iphone for itunes app-store purchase

902264
32-bit	64bit
vs hangs for me when debugging c++ 32-bit apps on 64bit os es sometimes.

902277
value	field
i need to reset a mysql field value automatically at midnight

902278
double-quotes	single-quotes
try single-quotes inside double-quotes

902303
value	field
if i understand correctly your loading up a huge string that contains multiple field and their value

902303
value	field
for each field and its value you are going to need to call substring with a specific positioning and length in the larger string

902303
value	field
as an alternative you could implement a simple parsing that would process your string once from start to end and retrieve each field and value in a single pass

902303
value	field
you probably don t even need to tokenize your input...you could just process it in streaming fashion to extract one field then its value stick it in some receptacle and move on

902303
value	field
if your input string is more complex than just a series of field and value its structured a more complex parsing would likely be needed

902320
contains	any
the result does not contains any decimals but it is even less accurate than 1 millisecond

902320
double	int
i understand that a double cannot hold the accuracy of a 64-bit int but at this time the performancecounter only required 46 bits and a double should be able to store 52 bits without loss

902345
datagrid	textbox
in wpf every itemscontrol derived control list your datagrid secretly uses a derivative of collectionview to facilitate the navigation between records items - in effect it is the class which provides the currency mechanism that help other controls like the textbox determine which databound item is current

902369
bazaar	git
i just wonder why nobody mentioned distributed version control systems in this context if you could manage to switch over to a distributed system git bazaar mercury most arguments of your second group would become pointless since they can just start their repository locally and push it to the server when they want and they can also just remove it if they want to restart from scratch

902390
ref	out
byref is equivalent to ref and out in c# it allows the methods to manipulate the parameter itself

902393
python	java
the only problem is that the java api does not have a call similar to python get_by_key_name

902393
put	get
from what i understand the only operations supported within a transaction for the java api are get and put

902403
triggers	insert
since tags is a property of your page object as long as it is attached to a datacontext any changes to that collection will properly triggers deletions or insert in the database in response to remove or add calls

902410
optional-parameters	named
in future versioning of c# where optional-parameters are allowed named parameters will allow you to specify some parameters but not others and to specify parameters in a different order than they were declared

902412
configuration	environment
if you cannot replicate issues in code on your development machines then you need to create a staging server that exactly replicates the configuration and environment of your production environment

902412
configuration	environment
if you still can t replicate the fault on that it means you have either a failed to replicate the environment well enough b do not understand your configuration on your production environment well enough to be able to replicate it or c have not properly configured your application to deal with the change in environment

902453
put	get
i don t know if the problem is related but all i get when i put a url into ie8 is this message

902465
silverlight	wpf
going into wpf also brings you additional benefits of basically knowing silverlight for free it s a subset of wpf at its core

902471
onkeydown	onkeyup
use the onkeydown or onkeyup event to fire a handler function

902490
onkeydown	onkeyup
you would attach an onkeydown or onkeyup event handler to the global document object

902490
onkeydown	onkeyup
w3schools has more information on using these events onkeydown and onkeyup

902516
order	join
normally i would join these two tables through the foreign key customer_id which exists in the order table

902531
keyboard	mouse
have your program open a second windows which displays underneath your main windows but is maximised then your errant mouse clicks will all be received by the maximised windows and it can receive your keyboard input

902532
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
i wanted to know if there is way to log the mysql queries in cakephp being executed when we use the find method on the models i know that ruby-on-rails database queries so does cake do the same if so how can i enable it or use it

902533
string.format	stringbuilder
string.format uses stringbuilder internally...so logically that leads to the idea that it would be a little less performant due to more overhead

902533
string.format	stringbuilder
simple fact is that concatenations...when the number of string parts is known without limitation..you could concatenation a thousand parts...as long as you know its always 1000 parts ...are always faster than stringbuilder or string.format

902538
postgresql	mysql
i can t speak for mysql but postgresql has transactional ddl

902538
updating	updates
even better would be online updates just updating the data directly as new information becomes available

902541
directory	folder
over the years i have vacillated between having my project source folder in a directory one level removed from the root d projects and keeping them in the default location for visual-studio

902541
directory	folder
i finally switched to storing them in the documents folder since vista shortened the path and i got tired of changing default directory for my dev tools

902542
bash	zsh
i have not found a tab-completion script for rubygem in bash zsh

902542
tab-completion	zsh
where can you get the tab-completion scripting for rubygem in bahs zsh

902543
sql-server	postgresql
postgresql does it and sql-server calls it snapshotting and i can t remember the details off the top of my head since i rarely use the thing

902549
stored-procedures	ado.net
i am going back and forth between using nhibernate and hand written ado.net stored-procedures

902549
business-logic-layer	data-layer
i currently use codesmith with templates i wrote that spits out simple classes that map my database tables and it wraps my stored-procedures for my data-layer and a thin business-logic-layer that just calls my data-layer and returns the objects 1 object or collection

902575
coding-style	idiomatic
so it uses the same approach as variables as the standard idiomatic coding-style

902585
hashtable	set
you can see the keys and values that are set by programmatically inspecting uimanager.getdefaults which returns a hashtable

902594
click	mouse
you can use the event object to check the mouse click type

902603
sql-server	oracle
another grave misconception and this is primarily from the sql-server camp...i have very little experience with oracle is that stored procedures are the only thing that can be compiled and the execution plan cached

902603
entity-framework	nhibernate
there are many many benefits that can be gained by using an or mapper and nhibernate is one of the best free ones llblgen is also very nice but is not free. linq to sql and entity-framework are some new offerings from microsoft l2s is soon to be replaced by ef 4.0 from the .net 4.0 framework...which will at least rival if not outpace nhibernate. the biggest hurdle to adopting an orm is usually not the orm product itself nor its capabilities or performance

902606
opera-mini	opera
try to download opera-mini or opera mobile and open the site with that

902611
directory	folder
i havenâ t tried it myself but i guess you can put your projects in my documents and use a symbolic link to the directory in your root folder

902621
contains	elements
if you have two successive elementss of which the first contains some and the second contains text then your code will incorrectly think that there exists an elements that contains sometext

902626
revision	svn
because projects have many and many small files and if you use svn or other revision control system this files have very high fragmentation and slowing system if are storing at os partition

902639
profiling	debugging
individual configuration properties rarely change on their own but you will almost always have a set of profiling usually for different environments debugging production etc

902644
put	get
then i can put my stuff anywhere and move it around and yet i always get to refer to it by y or q or whatever

902656
user-controls	ascx
statusdisplay - ascx user-controls that shows ms ajax exception-handling on partialpostback or update happenning during beginrequest to endrequest

902712
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
yes there are the nsdatecomponents class be used to convert time intervals to and from nsdate objects along with an nscalendar to handle localization issues

902736
put	get
put it all together and you get this

902740
author	posts
i m not sure why you would want to use self.posts.find .. to look for posts from other author

902744
hosts-file	hosts
perhaps the hosts

902767
variables	boolean
my most successful approach was to use three boolean variables to keep track of when the down left and right arrow keys are being held down

902767
keydown	keyup
i would set the boolean to true in the keydown event and to false in the keyup event

902767
variables	boolean
in the keydown event i would also tell the block how to move using the boolean variables to check which combination was currently being pressed

902767
keydown	keyup
i think this is because the second key triggers the keydown event and upon its release the keyup event was fired and the keydown event stopped firing completely even though the first key is fired

902770
logging	trace
the differences are mainly in the implementation and the result is a logging java stack trace when an allocation over a certain size is made which should help you track down the culprit

902777
selected	button
however for file fields selected file to upload the button is still 3d

902788
implements	sealed
this probably isn t necessary until you get into some of the cooler aspect-oriented programming features but if you ve forgotten to make a methods virtual sealed off that methods s class and it doesn t implements an interface and you re uncomfortable making those changes because of existing dependencies then making the switching isn t quite as appealing

902788
logging	trace
i can add or take away logging to any number of my classes without adding any sort of trace or logging statement

902803
great-circle	haversine
mysql great-circle distance haversine formula does exactly what you need

902803
any	set
the data set is really way too small to be worrying too much about database vs code or any other such optimizations

902807
udp	tcp
benchmark test profiling prove that tcp is your bottleneck only then consider udp

902813
variables	boolean
my method takes a boolean variables of yes or no - yes switches to the loading screen and no switches back to the normal view

902815
zero	nan
there are special representations for zero plus and minus zero as well as infinities and other not a number nan value

902818
put	get
in other words how do i get from a clean install of windows 7 with visual-studio to a working gadget that i can install and put on my windows 7 desktop

902836
dictionary	map
or others yet after values you could have 1 2 3 or named styles fee fie fo or fee s fie s fo s where you pass a dictionary instead of a map as the second argument to execute

902838
internet-explorer	firefox
this function works in at least firefox and internet-explorer

902853
background-color	transparency
since you re concerned about the background-color i guess the image you re copying has transparency elements to it

902853
internet-explorer	firefox
by the way both firefox and internet-explorer allow you to drag an image directly from the browser to the desktop or other folder windows to save the original image

902854
value	field
there is a ticket field which adds a value option to a templates variables for a form

902868
implements	super
i recommend that you implements -didrecivememorywarning and after calling super at the very least print a log so you can see whether it s happening to you

902891
visualstatemanager	textblock
i want to add a state called textblock and i want the visualstatemanager to go to that state when the istextblock property dependency property is true

902891
selected	textbox
when this is true i want to change the style of the textbox to be readonly and look just like a textblock but be able to selected the text to be copyable

902893
jquery	.post
if i hit the submit button it .posts a jquery .post to another page and logs a user in

902896
unsigned	short
old_string is an arrays of char and new_string is an arrays of unsigned short so given two chars 42 and 43 this will put 4342 into

902912
gzip	zip
a zip is an archive format while gzip is not

902928
configuration	environment
that d let you substitute your configuration files depending on your environment

902938
udp	tcp
tcp and udp sometimes use a simple checksum to make sure the contents are correct

902952
protected	public
basically it has to do with the view of a package as an api controlled unit hence the recommendation to start your package with your domain name - guaranteed global uniqueness so visibility grows from private - package-private - protected - public

902955
shell	bash
the reason you separate the login and non-login shell is because the .bashrc file is reloaded every time you start a new copy of bash

902955
shell	bash
the .profile file is loaded only when you either log in or use the appropriate flag to tell bash to act as a login shell

902956
protected	public
given progressive levels of access private package protected and public it would be unnecessarily limiting if it went protected then package since that would force me to allow subclasses access in order to grant other members of the same package

902956
protected	public
so protected is between package and public in that it allows a wider exposure of access

902957
keydown	keyup
you should only be tracking the state of the keys during the keydown and keyup events and handle movement elsewhere

902957
keydown	keyup
if you use the second option you will need to look into doevents because if you have code that s constantly running without ever finishing the function the program will not process any other events such as keyup and keydown events

902959
shell	bash
when a login shell exits bash

902959
shell	bash
when an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started bash

902959
put	get
thus if you want to get the same behavior for both login shell and interactive non-login shell you should put all of your commands in either .bashrc or .bash_profile and then have the other file source the first one

902970
administration	account
after some code is performed log in as an administration using code and unlock the account

902971
typedef	struct
instead windows provides a typedef for pointer to struct for that struct

902989
python	java
so i moved to python and then ruby over java because i could build a program incrementally add functions easily and express programs more concisely esp

903002
display	height
1 how do i get it so i can add panels objects with my image label guts to the main panels in a way where it will display with 3 columns fixed viewable height and tidy scrollbar

903018
debugging	trace
you re right in that it s much easier to debugging if you ve got the stack trace and perhaps even a screenie of what the poor old user was doing

903028
16-bit	8bit
what got me was that it was using 32 bit and 16-bit registers for 16 and 8bit data types..

903028
32-bit	16-bit
i didn t get why it wrote it to memory twice though or why it was using 32-bit registers well actually my guess is that a 32-bit processor is way faster at working with 32-bit values than it is with 8 and 16-bit values but that s a totally uneducated guess so i tried rewriting it

903052
perl	tcl
it s a bridge between perl and tcl tk so it can use all of the modern tcl tk features like tile while still having application logic coded in perl

903059
filtering	grouping
logging to public folder makes search filtering easy grouping ...

903063
subclassing	abc
i don t see why an abc couldn t properly have per-instance aka non-static data-members as needed to support the methods it supplies to subclassing

903066
constructor	private
for example you have a bunch of classes that take an instance of logger the abstract class they re based off might have a constructor store it in an member variables or private property assuming of course you remember to call the base constructor grin

903082
button	popup
there is a preview button which will popup a new windows and using javascript to layout the filled up form for display

903100
ruby-on-rails	django
the only way to safely do what you want is to fully submit the form with the file and use a server side language php asp.net ruby-on-rails django take your pick to render out a page with the pretty layout of the form data as well as a preview of the document

903100
postback	ajax
if you don t want the user to leave the page you can roll this into your validation and do an ajax postback

903111
binary-search-tree	tree
this is efficient because treemap uses a red-black tree a kind of balanced binary-search-tree internally

903111
random-access	sorted
if you don t want to keep your data sorted all the time you can always dump your data into an arrays or any random-access containers use sort and then use the stl s binary-search routines on the arrays

903120
constructor	object
meanwhile it came to my mind that if anytime in the future i ll need to extend the knowledge of lib_hashmanager following the functional constructor pattern i can simply add methods to an object and lib_hashmanager will return that produced object

903134
subclassing	base-class
yes its possible to provide member variables in an abstract base-class with the intention that its subclassing will use those members to make a concrete implementation

903134
subclassing	base-class
let s say we make car an abstract base-class which has placeholder for wheels chassis and an engine for its its subclassing to use

903139
radio	click
they click the link radio span whatever you set the src of an image to something that lives on your server

903149
python	ruby
if you already know ruby learning python is not likely to teach you much in the way of big new things

903150
put	get
where would i put onclick changelist to get the values from the list

903157
binary	hex
the previous answer to this which i can t link to because of my member status - sucks can be easily countered since the signeridentity string can be looked for and replaced in the binary using a hex editor

903164
contains	lookup
a lookup of a letter there would give you a sub-trie which contains only the tokens which have that letter as the first letter and then you just continue searching downward as far as you can go

903164
arrays	map
i know for example that there s going to be a function that given a single key and the map will very efficiently search for and return the value associated with that key and that there s also likely a function that will give you a list arrays whatever of all of the keys which you could search yourself using your own code

903164
arrays	map
my interpretation of your data structure is that you have a map where the keys are what you call a pattern those being a list or arrays or something of that nature of characters and the values are tokens

903164
lookup	any
it may help if you start out by writing the parsing code first in this manner imagine someone else will write the functions to do the lookup you need and he s a really good programmer and can do pretty much any magic that you want

903165
contains	any
the params scope is a combination of url form get post fields and it will be printed out in the log as part of the normal output processing so you might not need your own dumping of it - any development or production log contains the params dump at the top of the log line

903171
python	perl
or you could go for a scripting language - perl python .

903179
testng	junit
i m not sure about junit but for testng the strategy would be to define a suite xml file with only the one test and then in your pom configure the surefire plugins to only run that

903185
testng	junit
examples of this include pmd bnd junit testng and so on - no serious projects seem to package the maven plugins with the library proper

903202
mechanize	hpricot
so i am trying to extract the email of my website using ruby mechanize and hpricot

903207
python	ruby
can someone please shed some light on how popular languages like python ruby implements hash tables internally for symbol lookup

903207
linked-list	tree
do they use the classic arrays with linked-list method or use a balanced tree

903211
linked-list	heap
separate chaining arrays with linked-list really works quite well if you have enough buckets and your linked-list implementation uses a pooling allocator rather than malloc ing each node from the heap individually

903213
shell	bash
imagine logging in running x and in x starting a few terminals with bash shell

903213
shell	bash
that means your login shell started x which inherited your login shell s environment variables which started your terminals which started your non-login bash shells

903213
shell	bash
non-login shell only execute .bashrc not .profile or .bash_profile for this exact reason so in there define everything that only applies to bash

903236
any	set
by default cin will have the skipws flag set which means it skips over any whitespace before it is extracted and put into your string

903241
floating	clearfix
next you ll need to apply the clearfix style to your outer panels so that all floating contents inside it don t suffer from the guillotine effect

903254
macports	fink
otherwise you ll need to either build it from source -- which does require the mac dev tools -- or install it with macports or fink

903293
radio-button	selected
from the main menu - windows - preferences - general - browser - selected the external browser radio-button and your preferred browser

903302
gnu-smalltalk	squeak
gnu-smalltalk s are more similar to what you get with squeak s rio package

903306
put	get
to put it above all and check how many pixels you need to position your button so that it does not get above the tabs

903323
c#-to-vb.net	vb.net-to-c#
there s an open source c# vb.net ide called sharpdevelop that has a converter to convert from vb.net-to-c# and c#-to-vb.net

903338
interrupt	delay
you will still see some flicker especially when resizing because there is still a small delay between the two actions and you cannot always get in all of the drawing before the next occurance of the vertical blanking interrupt for the monitor

903343
value	field
i don t know how to obtain the value of the field in the cursor

903345
extjs	gxt
extjs has debugging console but i was not able to find something similar for gxt

903351
click	mouse
events are representations of things like key-presses mouse movement click button pressing getting losing focus clock ticks etc

903384
subtract	division
i just remember the performance counter of when my program started and subtract this from the current counter before converting to double and doing the division

903387
firefox	gecko
rv 1.8.1.6 gecko 20061201 firefox 2.0.0.6 ubuntu-feisty

903391
compression	streaming
first off have you considered using a standard compression streaming like gzipstreaming in .net

903416
derived-class	base-class
what you have done is added a new static preferences member to the derived-class which means that as well as a per-instance preferences member associated with the base-class you also have a global preferences instance shared between all the derived instances

903418
children	nodes
since every nodes in a huffman tree is either a branch with two children or a leaf you can use a single bit to represent each nodes unambiguously

903423

perl	ruby
a basic grep application in ruby python perl

903543
exception-handling	try-catch
i think every request should be redirected to the front controller so wrap your code inside a try-catch block that will intercept the exception-handling and maybe you can redirect to the homepage in the catch block or simply raise a 404 error with an exception-handling handler

903548
bitvector	bitarray
what is the difference between bitarray and bitvector 32 structure and what are the advantages of bitvector 32 structure over bitarray

903555
factors	digits
i need to be able to factors integers of up to 15 digits efficiently

903566
boolean	int
bitvector32 is more efficient than bitarray for boolean values and small int that are used internally

903567
parentheses	operators
by the way the alternation operators | has very low precedence in order to make parentheses unnecessary in cases like yours

903576
hide	show
this code hide and show a div in a td using jquery user-interface s toggle function same result with the show and hide functions

903579
boolean	int
bitvector32 is more efficient than bitarray for boolean values and small int that are used internally

903594
rollback	commit
in case of database connections in python i think the natural thing to do is to create a cursor at the beginning of the with statement and then commit or rollback the transaction at the end of it

903595

the best i can manage is can t load ia 32-bit .dll on a amd 64bit platform and this after downloading the latest lwjgl version

903768
background-image	background-color
you set the background-color and background-image styles

903768
background-position	background-repeat
if the image is smaller than the element you need to use the background-position style to place it to the right and to keep it from repeating and covering the entire background you use the background-repeat style

903768
background-image	transparency
there is no way to specifically limit the background-image to cover only part of the element so you have to make sure that the image is smaller than the element or that it has any transparency areas for the background color to be visible

903777
instance-variables	subclass
since this is ruby-on-rails and there s a whole lot of activerecord magic going on with your models and i m guessing student is a subclass of activerecord base you probably want to use the former since activerecord creates methods to access the database and the value stored in instance-variables may not be what you want or expect

903779
mocking	stubs
any mocking framework when asked to create a mock for a class generates stubs for all the methods in that class

903804

904009
http	ssl
authentication should ideally be left to the webserver as spliff recommends and ssl http is generally good for that

904013
put	get
ruby-on-rails uses some trickery in html forms to act as though a put or delete request was sent even though ruby-on-rails is still using get or post for these methods

904022
command-line	cmd
i initially suspected permission hijinx were going on but i ve verified that i can delete the files manually by su-ing into the mongrel_appnamegoeshere user and issuing individual rm cmd or by copy pasting the cron job to the command-line

904031
default-value	default
in .net all structures value types like int decimal guid datetime etc must have a default parameterless constructor that initializes all of the fields to their default-value

904036

they are not covariant so if i wanted to take a value from the map contains date classes and put it into the map contains serialization elements that is fine but a methods signature that says

904123
readfile	fopen
use php s built-in fopen to open the file and then fseek to the right place based on the range in the request header and then return the partial file using fpassthru instead of using readfile

904140

fat simply uses a single file allocation table which is effectively a gigantic series of linked lists and many modern filesystems use extents

904143
vbscript	jscript
it is possible to call these from vbscript and jscript

for what its worth you could use either jscript or vbscript

904322
authentication	login
i would like to redirect visitors to a login page with added parameters based on the action they are performing after the authentication fails

904329
button	popup
there is also a button to open a popup for some other special things to do in there

904329

note that the attributes needed to be added to the page properties of the pagetag class not the other way around

904348
textbox	button
i have created a simple windows forms application with a textbox a button and a datagridview with names textbox1 button1 and dgv_1 respectively.

904358
hash	md5
even if you do an md5 hash in javascript this does not help because it is trivial to submit the hash to the login page and the hash effectively becomes the password

904359
required	checked
it might make sense to derive your customautorization from the existing authorizeattribute - checked it out and see if you can tack on your required functionallity

904367
selected	button
in the design view for your form within the properties windows selected the events button and scroll down to the formclosed and formclosing events

904372
credentials	security
when that form submission includes credentials then yes you have a security issue

904373
git-rebase	git-remote
look at git-remote --help to see how you can name your teammates repositories in yours so that you can easily import their changes git-rebase onto them or perform merges

904382
contains	any
here is the code that just works without any encoding decoding file da.csv contains the same data as the variables data

my advice is to use onkeyup and onkeydown

904425
margins	padding
also check margins property on the control and padding property on the parent control

904448

you can use a solution like banjollity suggested but even that won t work all the time if your errant mouse click open another fullsized windows currently open in your taskbar for example

904448
ubuntu	linux
this can be done on an ubuntu linux distro according to a howto that i wrote at

904452
associations	model
the ruby-on-rails default behaviour is that the column used to hold the foreign key on a model is the name of the associations with the suffix _id added

904452
associations	model
the associations between your post and comment model classes should look like this

904454

firefox	gecko
the downside is that you ll need to ship gecko with your app i last used the equivalent of firefox 2 and it was around 8mb

904526
boolean	int
just wrap the float boolean int or similar in an nsnumber

904527
linux	unix
see this question comparing unix linux ipc for more information

904584

904587
decrement	increment
i am trying a simple extension methods example and am unable to increment or decrement an int

904587
decrement	increment
any idea why decrement or increment should not work here

904598
sharpdevelop	monodevelop
if you prefer opensource you could also look into sharpdevelop c# and boo and or monodevelop c# but better for linux multiplatform not so great for just windows imho but yout mileage may vary

904600
for-loop	loops
the enhanced for-loops is based on the iterable interface which it uses to obtain an iterator which is then used for the loops

904600
any	set
it s not even possible to iterate over a set in any other way since there is no index or anything by which you could obtain individual elements

904610
decrement	increment
the reason your code is not working is because of the way you are using the increment and decrement operators

904613
decrement	increment
having said that it is confusing to name your methods increment or decrement since it does not automatically assign the value back to the original

904617
post-increment	pre-increment
the one is called the pre-increment operators and the other is called the post-increment operators

904622
rewrite	rule
you can use the following rule to rewrite any request of a path like foobar internally to foobar

904642

this will display all the digits even beyond excel s numeric precision limit but the cell generally won t be able to be used directly in numeric calculations

904668
directory	folder
child directory solution folder which are logical collections of projects

904672
compatibility	platform
if you re looking for open source and cross platform compatibility i would look at eclipse

904694
.when	ready
it s primarily a learning tool however so you ll need to eventually pick up visual-studio or something similar .when you re ready to develop a functional windows app

904709
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
if you need to access the db sequentially let s say you do a selected then another selected and then an updates you may reuse the connection i mean the same sqlconnection instances but if you need to access the db while reading from a sqldatareader then you ll need 2 different connections

904715
haskell	sml
haskell actually does this but in languages like f# and ocaml and sml which have unrestricted side-effects this is a bad idea because it might reorder the side-effects too

904722
perl	ruby
some languages support this technique well ruby perl others not so much

904728
for-loop	arrays
after you get it sorted you can create the last arrays in another for-loop

904736
selected	button
when i press the back button at the top of the navigation control to return to the previous uiviewcontroller that contains the tableview and then i selected 1 of the 2 items in the uitableview again it eats up almost 2m of memory according to instrumentation

904754
constructor	object
and the component i want to display the selected object has the following constructor

904763
environment	building
because you are using separate compilers it follows that you have separate building environment

904774
button	popup
have you considered adding the popup button via dom methods easy or innerhtml if you like after everything is validated

904777
microsoft.build	msbuild
my book inside the microsoft.build engine using msbuild and team foundation build

904780

expressionengine	wordpress
i m trying to put my old wordpress powered site into expressionengine just for giggles and i m stuck with my project layout i want a grid of my projects each a div with a set height width

904818
user-interface	drawing
at that point the uml tool would give you traceability from domain model elements entities their attributes and their relationships back to use cases and user-interface elements and mappings between your domain model and db schema could be left in the air because in the vast majority of cases they should be simple enough to track without drawing anything

904844
managed-code	unmanaged
the ways i know to work with managed-code from unmanaged is to build a dll or to work with com

904887
mathml	latex
i am developing a simple translator from mathml to latex using lex and yacc

904897
bugzilla	trac
among the regulars are bugzilla mantis and trac

904922

if you don t have the serialization attribute on your custom classes it will not work correctly because this is how the classes are marshalling between the processes

904926
packets	ping
figuring on an average 250ms ping an average time for a remote operation is about half a second or more just because it takes that long to generate the .network packets send over the .net wait for the remote server to receive wait for the remote server to process wait for the response and parsing the response

904930
repository	entity
if we have an understanding that a repository handles almost exclusively very rich domain entity then you numerous dto s could simply map back

904930
repository	entity
so your repository only saves rich entity s not numerous dto s

904930
repository	entity
the whole point of dto s is to keep things simple for the presentation or say for wcf datatransfer it has nothing to do with the repository or the entity for that matter

904930
repository	entity
the only two ways to ever acquire an entity is through a factory new or a repository existing respectively

904935
user-controls	ascx
is not working from within ascx user-controls

904936
forms-authentication	security
with a sharepoint site which is partially anonymous and partially behind a forms-authentication login how do you manage the security of it

904947
entity-framework	data-access
i debated whether to use the entity-framework for my project since microsoft says this will be their go-to solution for data-access in the future

904948
backslash	regex
the double-quote syntax is pretty unusual -- most other regex implementations only use backslash for escaping so i d be inclined to use backslashes as it makes the regex more conventional .

904949
double	int
decimals and double can represent int exactly so there will be no representation error

904979
put	get
you will get an arrays that either has agree yes or nothing depending on if they check the box so no need to put the arrays brackets unless you have tons of boxes

904999
constructor	object
since the infinite loop is in the constructor and it s trying to create new objects i can t just set a boolean flag to prevent this because neither object ever gets finished being constructed

905008
attributes	properties
if i throw an exception-handling in the setter of the properties to which they are bound they both show the proper red sign and error but if i decorate the properties by validation attributes for example only the dataformtextfield control and not the textbox control will show the error

905009
contains	elements
even if you separate initialization from construction you still have a cyclic dependency with hidden membership the wrappers reference each other but hide the foo bar elements from a contains check

905009
dictionary	arrays
a direct relational approach would work but requires searching mechanisms and assumes that wrappers would be created as-needed instead of in advance an arrays with search functions or a pair of dictionaries dictionary dictionary would work for the mapping but might not fit your object model

905012
implements	abstract
i would recommend you get rid of the mutual dependency for example through the dependency inversion principle -- have at least one of the two sides foo and bar or their wrappers depend on an abstract interface which the other side implements rather than having two concrete classes directly depend on each other which can easily produce circular-dependency and mutual-recursion nightmares like the one you re observing

905013
click	mouse
to get the list of allocations click the little triangle in a circle disclosure triangle that appears next to the block s address when you hover the mouse over it

905016
markup	xhtml
if you re actually serving this as xhtml and thus having it run through an xml-parsing it won t render as the markup is not valid

905023
selected	listbox
so this focuses the listbox but then if the listbox contains any items it focuses either the selected item or the first item if one is selected

905024
base-class	inherited
there s no special base-class to inherited from no special list class that all your one-to-many properties have to be etc

905024
data-access	nhibernate
you will most likely find that you can exercise very fine-grained control over the data-access strategies that nhibernate uses so much so that nhibernate is likely to be an excellent choice for your complex cases as well

905028
google-chrome	firefox
when in tinymce i press anything that is supposed to open a new windows such as color picker or a link dialog firefox google-chrome seems to start opening the windows and then all of the sudden it opens a standard file download dialog asking if i am sure i want to download the requested html file

905028
google-chrome	firefox
same firefox google-chrome with all same plugins is completely able to run all tinymce samples correctly on their example page

905036
indentation	pyflakes
there are a number of other very useful plugins for python development in vim such as pyflakes which checks code on the fly and python_fn.vim which provides functionality for manipulating python indentation code blocks

905044
contains	elements
you ll also need a style elements to contains your styles

905048
rewrite	rule
adding the ns flag will make this rule not operate on subrequests which i think should fix your problem unless you re also doing a 301 on the articles - index.php articles rewrite but that would be madness

905052
jmockit	junit
i am trying to use emma to measure coverage of some junit tests that use jmockit

905073
data-structures	map
the second possibility is that in the particular flavor of stl that you are using the map clear function does not efficiently clear out internal data-structures used to maintain the associative indexes

905078
integer	zero
the size can be zero or any positive integer

905078
nskeyedarchiver	plist
if so can i use other archive methods say plist or nskeyedarchiver to implement that

905122
cryptography	security
maximum security will be defined by how you use the cryptography api that you choose

905123
attributes	properties
i guess with a bit of work you could add human-readable descriptions to each properties via attributes so you could define the label for each control in the user-interface

905132
put	get
and besides all of this is moot if folks can get physical access to your machine and put in a key logger

905133
highlight	selected
only want to highlight the region when it is selected using a

905147
internet-explorer	safari
this javascript is deployed for both internet-explorer and safari

905258
environment	execution
edit i should also mention that the subprocess module allows you to set the environment available to the execution process through the env parameter

905264
attributes	properties
the extended custom properties will be used to derive attributes of the xml web-part like xml url xsl url etc

905271
arrays	loops
it maps the hash code of each object to its byte arrays so when an object contains a reference to another object it a doesn t serialize the same object twice and b doesn t serialize itself into an infinite loops

905280

the simple application uses a uinavigationcontroller onto which new instances of uiviewcontroller are pushed

905302
selected	cell
it creates and pushes another myviewcontroller instance onto the navigationcontroller when the user selected a table cell

905302
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
as far as i know the uinavigationcontroller owns the pushed uiviewcontroller instance which can then safely be released from the client that allocated it

905313
entity-framework	ado.net
i have a repository pattern i created on top of the ado.net entity-framework

905313
constructor	object
this is what the controller constructor look like the first one creates an instance of the validation object

905317
put	get
so say i put in happy i should get an arrays back of

905318
ruby-on-rails	django
if it is just you or you have unique requirements you may find that you spend way too much time customizing a cms suite to get what you could have done quickly in .net ruby-on-rails django symphony etc.

905325
json	xml
and also it s better to use json for these purposes data in json format is usually much smaller than the same data in xml format

905339
authentication	logout
when i click the logout button from my authentication page the new location executes a php function to logout the user updates the logged status of the user in mysql

905358
logout	login
how about invalidating the login from the previous pc logout when the user logs in to another pc

905367

905421
executable	jar
applications from the web also jar are allready compressed files i don t know about cli executable

905447
selected	listbox
however when it executes the method it also calls the selectedindexchanged event handler of the listbox even though i am not setting the selected index in the method above

905447
selected	listbox
or is there any other event which is only for user selected listbox items using mouse click

905454
websphere	ibm
as stated by martin service is a crucial part of why people purchase ibm websphere products and btw

905456
pascal	delphi
pascal analyzer has support for all delphi versions except the latest one from it s faq page

905457

you should only do this however when you can implements the utility class using only the public interface of the type you are extends

905460
principles	srp
in oop there is the single responsibility principles srp which basically states that every class should only have one reason to change. if adding an instances methods to a particular class would violate the srp consider factors that logic out of the class

905464
reflection	runtime
reflection is costly because of the many checks the runtime must make whenever you make a request for a methods that matches a list of parameters

905467
any	set
it may just be launched with its current working directory set to and logging there cause it doesn t know any better

905472
attributes	properties
it can also be used to dynamically execute methods or set properties at runtime as is done with custom attributes

905477
shutdown	restart
my application s functionality was to restart shutdown and i cannot make it cross platform in one single app

905497
websphere	ibm
in the end websphere only gets sold to big corporate types where the manager knows little technology doesnt care about wasting h h h h investing the companies money and becasuse of the old addage - nobody got fired buying ibm

905522
deployment	install
no one seemed to answer your question about jre install base though many people agreed with your assumption that jre deployment is very low

905539
compact-framework	.net
there is also a built in http downloader class in the .net compact-framework you can use

905541
perl	c++
minimalists and people who believe there ought to be one and ideally only one obvious way to do it as the zen of python recites will i guess mostly agree with your doubts naveen while fans of perl s there s more than one way to do it or sql s syntax with a bazillion optional noise words giving umpteen identically equivalent syntactic forms to express one concept will no doubt be complaining that ruby and especially c++ just don t go far enough in offering such synonymical redundancy

905547
sequences	unique
1 your randomizer must be repeatable by using a unique seed for each user and using the random class you can generate the same sequences of random numbers

905587
contains	set
here we first check if textbox2 contains the - character and if it does we split the text in two parts and set the text of textbox1 to the part that is left of the first - character

905597
contains	elements
what is the contains block of an absolutely positioning elements

905597
contains	elements
for simplicity assume the contains block is a block elements not inline elements .

905597
contains	elements
1 if the absolute positioning elements has a closest ancestor that is positioning non static relative fixed or absolute then that ancestor is the contains block

905597
contains	elements
2 if there is no such ancestor then the viewport is the contains block and so the absolute positioning elements is relative to the viewport

905597
google-chrome	firefox
if so i think ie 6 and above firefox safari google-chrome all follow this behavior accurately

905610
contains	elements
the contains block is the last positioning elements

905641
execution	jobs
maybe you could meet this scope using jobs inside sql-server 2005 standard or higher and simply execution queries stored-procedures

905659
any	set
do any two people in a set have the same birthday

905663
directory	folder
i m not sure whether they explicitly support adding folder rather than just individual files to zip files but it should be quite easy to create something that recursively iterated over a directory and its sub-directories using the directoryinfo and fileinfo classes

905668
hide	show
i have an asp.net web application where i have a page signup.aspx and a home page.aspx.in my home page i have link to the signup.aspx page.i want to hide the file extension.aspx from the addressbar when someone click on the signup link in home page.i want to show it as

905671
debugging	trace
use debugging trace

905689
overwrite	import
i need it so that when i import the outputted sql my current wiki entries will not be overwrite

905702
contains	set
yes you can set a datatemplate contains a button for an itemscontrol control that is binded to that collection

905711
stored-procedures	ado.net
i ve always thought in term of the domain and while i ve used stored-procedures ado.net in the past it s only when i finally moved to nhibernate that i was satisfied with my persistence mechanism

905725
textbox	button
i have an aspx page in which i have 3 asp.net textbox and 1 asp.net button control.i want to do a client side validation before the postback happens when i click on the button

905764
double	int
how do i copy a double int bool or other built-in type to a byte arrays in c#

905765

i didnt think it was necessary to post but i will update my post with the entire main loop if it is necessary but i believe i am just off with my understanding of malloc and free

905778
uilabel	uiview
i ve come up against layout problems using a standard uiview and uilabel because of the variables size content

905788
detect	move
i was half-fantasising about a way to either detect the drop operation directly or to perhaps detect when a control is move so i can determine where it should go

905798
integration-testing	automated-tests
automated-tests unit- integration-testing

905831
decimal-point	zero
the scale of new bigdecimal 20 is zero because you ve got no decimal-point in there

905906

after deployment on iis 6 methods declare in global-asax for application start etc. are not execute

905923
managed-code	unmanaged
what is the correct way to marshal arrays from vb.net managed-code to unmanaged com code

905933
contains	any
exchanged contains with any

905961
keyvaluepair	key-value
the todictionary extension methods works around using two lambda expressions to generate the key-value pair rather than the keyvaluepair type

905998
contains	elements
as you use contains i don t think it s a good idea to do it that way as it is a slow operation linear search for every elements in allowedobjects you re enumerating preferredobjects

906007
textbox	button
the purpose of the question is that i would like to implement a comment script for a site like this ommmm.de modelle_sticky.htm each time a team memeber hits one of the button comments - send i would like that everything that was typed into the textbox below will update immediately into the space above

906007
textbox	button
it just seems odd to me that there seems to be not one most simple solution where you can type something into a textbox hit a button and have it be embedded as html on the same page right away

906009
integer	digits
for example with a 16-bit signed integer you re limited to four digits 9 999 is the largest power-of-ten-minus-one that can be represented

906009
subtract	time
however there are ways to handle this by further processing the fractional part shifting it by four decimal digits each time and using subtract the integer part until you have the precision you desire

906018
for-loop	loops
please correct me but the test2 for-loops executes only 1 step because of the throwing exception and test1 caught the exception inside the loops and is executed 2500000 times

906026
firefox	safari
the following solution works for prototype tested in firefox ie 6 and safari

906082
order	add
in the beginning we used just the add service reference menu option in order to create a wcf proxy

906092
getter	setter
the idea is to have duplicates getter and setter for a field which is lazy-evaluation loaded

906092
getter-setter	setter
the idea is that the private getter-setter pair is what hibernate uses internally and the public getters and setter are transient and used by the developer

906108
entity-framework	nhibernate
look also at orm frameworks like linq-to-sql entity-framework nhibernate etc

906112
value	field
i want to show a uipickerview on becoming firstresponder of a uitextfield not the keyboard and fill the value in text field form the picker view

906115
selected	checkbox
selected the make single instance application checkbox to prevent users from running multiple instances of your application

906133
any	set
to be honest the content type is usually set correctly in any case

906143
font-size	width
i was wondering whether sifr-text that is rendered in flash has the same width across all browsers flash plugins in case i set an absolute font-size

906156
textbox	button
i was using a file upload functionality in asp.net .if the users are using the browse button shown next to the textbox and selecting the required file then there is no issue about the file getting upload

906156
textbox	button
but instead if they are directly typing the file name in the textbox instead of using the browse button then i should be able to check if really the file exist in the client machine

906174
silverlight	wpf
microsoft has invested heavily in wpf and xaml over the past few years and using the same core infrastructure on silverlight which microsoft really cares about is a strong point for sticking to it for enough time

906188
fwrite	eof
i am using fwrite and able to write into a file but how can i clear the file each time it writes instead of writing at the eof

906198
double	int
a lot of code either uses int with double floats

906204
buffering	streaming
lots of reasons to use byte - anything that handles raw binary streaming images files serialization code etc is going to have to talk in terms of buffering

906246
versioning	upgrade
super simple to upgrade from older versioning

906274
python	java
java .net and python will still i d bet be around

906282
postback	ajax
i was thinking that ajax should postback an id of lastmassage recieved to the web service and web service would send the user all the latest posts since the last recieved messages

906306
associations	model
all you have to do is create the appropriate model associations and cake will do the work for you

906310
virtual-machine	vmware
still it does not work on a clean virtual-machine under vmware

906319
vb.net	vb6
that said an awful lot of vb developers were annoyed when the classic vb was discontinued and vb.net was not compatible with vb6

906326
order	add
this means that in order to be pedantically correct about the real number of seconds passed since the unix epoch you should probably add the leap seconds to the result obtained above for applications that rely on this

906356
gridview	listview
the reason to use listview would be if you need some special layout for example to create a table that places more than one item in the same row or to break free from table-based rendering altogether - which is not possible with gridview

906366
arrays	loops
because the ocaml compiler could recognize that the arrays were completely independent - it didn t need to worry about one iteration of the loops stepping on the values used by another

906379
httpd.conf	.htaccess
the block that you are using can only be configured inside the httpd.conf file main server config and will not work inside .htaccess

906379
httpd.conf	.htaccess
you can try moving the virtualhost inside httpd.conf and just leving rewritecond and rewriterule inside the .htaccess file

906382
viewwillappear	viewdidload
load the data in the table in the viewwillappear methods instead of viewdidload

906382
viewwillappear	viewdidload
viewwillappear will be called every time your view is going to appear whereas viewdidload is called just once when the view is created

906406
order	add
i know in order to do that i need to add and then activate the view to the region using the regionmanager

906431
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning in which this is fixed

906443
any	set
any register bit set reset etc

906459
associations	model
each model can have associations defined such as belongsto hasmany hasone etc

906459
associations	model
another benefit of defining associations between model to answer your comment on rob s answer is that you don t need to put all your model in the uses variables

906461
contains	set
i would rather have set the session.timeout for the firstupdate variables explicitly but apparently timeout is universial for the entire session object and the variabless it contains

906469
pointers	stack
a full stack is one where stack pointers points to the latest word on stack as opposed to the next location to use

906473
consistency	acid
now because it runs in one go the c consistency in acid means that foreign keys and uniqueness are handled during but will be ok before and after

906510
contains	set
you can set a variables in the click event which contains what tab was last selected

906530
contains	elements
my concern is this my structure basically contains n elements of the same type a mapping between a date and a number and i want to be able to quickly iterate through them in javascript

906570
httpwebrequest	webclient
the easiest way is to use the webclient class that simplifies most common uses of httpwebrequest

906574
double	int
in a double 120 is stored precisely because it s an int value

906581
implements	extends
it s very difficult to see what you have done there but it looks as if what you have marked as second thread is used by both threads some confusion over implements runnable extends thread and actual threads

906583
animation	rotation
they re simple uiimageviews but a custom class that does this rotation animation on her own

906607
shell	bash
if you are using the bash as your shell

906631
core-animation	uikit
i m sorry for the bad news but i strongly advise against using uikit and core-animation for frame to frame based apps

906649
terminal	prompt
and force prompt even if stdin does not appear to be a terminal

906649
local-variables	function-call
this is great for inspector objects in the global scope but what happens if the exception-handling was raised in a function-call and i d like to inspect the local-variables of the function

906652
integer	modulus
modulus should only be used with integer

906655
put	get
you can use the h message and h messages tags to view reported errors though because you re using ajax you ll have to put them in something that will get re-rendered

906655
value	field
the documentation says that this will only submit the value for the control so the text field will not be involved in the apply request values process validations process updates phases

906657
required	checked
the instanceof checked can all be replace by calls to virtual methods that perform the operations you required

906658
versioning	upgrade
if i install the all new and latest versioning when i save the rpt file it tells me that the original file was from an old versioning does not specify which and that the save will upgrade it to the latest format thus previous versioning of the application will not be able to use it

906690
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
if you are self hosting the wcf service you cannot solve this because they required either a clientaccesspolicy.xml file or a crossdomain.xml file allowing access to the services from your silverlight url however there is no way to serve an xml from the root of the self hosting wcf server

906697
perl	c++
if you don t like the idea of c c++ get into a scripting language instead - bash vbscript wmi or perl or python

906699
udp	tcp
i would investigate how operating system work how they allocate resources for you how they schedule programs and threads how networks work routing tcp udp behaviours and limitations etc. and some database theory

906735
environment	execution
you can use the cultureinfo class to set the culture for your execution environment

906745
constructor	object
i would think then in the constructor of the smartform object that status would equal ready but instead it equals null

906782
postback	ajax
failing that you could just invoke the href which will do a full postback but should accomplish the desired action if the action is written to handle both ajax and non-ajax requests

906786
interceptor	inject
will a java ee 5 compliant application server jboss 5 inject into the interceptor

906788
http-post	post
i have a wcf service hosted in iis asp.net that accepts http-post not form post of serialized objects

906794
value-initialization	rvalue
for a type t t value-initialization an object of type t and yields an rvalue expression

906794
value-initialization	rvalue
the expression t where t is a simple-type-specifier 7.1.5.2 for a non-array complete object type or the possibly cv-qualified void type creates an rvalue of the specified type which is value-initialization

906826
selected	checkbox
basically the first part checks if the switch is set checkbox selected

906826
selected	checkbox
the second is the filtering given the checkbox is selected

906834
macros	vba
issues though office 2007 supports vba application - vb macros code menu bars are not appearing

906834
macros	vba
indeed vba macros menus display under add-ins

906834
macros	vba
is there any ideal approach to migrate vba macros application to office 2007

906856
licensing	gpl
upon reading the semweb licensing information it states that it is currenly licensed under the gpl and the creative commons attribution license but that originally it was only licensed under the cc attribution license

906864
updatepanel	gridview
why don t you wrap your gridview button in an updatepanel inside the modalpopup

906871
where-clause	sql
you can build a sql statement with a dynamic where-clause

906878
delphi	c++
advantages are it s pretty widely supported both within delphi the type library editor has everything you need and updates your code and com internals and registering are catered for from the comserv unit and outside of delphi i use it in a number of project to interact with all sorts of applications c++ projects word and excel documents using vba oldskool asp...

906885
external	host
do your request to your server using ajax have the server request and return the response from the external host

906901
32-bit	64bit
32-bit os skus have a much lower limit on non-paged memory than 64bit os sku s

906907
integer	zero
its an integer starting at zero but its not an identity-column for the table

906910
infinispan	hazelcast
recently i ve become quite involved experimenting with lightweight grid frameworks hazelcast gigaspaces infinispan

906916
entity-framework	ado.net
the ado.net design team has just recently posted poco in the entity-framework part 1 - the experience which will help you get right on track

906945
url-encoding	url
the current version of your code is url-encoding the slashes and colon in the url which is confusing webrequest

906958
keyvaluepair	key
value and key are public properties of keyvaluepair structure

906966
directory	folder
git doesn t handle branching with directory in the same way that svn does with branch folder

906966
push	pull
i can push and pull my branches to there as i wish

907000
document	element
it is supposed to remove an element from document when all effects on it are completed

907010
configuration-files	web-config
there are a lot of modifications in both web-config and views web-config configuration-files that need to be made for working with asp.net-mvc source

907039
driver	kernel
i tried asp.net-mvc in my network kernel driver

907042
firefox	opera
in firefox and opera you can do

907042
firefox	opera
is this something that will come in an upcoming javascript version or just custom implementation in firefox and opera

907045
value	field
my issue is that when i enter a new value in the field for mobile number and then click the save button the value typed is not logged out.

907048
revision	svn
thus the svn date property seems to be set correctly however when i tell tortoisesvn to display the list of logs it still displays the entry for the head revision as if it had been committed with the old timestamp 2003-01-01

907048
revision	updates
i have already updates the working copy and even checked it out again and before that i manually updates the timestamp of the file corresponding to the head revision but still the old date is displayed by tortoisesvn

907050
ruby-on-rails	django
while you can do a cms in ruby-on-rails there are much more efficient technologies for the task such as drupal and django

907050
drupal	django
in fact iâ d say if youâ re looking at a java portal development effort you should evaluate drupal and django for the task instead

907099
instances	self
you should bind the methods instances of self

907128
http	ssl
we place our sensitive information in the hands of http ssl all the time i dont see how this is any different

907166
constructor	object
note i do not want to pass any information into the object s constructor

907188
command-pattern	memento
i suppose you are coupling command-pattern with a memento

907195
selected	button
i would like to be able to go to the next previous diff and copy the selected diff left without having to click the tiny little button

907198
value	field
now you can use get int field with the appropriate constant like hour_of_day or so to read the value you need

907210
binary-tree	nodes
it seems to me that it is a full binary-tree as every nodes is either a leaf or has two child nodess however i have this feeling that we were told it is not a full binary-tree

907221
binary-tree	nodes
a perfect binary-tree is a full binary-tree with all leaf nodes at the same level

907221
binary-tree	nodes
thus a full binary-tree is a binary-tree in which each nodes has either zero or two children

907233
selected	checkbox
but inline table with simple selected field and delete checkbox is much miserable for me and i want to show here previews of images or video youtube

primitive	int
std list is a node-based container so if t is a primitive type or relatively small user-defined type then the memory overhead of the node-based linkage might be non-negligible - consider that is likely to use at least storage for each element whereas std vector will only use sizeof int storage with a small header overhead

it s quite reasonable for a subclass to instantiate something that implements imyrequiredinterface and pass that to the superclass constructor with a super ... call

907760
base-class	inherited
if you inherited from a class that has a parameterless constructor it means that the author of this base-class intended that it cannot function properly without supplying the necessary dependency

907760
base-class	inherited
so if you really think that you should completely override this behavior you don t have to inherit from this base-class otherwise just copy the constructor in the inherited class

dictionary	arrays
while trying to optimize its speed i like the challenge i was shocked to find that the performance of dictionary key lookups was quite slow compared to arrays index lookups

908050
dictionary	arrays
iirc a dictionary has on average o 1 lookups while an arrays has worst-case o 1 lookups so i do expect the arrays lookups to be faster but not by this much

908050
dictionary	arrays
i suppose if this is as fast as the dictionary lookups can be i have to rethink my approach and use arrays instead although indexing the rankings will get a little tricky and i ll probably have to ask another question about it

908052
m2eclipse	maven
maven for builds and m2eclipse

908055
dictionary	arrays
performing a dictionary lookup is relatively complicated - very fast compared with say a linear lookup by key when there are lots of keys but much more complicated than a straight arrays lookup

908068
dictionary	arrays
each arrays lookup is almost intantaneous negligeable whereas a dictionary lookup may need at least an extra subroutine call

emacs	vim
emacs vim eclipse or textmate sure

908541
sharing	share
if you are a full microsoft shop and use .net for your entire application stack then i would say sharing the api is a great way to gain code reuse you have to be careful how you design your api so you don t bleed domain concerns like repositories into your presentation. if you don t have any plans to migrate your client applications to other platforms you plan to stay on .net for the foreseeable future then i think its perfectly acceptable to share your service api assemblies and even then in a multi-platform client environment sharing service api with .net clients should still be acceptable. there is always a trade off between the architecturally ideal and the practical and achievable within budget

908565
required	checked
usually when doing this i skip depends and just use the required jquery-validate rule and let it handle the checked based on the given selector as opposed to splitting the logic between the validate rules and the checkbox click handler

908565
required	checked
really it boils down to required #oneselected checked

908565
checkbox	textbox
also i shortened up your checkbox toggling a bit making use of jquery s wonderful chaining feature though your caching to textbox is just as effective.

908571
javascript	dom
this sounds more like you want to improve the dom interaction performance rather than javascript so in that vein

908571
google-chrome	firefox
yes document.write is bad it blocks additional loading any javascript executing before your pages has finished loading basically requires all other processing to stop -- modern browsers like safari and by proxy google-chrome and firefox do a degree of content preloading in order to prevents loads from blocking but subsequent style resolution etc is largely blocked

908571
google-chrome	firefox
oh for animations you should look at css animations and they perform much better than any javascript implementations but they re only present in safari and by proxy google-chrome and firefox 3.5 -- definitely not in ie -

908695
exception-handling	try-catch
there is a return statement in the methods but if an exception-handling is thrown it might not be reached so you either need to return in the catch block or remove the try-catch from encrypt as i mentioned before

if not or if you can factor out those you could make the tile object themselves into an enumeration of 16 constants with a tile.getimage method that returns a fixed image passed to the constructor

910343

i had to use 32-bit mysql on my 64bit macbookpro with ruby-on-rails b c mysql.gem couldn t handle 64bit mysql

versioning	upgrade
i have recently upgrade my asp.net-mvc application from beta to versioning 1

910505

910583
google-chrome	firefox
the table renders differently in firefox from ie8 google-chrome

910587
python	ruby
i assume i could get one of the ruby or python css dsls running under ironruby python but this client is very very particular about what software frameworks are installed

910596

the simplest way to get the modularity you seek is to put those portions of controller code into separate methods set_up_graph1_data set_up_graph2_data etc. which you simply call from your index action to set up the variables for the view

910610
textchanged	textbox
i think it s worth considering doing the filtering on the textbox s textchanged event

910617

i need to hash md5 all the password in our sql-server 2000 database

910617

hash	md5
no there is no native tsql command to generate md5 hash s in sql-server 2000

910655
splitter	panels

910822
debugging	trace
i believe the answer to be yes looking at the debugging info trace listener output

dom parsing with xpath and javascript

910862
elementtree	lxml
use lxml or elementtree to parsing the xml and find the headings sections paragraphs and lists

dictionary	arrays
then you can finally run through the arrays you end up with and put everything into a dictionary so you can access the values by name

but for this explicit case the special yyyymm field is not to be considered as a date field but just as a tag o whatever would be used for matching the exactly year-month researched value

911079

the main reason for using them is that you then don t have to worry about any possible problems arising when switching between 64bit and 32-bit os

also if you are interfacing to any legacy code that you new was destined for 32-bit or even 16-bit then it avoids potential problems there as well

internet-explorer	google-chrome
since my original post both internet-explorer and google-chrome have added built-in developer tools that are quite useful

911243
gridview	listview
i have a listview with a gridview with 3 columns

there are a few things that the bash shell isn t liking about this script that i m trying to do

911353
arrays	loops
you ll have to break into a loops and split each arrays and add to the list

911357
attributes	properties
i need to animate the height attributes of iframe but seems like the animate function accepts style properties only

911366
64bit	x86
the nearest related question on stackoverflow dealt with getting nunit to run on vista x64 in visual-studio 2005 nunit.exe cannot work on vista 64bit if x86 build stackoverflow.com questions 208985 nunit-exe-cannot-work-on-vista-64bit-if-x86-build

911369
hide	next
if the top item were selecteded then you key down it would selected the next item but then scroll the element down and hide what was just selecteded

911375
tuples	set
i hope you see why i would want to subtyping tuples or other basic types like set

911390
inotifypropertychanged	ivalueconverter
while you ve got the right general idea the way you re going about this is a very un-wpfy way to do this - one better way to do this is to have a bool dp in your business object class or have the bo implements inotifypropertychanged then bind the bool to the foreground color via a custom ivalueconverter that returns istrue

911400
value	field
in the subform properties data tab delete the value in the source object field

911430
checkbox	button
user might check any of these checkbox and press delete button

911444
quadtree	octree
when to use binary space partitioning quadtree octree

911444
quadtree	octree
you should decide between bsp quadtree or octree

911488
command-prompt	cmd
as far as i know you have to use the get cmd at a cmd-prompt not the gui

911491
command-line	cmd
using the cmd-line use the get cmd with the -vd parameter

911499
required	checked
note that while i think all standard collections work nicely in this respect iterators are not required to implements the remove methods so if you have no control over the class of mycollection and thus the implementsation class of the returned iterator you might need to put more safety checked in there

911499
iteration	elements
edit you can probably use this latter technique to achieve what you want but then you still end up coming back to the reason why iterators throw the exception-handling in the first place what should the iteration do if you remove an elements it hasn t yet reached

911526
malloc	free
you can t free file it wasn t allocated by malloc

911534
fclose	fopen
fopen returns a pointers to c library internally managed file structure which is release not necessarily free d by call to fclose

911538
malloc	free
you shouldn t use free f as the memory is not allocated by malloc

911538
malloc	free
otherwise i think the thumbrule would be for every malloc call free explicitely

911539
malloc	free
in general only free pointers that were allocated directly by malloc

911539
fclose	fopen
3 many of the c api functions work this way - such as file using fopen fclose

911627
postback	ajax
if the postback was an ajax call you can change the css-styling of the elements for example and disable the submit button or erase the whole and substitute the values that you get back from ajax request

911635
constructor	object
in the second case the exception won t be caught if it is thrown in the using line for example instantiating an idisposable object and the constructor throws an exception

911641
arrays	loops
for suns hotspot 64 server jvm on linux both nested loops and unwrapped loops were more or less equally fast and almost as fast as iterating over a linear arrays of size size

911644
google-chrome	firefox
how do i style radio button labels so that they look like the following in most browsers ie6+ firefox safari google-chrome

911661
hashtable	set
as other have said the stack allocation is very fast the speedup from not having to realloc each time is probably greater for more complex objects such as an arraylist or hashtable now list and dictionary in the generic world where there is construction code to run each time also if the capacities are not set correctly then you have unwanted reallocations each time the container reaches capacity and has to allocate new memory and copy the contents from old memory to new

911666
if-statement	loops
each decision point in a routine loops switch if etc... essentially boils down to an if-statement equivalent

911671
acceptance-testing	bdd
in your session write a few user acceptance-testing preferrably in the bdd format and then start writing a test first to match one of your uat s

911681
kerberos	ldap
if you need to have the same user account across multiple systems ldap for user info and kerberos for authentication is the only fully supported cross platform way to handle it

911681
postgresql	mysql
look at how security works in mysql or postgresql

911683
mouseleave	mouseenter
in addition mouseenter and mouseleave on the windows button are still active but when mouseenter on the windows border

911712
display	outline
i have an outline view with 2 entities being display inside it so it is connected to a nstreecontroller

911712
selected	button
but when you run the app the button is always disabled even when a row is selected in the outline view

911725
strncpy	strcpy
use strncpy because strcpy is naughty

911731
children	nodes
so it takes the top-most nodes in the string and searches through it s children

911732
decrement	increment
traditional arm instructions yes you can ldmia or ldmdb increment after or decrement before and stmdb and stmia

911751
order	join
indexed values are in order but selected criteria filtering part of them your hql similar to that from user u join u.authorities a where a.id 2

911754
matplotlib	wxpython
one marked advantage of matplotlib is that you can integrate it with python guis wxpython and pyqt at least and create gui application with nice plots

911763
extends	sealed
to extends others answers a sealed class the equivalent of a final class in java cannot be extendsed

911763
base-class	inherited
note you can use sealed on a class to prevent any inherited from that class and you can use sealed on a methods that was declared virtual in a base-class to prevent further overriding of that methods

911766
push	pull
the greatest advantage of jms is that it uses the push methods the server notify new messages rather than the pull methods the clients keep asking for new messages each x milliseconds

911767
export	report
iâ m not sure if this is what you are looking for but crystal-reports can export the reports directly to pdf so you can generate the report on the server directly in pdf format and return that pdf to the user

911781
implements	sealed
if you re calling a methods on a sealed class and the type is declared at compile time to be that sealed class the compiler can implements the methods call in most cases using the call il instruction instead of the callvirt il instruction

911792
highlight	selected
i want to selected a particular line of text and highlight it with a blue color and i want the forecolor of that text to be white

911811
jquery	.post
i m developing a .post slideshow for wordpress on jquery

911811
show	next
everything works perfect the code works just fine the post rotate each x seconds there is two div s which move post left previous or right next on click it works fine but on the first post 0 when you click left previous it show nothing since 0 - 1 -1 there is no -1 post and what is supossed to show is the last post 4

911816
shell	tcsh
i ve search the tcsh man pages and the web for a while and have not been able to find anything shell specific yet

911825
cassini	iis
you don t need to specify baseaddresses in the config file when hosting in iis or cassini - the base url is provided by the webserver

911827
sql-server	mysql
assuming you are going to use the orginal make sure that you have the ability to insert id fields into the table before you start the sql-server equivalent if you are autogenrating the number is set identity insert on not sure what mysql would use

911827
select	union
where you have multiple phone numbers in differnt fields for instance you would use a union all stament as your insert select

911855
tcsh	bash
an example script in bash i am afraid as tcsh is not my forte is given below

911856
keyboard	mouse
how do i detect if the system is idle on windows using python no keyboard or mouse activity

911862
highlight	selected
highlight all of the text selected table - convert - text to table

911915
attributes	properties
you can set arbitrary html attributes on a widget using its attrs properties

911946
authentication	login
i use forms login for authentication and got an issue after publishing

911946
authentication	login
however when the authentication has timed out - at the next page request the user will be redirected to www.domain.com account login

911949
mstest	nunit
it s hard to decide which framework is better but i think that xunit is the most modern among nunit mbunit and mstest

911959
webserver	security
from security point of view is this a bad idea to leave .git folder lying around on the webserver

911970
sniffing	traffic
however if you want to be notified about all connections to a specific ip then you could use sniffing mechanisms of your kernel or even redirect all traffic to this ip to a proxy you have set up with iptables or similar

912001
webserver	security
if you want an extra security layer in case you forget to put the .htaccess there while recloning the repository for example you can have your web server refuse to serve any url with .git in it by using mod_rewrite provided you use apache other webserver will use other mechanisms

912006
perl	php
the lingo is not like perl java php etc

912051
order	add
the explicit relationships in sql are used by linq to add properties - for example if you have a customers table and an order table with explicit relationships linq will be able to put a strongly-typed order collection as a property on the customer object

912051
attributes	properties
in the absence of explicit relationships you can manually add properties and attributes decorations to the auto-generated entity classes

912055
export	report
the rendering for the report viewer and printing pdf export and other renderings are different

912072
contains	set
so the main project was set to project and the test project contains the nunit debugging configuration

912078
contains	set
a very common need for me is to get information for one or more users based on a condition the result set should contains the user details but also the user s level and class

912090
ip-address	hostname
whether i pass in an ip-address or a fully qualified host.domain... hostname the lookup name call will fail saying it cannot find the hostname where the hostname is just the basename of the host without its domain

912093
value	field
i understand that hibernate uses reflection to instantiate its classes and therefore needs to be able to invoke a constructor of some sort without taking the risk that it would pick the wrong constructor or pass the wrong value to one of its parameters so it s probably safer to invoke the no-arg constructor and set each field one at a time

912102
panels	grid
try putting panels and panels1 in a grid that has 2 rows each row having its height set to auto

912150
contains	any
this file can contains any html you wish indicating that your site is down for a short period due to maintenance

912181
iprincipal	iidentity
you might see if just creating classes that implements iprincipal and iidentity will satisfy your needs since they entail a lot less overhead

912186
contains	any
now if your gridview exceeds the dimensions of the contains div the div will remain static in size and any overflow will prompt scrollbar to appear

912189
double	int
the problem is i dont know what type the arguments will be int long double etc

912193
margins	padding
remove any fixed width from the div itself and instead apply margins to the div and padding to the datagrid through css

912233
push	pull
why do you think that push is far more scalability then pull for starters

912242
navigation	styling
this approach tends to work well if you want to completely override any of the styling that occurs in your navigation bar

912271
order	add
you need to add fields to the order by to make it unique - preferable an unique id you do have an unique pk don t you

912279
integer	digits
is there a safe way of adding a digits at the end of an integer without converting it to a string and without using stringstreams

912279
integer	digits
i also read a solution which suggested to multiply the int by 10 and then adding the digits however this might cause an integer overflow

912286
placeholder	required
required javascript and placeholder divs

912286
controllers	routes
this allows you to keep the things totally independent function more or less as if they were perfectly normal controllers of their own other than the layout setting preserve normal routes etc

912288
memcached	ncache
i have seen another commercial option in the form of ncache but memcached seems perfectly acceptable to me and apparently is used on facebook myspace etc.

912288
filtering	sorting
if i where to sort the items descending then items 1-10 would be different products so i would not want to store the actual objects each time the paged data sorting filtering changed but instead stored the ids of the objects so i could then perform a trabsactional lookup in the databse if some of them do not already exist in the cache or are invalid

912294
multiplication	addition
your best bet is the multiplication by 10 and addition of the value

912307
logging	daemon
there can be no frequency the rsyslogd runs because it is a daemon providing logging facilities

912319
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship studio is awesome for database diagram and documentation - it is capable of holding multiple diagram for the same entity - logical sub diagram multiple physical with denormalization and dimensional diagram for your data warehouse and cubes

912330
select	union
union is used to combine the result from multiple select statements into a single result set

912365
javascript	dom
this allows you to manipulate parts of the page in general the entire html dom using callbacks to the server via javascript

912365
restart	reload
this is exactly what youtube google videos use to allow voting feedback while still watching the video since any page reload forces the browser to stop playback of the video and restart

912367
push	pull
whether push or pull is appropriate for a given problem depends greatly on the latency requirements the amount of data being transferred node availability and other specific attributes of the problem

912373
output	mode
i am trying to figure out why a program i am working on goes in to not responding mode when i ask it to output a large amount of characters to the console it is running in

912375
python	perl
python javascript perl and others all make you refer to a this or self when dealing with objects

912416
contains	set
i would like them to always contains a set number of rows whether data is present or not

912419
value	field
although the password is typed into a password field showing only the value is clearly visible inside the html

912437
hide	show
as you can imagine this becomes a pain as every state needs a show hide statement for each control

912442
selection	cell
swt.eraseitem allows a client to custom draw a cell s background and or selection and to influence whether the cell s foreground should be drawn

912445
order	add
whether or not a sorted set will re-sort each time you add something i wouldn t depend on but the worst thing that would occur from order changing is your set would not remain sorted

912474
curly-braces	parentheses
note the end parentheses after #.## it should be a instead curly-braces

912484
parentheses	braces
you used a parentheses instead of a curly braces in your string literal

912504
firefox	safari
processing.js runs in firefox safari

912504
google-chrome	opera
opera google-chrome and will also work with

912509
perl	ruby
ruby is a car that was formed when the perl python and smalltalk cars

912510
put	get
you can also put a div in front of your flash element position absolute and get the events on this

912534
cvs	git
i m starting tests to move from cvs to git and i have a problem on all my tests

912537
hosts-file	hosts
trying adding this to your hosts

912545
any	set
i would recommend either recreating resorting the treeset before searching it or my preference iterating through the set before the search and removing any of the objects that are too old

912552
any	set
i would be very surprised it the compiler or at very least the jit didn t simply remove the first initialisation statement for any variables that is set twice in your constructor

912580
client-server	security
i also noticed that the security token seems to be cached somewhere in the client-server because they have another process that calls the web service b using the same service account and successfully gets data the first time is called

912589
any	set
i have set my filemerge not to ignore any file

912597
double-quotes	single-quotes
ditto the above but i believe you need double-quotes around the column names not single-quotes

912597
value	field
perhaps some flavors of sql will process the single quotes correctly but i think the standard says double quotes for field names single quotes for field value

912603
pixels	line
every pixels on the screen represents a line from the eye of the beholder into the imaginary 3d world behind the screen

912641
debugging	trace
if i do that the application crashes - without leaving any trace in the debugging log

912643
firefox	safari
tested in safari 3 firefox 3 and ie7

912655
triggers	insert
without the power of auditing you are left with the use of triggers to handle the logging of insert updates delete

912677
subtract	time
you need to measure how long it takes to perform the body of your loop send and whatever else and subtract that from 60ms to get the wait time

912701
callback	methods
i m not so much interested in accessing it from the application delegate i already have an application delegate but want to respond to the event via callback or some observer methods if it s possible

912709
visitor-pattern	visitor
your domain classes then need an accept methods to accept the visitor visitor-pattern

912729
getter	setter
that is why short functions like getter and setter are almost always defined inside the class definition

912729
inlining	inline
the inline keyword has almost nothing to do with the compiler actually inlining functions

912743
32-bit	64bit
is your process 32-bit or 64bit

912795
value	field
if you want to keep the value that already exist in the field that needs to be an identity you could do something like this

912797
hide	next
if the client code calculates the next piece and you can t hide this algorithm very well then some bored college student will figure this out

912809
xargs	cut
| cut -b1- | xargs -i mv .

912811
firefox	safari
which makes it seem like firefox or safari is doing this

912820
user-input	output
the only way to protect you from cheating and all kinds of attacks is to perform the logic at the server - the client will just collect user-input and display the server output

912825
order	join
if we were to write this query as a join then we would return duplicates rows whenever an order had more than one line item.

912825
any	set
a not exists predicate is also useful for example to return a set of orders that do not have any associated line_items

912830
stderr	stdout
also i wanted to capture the stdout and stderr for debugging incase something went wrong

912831
private-members	private
our orm devexpress xpo requires that you have private-members for all public properties because you have to call a function in the setter to persist it as well as storing it in the private member and commenting both the public property and the private member with the same thing is killing me considering that some of the tables have upwards of 50 fields

912841
traffic	packets
once the packets hit the link they become the mercy of the network link which could include network traffic and even dropping your packets along the routed path

912863
transfer-encoding	chunked
i can t tell from rfc 2616 whether an http client should accept a 204 no content response that include content-length 0 or transfer-encoding chunked headers

912878
constructor	object
i ve learned that immutability is when you set everything in the constructor and cannot modify it later on during the lifetime of the object

912882
select	union
is there a way to do a select from select from tableonservera union select from tableonserverb

912895
constructor	object
this should only be done in the constructor while methods should create new instances using a particular constructor if they require to return a modified object

912898
value	field
the previous posters have already stated that you should assign value to your field in the constructor and then keep your hands off them

912900
filtering	sorting
the rows may not fit in memory and may not map cleanly to java objects so i want to do all sorting filtering within sql

912900
filtering	sorting
i have already written the code for changing a query to accommodate sorting by column filtering by values and visible columns

912900
filtering	sorting
yes i really do need to use sql to do the sorting and filtering

912913
sql-server	oracle
oracle can give you the name of the exe but sql-server can t - different architecture

912925
alignment	wrap
wrap the thing in and use as the alignment marker in your formulas

912926
selected	checkbox
you may go to your iis site s properties tab home-directory press configuration... selected .aspx press insert... type c windows microsoft.net framework v2.0.50727 aspnet_isapi.dll uncheck checkbox and press ok

912932
low-level	hardware
low-level protection - this means kernel or hardware level programming

912944
instance-variables	local-variables
you ll probably want to keep the reference to the windows controllers in an instance-variables instead of a local-variables like i ve done here

912949
javascript	dom
once you have the page working like this use javascript to manipulate the dom to produce the ui that you need

912974
webserver	nginx
non-forking aka single-threaded or select -based webserver like lighttpd or nginx are

912975
filtering	sorting
in answer to 1 and 2 check out swingx which already includes a table class with built-in sorting and filtering

912975
required	checked
this acts as an adapter between your updateable resultset and the view although i d checked whether using a resultset this way is going to required an open database connection whilst data is visible...

912988
host	dns
while looking around at the dns manager on test.domainname.com my coworker noticed that a different site on the same server was set up as a host a entry whereas the site we were working on was set up as an alias cname entry

912988
host	dns
we talked to the ad dns admin and as a test he switched our entries from alias to host and once we cleared our local dns caches it worked perfectly without requiring entries in our .hosts file

913003
chmod	sudo
i always switching as root sudo -s and i m sure that the permissions were set correctly on the whole tree chmod -r 777

913006
global-asax	web-config
i would pay special attention to the web-config and global-asax

913018
exception-handling	error-handling
if checked exception-handling were compiler warnings including a compiler warning if one was ignored several layers down so the fact that one was ignored would be compiled into the class so that the caller would at least know to catch exception even if he couldn t know which one then those who don t care would ignore the compiler warning and those who do would not without anyone being forced to write error-handling code they don t care about to get their code to compile

913030
push	pull
when you pull or have the other person push their changes to you git will merge the changes together resulting in a branch with both of your changes

913041
click	mouse
i m really struggling to figure out how to lay the basic framework of the user-interface out and how to dynamically buser-interfaceld the interface as the user scrolls by click and dragging the mouse in the view area

913042
append	input
as someone types into the input textbox i need it to append add-to a textarea value

913043
arguments	default
you can have default templates arguments and templates templates parameters

913051
memcheck	valgrind
valgrind can also output xml for memcheck the --xml yes option

913053
highlight	selected
it must be possible because the selected feature doesn t highlight the entire row

913053
silverlight	wpf
i m writing the client in wpf and silverlight

913073
persistence	hibernate
in this particular case there is no reason to deal with child persistence except to make hibernate happy and only in the case of deleting children

913108
push	pull
this can t happen when you push only when you pull confusingly pull isn t quite the opposite of push fetch is the opposite of push- a pull is a fetch followed by a merge or a rebase

913108
push	pull
so if you re in this situation whoever is trying to push their changes first needs to pull back from the updated origin master merge or rebase their version of master and then push

913108
push	pull
or the two of them could cooperate beforehand one of them pull the other s changes do the merge and then push the result

913137
postgresql	mysql
if you find your application has more users down the track you re going to want to transition to postgresql or mysql however

913143
exception-handling	try-catch
we document our methodss using php doc so something that triggered an e_warning if you called a methods without the correct try-catch block or threw an exception-handling without the correct thows comment would be perfect

913144
selected	textbox
i am using a transparent read-only borderless textbox as opposed to a textblock because i want users to be able to selected the text for copying

913144
selected	textbox
how can i write this so that when the user clicks on the textbox the listboxitem gets selected as well

913146
triggers	insert
while it s true this means maintaining two rows for each possible mark that can be done using a triggers that detects inserts with a non-zero value for num and does an additional insert with num 0

913169
cassini	iis
i am trying to decide whether or not to pursue this option or just accept my vista install so i want to understand what i will lose in way of development such as iis restrictions is cassini an acceptable substitue

913189
document	element
not sure of what i am saying but since it s not a part of the html document it s not an element so javascript should not be able to work on it

913215
decrement	increment
i got an error that says just the expression of object assignment call increment decrement and new can be used as instruction it s a translation from spanish

913219
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome 0.2.149.27 safari 525.13 and

913231
textarea	textbox
assuming area is the id of your textarea and text the id of your textbox

913243
downgrade	upgrade
this causes ridiculous situations like users of a new version being told to upgrade downgrade to an older version

913253
nsmanagedobject	nsobject
you very rarely create subclasses of anything other than nsobject or for model objects in core data nsmanagedobject in cocoa

913255
contains	elements
issue on windows 7 beta you might encounter the following error when generating a proxy the elements httptransport cannot contains child elements extendedprotectionpolicy because the parent elements s content model is empty

913273
double	int
to test this out further i thought i d try varying-sized spacers and use an int instead of a double to keep the object without any added spacers smaller

913281
base-class	inherited
- are inherited from a base-class shape it contains a shape color as a protected field

913282
solaris	aix
log-structured or journaled file systems such as those supplied with aix and solaris and jfs reiserfs xfs ext3 etc.

913283
having	select
select plus nonblocking i o essentially allows you to manage respond to multiple connections as they come in a single thread multiplexing versus having multiple threads processes handle one socket each

913321
javadoc	doxygen
generally the only solutions that i ve seen that really keep this sort of stuff in sync are tools that generate documentation from the source code doxygen javadoc

913330
google-chrome	firefox
i just tested the code from the original post in firefox 3.0.10 opera 9.64 ie8 and google-chrome 2.0.181.1

913344
defined	declare
note i don t want to declare any variables here it s a header file only defined what the struct spreadsheet should include.

913358
ssl-certificate	ssl
if you re using ssl you would need to either get an additional single-host ssl-certificate for images.domain.com or a wildcard ssl-certificate for .domain.com matches any subdomain

913380
typedef	struct
you declare a new struct and the typedef keyword isn t used for that

913389

python	c++
i m using swig to wrap a class from a c++ library with python

913400
reflection	runtime
on the other hand i ve found out you can set the value of a readonly int through reflection without the clr throwing an exception-handling which shouldn t be possible if readonly was a runtime check

913402
any	set
the difference between the two types of dependency properties is reasonably straightforward regular dependency properties are set on a particular dependencyobject just like you would any other .net property

913410
winpcap	libpcap
this answer is probably overkill for this application but i like using tcpdump libpcap winpcap and raw sockets for generating traffic

913413
32-bit	x86
32-bit calling conventions on x86 are described here

913415
naming-conventions	conventions
the various calling conventions and name mangling applied to functions is documented as arguments passing and naming-conventions

913415
double	int
as int func int a double b is

913439
integer	zero
this results in a file of four bytes size that contains the binary representation of a zero integer

913446
silverlight	wpf
if you want an application that will more easily port between a web interface a wpf interface or a silverlight or even a flex interface windows forms is probably not for you

913465
value	field
to get the field s value

913480
silverlight	wpf
the biggest is that if you use wpf xaml your porting efforts to silverlight will be much easier

913481
value	field
this is further complicated with fields like multi-lookup where when extracting the value of that field can yield results like id_1

913485
keyboard	mouse
i m doing usability testing and would like to log all user input events mouse movements clicks drags and keyboard input

913485
selected	button
so i want to keep track of button foo was clicked 7 times at these particular timestamps the user scrolled through this list and selected such-and-such item and so forth

913486
windows-server	windows
this 5+5 policy applies to all business-related infrastructure software windows windows-server sql-server visual-studio .net and so on

913498
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome and ie surprisingly but not firefox

913519
value	field
field value objects are stored as strings in the sharepoint database

913519
value	field
but for complex field values - such as an id value pair how to store the entire value as a single string is obviously more complex as well

913519
value	field
each field value class in sharepoint is responsible for its own storage implementation

913519
value	field
while the field value s constructor takes a string and is responsible for parsing that and setting all the properties on itself appropriately

913519
value	field
representation of the field value you must know what type the field is and what that field s value class is

913521
32-bit	64bit
also note that pointer values are 32-bit or 64bit in most platforms so you couldn t store a uint64 in a void on a 32-bit platform

913523
access-modifiers	readonly
however readonly does not seem to have that same run-time check that access-modifiers exhibit in my sample above

913526
python	c++
i m not familiar with swig or with using c++ and python together but if this is under a recent version of microsoft visual c++ then the monitor class is probably throwing a c structured exception rather than a c++ typed exception

913526
exception-handling	try-catch
if that s the case you can use the __try __except keywords instead of try-catch or use the _set_se_translator function to translate the c structured exception-handling into a c++ typed exception-handling

913532
value	field
of course the fact that the field is marked readonly means the jit can do other things like optimization inline uses of the value etc

913532
value	field
irrespective of the fact that you used reflection to change the field s value creating il which modifies an initonly field outside of the corresponding constructor instance or static depending on field type will result in an unverifiable assembly

913546
any	set
however how the mail call in php actually sends the mail is totally dependent on how your system is set up so any problems you re having sending mail won t be resolved in your php code they ll be in your mail set up

913565
attributes	properties
if you want to change the attributes on a per-field instance you can add the attrs properties directly in to your form entries

913568
runas	cmd
you could try executing the batch file using the runas cmd in a cmd windows

913574
value	field
as each instance could have different value the value of a methods or field with the same name in different objects don t necessarily have to be the same

913574
instance-variables	class-variables
the above class has an instance variables instance-variables and a class variables class-variables which is declared with a static modifier

913576
latitude-longitude	location
i have about 22000 latitude-longitude points and i want to find the closest one s to the current location of the iphone

913593
constructor	object
you create object instances by calling the class constructor

913593
void	main
many people consider static-methods a bad design pattern and advise to not use them except for public static void main look up the singleton instances pattern for an alternative

913602
latitude-longitude	great-circle
actually it is best to use haversine great-circle calculation for latitude-longitude points otherwise increasingly large distances will be wrong especially if you use simple trig like in jherico s answer

913610
strncpy	strcpy
using strncpy here is as wrong as using strcpy as there is absolutely no risk of overflow

913630
if-statement	loops
the loops with the usersm variable in the if-statement sets up the whole file stream for extraction

913637
variables	boolean
assuming your user is instantiated as class variables user and returns boolean for public method isspecialuser

913658
.when	ready
are you supposed to start the cycling .when the document becomes ready

913658
document	element
perhaps you were trying to run a cycler on an element that didn t exist yet because the document wasn t ready

913675
haskell	python
obviously you re not going to get as pure an intro to functional programming as you would with say haskell but you can learn a lot of the concepts in python and especially javascript

913676
lighttpd	apache
for example your static content could be served via lighttpd or nginx while still serving your dynamic content off apache

913680
common-lisp	lisp
there are huge numbers of lisp compilers to native code see and the cmu common-lisp compiler

913709
entity-framework	ado.net
rdo - dao - ado - ado.net - linq to sql - entity-framework toss in some odbc .

913709
windows-vista	windows
if anything the thing that windows forms has going for it is that it s based on the technology that has existed for well over a decade and that inertia is not dying anytime soon the browser you are typing in is using gdi the taskbar is using gdi your instant messaging application is using gdi the new ribbon control in windows 7 is using gdi the 60 printer sitting your desk is using a gdi printer driver the windows ce applications running on your phone run a port of windows forms and gdi the new event viewer in windows-vista is using windows forms and there is a large third-party component community behind the windows forms platform--wpf is a very small niche product that only exists in the managed world which is itself smaller than its unmanaged counterpart

913711
perl	awk
awk or perl or .

913744
put	get
once you get that function working correctly you don t want to have to recompile the code every time you use it so you put the executable code for that function in a library and the linker can extract and insert the compiled code into your program

913774
deep-copy	object
you should create a deep-copy of your object

913777
tokenize	parsing
they both use the rhino javascript parsing engine which tokenize your code and will therefore only work if the code is valid code

913778
event-bubbling	onclick
if the onclick is set to both the a tag and the li through whatever means the call may happen twice unless you specifically prevent such event-bubbling in your named function

913817
stderr	stdout
is there a shim or something to let you invoke a fastcgi program from the command-line and hook it up to the terminal so you can see its stdout stderr

913832
virtualbox	vmware
is anyone aware of an easy way of duplicating and renaming a virtual pc can be ms vpc vmware or virtualbox which is running sharepoint k2 and acting as a domain controller

913839
callback	methods
according to the documentation at mortbay the callback methods takes 2 3 or 4 arguments

913840
command-prompt	cmd
go to a cmd-prompt and execute the set cmd

913860
xsd	xml
the world or your client can then use the xsd file to validate or databind to xml documents that you exchange

913890
apache-config	httpd.conf
i m not sure whether you have access to the apache-config httpd.conf but you should be able to set an adddefaultcharset directive

913910
revision	svn
that number is the svn revision number

913915
dictionary	arrays
i m using an arrays of dictionary to hold my touch data

913928
testng	junit
if there is a junit extension or similar framework that provides a better solution than testng then please let me know

913930
internet-explorer	firefox
my website s logo shows up normally in firefox and such but in internet-explorer the logo shows up behind the background image and it s really bad looking

913932
difference	count
the actual requirement is to count the whole minutes of difference between two dates

913952
attributes	properties
you can use the rename attributes for the import to explicitly rename the properties

913953
lgpl	gpl
extjs javascript 2.2 and 3.0 not yet ready are lgpl and gpl licensed you have also commercial subscription available i think it worth to have a look at it

913987
javascript	dom
unfortunately without having a complete dom implementation on top of that you would be limited to only very simple javascript

913992
selected	checkbox
did you create a checkbox for each picture that you wanted to selected

913999
any	set
a triggers can execute basically any t-sql code - if you have database mail set up correctly it could send you an email yes

914020
xsd	xml
in order to achieve this what combination of values do i need for the various attributes targetnamespace namespace xmlns elementformdefault etc in the xsd and xml documents

914020
xsd	xml
currently any elements defined in the imported xsd document require namespace qualification in the xml

914025
windows-xp	windows
alternately there is another option using windows 7 on a another computer instead of windows-xp pro

914030
dockpanel	dock
for example canvas needs left top coordinates grid needs a row and a column dockpanel needs a dock information etc

914036
rewrite	rule
how can i do the rewrite rule such that the browser is tricked into treating it like a normals .dat file as is accomplished by the symlink

914038
javascript	dom
this isn t guaranteed to work especially if the javascript tries to access the dom or somesuch.

914050
javascript	dom
as other answers have said you cannot reliably simulate browser javascript without having a complete dom

914054
nunit	mspec
on the other hand i super love the mspec nunit extensions

914059
revision	svn
if you are using cruisecontrol.net you can capture the svn revision to the .state file using this

914064
constructor	private
there s no point getting fancy with abscissa ordinate when your private variables are x y and your constructor takes x y

914069
sftp	ftp
i still see people using ftp or telnet for work instead of sftp and ssh

914069
telnet	ftp
is it true that using ftp or telnet can let people see the password quite easily

914069
sftp	ftp
update 2 so maybe it is good to alias ftp echo use sftp

914077
telnet	ftp
both ftp and telnet are unencrypted

914077
scp	ssh
ssh and sftp scp will encrypt your password and none should be able to read it

914082
firefox	safari
this implementation works fine in firefox but it does not work in safari

914084
sniffing	packets
you can see more about packets sniffing at

914086
buffering	streaming
if it s previously read too much data deliberately for the sake of efficiency - it tries to avoid doing lots of little reads on the underlying streaming then it will have buffering data that it ll use instead of talking directly to the repositioned streaming

914097
telnet	ftp
yes by using a simple packet sniffer such as wireshark it is possible to read the plaintext passwords used by telnet and ftp

914097
telnet	ftp
try using this tool while initializing a ftp or telnet session and you ll see how non-secure these mechanisms are

914097
sftp	ssh
as tagged with this post ssh and sftp are more secure alternatives as they encrypt the data as it moves across the wire

914114
sftp	ssh
use the secure equivalents sftp and ssh instead

914121
convention	standards
subversion doesn t have hooks that work on update - you could have a post-commit hook that would allow you to convert from one convention to another repository standards and you could use a scripting that you write yourself that does the checkout and then performs the necessary adjustments but this would give you false readings on svn diff etc

914121
convention	standards
i m thinking something that sees a commit has occurred automatically checks out and alters the code to adhere to the repository standards convention and then commits if necessary

914129
quicksort	heapsort
the particular application i have in mind is where humans are doing subjective pairwise comparison and may not be able to do all n log n comparisons required by say heapsort or best-case quicksort

914137
instances	self
i m not entirely sure why self.navigationcontroller is not set in this instances - the only thing i can think of is that self is a subclass of uiviewcontroller rather than uitableviewcontroller where the pushviewcontroller code came from

914159
keydown	mouseup
if that doesn t work you ll need to swizzle such methods as mousedown mouseup the drag event methods keydown keyup and the undocumented gesture methods

914160
hide	show
you can use fold unfold to hide show comments using âœƒâ âœ â and âœƒâ âœ â

914169
navigationcontroller	viewcontroller
so if you know what state you want to bring your application back to you could load the appropriate viewcontroller in the series to be latered and push them onto the navigationcontroller

914179
disconnect	transfer
i need to disconnect the usb device after the file is transfer and connect the usb when needed - without unplug and replug

914181
hazelcast	jgroups
you can achieve much higher performance with a custom solution which also might be simpler hazelcast jgroups are free you can add a node s which does the database synchronization so your main app doesn t slow down

914195
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i move a uiimageview with touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended

914201
assign	add
i need to ask if i have master page that contains button as an example then i add new webforms default and i assign that master page as default form master page.the question is can i change the text of the button in default page code

914244
constructor	private
private db in querysurface.tt so i blindly made constructor public

914250
floor	ceil
which means that none of trunc round ceil and floor will work in all cases

914252

it only happens when i bind a text fields value to the nstreecontrollers s selection and controllers key notes i also notice that when i try and edit the text field in the app the outline view freezes this is when the above error shows in console

914273
button	popup
i have a page in which i have a link button.when i click on the link button a popup will appear but the same if i do through watin the popup is blocked and is showing the message popup is blocked.press ctrl key to to allow the popup is coming

914273
button	popup
through watin automation i am not able to get the popup on click of a link button but if i click manually the popup is coming.i am sick and tired of searching for solution could anyone please help me

914293
solaris	unix
when i run it on unix linux solaris it runs smoothly

914297
having	select
plain char having unspecified signed-ness allows compilers to select whichever representation is more efficient for the target architecture on some architectures zero extending a one-byte value to the size of int requires less operations thus making plain char unsigned while on others the instruction set makes sign-extending more natural and plain char gets implemented as signed

914300
factors	primes
we may assume that p is the smaller primes factors of n

914300
factors	primes
hence it is possible to find all numbers with two factors by iterating through all primess p below the square root of 10 11 then find the divisors of p 2-p+1 solve for q and check if q is primes and pq is a solution of the problem

914300
factors	primes
this of course still leaves the integers with more than two primes factors

914300
factors	primes
now that the solutions with two primes factors are known i ll try to find a potential algorithm for finding solutions with more than 2 primes factors

914300
factors	primes
as in the case of two primes factors it is possible to find a condition for f by eliminating q from the left hand side of the equation above

914302
windows-server	windows
i need to implement integrated windows authentication for a wcf service hosted on iis 6.0 windows-server 2003 without certificates

914314
webforms	asp.net
since it sounds like your using webforms the first step to solving your problem would be for you to first research the asp.net updatepanel control and the options it provides

914314
webforms	asp.net
i d take a look at the great tutorials on encosia.com on how to use jquery with asp.net webforms and see if you can learn that method instead

914315
decrement	increment
basically this would cause the reference count to increment automatically in your reader code where it loads the local reference to the data and it gets decrement when the variables leaves scope at which point it would de-allocate there

914324
configuration	logging
assuming that the log4net configuration is done in the applications web.config you should be able to format logging to include the log time

914328
stderr	stdout
alternatively stderr sub.stdout will merge your errors with the stdout

914332
authentication	login
when i try to login to the website i get a event log url authentication failed for the request and the page redirects back to -

914334
stream	send
i do remember somewhere that there are modes that you can set where stream oriented send try to reduce the number of small packets sent

914340
factors	primes
any solution must be a multiple of distinct primes no square number factors are allowed

914356
linux	unix
to clarify there is nothing in the linux os that requires vim or emacs to use the unix convention

914382
perl	awk
this can be in any high-level language that is likely to be available on a typical unix-like system python perl awk standard unix utils sort uniq etc

914383
32-bit	64bit
native means here machine code x86 in 32-bit or 64bit mode powerpc sparc ...

914383
sbcl	ccl
the executable are either large ccl or very large sbcl

914392
order	add
in order to create my database and update my database-schema i use migrator.net which is a framework which lets you write c# classes in where you specify what needs to be done create a table add a column etc...

914404
subtract	add
using the endianness of the cpu no matter little or big gives you the speed benefit on arithmetics you can add subtract etc

914408
uilabel	uiview
if they re not meant to be interactive then you can use a container uiview with a uiimageview in the background and a uilabel in the front added as subviews

914419
punctuation	words
if you re on a system without gnu tr you ll need to replace with a list of all the whitespace and punctuation characters you d like to consider to be separators of words rather than part of a word t.

914428
implements	extends
we decided to use atl because it conveniently implements a basic boilerplate that we can extends for our needs

914433
16-bit	8bit
for example a 32 bit variables can be read as an 8bit or 16-bit variables without changing the address

914448
versioning	upgrade
i have successfully upgrade an mfc application which was compiled with an old versioning of developer studio to visual-studio 2008

914461
put	get
im trying to get specific lines from a file and put them in a another string or maybe if we can put it in anothe textbox it wont be a prob p

914469
.when	ready
with long-running services you ll want your sharepoint app to subscribe to service a and have service a publishing its results .when it is ready to do so - regardless of how long it takes

914470
arrays	loops
your loops is controlled by x but you re indexing by c hence you need logic to prevent c getting greater than size of the arrays

914475
utility	gnu
also both are using gnu make utility - make files will be processed the same way

914475
toolchain	newlib
if you are producing an hex file then this could be different as the two toolchain are not using the same version of newlib library

914508
arrays	loops
in the the fourth iteration through the loops x 3 you are going to try to access msglines 6 which is outside of the bounds of the arrays hence the error

914518
contains	set
instead of a vector contains the bad positioning use a set which has a constant lookup time instead of a linear one

914558
hide	show
second click - hide remaining div s and show div2

914558
hide	show
third click - hide remaining div s and show div3

914558

try the fonteffect jquery plugin sorry i can t .post the link but you can find it easily on google or jquery plugin site

914623
c-preprocessor	macros
how about using a c-preprocessor macros to insert the relevant methods if it s being built for 10.4

914624
folder	dir
if i have example.com dir and dir is basically a folder in the example.com server how can i download the contents of the folder to my hard drive

914628
basic	vb6
the vb6 help on getobject says you can t use getobject to obtain a reference to a class created with visual basic the very last sentence

914629
filtering	sorting
i have never used it myself but jide data grids provides a databasetablemodel that provides filtering and sorting support using sql where and order by

914654
gtk	swt
before i added dnd support for that text widget i noticed that on linux platform gtk swt text widget automatically get drag and drop support

914659
postdata	request
the request s postdata is null also

914660
dependency-properties	datatrigger
i changed to datatrigger and dependency-properties and it gets the same error

914667
rewrite	rule
the first way i thought of was to add a rewrite rule to our .htaccess

914667
rewrite	rule
our site implementation is php5 zend-framework 1.8.1 so there s an existing rewrite rule in the .htaccess as per zend-framework asp.net-mvc requirement which is

914667
rewrite	rule
how to get the rewrite rule to work

914681
any	set
any suggestions on how i can order by an expression set somewhere else in the application without executing the sql when applying the order to the iqueryable

914702
contains	any
as you can see the resulting arrays doesn t contains any spaces anymore

914720
updating	updates
meaning that each time a customer is edited instead of updating the row the software simply slams a new record into the database and then updates the old records to have a pointers to this new record

914723
device-driver	hardware
i have a usb rndis device-driver for some hardware only working in xp 2000 vista

914728
shutdown	logging
shutdown hooks -- it shows a little example of how a shutdown hook is added for logging at shutdown

914765
arrays	loops
i have a script that loops through an arrays of ip s and checks the clients ip against them

914771
constructor	object
since you want to add each object to the map you could as well move this logic to the cshoe constructor - the object will add itsself

914790
triggers	insert
so new.userid will always return 0 in a before insert triggers

914790
triggers	insert
the above also wont work unless it is a before insert triggers since you cant update values in a after insert query

914791
backgroundworker	winforms
for allowing asynchronous code execution in winforms applications the backgroundworker component is rather convinient

914796
constructor	object
you could perhaps pass the factory object into the constructor

914803
lotus	ibm
c archivos de programa ibm lotus notes framework rcp eclipse plugins com.ibm.rcp.j2se.win32.x86_1.5.0.sr4-200707311521 jre lib notes.jar

the initialization of the camera is done properly the video mode is set to the supported dc1394_video_mode_640x480_yuv422 and the frame is grabbed without any errors

914852
cassini	iis
if you re a web developer cassini should be fine but if you really need iis it can be installed on home premium according to this technet article

914857
javascript	dom
so the extension would have a small javascript part to suck the data out of the dom then communicate with a c ++ xpcom component to do anything else

914865
digits	short
at least here in norway sms gateways offer short 4 digits numbers for incoming messages

914879
communication	messages
communication through messages block

914880
exponent	modulo
admitedly the documentation isn t explicit but i would venture that you can just send the modulo and exponent components to any other rsa engine in order to reconstitute the public key

914886
arrays	loops
note that although getvalues is only declared to return arrays the foreach loops performs the cast for you automatically

914896
product	invoice
right now if the user puts together an invoice via django admin django checks to see if there are price matches for that supplier and product in a cost price table and pulls through the respective fields

914896
order	add
what i need to add is code to cover any instances where there is no price match in which case validation should kick in and warn the user that they have to enter something into the order before committing

914907
punctuation	words
this makes an attempt to handle punctuation so that foo. is counted with foo while don t is treated as a single words but you can adjust the regex to suit your needs

914920
constructor	private
your only solution for specific classes is to make their constructor private and then always construct them via some sort of factory

914926
linux	osx
on linux and osx it is located in .subversion auth

914927
findcontrol	asp.net
container controls in asp.net provide a findcontrol method which uses reflection to locate the control with the specified name in their child controls

914951
show	next
i would like to show divs at a specific interval 10 seconds and show next div and as go on and repeat the same

914951
hide	show
show div1 hide other divs

914951
hide	show
show div 2 and hide other divs

914951
hide	show
show div 3 and hide other divs

914958
installation	building
i am thinking about the possibility of building a large multi-screen video installation letâ s say 8 or more screens

915002
contains	elements
i want to check check a string variables if it contains any elements within my string arrays is present

915030
ftps	ftp
also supports ftp and ftps so all bases for secure file transfer are covered

915044
dictionary	arrays
if it s for a lookup an arrays index with the int value of the enum will be a lot faster than the dictionary

915050
sftp	ftps
you might also want to take a look at completeftp which is a fast compact sftp server for windows platforms it also supports ftp and ftps

915050
sftp	ssh
it can mean sftp which is a secure file transfer protocol that runs over ssh

915050
ftps	ftp
or it can mean ftps which is basically standard ftp commands running over an ssl connection

915053
contains	elements
i think the question is more about testing if a string contains any elements of the arrays

915074
vb.net	vba
first link is for vb.net links 2 - 6 are for vba

915075
value	field
consequently a legitimate 0.0 datetime value will sometimes be converted to a timestamp with datepart 0 and when this value is again reverse validated such as when the value is read from a dataset field as shown here and in the qc report an exception-handling is erroneously raised

915079
delphi	vba
i don t know about vba but there are code online in delphi and c# that uses the format

915140
attributes	properties
i have a dtd and i would like to limit a few attributes properties possible values to say yes or no

915157
methods	extend
to force this behaviour in linq i extend the delete table methods autogenerated by sqlmetal

915169
oracle	mysql
i want to do a search based on a series of regular-expressions however the application should be generic we do not know if the database-engine will by mysql oracle sql server etc but we are pretty sure it s gonna be either mysql or oracle

915178
authentication	logout
i already audit authentication success failure and logout

915181
relocation	linker
from linker point of view a so library is a final product that does not contain relocation information required for linking

915182
pyflakes	pylint
pyflakes is a smaller and faster pylint

915185
postgresql	mysql
that said at least oracle mysql postgresql and ms-sql support some sort of regexp so it should not be a problem in principle

915188
python	ruby
here s where ruby takes the definite lead over groovy and python

915194
oracle	mysql
while in theory i believe both mysql and oracle are meant to support posix ere mysql uses regexp where oracle uses regexp_like and regular-expressions.info notes quirks with oracle s implementation there are likely similar ones for mysql

915198
haskell	ocaml
so f# has a more ml ocaml haskell feel with emphasis on

915216
derived-class	base-class
the type of this pointers will be baselist hence compiler gives the error that you can not convert the base-class pointers to the derived-class pointers

915251
radio-button	selected
the above command will simply alert the value of the selected radio-button

915254
derived-class	base-class
specifically they don t have virtual destructor so when you call delete on pointers to base-class your derived-class s destructor will never get called

915254
methods	extend
you can read more on it advice on a better way to extend c++ stl container with user-defined methods

915256
object-reference	instances
--- object-reference not set to an instances of an object

915259
udp	tcp
both with tcp and udp sockets that were set to o_nonblock the only socket option that is set

915265
converter	export
the standard richtextbox cannot export to html is there an rtf to html converter

915305
databound	gridview
another work around you may want to try is to perform your checks and css class manipulation after all the rows are databound by using one of the later gridview events and looping through the rows yourself

915308
duplicates	contains
since set is ordered and contains no duplicates removing elements equal to removal_value is much simpler than for vector or for generic sequences

915313
detailsview	formview
you can do something very similar with the built-in objectdatasource and detailsview or formview controls

915315
procedure	records
if you know how many rows you need to return say 20 maybe you could pad some bogus info into your records returned from the stored procedure

915323
vb.net	vb6
for vb6 vba excel and vb.net

915330
lgpl	gpl
in the gpl world lgpl is more compatible than gpl with other code

915341
nsinteger	int
i ve read that nsinteger and nsnumber are preferred when working with simple int because they re the platform-safe versions of the primitive numeric types and in nsnumber s case wrapped in an object

915372
any	set
i don t think it does any searching it s all about getting the first element of the source list result set etc

915387
exception-handling	try-catch
however when the credentials are wrong exception-handling is thrown though i can t catch it in my client application in try-catch block

915397
account	api
if you need something to work with a service without an api then you might have to ask that user for his username and password use it temporarily to log into his account download the contact information and then discard the login details

915398
32-bit	64bit
and now i cannot launch the 32 bit application from the chm file because a 64bit process cannot load a 32-bit process

915398
32-bit	64bit
1 in javascript code if i could check whether the os is a 32-bit or 64 bit.then i could pop-up a well-defined error to user if it is 64bit os

915416
transparency	frame
i thought to be clever and just put an transparency uibutton over an uiimageview with the exact frame size so that i can wire it up easily with any event i like for example touchupinside and make it call a action methods of an view controllers when the user touches it

915417
nsinteger	int
nsint is simply an int that is typedef to be safe for 32 and 64 bit programs and is recommended by apple for use instead of int

915423
stderr	stdout
you will also need to capture the stdout stderr streams in separate threads to prevent blocking - see this answer for more info

915424
nsinteger	int
i use nsinteger not int to be more portable and wrap it into a nsnumber if i need to add it to a collection such as a nsmutabledictionary when saving the state on quitting the application

915433
uninstaller	msiexec
the command-line for uninstaller using msiexec

915433

915442
defined	declare
my selector is a methods with the signature which is declare in the interface and defined in the implementation file of the controllers as well

915456
any	set
you should be able to set the button s type to custom in interface builder and it will not display any text or graphical elements over the uiimageview

915467
stderr	stdout
exit will call any functions registered with atexit and will also flush and then close any open stdio streams including at least stdin stdout stderr

915467
fflush	stdio
nor will it call functions registered with atexit or fflush stdio streams

915475
button	popup
i want to create a user-interface sequence where the user clicks a button and it popup a small panel below it with a button and a textbox and maybe a small list of items

915475
internet-explorer	firefox
for example when you click the favorites star icon in internet-explorer 7 or you click the star in the location bar in firefox twice and it brings up the bookmark editor dialog

915497
contains	any
the convert.toint32 should be able to handle most anything that is possible to convert to an int like a string contains digits or any numeric type that is within the range that an int can handle

915509
nested	order
nested sets are better for performance if you don t need frequent updates or hierarchical order

915509
oracle	mysql
it s easily constructed in oracle and sql server 2005+ and not so easily but still possible in mysql

915524
value	field
if you have a null value in a field in a dataset and export it to xml it does remove the field tag

915544
sql-server	mysql
this is valid syntax but it will fail both in mysql and in sql-server if the subquery returns more than 1 row

915570
sql-server	ms-access
the two main options i normally use are to either store the information in a database such as sql-server or ms-access if there is alot of information that many forms will use or if the information is only going to be used in the next form i would pass the information to that form and then store it as appropriate

915577
domcontentloaded	onload
onpageload is loaded when domcontentloaded event occures so when the whole tree of the page is loaded it seems it s a dom equivalent to onload

915583
grouping	sorting
this would be a real pita if i have to do it manually as there i need to do multi level grouping and sorting

915611
dialog	pop-up
the pop-up class displays an element that floats above the rest of the elements on the screen but is non-modal and can be configured to disappear when the user clicks away from it - perfect for your non-modal dialog

915611
button	popup
the popup class has properties that allow you to control where it shows up relative to another control in your case the button you want the user to press to open the popup

915624
any	set
i am not getting any value for the customvalue property even though it is set correctly

915643
selected	cells
i m trying to query a database to selected everything from one table where certain cells don t exist in another

915649
contains	any
would be even more useful if it contains the proper oo terms and concepts so that any check item is easily searchable for further information

915653
processor	affinity
though i agree completely with brian here i can t see the benefit in running a java app as a separate process when you should be able to just run it in the original jvm barring some really unusual environmental stuff such as setting niceness or processor affinity of the various processes

915659
directory	folder
different apps can use different templatess as common practice these days are to place templates directory in respective app folder

915659
directory	folder
so if you want to use templates anywhere you can place them in a folder called templatess placed in the same path where your apps directory are

915672
getter	setter
visual-studio generates a class with both a getter a setter for this property

915672
any	set
allowing the consumer of the web service to set a value for this property will not cause any harm

915676
put	get
the design i came up with did not meet the expectations of the interviewer to put simply i didnt get the job because i lost to another candidate on this design problem

915676
sqrt	pow
distance sqrt pow wpersonâˆ wcenter 2 + pow hpersonâˆ hcenter 2

915685
silverlight	wpf
telerik has a commercial line of wpf controls as well as winforms and silverlight

915712
contains	set
i have got a visual-studio solution contains several projects and have set up the references between the projects as project references

915720
animation	rotation
as a suggestion if all you are doing is rotating and scaling the layers in 3-d i might suggest that you take a look at some sample code that i had written for doing 3-d rotation and scaling on the iphone using core animation

915727
entity-framework	data-access
i cant seem to find anyone who is using the entity-framework exclusively in their data-access layer so i m keen to see any online examples of this experience people have

915729
create-table	declare
edit to use a temp table one just has to change s to #s and declare s table to create-table #s which is nice

915736
fileoutputstream	filewriter
i m wandering why getchannel is only implemented in fileoutputstream and not in filewriter

915763
triggers	insert
the only way you can check if the values have changed is to compare the values in the deleted and insert virtual tables within the triggers

915763
updating	updates
sql doesn t check the existing value before updating to the new one it will happily write a new identical value over the top - in other words it takes your word for the updates and tracks the updates rather than actual changes

915771
webforms	asp.net
i am making a making a new asp.net webforms site and would like to beautify my urls - i want to accept a url like this one www.mysite.com 1-2 3 and turn it one like this www.mysite.com page.aspx

915802
children	tree
this allows great performance on traversing the tree and finding children if you don t mind a bit of a penalty on changes to the structure

915810
swing	swt
but i can t imagine that people still spend so much time on writing nasty swing or swt apps

915811
hash	md5
there doesn t seem to be any methods in the .net cryptography classes that return a 32-bit hash md5 is 128 bits sha1 is 160 bits etc.

915822
superclass	subclass
i suspect it is an oversight - note that filewriter is a subclass of outputstreamwriter that does nothing except pass a fileoutputstream to the superclass constructor

915927
cryptography	security
whether cutting the output of some cryptography hash-functions hurts its security with respect to collision resistant is an open research problem unnatural constructed examples exist if i remember correctly

915930
value	field
you need to know for sure what the value for these field are to properly import to your system

915939
value	field
firstly with a custom serialization in java you can do almost anything you want including directly setting value of a protected or private field using reflection so long as the security manager doesn t prevent this activity

915943
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
autoresetevent manualresetevent should actually be disposed but if you do it make it very carefully as it may cause racing conditional

915952
exception-handling	try-catch
you re probably better off writing your code defensively with at least a global try-catch rather than trying to micromanage which sections of code will or won t throw exception-handling

915990
value	field
there are 3 email field available in this table which can sometimes contains null value

916000
value	field
for the purpose of improving the display when i have a report with grouping data i would like to display the field value only on the first row of each unique value - and i would like to do this at the query level or it would necessitate additional logic in my class to determine these special values

916001
qgraphicsview	qlayout
plasma works as a big qgraphicsview and applets are qgraphicswidget items meaning it s the documentation for qgraphicslayout that you should be looking at not qlayout as suggested

916002
environment	building
it seems like you guys are moving changes between environment rather than building

916006
filehandle	eof
that s because your while-loop will terminate when the filehandle returns eof

916008
solaris	unix
if it is linux bsd unix solaris then you have this handy utility as cron

916027
interop	tlbimp
visual-studio will then use tlbimp to generate the interop assembly when building the project

916029
assign	add
you can add the link at the top but you will need to programmatically access it later and then assign the url to it

916036
button	popup
i display one modal popup on the button click.i have another button inside this modal popup

916036
button	popup
when i click on this button i display another modal popup

916050
constructor	object
i could make a constructor with the original object as a parameter and initialize the derived object with the values of this object but to me this seems not to be the smartest solution

916050
constructor	object
another idea would be to have a constructor that could be â œinitializedâ with an object

916050
constructor	object
here the idea would be that instead of having the base constructor build a new object

916051
powerpc	arm
on most common platforms in use today x86 powerpc arm and 64-bit variants etc. the size of all pointers equals the native register size 4 or 8 bytes regardless of the pointed-to type

916055
http	ssl
beware though that if you use ssl http you will have a hard time tracing the contents of packages

916056
signals	sigint
master thread sets a sigint signals handler

916056
signals	sigint
what i expect is that upon receiving sigint all thread will be signalsed with another signals get out of their blocking call see the g_do_cleanup flag and gracefully exit

916067
actioncontroller	helpers
it s a ruby-on-rails actioncontroller testcase so i have access to all sorts of helpers methods

916075
derived-class	base-class
you have just about answered this yourself - the standard way to do this is to take an instance of the base-class in the constructor of your derived-class

916090
stdin	pipe
you can use a pipe character on the command-line to connect stdout from the first program to stdin on the second program which you can then write to using print or read from using the operator

916092
any	set
set that to any folder on your desktop pc

916099
contains	any
i am also checking though not include in the sample after the process that my templates does not contains any tag anymore

916100
32-bit	16-bit
not quite what you re asking but back in the 16-bit dos windows days you did have the distinction between a pointer and a far-pointer the latter being 32-bit

916112
methods	extend
here is a third option - create a new type that does not extend unchangeableclass but contains an instance of it that you can use and then expose any new methods from this new type

916116
bufferedreader	ioexception
if i try and upload small xml files it works fine however if the xml file is larger has a few thousand nodes i get an ioexception where the bufferedreader down is being created

916133
c++	lua
lua is good because it uses a stack to communicate between interpreter and c++

916146
processor	cpu
my eee pc has a single-core atom-editor processor which has two logical cores -- the windows task manager will show two cpu graphs

916151
processor	cpu
i didn t work on such processor but i think you can get about 10 -20 additional cpu time

916183
where-clause	sql
think of the phrase in the square brackets as a where-clause in sql

916190
versioning	upgrade
does anyone know if vs2010 will use the same project solution file format as 2008 or will the 2008 project files need to be upgrade to 2010 format before they ll open in that versioning

916197
selected	textbox
i have a search textbox to search the treeviewitem and selected it

916197
selected	textbox
i want to selected the child times of a treeview passed in search textbox

916201
child-process	spawn
any modifications to these variables is reflected only in the current process and any child-process that it may spawn

916212
create-table	alter-table
but i will try to translation the actual statement according to the example ps it is not alter-table it is a create-table

916222
ip-address	hostname
you can catch these by doing lookups on the bots s ip-address hostname to ensure that they actually are coming from google yahoo etc

916240
persistence	hibernate
there is a very good example on page 304 in the book java persistence with hibernate

916252
xsd	xml
is the xml schema binding wizard which generates delphi code for xsd files available as a command line tool

916259
click	mouse
there is one this might help no matter which windows i click on hwnd2 hwnd pops up automatically as loong as the mouse is on top of hwnd in z-order including menu bar and non-client area etc.

916282
profiling	debugging
what i m trying to do is similar to profiling but it s not the same because gathered data will be used more for debugging than profiling

916286
constructor	object
it is important that the state of the object be valid at all points during the life of the object then you might want to set and check this in the constructor

916286
void	main
static void main is client code and not a good place for business logic

916315
searchable	relevance
change weight for searchable text relevance - if a search word occurs in a document s title and its body the title is probably more relevant

916315
unique	words
make unique search words matches worth more you d have to determine what makes a words unique

916317
.when	ready
they sound like a good match for this sort of thing letting the dostufftolist work on a future.get instead of the actual list so it ll be ready .when get is called apart from the whole swingworker business

916323
order	add
then you add an order

916324
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade java versioning from 1.4 to 1.6

916328
any	set
you have to set the engine to innodb if you want any kind of integrity actually enforced on the database end instead of just in your logic

916382
nested	order
nested sets is implementable anywhere and more performant if you don t need hierarchical order or frequent updates on group_types

916382
oracle	mysql
parent-child is implementable easily in oracle and sql server and with a little effort in mysql

916401
windows-server	windows
now i ve been trying to find out if the only windows version that is supported is windows-server 2003 or if i would be able to virtualize an older version of windows and mash it into an ami

916417
postgresql	mysql
mysql or postgresql for the database backend

916419
droppable	draggable
they have draggable and droppable classes that seem to be exactly what you re looking for

916437
value	field
the flex notification framework doesn t seem to allow this - if we have a field in the message with a value of the user s user id for example any client could theoretically subscribe to all messages for any given user id and there s no verification on the server side to make sure that the client that has subscribed is logged in as that user id

916473
spring	grails
i am writing a web app in grails with the acegi spring security plug-in and am having trouble getting it to see changes i make to user instances

916473
contains	any
i have been adding new attributes to the user domain class whenever i need a user to contains more information such as an email confirmation token or real name since i couldn t find any recommendations to the contrary

916505
data-access	nhibernate
although i highly recommend nhibernate you may also want to look at the data-access application block of microsoft s enterprise library

916506
firefox	safari
this is the basic format for ajax calls we use where i work this should work the same for firefox ie and safari

916517
google-chrome	firefox
install as many browsers as possible firefox google-chrome ie safari flock opera etc.

916527
selected	checkbox
in the right-hand pane selected the ignore privates checkbox and or unselected the include fields box

916529
contains	set
if your memory contains garbage why not do the decent thing and set

916530
16-bit	8bit
to point to data in another code page you have to include both the 8bit page number and the 16-bit address within that page resulting in a 24-bit far pointer

916533
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have animation on the list for mouseenter and mouseleave which increases the font-size when the a link is hovered

916555
python	lua
i m trying to build a set of lua bindings for a collection of c++ classes but have been toying with python to see if i get better results

916555
data-members	instances
in either language the bindings seem to work however when i initialize an instances of a class that contains members of other classes those data-members do not seem to be guaranteed to be initialized

916555
python	lua
however if i try to print anything about the instance of otherclass it becomes obvious that it is stubbed out -- in lua it has no metatable at all and in python doing dir var.oc gives only the default functions

916556
versioning	upgrade
www.hellzcalc.com resolves to your app server which notices that they are running on the new 1.1 versioning since they went in an updated their css to work on the new versioning and click the finish upgrade button or whatever so they get redirected to www.hellzcalc.com 1.1

916589
command-line	cmd
if i remember correctly it will install without any problems and then you will have hg cmd which you can use on cmd-line just like in linux

916606
updating	updates
why not just synchronize it on one clock such as having them all updates on the 10 during every hour 10 20 30 etc instead of having all your threads updating randomly during a 10 minute period

916609
naming-conventions	conventions
if one of your fields has the same identifier as a class you may break some naming-conventions although of course these are only conventions

916613
webforms	asp.net
afaik asp.net webforms cannot run without the asp.net infrastructure

916640
gethashcode	equals
you should be overriding gethashcode as well as equals

916663

916672
value	field
deselect the binding option raises for not applicable keys in the value binding of the text field

916674
pygtk	gtk
when python raise an exception-handling in the middle of a pygtk signal handling callback the exception-handling is catched by the gtk main loop its value printed and the main loop just continue ignoring it

916686
python	c++
a good development pattern would be to develop it in pure python and then profile it and rewrite performance-critical bottlenecks either in c c++ cython or even python itself but with more efficient code

916693
python	c++
because python is interpreted there would be a performance hit as opposed to c c++ but you would want to use something like pyopengl instead of directx though to run on more operating systems

916702
remote-debugging	debugging
it is a platform independent graphical gpl python debugger with support for remote-debugging over a network multiple threads namespace modification embedded debugging encrypted communication and is up to 20 times faster than pdb

916704
python	java
yes you could write it in assembly or java or python or brainfuck

916738

python	perl
is there a way to do this in bash without python or perl

916782
jquery-slider	slider
jquery-slider uses html elements to build the slider

916787

916820
samba	jcifs
i m expecting to use samba jcifs to handle the ntlm handshake

916820
samba	jcifs
figure out how to wire httpclient 3.0 up with samba jcifs

916820
samba	jcifs
my question is has anyone successfully connected samba jcifs with httpclient 3.0

916828
json	xml
provide a misc column which contains a dictionary in json xml other string formeat which will contain the fields as key-value pairs

916828
key-value	key
if your key-value pairs are simple boolean flags this technique has the same power as having a separate column for the key

916851
macros	let
also would i just remove the let tms from the macros

916869
configparser	pickle
i used to use pickle or configparser before

916877

where the bash syntax takes the output of the enclosed cmd runs it in a pipe and places the file path of the pipe on the cmd-line

916923
implements	extends
however if you are sure that you will not want to use your class with a type that does not also implements the icomparable interface you can extends your constraint to

916931
contains	elements
the custom attributes knows nothing about the attributesd elements so i don t think what you want is possible to do unless you enumerate all types in your system and check if they contains such attributes

916941
value	field
as far as i know you can either call this methods and pass in the hidden value field or the div that it is in

916947
keyvaluepair	key

also python has native operator overloading unlike php although it does exist an extension

917282
configuration	installation
typically if you have a server service certificate the client will either know the server s public key it could be installed in the client s certificate store by an installation program or by downloading and installing it or it will inquire about the server s certificate at the time the proxy gets created and stores the server s public key in the local client configuration file for later use

any	set
the sad truth is that afaik there s no standard for what character set the values in a query string or indeed any characters in the url should be interpreted as

918271
any	set
it s a known problem that you have to tell your server framework which character set you expect the query string to be encoded as--- for instance in tomcat you have to call request.setencoding or some similar methods before you call any of the request.getparameter methodss

918359
python	java
i assumed that because java is compiled and is generally considered to be faster than python i would see some big paybacks

918359
python	java
so this java code does basically the same thing as the python code

918359
python	java
how come my python implementation is faster than my java implementation

918359
python	java
by that i mean that the java put call seems to be much slower than the python set s add

918397
python	java
it has generally been my experience that python programs run faster than java programs despite the fact that java is a bit lower level language

918397
python	java
in my practical experience when i rewrite java code to python i always see a performance increase but that could be as much due to the language as it is due to rewritng in general leads to performance improvements

918402
handler	service
this way it s easy for us to write a request handler that writes requests to disk calls a web service etc

918402
implements	extends
these request handler can simply extends bufferedrequesthandlermixin and implements flushbuffer

918409
python	java
another possible explanation is that sets in python are implemented natively in c code while hashset s in java are implemented in java itself

918416
show	next
next image show an enlarged portion of the first image

918432
python	java
thus you re probably comparing python to java s interpreter not the compiler

918441
contains	any
your partial snippet doesn t contains any non-asp.net compatible code

918456
python	java
the java runtime is much bigger than python so takes longer to load from disk and takes up more memory which may be important if you are swapping

918458
nsinteger	int
nsinteger is the appropriate platform-specific int type whereas nsnumber is an object that can contain an int float or what have you

918462
contains	any
containss may contains any old text.

918462
contains	any
contains any old text.

918469
freebsd	netbsd
closefrom fd solaris 9 or later freebsd 7.3 or 8.0 and later netbsd 3.0 or later openbsd 3.5 or later.

918469
netbsd	aix
fcntl fd f_closem 0 aix irix netbsd

918469
solaris	aix
proc pid fd or proc self fd linux solaris aix cygwin netbsd

918478
firefox	safari
firefox will drop the bold element 1 pixel at some line-heights and safari will drop it at the exact opposites

918478
firefox	safari
line-height 20px safari drops the bold 1 pixel while firefox renders normally the opposite of your problem

918483
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following html css that is causing problems in firefox 1.5 and 2 but is working correctly in ie6 7 8 safari google-chrome opera and firefox 1 and 3

918503
implements	abstract
an abstract-class is a class that not all of its members are implements they are left for the inheritors to be implements.it forces its inheritors to implement its abstract members

918510
external	embed
otherwise if there s a way to embed an external image that might work for logging purposes but i don t think that s possible.

918524
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
i ve tried the mono stuff and sharpdevelop but i think the answer to your question might just be visual-studio 2010

918528
push	pull
in a basic jsp servlet app you d have a backing servlet which will do almost all the logic in your program push the model into a request and then redirect the user to a jsp page that will pull the model from the request and will only format it by using jstl if you want

918530
any	set
this should execute as quickly as your original query and you can access its data as you would any other result set

918545
lookup	any
if they used any sort of api provided by google or otherwise it would ideally provide an indexed lookup based on the keywords

918564
qtdbus	dbus
per qdbusabstractinterface class is the base-class for all dbus interfaces in the qtdbus binding while per qdbusabstractadaptor class is the starting point for all objects intending to provide interfaces to the external world using dbus

918565
any	set
but i can t seem to get configurationmanager to list any properties or be able to set anything

918565
object-reference	instances
search keyword object-reference not set to not set to an instances -- this occurs when trying to write to a property

918566
ftps	ftp
however it looks like you are connecting to ftps or ftp ssl server

918566
sftp	ftps
the ftps is completely different protocol and has nothing common with sftp nor ssh

918566
sftp	ftps
following page on our website discusses the differences between ftp ftp ssl ftps and sftp protocols rebex.net secure-ftp.net

918566
ftps	ftp
ftps - ftp over tls ssl encrypted

918566
ftps	ftp
ftp and ftps relation is

918566
ftps	ftp
ftp ssl - same as ftps

918566
sftp	ssh
sftp - ssh file transfer protocol

918566
sftp	ftps
secure ftp - could be either sftp or ftps -

918566
sftp	ftps
you may try rebex file transfer pack component which supports both sftp and ftps protocols but it costs some money unlike the sharpssh

918570
contains	elements
for example the string â greetings hey hello world hello backslash â contains four elements using as the delimiter and as the escape character

918596
application-pool	was
i was actually using an application-pool that had been set up by someone else - of the expected name - but they had set it up with the properties performance tab | web garden option to use 4 worker processes

918607
put	get
i was going to have a full text search catalogue but i can t put that on a view or at least i can t get it working using the gui against a view

918610
google-chrome	safari
this works fine but because i m calling the function on many pieces of texts on any browser except safari 4 and google-chrome it s really slow

918614
disposable	dispose
specifically i wonder if there should nt have been better support in the languages and tools to make sure that disposable things are both implements correctly and properly dispose of

918618
jar	war
if you put the excel file in the classpath you ll have the advantage that the file can be accessed independently of your jar file or war file location just by knowing its location in the classpath

918631
any	set
if you don t have the symbol server setup for your debugger i would get it set up so that you can check out the msenv.dll calls to get any indication as i did above for the vspackage querystatus calls

918633
object-reference	instances
when i try to run the test class i get the following error object-reference not set to an instances of an object

918641
ip-address	proxy
once that is working i want to add nginx at the same ip-address but for port 81 and proxy image requests to nginx on the same server

918663
forwarding	port
host your application on port 8080 and use mod_proxy to forwarding the requests

918666
updating	updates
if you get only the 6 records you want to updates it s time to start looking for triggers that might be updating the whole table

918675
selected	button
when the user selects these and then uses an alternate submit button i need to change the name of the name value pair for the selected inputs

918684
cos	sin
basic sin cos stuff isn t slowing down the app

918688
sysadmin	root
if the person s username appears anywhere on the site it might be desirable to disallow usernames like admin administrator root sysadmin webmaster moderator as these usernames might be imply some sort of ownership or control of the site to another user

918689
sysadmin	root
that means that admin webadmin postmaster root administration sysadmin etc

918702
linked-list	nodes
i am learning a book on data structures and complied their nodes in linked-list example and i receive this error

918723
widget	button
when something happens in your widget you can use events to triggers some action on the form - disabling other button etc

918741
nsstring	nsobject
every objective-c class like nsstring nsobject nsview etc

918744
value	field
a straightforward solution that is good enough is to create sort of a valuebox class with a single value field and a getter and setter

918744
getter	setter
the anonymous-class will use its getter and setter to write read

918747
hide	show
you would then hide or show the frames based on which one you want to be active

918757
duplicates	elements
duplicates elements and whose elements

918768
version-control	git
if i use git submodules then when things happen within the data directory committed updates i think the version-control for the program notes that there s an update with the submodule

918776
rhino-mocks	mstest
and i am trying to test it using mstest and rhino-mocks v3.4 with

918782
probability	cdf
if you know the distribution you want called the probability distribution function pdf and have it properly normalized you can integrate it to get the cumulative distribution function cdf then invert the cdf if possible to get the transformation you need from uniform distribution to your desired

918788
python	java
tools in languages like python java php are certainly more powerful for your tasks than javascript or whatever you have in those firefox extensions

918795
any	set
for example if i create a global object using createelement say a set a few attributes href title etc. and then append it into the dom any original reference to my global object has no impact on the append element

918816
click	mouse
this is so the mouse wheel scrolls the display without having to click within the twebbrwoser display area first

918824
profiling	trace
what you can do is open sql profiling and create a trace on the sql stmtstarting batchstarting rpc starting and sp starting stmtstarting events and actually capture the drop being issued by sql-server management studio through the user-interface and then compare that to the ddl that you are trying to manually write

918825
vtk	itk
if you don t already have a lot of code in matlab i m guessing you d have a much easier time seamlessly integration vtk itk with python numpy matplotlib etc

918825
matplotlib	scipy
depending on what you re doing scipy a bundle of python packages including matplotlib numpy etc. does a lot of what matlab does

918829
stderr	stdout
you can redirect stderr separately from stdout in a .cmd or .bat file

918835
webforms	asp.net
they did just release asp.net mvc which gives developers the choice of using mvc instead of webforms

918837
silverlight	wpf
it would be either of asp.net-mvc if you re a die hard asp.net fan or if you love the wpf and or the smart web approach silverlight

918856
javascript	dom
javascript can be used to render html add elements to the dom and this is essentially what the solution does

918857
grouping	sorting
are you grouping or sorting

918857
grouping	sorting
if you do not use the grouping header footer it is basically the same as sorting and you should simply use the record sort

918860
revision	svn
it s obvious to svn tortioisesvn because you can t make a branch without taking every single artefact from the trunk at the revision you chose

918861
python	java
just a stab in the dark here but some optimizations that python is making that java probably isn t

918861
python	java
if most of your time is spent in data structure code i wouldn t be surprised at all to see python beat java given the amount of effort that has been spent over the years hand-tuning the python c implementation

918867
where-clause	sql
you could then build a dynamic but paramterized where-clause based on the number of values to search or hard-code them for that matter assuming there are only at most 3 using sp_executsql in a stored proc linq to sql or even ugly string manipulation in code

918886
default	reset
i am not sure what happened with that answer how do you reset ifs back to default

918889
value	field
for a string it s fairly easy to create a textbox or label and put the # expression in the value of that new field more details here but it was a bit more complicated with a datetime value as comparing an sql datetime with a .net datetime caused an exception-handling

918898
arrays	loops
you could use this kind of loops to initialize an arrays but there s probably an easier way to do it

918903
sql-server	oracle
they have both an sql-server oracle version

918909
return-type	arguments
size_t is defined by the c standard to be the unsigned-integer return-type of the sizeof operator c99 6.3.5.4.4 and the arguments of malloc and friends c99 7.20.3.3 etc

918909
32-bit	64bit
putting that aside however in general you ll have 32-bit size_t on 32-bit programs and 64bit on 64bit programs regardless of the data model

918913
organization	naming
organization s own internal naming

918924
persistent	transient
hibernate for instances will not persistent fields marked with either transient or the transient modifiers

918937
cryptography	security
it includes application blocks for inclusion in your projects such as caching cryptography data access exception handling logging policy injection security validation and unity

918946
google-chrome	opera
problem 2 the second script doesn t seem to be included at all in either opera or google-chrome

918946
google-chrome	opera
i don t actually know that the script isn t working in opera google-chrome but nothing happens

918947
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you like asp.net-mvc but not webforms there are other view engines that can be plugged in pretty easily

918953
32-bit	64bit
in order to do this it will need to know if the other process is running in 32-bit or 64bit mode

918966
getter	setter
i agree that disposability could have been elevated out of the pattern world and into the c# language proper as we did with say property getters and setter which are standardizations of the pattern of having getter and setter methods or events which standardize the idea of storing a delegate and calling it when something interesting happens.

918966
filtering	grouping
linq for example moves the concepts of filtering projecting joining grouping and ordering data into the language proper which adds a lot of expressive power to the language

918968
background-color	transparency
it seems like it should be trivial to set the background-color black is fine of a uitableview s cell to something other than white or completely transparency so that you can display your data with white text

918982
haskell	lisp
i d say before delving into f# dip your toes in a bit of lisp or haskell first or even both

918982
haskell	lisp
after having a bit of prior experience in lisp and haskell and using c# religiously for a long time i felt right at home with f#

918983
value	field
i m no expert but maybe the unique constraint won t let you have null values in those field you can t have a null value in a primary key for example

919021
order	add
then you read the string that sets the order split it by commas and for each id you find the corresponding item in your hashtable and add it to a list or collection

919023
.when	ready
.when you are ready to send you changes back to the db you can delploy make sure you set up your deploy options first as i think the default is to drop the db and re-deploy

919025
base-class	inherited
the other alternative which seems a little overkill is to define a new class which inherited from task for example taskoptional which overrides the tostring methods on the base-class

919029
perl	c++
i ve got a little experience with perl c++ and vb

919034
string.format	stringbuilder
is string.format as efficient as stringbuilder

919042
malloc	strcat
i assumed at first that this was just weird memory since i haven t don a strcat or anything to it but that odd starting character s carry through and recurs at every other point that i perform a similar malloc

919045
erlang	lua
if i like ruby a lot is there a reason i should learn another language now such as lua or erlang

919047
any	set
the value returned by malloc is not guaranteed to be set to any specific value

919059
string.format	stringbuilder
but assuming that string.format internally uses a stringbuilder you can see that with the reflector tool using directly stringbuilder.append should be faster

919060
groovy	java
is there a way to execute a groovy class by specifying the package with dots as with java

919070
string.format	stringbuilder
for example since some cultures use a comma as a decimal-point you would want to ensure with either stringbuilder or string.format that you specify cultureinfo.invariantculture if you wanted to ensure that numbers were formatted the way you intend

919070
string.format	stringbuilder
stringbuilder also has an appendformat function which gives you the flexibility of string.format without requiring an unnecessary second buffering

919073
revision	svn
what i ve recalled is that before in ubuntu 8 probably an older svn revision of django i didn t configure anyting in my settings or symlin anything from my static folder and it worked just fine with the default media - is there somewhere where it is symlinked automatically for the admin

919084
python	perl
i don t know how the json implementation is in python but in perl the json xs module is insanely fast

919100
any	set
any enumeration will be tied to a given character set

919105
contains	any
contains servicecontract interface and any datacontracts

919117
exception-handling	try-catch
instead of calling methods wrapped in try-catch blocks vexing exception-handling i have out argument parameters with a collection of errors that may have occurred during processing

919129
configuration	upgrade
the osgi service compendium spec contains a deployment admin service which defined deployment packages as a collection of bundles and other artifacts such as configuration that can be deployed upgrade uninstalled and so forth as a single unit

919135
contains	elements
this line errors when the sequence contains no elements as it should

919136
difference	zero
i want the results to show a third column called difference which is one row subtract from the one below with the final row subtract from zero

919148
contains	elements
nextrecord will either contains the first elements if there was one or null if the collection was empty

919154
any	set
for example what did you set in your settings.py how did you configure your urls.py are you using django to serve the media files what is the output from the debugging server when you load the admin interface do you get any errors etc

919164
coalesce	isnull
you can use coalesce or ifnull instead of isnull for mysql

919170
feedback	account
when people say you should not use exception-handling to control program flow what they mean is for example if a user tries to create an account but the account already exists you should not throw an accountexistsexception and then catch it higher up in the application to be able to provide that feedback to the user because the account already existing is not an exceptional case

919201
ruby-on-rails	rspec
things like rake ruby-on-rails sinatra capistrano and rspec all have a very particular dsl that is quite expandable by adding the full power of the ruby language within the dsl

919203
lookup	any
the trick here is that you have single-column lookup on any number of columns as well as composite column lookup

919204
exception-handling	try-catch
if you are properly handling exception-handling and building code that uses exception-handling in an appropriate way you shouldn t have to worry about lots of try-catch finally blocks return codes or convoluted methods signatures with lots of ref and out parameters

919204
exception-handling	try-catch
by following the above paradigm you don t have a lot of messy try-catch code all over but your still protected from exceptions that otherwise interrupt your normal program flow and bubble up to your higher-level exception-handling code

919210
json	xml
maybe creating an http handler to a custom extension and in the implementation of the handler return the data or pre-formatted html json or xml that you then insert into an html element of the container page with a javascript ajax call

919218
solaris	linux
linux and solaris have similar facilities

919223
stream	send
dont send xml or other textual data rather send them as a binary stream which you can create using the dataoutputstream class

919240
configuration	installation
installation of a newer version will result in a completely new set of configuration settings stored under the same keyed folder but a different version subfolder

919269
configuration	upgrade
depending on what earlier version of ubuntu you upgrade from some apache configuration might have changed

919273
headless-browser	htmlunit
celerity is a headless-browser which wraps around htmlunit with a watir-compatible api and supports javascript and ajax testing

919278
exception-handling	try-catch
i just try-catch any function and messagebox the exception-handling message like

919279
rollback	commit
when off then you still have the choice of commit or rollback subject to xact_state

919285
ruby	php
first of all other clients java php ruby won t be able to use shared .net assemblies

919287
.net	wcf
i have a client application developed in .net seding a request to wcf service and supposed to send reponse .if execution time with in 1 minute there is no error if it exceeds

919293
reflection	runtime
you can see his blog about it here . the reflection is done using the objective-c runtime functions documented in the objective-c 2.0 runtime reference

919297
put	get
asp.net connects to the database and gets the stream url in the codebehind page we get the innerhtml value of the div of the video player and put the stream name in it

919297
google-chrome	firefox
now it works perfectly at least on google-chrome firefox and opera

919297
player	movie
however in ie it says that the movie pertaining to the video player is not loaded

919303
inline-assembly	assembly
there are examples of inline-assembly but i can t find info on using .s assembly files

919316
intermediate-language	cil
msil is the microsoft intermediate-language which is currently called the common intermediate-language cil are the lowest-level human readable instructions which is bytecode that is run on the common language runtime clr the virtual-machine on the .net platform

919326
keyboard	mouse
there is actually a windows hook designed for computer based training applications called wh_cbt and it provides notification when windows are activated minimized moved resized commands are executed mouse keyboard events etc

919338
pointers	stack
i don t know if there is a program that ll do it for you but you can easily check inside a function where stack pointers is at least in c and c++

919343
stderr	stdout
your best bet is to change the startup scripting to redirect stdout and stderr to a file

919343
dev-null	stdin
for daemon processes it s a best practice to redirect stdin to dev-null

919362
margins	padding
the difirefoxerence between ie and firefox in padding and margins act

919364
svnkit	svn
user-agent svn 1.5.5 svnkit 1.2.2 r5405

919379
json	xml
there are two ways to do this using xml or json

919384
value	field
i have unicline int identity 1 1 field that increase his value

919394
callback	methods
depending on the jquery ajax methods you are using you can set a custom callback a function that gets called after the first function has returned

919409
webforms	asp.net
in my asp.net 2.0 vb.net project around 40+ webforms are there.the website is published to

919413
value	field
however this will not necessarily tell you what the next value will be in the identity field

919418
textbox	button
so that when clicking on the button a textbox is filled with the string.

919419
relational-database	schema
bonus if you can elaborate on why you would or wouldn t just store these documents in a relational-database and decorate them with metadata stores in an appropriate schema

919421
ruby-on-rails	django
but all my colleagues and friends have pointed out to me that the better sites that are coming up now-a-days are mostly written either using ruby on ruby-on-rails django or asp.net mvc framework

919429
double	int
here s a little example that uses int and double as the two types and their common ancestor as number

919432
linked-list	arrays
in that case making it receive iterator will make it generic so that it can operate on a c style arrays pointer an c++ stl vector or anything really that behaves like an iterator container such as a linked-list for instance

919436
value	field
i have an auto generated field in my action class and i am getting its value in a string variables

919436
value	field
i want to get that string variables having auto generated field value at my jsp page without creating object of action class in my jsp

919452
getter	setter
so using regular ognl you can access all getter setter in the controllers when the jsp executes unless you have used a servletredirectresult which is slightly different

919467
updating	updates
solutions are to expose the natual key of the items like role object with a unique name and realm together guarentee uniqueness however updating either of these value is the challenge cause you need to specify the old and new value to updates or pass two objects in original and new object so we can find the one to updates

919487
user-interface	look-and-feel
i found that you have to set those defaults right after you set the look-and-feel before you start creating any user-interface components

919499
lgpl	gpl
extjs javascript 2.2 and 3.0 not yet ready are lgpl and gpl licensed you have also commercial subscription available i think it worth to have a look at it

919502
linux	unix
all string functions except widechar ones support only native charset ascii on unix linux windows or ebcdic on ibm mainframe midrange computers

919509
iteration	elements
generalized concept usable beyond iteration over elements inside a

919516
asp.net-mvc	webforms
unfortunately i m tied to webforms at the moment and haven t been able to convince my organization to migrate to asp.net-mvc

919529
variables	boolean
when it s thr set a boolean variables to true and when that time comes it will not call the function.

919542
python	php
so there is something like that can be queryed by php python javascript

919544
mocking	stubs
before finding out these version difference i considered between stubbing and mocking and ended up with stubbing because the resultset has internal state current row handled that is more natural to me to work with stubs as

919552
double-quotes	single-quotes
how can i convert all single-quotes to double-quotes in all html tags only

919590
expression-blend	wpf
like previous posters i agree that josh smiths posts are good for the coding-part wpf but i also like the expression-blend team blog kirupa and pete blois individual blogs are also excellent and robby ingbretsens blog been a little bit unactive since mix

919604
spaces	output
make sure to call header before outputting anything â even a blank line or stray spaces that was accidentally output will cause header to fail usually it s best if you put your call to header at the beginning of the scripting

919616
xhtml	tidy
use tidy which can fix your html soup and output clean xhtml

919619
sftp	ftps
our rebex file transfer pack supports both variants of secure ftp - the sftp and ftps ftp ssl

919638
contains	any
assuming the pc is running an operating system contains a local dns caching resolver mine does the first thing that happens before any packets are sent is the cache is searched for an ip-address

919638
host	dns
also note if the web browser is one of the more popular ones and the pc is running a reasonably current operating system and the host has at least one network interface with a global scope ipv6 address assigned and the host is on a network where www.google.com has aaaa records in its dns horizon then the remote address of the server might be ipv6 not ipv4

919638
arp	tcp
if the remote address of the google webserver was locally cached in dns and the arp nd6 cache contains an entry for the ipv4 ipv6 address respectively of a default router then the first transmitted packet will be a tcp syn packet sourced from the interface address attached to the router and destined for the cached remote ipv4 ipv6 address

919638
webserver	host
if the remote address of the google webserver was not locally cached then the host will first need to query for the a and or aaaa records in the dns domain search list in sequence until it gets a positive response

919638
host	dns
if the first dns resolving server address in the resolver configuration is in one of the local ipv4 subnet ranges or in a locally attached ipv6 prefix with the l 1 bit set in the router advertisement and the arp nd6 cache already contains an entry for the address in question then the first packet the host will send is a direct dns query for either an a record or a aaaa record matching the first fully-qualified domain name in the domain search list

919638
host	dns
in the event the local on-link dns server or a default router respectively as the case above may be has no entry in the arp nd6 cache then the first packet the host will send is either an arp request or an icmp6 neighbor solicitation for the corresponding address

919639
factorization	primes
the standard mathematical way for positive integers is to use the uniqueness of primes factorization

919644
lgpl	gpl
redistributing of the code with changes - only if the derivative is gnu lgpl or gnu gpl

919645
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object. at

919660
http	ssl
our rebex ftp ssl can use http proxy

you should be able to easily teach the users how to export their data to a csv and upload it to the site or they could use the web interface to insert the data if they like to

920673
icollection	ienumerable
on the other hand if you are exposing a property for external consumption then do so with the most complex type ilist or icollection instead of ienumerable since this gives the client the most flexibility in the way they use the object

920676
configuration	logging
in your logging configuration file

920692
tuples	set
generally however we have a ready-made collection a set tuples list map or even a string is already an iterable collection so we simply use a for-loop

postgresql	oracle
this behavior is the sql standard and is also supported by postgresql and sqlite and apparently oracle for single-column unique constraint only though i can t confirm this

921355
triggers	insert
stick a triggers on the table that on insert and update you check if the column value your attempting to insert is either null or doesn t already exist in the table

921356

921414
delegation	dealloc
note that when you have a delegation that s assign it makes it very important to always set that delegation value to nil whenever the object is going to be deallocated - so an object should always be careful to nil out delegation references in dealloc if it has not done so elsewhere

921429
webserver	security
same problem here i ve mitigated the problem by adding a default binding to the endpoint and explicitly setting the security level to none where possible now it works better but if calls are made too frequently to the server it fails again i ve also noticed that the development webserver in vs2008 nnever fails even with very high frequency call

921441
packets	ping
if ping does not receive any reply packets at all it will exit with code 1

921441
linux	unix

921442
order	add
for these rows i would like to add these rows in order

921460
updating	updates
however there are things you can do to improve update effciency including only updating rows and columns that need to be updates

921463
debugging	trace
if this is for debugging purposes you might want to look into embedding a stack trace collected using stackwalk64 into your class when in a special debug mode - it ll give you a lot more useful information than just place of origin

921491
sql-server	oracle
i can say in sql-server and in oracle this is planned out in the execution plan stage and you will not notice a performance change when changing parameter ordering

921501
exception-handling	try-catch
usually that is due to the ide offering a helpful quick fix that wraps the offending code in a try-catch block with that exception-handling

921518
output	cat
just redirect cat s output to the compiler as in the echo case

921519
radio-button	selected

to be able to check it in later just do these steps again but selected the allow checkbox

921521
push	pull
note that this creates a new repository foo and you cannot push pull between your-big-repo and foo

921528
exception-handling	try-catch
the try-catch statements that you ve seen are only in the code where programmer explicitly decided to handle the exception-handling in place and therefore not to throw it further

921543
vba	vb6
the vba excel code plugs into a dll that the vb6 desktop apps use - it s here that all the sql calls are made

921588
children	nodes
not sure if leaf nodes is still proper terminology since it s not really a tree each nodes can have multiple children and also multiple parents and also i m actually trying to find all the root nodess which is really just a matter of semantics if you reverse the direction of all the edges it d they d be leaf nodess

921588
children	nodes
each nodes has a list of it s children and it s parents

921630

if you don t have a large enough cache set up or you disabled caching or your browser isn t sure its the same file or any of a number of other possibilities it will re-download the items

921658
nsrunloop	nstimer
ok i ve read the articles about why it s a better idea to use an nsrunloop instead of an nstimer call to run a game loop and maintain a nice frame rate

921660
firefox	gecko
here is an example of a case to match gecko based browsers netscape 6+ mozilla firefox ...

921679
children	nodes
so long as the nodes in general have more parents than children this direction will be much faster

921684
restart	reload
i don t want to disable auto reload completely i just don t want it to happen when i save a file that doesn t require a restart

921710
checkbox	textbox
i have a small textbox to the side of the checkbox labelled manager password

921734
checkbox	textbox
you can handle the onclick event of the checkbox and not allow a change if the textbox doesn t have the correct password

921747
put	get
as a general suggestion throw in some memory get a velociraptor put only sources and build directory there measure again

921765
gridview	datalist
for displaying a list of things repeaters are typically faster than gridview datalist and their other counterparts

921766
conditional	operators
even though each conditional can have any number of tests they will always be joined by the same boolean operators

921770
put	get
is there something i need to put into either the parent or sub class to get it to run

921776
associations	model
so if you just specify one end of the associations the child you d only be able to use those corresponding methods from the child model

1 created two javascript files one which defines all javascript functions dom manipulations as required by the site and second called messages.js this defines all the string literals that need to be localized something like var alert_msg alert message in english

921814
hide	show
and i use the jquery methods fadein and fadeout to show and hide it

921815
filtering	sorting
my way of doing this was to first query the tablerows table - for filtering i then filtering out the rows who s columns did not match the criteria and for sorting i sorted the rowids based on their column s content as specified by the sorting specified

921852
contains	elements
in both cases you re not handling any disposal issues of individual elements contains in the child collections

921913
any	set
in building a web application not built on any specific framework i d like to build a complete set of tools for monitoring it

921915
value	field
the way they handle field types is to have a table defining the type for each field then they store the actual field value in a table contains nothing but varbinary columns

921924
highlight	selected
as i m typing this right now if i double-click elsewhere in the text a word is selected and highlight and the cursor disappears

921939
implements	extends
yes it is but dbconnection itself extends and implements component idbconnection idisposable

921942
put	get
is there a javascript library which allow me to perform all the rest operation like get post put and delete over http or http

921947

an integer consists of one or more digits 0 to 9

921958
integer	zero
a number can either be an integer or it can be zero or more digits followed by a dot . followed by one or more digits

921966
32-bit	64bit
the point of using decimal 128 bits over double 64bit and float 32-bit isn t usually to do with the size

921968
triggers	insert
i created and dropped the table_1 and table_2 based on triggers on the tables table i added and dropped columns to these tables with triggers on the tablecolumns table insert and deleted rows with triggers on the tablerow table and updated values with triggers on the tablevalues table

921975
selected	button
you could then override the onfilenamechanged method to potentially disable the open button if the selected file has a .txt extension

921985
google-chrome	opera
i ve tested in ie8 ie7 ie6 ff3 google-chrome and opera

922034
having	select
this saves you having to select it to temp yourself

922055
metaphone	soundex
in addition to the other good info here you might want to consider using the double metaphone phonetic algorithm which is much superior to soundex

922071
rollback	commit
after the rollback the files will again be seen as modified and this means that the second commit will store the same changes as the first but with a better commit message

922071
revision	updates
you ve now lost the last commit you made and since you updates the working copy to some other revision the changes in that commit are gone

922071
rollback	commit
so you should only use hg rollback to undo a commit if you re certain that hg commit really was the last command that operated on the working copy

922071
rollback	commit
also if you have not given the commit message on the command-line then you cannot just press up-arrow twice to redo the commit after a rollback

922071
rollback	commit
however mercurial 1.5 and later will save your last commit message in .hg last-message.txt so that you can always find it again after a rollback

922071
rollback	commit
it simply incorporates the changes listed by hg status into the parent commit as if you had rollback and committed again

922094
put	get
then in the sql that tests validity if something could be put in that would fail if the connection is in the dbms_flashback enabled mode that should get jboss to discard the connection

922100
include	ssi
any of you guys have enabled ssi serverside include in jboss

922121
put	get
you can replace put with get post delete or whatever

922130
plugins	add-on
to me a bloated application is full of to manny features not really belonging as i see it to the application that can not be turned off or at least hidden and would be better off as a plugins add-on

922138
jar	war
i m having a hard time to make my maven2 multi module project with a deep project structure appear as a single ear with its dependencies - which includes 1 war 2 ejbs and 1 jar to be deployed in my jboss 5 server inside my eclipse ganymede tab servers

922138
jar	war
my project has 1 war 2 ejbs and 1 jar that must be packaged inside an ear each of the subprojects is a separate module

922138
jar	war
is there a way to tell eclipse ganymede that all those projects ejbs war and jar are inside the ear module so i can deploy the ear in the server

922173
attributes	properties
in dataobjects.net properties marked by field attributes are always bound to field in database so you can be sure that query will be translated

922181
background-color	transparency
it just shows the form s background-color through the transparency parts

922182
create-table	alter-table
the impatience some people are expressing is probably due to the fact that practically every database developer discovers this design and tries to use it for exactly what you re using it for -- a flexible system to support an extensible database without the inconvenience of using create-table and alter-table

922184
associations	model
why can you not have a foreign key in a polymorphic associations such as the one represented below as a ruby-on-rails model

922190
.when	ready
i have an external com-object that connect to a server and then fire an event .when the server is ready

922215
http	ssl
did you mention that the website is redirecting to an http ssl server

922254

object instances of these classes have getter and setter for each column in the table

922272
display	width
i want to display this as width x height in my user-interface

you could configurationure the reset dbs configuration to be triggerss by a checkin the default and have the codeigniter configuration triggerss by the completion of the reset dbs configuration called a dependency triggers

922330
linux	unix
d is analogous to the root directory in unix linux

922341
associations	model
i also cover polymorphic associations in my presentation practical object-oriented model in sql and my book sql antipatterns avoiding the pitfalls of database programming

922366
vbscript	basic
does anyone know how to pass a several bytes into a binary or varbinary field using sql and ideally in ado classic vbscript or visual basic 6

922366
vbscript	vb6
ideally i need to do this in vbscript ado but can take a vb6 based solution if available

922382
base-class	inherited
so that s why you have to put in an event in a viewmodel base-class which displayviewmodel inherited from and instead of the code above write this

922390
viewdidappear	viewdidload
try adding the textview programatically in viewdidload or viewdidappear to see if that works

922402
entity-framework	ado.net

when we are ready to release we create a branch in subversion make any changes required for the production environment tag the release number export the repository upload it to a new directory on the live server and symlink the files into place

922413
hotmail	gmail
we have pcs in a few kiosks that allow associates to check personal email and stuff gmail yahoo hotmail etc... and the user permissions on those pcs will not allow users to kill processes

922419
boost	stl
both work pretty much the same way in boost and stl contexts

922425
any	set
that would override any values being set by the client scripting

922446
any	set
so you ll have to set some sort of flag to distinguish between the first viewwillappear and any subsequent ones when returning from b

922457
display	width
if want to display this composite value as a string then bind display pattern 1 of a text field to the width property and display pattern 2 shown when you bind display pattern 1 to the height property

922457
display	width
this will give a text field that display width x height and will update on changes in either property

922457
value	field
the downside of this methods is that the text field will not be able to edit the bound width and height value

922492
solaris	linux
this works great on solaris but on linux i get the error

922533
treeset	treemap
for cases where your keys are a complex type that doesn t implements comparable or you don t want to use the natural order then treemap and treeset have additional constructor that let you pass in a comparator

922533
treeset	treemap
remember when using a treemap or treeset that it will have different performance characteristics than hashmap or hashset

922547
32-bit	64bit
if i compile the application as 32-bit everything works but we want to have this application work as a 64bit app

922549

i m working through a previous webforms application to convert it to asp.net-mvc and have one big issue that i can t seem to find any good resources about

922549
global-asax	web-config
i want the ability to capture the identity of the user windows auth set in the web-config but in the global-asax i can t seem to get access to session but i can get the identity information

922579
natural-join	nested-query
no need to use a nested-query quicker to do a natural-join

922600
hide	show
when you show and hide a div will it re-adjust surrounding elements automagically

922600
hide	show
sort of how google-maps tab wl has that little icon where you can show hide the left panels

922605
postgresql	mysql
apache or iis in combination with mysql postgresql mssql are both capable of handling a large server load

922612
children	nodes
however i have problem which is when i need to know the number of attributes of that nodes i can t for example if you want to know the number of children you use the following code

922613
ip-address	hostname
well you could get the ip-address using asp.net then do a reverse dns lookup on the ip to get the hostname

922615
32-bit	64bit
if i recompile the program on a 64bit machine can it deserialize the data from 32-bit machine

922634
authentication	login
if i wanted ie to remember a username and password combo for a specific site not in a text form but an authentication login how could i programatically add that to ie s database of stored usernames and passwords

922657
base-class	inherited
both enforce that you inherited your classes from their base-class as you d expect and activerecord is not intended for production use - ayende has said in a video that s meant to be a prototyping tool for nhibernate

922676
debugging	exit
if you grew up on structured programming which typically recommends functions have single exit points it may seem unnatural but if you ve ever tried to debugging code that has three levels or more of nested conditionals you ll start to appreciate it

922685
shell	bash
as a consequence if you re running bash as your login shell you can only use the . notation with a bash script not for example a binary on c shell script

922692
perl	php
suppose that no bytecode is generated for a program like in ruby perl or php in this case is line 1 below re-interpreted every time the execution reach line 1 again

922697
value	field
apparently access will interpreter null as no - changing the value but sql-server will not interpreter null as a no in a bit field what yes no gets turned into in conversion so it throws a write conflict error when a value is not required and is null

922714
attributes	properties
my form code county is an attributes for my properties model

922723
children	nodes
so a really simple interpreter will basically have a tree with a nodes for the where loop with two children one less than expression for the conditional and one block for the body of the loop

922737
children	tree
just because a control higher in the visual tree is focused doesn t mean that one of its children is not also focused

922740
ruby-on-rails	django
a common oo design pattern is the mvc pattern which is supported almost enforced by ruby on ruby-on-rails and django

922752
nsbuttoncell	nscell
you can return an nsbuttoncell configure as a checkbox for the child items and you can return a blank nscell

try m2eclipse google it and install the wtp integration tool create a project using the maven wizard change the type to pom in the pom xml editor create a sub modules from the pom and that adds it as child if its a web project it get the wtp behavior i.e it can be deployed to a j2ee container jboss tomcat add a dep to the web module for ejb module in the web pom etc deploy the web app to the container

922772
opensolaris	linux
i d like to run a java application on a opensolaris machine but this application uses a dll so that i only have the linux binary

922772
opensolaris	linux
can it be possible and this is because i know nothing about the opensolaris brandz feature that i can deploy the dll on a linux brandz and link to it from a jvm running on the opensolaris side

922779
solaris	linux
we have a mix of 1.4.2 and 1.5 sun jvms running on solaris 9 and linux redhat enterprise 4

silverlight	wpf
also i m using silverlight not wpf

922819
handler	service
i m mainly talking about broadcasting intents using aidl for service using handler to send messages and socket communication

922826
required	checked
request the email address via sreg ax extensions and during login if the openid hasn t been seen before checked the email address against existing account with that email address and ask the user if they meant to log in with a different openid volunteering to merge them poses a security risk so the user should still be required to log in with the original identifier

922827
value	field
as of now to test for this i can check if the address field is blank then check if there is an input-field without a value attributes

922840
textbox	button
two labels two textbox and a submit button

922858
exception-handling	try-catch
we know that is going to be null but it throws an exception-handling but i don t want to handle it in a try-catch block because that is nested in a loop and try-catch will slow it down also it doesn t look really good

922864
asp.net-mvc	wcf
i recently converted an asp.net website to an asp.net-mvc application and no longer appear to have access to the wcf rest starter kit templates when attempting to add new item.

922917
difference	zero
are zero difference between appone and apptwo

button	slide
hold the top standby button down until the slide to power off slider appears

923082
dump	temp
dump the offending tvf s data into a temp table

923094
highlight	selected
this text is then highlight though it is not selected

923095
export	csv
just export the calling list to the dialler csv file and review the call status after processing

923098
highlight	selected
highlight or selected

923098
highlight	selected
i think you actually want to selected not to highlight

923110
.when	ready
calculate the statistics from the concurrenthashmap .when you are ready to look at them

923112
value	field
if the base class or target class has an exception-handling creating the object and the field are preinitialized it will have a value at finalization and may cause some unexpected problems

923153
hosts-file	hosts
think about someone overwriting the server s hosts for example

923157
contains	lookup
if each table contains a different type of lookup entity then imho they should be represented separately in your edm

923160
transfer-encoding	chunked
chunked transfer-encoding

923176
attributes	properties
those are properties attributes in the

923176
getter	setter
in this case they are indicating the existence of two methods a getter read and setter write

923190
keyboard	mouse
also in this case keyboard input is essential and more important than mouse interaction

923191
32-bit	64bit
i d suggest that you provide a utility to do the data migration by decoding using lockbox in c++ 32-bit outputting to temp files tables and re-encoding using blowfish.net and c# 64bit

923191
versioning	upgrade
this data migration is done once before any upgrade to the .net versioning then it s all compatible with it

923231
linux	osx
i ve got a strong background in linux and osx and just left a job where i was architecting systems based on those platforms

we develop asp.net webforms using visual studio 2008

923348
profiling	debugging
i m especially interested in common functions that perform logging debugging profiling string manipulation and database access

923352
show	next
for many queries however we re only concerned with the aggregate number of votes to show next to the question

923359
constructor	object
any object initializer used outside a constructor has to refer to static members as the instance hasn t been constructed until the constructor is run and direct variables initialization conceptually happens before any constructor is run

923360
binary-search-tree	nodes
use a binary-search-tree with the additional property that nodes contain the sum of their subtree

923360
contains	elements
getting the sum is as easy as finding the node contains the elements and returning its sum minus its right child s sum

923363
expression	evaluation
edit after doing some more evaluation i found an issue where certain expression would be include that shouldn t have been

923367
action-filter	controller
according to the professional asp.net-mvc 1.0 book action-filter run after the controller is instantiated

923367
action-filter	controller
by the time of onactionexecuting the first methods called by an action-filter the controller context is available

923375
directory	folder
i tried deleting the folder and checking out the project to a different directory

923410
configuration	installation
this is a per installation configuration options and can thus be different from one computer to the next

923433
onmouseover	mouseover
maybe if you re constantly listening to onmouseover in the body tag then callback when the event is not ocurring but as zack states this could be very ugly because not all the browsers handle events the same way there is even some possibility that you lose the mouseover even by being over a div in the same page

923461
directory	folder
i have the create directory for solution checkbox cleared so that it will put the solution an dproject in the same folder and not create a solution folder but it still keeps making the project sub-folder

923481
json	xml
what is the difference between an xml soap and json response

923482
host	root
personally i suspect you should be able to get your third option to work at least since you d be able to host a crossdomain.xml at the root location of -- but let s see what you have in your crossdomain.xml

923484
selected	button
selected the keyboard button to add a keyboard shortcut or selected the command tab to add a toolbar button or menu item

923491
document	element
your example is wrong in that it is trying to access the elements by class .subid instead of by id #subid - also if you have an element s id it is not necessary to do something like #myid #subid as since there is only one id per document if you re doing things properly at least then jquery can just do the native document.getelementbyid to find the element

923510
exception-handling	error-handling
the real point of exception-handling is to simplify error-handling and separate it from error detection

923526
decimal-point	digits
you could also use a printf if you want to control the number of digits display to the right of the decimal-point

923529
arrays	loops
i bet the first line of your file is actually blank so your first time through the loops the split does nothing and hence the arrays is empty

923531
listbox	textbox
the selectedindexchanged event on a listbox and the textchanged event on a textbox will fire on a postback even if the autopostback property is false

923531
selected	button
then run it change the selected item type some text and hit the button - both events fire

923588
put	get
i read quite a bit of information about rest and being restful with http using put get post and delete

923591
json	xml
the dtos go up to the presentation layer ui where they drive the template expansion mechanisms that generate xhtml xml and json representations of the data

923591
value	field
so for us the only dl dependency that flowed up to the user-interface was the set of dtos but they made the user-interface a lot more streamlined than passing up unpacked field value would

923628
nsinvocationoperation	nsoperationqueue
you could use nsoperationqueue and nsinvocationoperation

923631
callback	methods
to get around the problem of c-style callback the following methods stores retrieves the pointer using setwindowlong getwindowlong and passes it to the actual winproc

923635
nsinvocationoperation	nsoperation
if you have more than one operation like this you may want to check out nsoperation and its subclass nsinvocationoperation

923643
internet-explorer	firefox
here s the code i used to get to work in internet-explorer for firefox you need to use the jsonp

923654
automated-tests	web-testing
i even trained our qa grouping on how to do web-testing and we re slowly integrating automated-tests into the whole shebang

923657
implode	echo
you can echo _post catagories nth number or echo implode _post catagories

923659
contains	elements
each row grouping must contains at least one row defined by the tr elements

923661
highlight	selected
you re generally only interested in selected or highlight rows in the tbody not the header row at the top

923663
contains	set
if i m understanding the question correctly you could always try an inner join with a set that contains getdate like in the following query

923665
show	next
my application has a notification queue and i use the notificationicon.balloontipclosed event to determine when to reset the balloon and show the next notification if there s one in the queue

923667
32-bit	64bit
you dereference a char resulting in a char and then cast that 1-byte char to an int not the entire 4 bytes of address if this is a 32-bit machine 8 bytes on 64bit

923668
google-chrome	firefox
works for me google-chrome and firefox not ie

923680
python	php
i have a php page in which i call a python script

python script when run through php doesn t do either

923680
python	php
i use a simple system command in php to run the python script as

this python scripting has a few routines in it which get executed so i put print statements to debugging

923690
preserve	copying
if you re copying from the clipboard into html note that whitespace especially including carriage return and line feed characters is not necessarily preserve by the html dom when you insert it into the dom

923701
pyqt	gtk
i know that i could write this natively in both oses using gtk and its ilk but anyway to write in pyqt or wxwidget so i don t have to deal with dependancy issues

923705
managed-code	c++-cli
it is c++-cli - code that is written to be run as managed-code under the .net not regular c++ code

923712
perl	lua
many languages either have no static semantics scheme ruby python icon lua perl or have a static semantics that is primarily about implementing a type system java c c# haskell

923716
protected	public
each attributes can be public private protected

923726
daemons	systemd
if you want to automate things completely it makes sense to set up the process to run as a daemons and write to the systemd log using syslog

923726
daemons	systemd
your systemd may have a start-stop-daemons scripting and for c code it may also have a daemons 3 call in the c library

923740
rollback	commit
i also notice in sqlite i need to commit the data in c# it seems to do it automatically which makes me suspect there is an automatic rollback option

923757
python	c++
widgets inside the gnome panel are called applets and to my knowledge it s not possible to write them with anything but gtk since you have to use the respective gnome library libpanel-applet in either c c++ or python

923757
notification-area	tray
systemd tray icons are different because they only allow icons to be display inside the notification-area since windows only supports icons there

923760
constructor	object
i keep encountering an annoying situation on this project and that is object that require many private variables and as a result very long constructor

923764
hide	show
routing hide you application structure and makes you think more of your urls as path to the content that you want to show opposed to the path to some page with params

923772
perl	php
i ve written tons of stuff over the years even in php and perl

923779
instances	destroy
when nobody has an instances of this common class the static variables is no longer referenced and garbage-collection will destroy of the isessionfactory

923787
installation	environment
i ve set persistent environment variables using this but i only use it for python-based installation scripting

923798
exception-handling	error-handling
the truth is when you re writing a technical article trying to explain how some particular api works or how to get started with something then you re very likely to skip over some aspects of the code - the error-handling that s not directly related to what you re demonstrating is a likely candidate for disposal especially if the exception-handling is unlikely to occur in the example scenario

923810
command-line	cmd
this will be necessary if you need to send a series of cmd in order to the client and can t do everything via a single set of input parameters a command-line ftp client that accepts a command script as an input parameter there probably are some more robust ftp clients out there that do this

923826
any	set
i tend to lean towards cletus s solution but the other alternative is to use set functions for any values that aren t absolutely necessary to have in the constructor

923857
selected	cell
eg in cell a1 enter firstname row a1 then selected however many rows you want and fill down

923857
put	get
or you could get a little smarter put some first names in column a and some surnames in column b

923896

i run the 32-bit versions on xp right now and deploy to a 64bit windows 2003 server that runs iis in 32-bit mode

923918
spring	seam
if you re struggling to use hibernate in spring in particular check out this piece of seam s docs

923918
persistence	hibernate
if you need more clarification have a look at section 9.3.2 of java persistence with hibernate called working with detached objects. i d strongly recommend you get this book if you re doing anything more than crud with hibernate

923947
contains	elements
imagine i have a new employee button in a module and when you press it i want to create a new employee view you press it 3 times and i want to have a tab with three elements in it and each tab page contains data for an employee then you can save and or close each tab page separately

923964
standard-library	boost
there s futures library making its way into boost and the c++ standard-library

923966
filtering	sorting
having a list of data object and something visual to represent each where would you code the sorting filtering logic

923967
put	get
if you have a place to put the hook that both your libraries can get to just put the function there instead

923972
filtering	sorting
i would put in the sorting and filtering methods in the controller and call these methods from the view

923973
filtering	sorting
put any filtering sorting into your business logic and return it to the view

923982
buildpath	libs
add the tomcat libs to buildpath so you can use the servlet jsp classes

923988

it uses a dictionary to map the key from the file to a propertyinfo and then sets the value using reflection

923997
click	mouse
basically it shows a movie of a visitor s mouse and where he click when he enters a site

923998
haskell	scheme
are there mainly functional languages like lisp scheme haskell and so forth besides f# for the clr platform

924004
getter	setter
naturally you would have multiple tasks that can have all kinds of extra setter getter attributes and whatever you need in any walk of life

924017
filtering	sorting
if all the data is in the view the filtering and sorting can be contained within the view

924017
filtering	sorting
if the data is chunked the model must deliver the data and contain some of filtering sorting the view may still contain filtering sorting as well

924017
contains	any
the controllers should not contains these functions since it is a routing mechanism and should not have any idea of how to interpret the data

924028
required	checked
thanks to the way that the c standard interacts with ieee 754 floating point it did have to follow the fsqrt with some code to checked for exceptional conditional and a call to the real sqrt function from the runtime library so that floating point exception-handling can be handled by the library as required by the standard

924044
host	dns
provided dns always accurately represents the ip-address of that host that s the preferred way

924052
dictionary	map
marker is a dictionary to map the special marker __xx__ into the desired string in the output i m left-padding it appropriately for the intermediate totals so when i print the final grand total i .strip those blanks off

924052
python	php
the space-alignment is not identical to that i see in the question which is a little inconsistent in terms of how many spaces are supposed to be where but i hope it s close enough to what you want to make it easy for you to adjust this to your exact needs as you re having to translate python into php anyway the space-adjustment should hopefully be the least of it

924091
exception-handling	try-catch
i could nest the for each in a try-catch block and throw away the empty query exception-handling but that s ugly

924115
rowdatabound	databound
if you need to have a lot of control over exactly what is going out to your grid even when it is databound you can simply handle the rowdatabound event that fires after each row is bound

924117
.when	ready
then .when you are ready to make another backup and after you ve been doing some work and git-rebase just delete the backup branch from the origin repo before you push it out again

924119
.net	wcf
i have also seen a blogs on sharepoint as a wcf host sharepoint 2007 and the thin .net 3.5 development model how to get up and running with .net 3.5 in your sharepoint environment and enabling .net 3.5 in sharepoint 2007 sites the lazy way

924125
json	xml
i d serialize the user s custom data as xml or yaml or json or similar semi-structured format and save it in a text blob

924144
deployment	install
in addition all of the x509 certificates would be install on the server instead of on each individual client computer as part of the effort to simplify and centralize deployment

924144
webserver	host
find a ready-made soap proxy-server which can take incoming http-based soap requests modify the host header and routing-related parts of the soap message so they are pointing to the real webserver open an ssl connection to the real webserver present the correct client certificate to the server based on a username-to-certificate mapping forward the modified request read the response convert it back to plaintext and send it back to the client

924144
http	ssl
do i bite the bullet and write my own http ssl soap x509 aware proxy-server to do all this

924160
integer	zero
integer division is defined to round towards zero 7.7.2 of the spec but we want to round up

924162
ruby	php
you need to look into writing your web service with a server-side language framework such as php ruby on rails asp.net etc

924169
msbuild	nant
here is how you can do it using the msbuild task for nant

924183
textbox	button
either in the afterupdate event of the textbox or in the click event of a button you can write code or assign a macros to look up and display the record you want

924189
packets	ping
you can monitor packets loss with a tool like ping as the other answer states

924191
firefox	opera
html5 provides canvas.todataurl mimetype which is implemented in opera firefox and safari 4 beta

924204
latitude-longitude	location
although they list text location and not latitude-longitude coordinates they do publish pdf maps so those data may be available if you ask nicely

924210
contains	set
you could set it up so that the default feedback is a mailto which gets replaced using javascript with a link that brings up a jquery-dialog contains the fields you want to collect

924212
perl	php
you should use a server-side script php python perl etc.

924214
upgrade	migrate
the call to upgrade should migrate settings across build numbers

924247
dictionary	for-loop
i m trying to populate a dictionary dynamically in a for-loop like so

924250
user-stories	methodology
are user-stories typically used in agile development or test driven development the same thing as events in edward yourdon s structured analysis methodology

924260
dictionary	for-loop
that means that if you add it to mydic and then modify the properties of the object later such as on the next iteration of your for-loop those changes will be reflected when you pull the object out of the dictionary at some point in the future

924262
user-permissions	account
you can fix it by going into user-permissions and granting read access to that table for the admin account

924274
httpserver	webserver
don t you just need a webserver that can forward any http request to a remote httpserver

924278
protected	public
the purpose of unit tests it to establish that the public including virtual abstract protected api of your class performs as expected

924285
contains	any
this idiom creates an anonymous inner class with just an instance initializer in it which can use any ... methods in the contains scope

924285
scala	java
newer jvm languages like scala jruby and groovy also offer concise notations for list construction and interoperate well with java

924287
contains	any
what is the regular exp for a text that can t contains any special characters except space

924294
python	java
i am a script language fan nevertheless i have dived into c# java python ruby and even oo javascript books to find new mechanisms ways of thinking

924307
distance	polygons
sort the polygons by distance from the camera and paint those furtherest away first otherwise known as the painters algorithm

924308
boolean	int
while it s defined as an int when you create a cancellable event it s really not at all -- it s a boolean and to cancel the event you have to set it equal to true -1

924308
access-vba	vba
i think this is actually a holdover in access-vba from the days of access before vba when access basic lacked a boolean data type

924308
variables	boolean
in general i only use boolean for variables used with the cancel parameter

924308
value	field
but for manipulating the values if there s a control with the same name as a field it doesn t matter which value you use as they will be identical except in the highly unlikely event that the control is not actually bound to the field of the same name

924313
methods	extend
it should extend routebuilder and override the configure methods

924321
click	mouse
in the event handler for the balloontipclick event i would check to see if the right mouse button was click and if it was set the boolean to false

924328
octal	hex
all you need to do is translate the hex or octal representation of the code to match the instructions

924337
solaris	linux
on modern linux and solaris systems often used as servers the default dynamic range now starts at 32768

924348
capacity	storage
but that isn t going to give you a massive increase in storage capacity

924349
quadtree	octree
if you need better than o n you can only get that if you first pay n lg n for building a spatial hash of some sort a quadtree octree hash grid or similar

924355
16-bit	8bit
we have a particle detector hard-wired to use 16-bit and 8bit buffers

924363
modal-dialog	jqmodal
i am using the jqmodal plugins for modal-dialog on my page

924368
ref	out
there is no const ref which i guess would be called in as opposed to out in c#

924368
ref	out
the c# compiler treats a ref as something that has to be valid on function-call and complains if you haven t initializer it whereas it treats out as something that should not be initializer before and must be assign before return

924376
hashtable	sorted
a sorted hashtable is how i accomplish both

924377
ref	out
there are some difference -- c# s ref is only used for arguments and you can only pass initializer variables use out instead to remove the latter limitation

924379
icmp	udp
udp or icmp and friends don t have connections per se but stateful routers firewalls usually fake it by assuming that a source ip source port destination ip destination port tuple is a connection with some timeout

924382
logout	login
suppose i am developing an application with a login logout capability for users

924384
decompression	on-the-fly
essentially the appliance on the sending end compresses the outgoing data and the receiving end decompression it all on-the-fly and completely invisibly

924391
any	set
you set edit the elements tabindex values at any time you want

924397
ref	out
no ref or out is the equivalent of c++ s reference passing

924397
ref	out
c# s out is just ref with some semantic sugar around initialization so all above applies to out

924406
32-bit	64bit
this can be caused by running a 64bit .net runtime against a 32-bit oracle client

924429
arrays	loops
then when a font is loaded it references the arrays which loops and updates all the text fields that are registered to it

924431

in c# you have primitive-types ints structs etc. and reference-type objects

924440
insert-into	sql-insert
you are using direct sql-insert scripting to insert-into the database

924445
32-bit	16-bit
if so decode addresses in the rest of the instruction in 16-bit mode if currently in 32-bit mode or decode addresses in 32-bit mode if currently in 16-bit mode

924445
32-bit	16-bit
if so decode immediate operands in 16-bit mode if currently in 32-bit mode or decode immediate operands in 32-bit mode if currently in 16-bit mode

924447
python	java
more likely you mean the call stack in which case the biggest example i can think of is stackless python which to my understanding uses a pure-python memory-limited stack like java s as the call stack for python code rather than using c s call stack

924452
constructor	object
implement the iuserlookup on the usermapper class and then inject it into the user class instances it creates with the static-methods through a constructor so basically as the usermapper creates user object it gives them a reference to the iuserlookup interface that it implements itself

924458
json	xml
it could return xml json headers only a redirection nothing etc

924472
put	get
the collection would be made available at db questions with the usual crud api get db questions xxx put db questions xxx post db questions is in play

924476
versioning	upgrade
assume that older versioning being install in french while doing upgrade it is coming in english which is my operating system language

924481
python	php
write the output file to tmp and then read the results using php as soon as the python script is done

924487
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
roll your own solution along the lines of what sortedlist or sorteddictionary is doing under the hood

924505
constructor	object
in 2 you re inside the constructor of an object so this refers to the object you re constructing

924509
shell	bash
...but then you may have to define it in both .bashrc and .bash_profile so it gets defined for both login and interactive shell see the invocation section of bash s man page

924514
authentication	login
in order to preserve post data after utilizing the authorize attribute on a controller method which then redirects the user to a login page which then upon successful authentication redirects the user to where they were intending to go -- how would this be done

924515
triggers	insert
you can then use an instead of insert triggers to populate calculate the value to be inserted for id

924515
triggers	insert
the triggers will determine what the maximum existing id is for the table in question using selected max id from tablea and then increment it by 1 for each record to be insert

924516
children	nodes
it selected all text nodes that are not children of anchor tags

924521
environment	execution
edit i do notice though that if execution a console application with the above code the environment variables is not available until you open a new command windows so if execution the console app from a batch file the variables will not be available to the batch file unless there is a trick to have it refresh the set of environment variabless that it sees

924536
contains	set
this means that as long as your set is alive it will retain a pointer to the contains instance and keep that from being garbage-collected which could be an issue

924548
cvs	git
by using a revision control program like subversion cvs git you can use any editor and run for example svn diff

924570
conditional	parentheses
if i have multiple tests i wrap them in parentheses for readability but with only one conditional parentehses are convenitionally not added

924574
revision	svn
if you have svn info like url repository root repository uuid and the revision you have a good link between what is deployed and the buildsystem

924574
put	get
i think that if i take some parts from that scripting vonc provided and put them into my buildfile i will get the result i was looking for

924594
specifications	w3c
of course you can always read the w3c specifications for full details

924596
haskell	scheme
i ve got some background in both oo and functional languages haskell and scheme but not ocaml ml

924636
boost	stl
but there is another type of library so-called header-only libraries including parts of stl tr1 and boost

924640
object-reference	instances
system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

924666
selected	checkbox
use a checkbox to allow non standard answer which would populate the selected box and make it clickable not disabled

924666
selected	button
give another referesh options button near the selected box to reload options thru ajax

924684
environment	building
working like this ensures a reproducible environment for server building or for desktops even after years

924700
dictionary	arrays
and how can i read a json arrays in a text file and transform it in a python dictionary

924729
value	field
the fields wrap onto the next line so it is very hard to line up column titles with field value

924738
observers	listeners
event is a way to notify to it s listeners observers that a significant action have occurred

924743
revision	svn
i can see revision number in svn by commands like svn info but in git i can only see sha object names is there any way to know how many revision have been commited

924753
silverlight	wpf
the wpf sdk folks have crafted a silverlight wpf platform

924755
contains	any
now i want find if of the cells which i got by dividing the map by bounds is contains any markers or not

924773
show	next
but after that i click it again and it show div1 its getting toggling fine but i would like to continue next action which was to show div3

924782
positioning	slider
when the slider is moved erase the movable part by doing a bitblt from the off-screen background of only the part that needs to be erased and then bitblt the movable part into the new positioning

924783
constructor	object
give the user object a constructor that takes an instance of the population interface to load data from

924815
silverlight	wpf
in wpf as opposed to silverlight i think you can use bindinglist instead of observablecollection in order to watch property changes for any item in the collection

924833
any	set
is there any particular reason you save the form s data set before changing the other field s value which will make the form dirty again

924929
python	ruby
it s clear to me that any algorithm i choose will not be 100 proof certainly for very short input codes that could be accepted by both python and ruby in which cases i will still need the user s assistance however i would like to minimize user involvement in the process to minimize mistakes

924929
void	main
if the text contains public static void main i may know for sure it s java

wcf is the present and future of web service and other service-oriented development in .net so they ve got a very strong incentive to listen to you and resolve your pain points

924966
void	main
public static void main is java if it is cased properly - write main and it s c#

924966

925006
specifications	w3c
although the w3c specifications may indicate that the iframe tag is being deprecated in xhtml at least anyway browser developers do not necessarily follow exactly what those specifications say ie6 anyone

925009
boolean	int
which reminds me c++ can look very differently across projects #define boolean int so you can never guarantee that you found the correct language

925009
python	php
you could use functions provided by the languages themselves - like token_get_all for php - or third-party tools - like pychecker for python - to check the syntax

925021
arrays	loops
if you want to do it yourself use a file object to get the length create the arrays and the a loops which reads bytes from the file

is there any better way than using a dictionary to store this lookup table it is 300 unique text keys mapping on to approx 10 categories

925082
web-services	api
your first point could be solved by a custom wrapper to the sharepoint web-services presenting the api that you want to present rather than the generic web service

925089
key-value	key
side note a dictionary with 300 key is by no means massive but you may want to either move the code that fills the dictionary to a separate module or perhaps more fancy store the key-value pairs in a format like json and load it when the program starts

925090
callback	methods
this will be catched in the callback onfailure methods which then can redirect the user to the login-page

925099
contains	any
i can not think of any usage that would need to put a string a cdata section when it contains an n or an r

but i don t want it to be display at all if the user hasn t modified any field value

925111
value	field
i tried to bind the change event to this is_modified field to try and detect for value change.

if you use 0 in the formatting string those will be filled with zero of there are no significant digits there

925374
httpd.conf	.htaccess
move as many .htaccess directives including mod_rewrite rules into the httpd configuration httpd.conf - this is only read once on server restart rather than on per-request per-directory

925374
rewrite	rule
beyond that unless you ve got either an excessive amount of rewrite rules or an incredibly complex individual rule there s not much to it

925375
rhino-mocks	nunit
if you already know how to use nunit and or rhino-mocks then go with them

it uses the quicksort algorithm not bubble-sort which is typically better anyway. even better it has an overload that takes a arguments which means you can pass a lambda expression and make things very simple indeed

925484
bubble-sort	quicksort
if you re after an efficient way of sorting i d advise against using bubble-sort and go for a quicksort instead

925499

926593
solaris	unix
a few years back i used a product called transoft u sql which allowed sql-server to connect to microfocus cobol data on solaris unix machines as if it where a linked server

926602
webforms	asp.net
you do have both options in asp.net using either asp.net mvc or wcsf an mvp implentation using webforms

926619
append	input
for each item there is a set of input boxes that needs an id append to it

926630
persistence	hibernate
the part about being similar to i.batis or hibernate pushes you towards object-oriented persistence frameworks like tiopf which are a somewhat of a different beast

926633
contains	elements
the selector above selected any elements that contains the target string

926633
contains	elements
the foundin will be a jquery object that contains any matched elements

926643
web-config	app-config
yes the various .config files app-config web-config etc.. have replaced ini and to a certain extent the registry as the preferred means of storing configuration data for your application

926668
constructor	object
in classic oo design to properly encapsulate data it s a common pattern to have values passed in to an object s constructor that are stored in data members fields

926668
constructor	object
it seems to me that a proper o rm should respect these conventions and use the available constructor when creating an object

926668
arguments	default
to address praveen s point i know that there are projects that have a default algorithm for choosing a constructor - structuremap for example always uses the constructor with the most arguments unless you mark a constructor with a custom attributes

926669
any	set
if you were to write an app for a site but wanted to make the app plug play so you can just drop it in any django project set the main url and there you go how would you do that if you wanted to keep all the other required utility apps include in your portable app

926686
onchange	onclick
look at the following the first row uses onchange but the rows added with javascript uses onclick â

926706
document	element
so for simple paths cars doors driver lock combinations would be appropriate to locate the combinations element in the driver s door xml document

926722
session-cookies	cookies
as far as gotchas go for using cookies in this way the main one will be that some users have cookies turned off completely even first party session-cookies though depending on your target audience this may not be an issue

926725
scheme	let
let s say that i have yaml scheme looking like that

926742
constructor	object
it is a common pattern to have your object accept the pk s in the constructor and it will automatically fetch that record

926746
for-loop	loops
a for-loops is only to be used in an incremental fashion you attempted to use it in place of a while loops

926751
constructor	object
assume a object that is initialized by the values passed to the constructor and after that the state is modified by method calls

926751
constructor	object
in this case the object might be persisted with a state that is no valid initial state and hence rejected by the constructor

926771
temporary	copy
is there a way to copy only a portion of a single or better yet a two dimensional list of strings into a new temporary list of strings

926777
decimal-point	digits
this will output the matrix a with 6 digits of precision after the decimal-point

926777
fclose	fopen
note that you also have to use the functions fopen and fclose

926781
children	nodes
my problem is that obviously i don t know if a nodes has children unless i make a call to the database and look

926793
json	xml
the search resource would have fields for color make model garaged status etc and could be specified in xml json or any other format

926798
decrement	increment
how do i link a jquery user-interface number spinner stepper so that a label text value changes as the spinner value increment or decrement

926802
constructor	object
apart from the performance reasons mentioned above if your class stores references to object passed as constructor parameters or your class has const variables then you don t have any choice except using initializer lists

926806
integer	zero
what we want is an integer division function which computes the quotient but rounds the result always upwards not always towards zero

926806
double	int
suppose we add an additional design criterion that the problem be solved solely with int arithmetic rather than computing the quotient as a double since the double solution has been explicitly rejected in the problem statement

926807
any	set
for example is there any accepted way to set an element s size positioning without hard-coding it into each element

926808
version-control	git
i ve been looking at version-control but a lot of them git svn look really complicated

926836
cvs	git
if you are collaborating with others on your code there probably is no way around learning one of the standard tools like svn cvs or git

926843
execution	restart
you could recreate the stream after the interrupt with another expression if you need to restart execution

926865
stderr	stdout
in other words is there a way to detect in code if stdin stdout stderr has been redirected

926871
children	nodes
when you make a call check for children along with the nodes data

926876
subtract	time
now it s a matter of simply subtract one from the other dividing by clock cycles per second and further dividing by the coefficient appropriate to the unit of time you want measured 60 for minutes 3600 for hours 3600 24 for days etc.

926882
subtraction	multiplying
the best way i can think of is to parsing the time spans into hour minute second and millisecond components convert it all into milliseconds by adding and multiplying then adding them and using modulos and subtraction to turn it back into a timespan

926890
javascript	dom
unfortunately i don t know of any tools but i would think this could be done using javascript using jquery prototype or other js framework to rip through the rendered dom and discover applied styles and create new html based on that

926901
configuration	environment
environment files are for configuration that is the same across all deployments

926901
capistrano	engineyard
for capistrano based deployments this is what i use to symlink multiple configuration files in the new current from the shared directory i think it originally came from an ezra recipe from engineyard

926902
children	nodes
the point is that if you maintain a left and right value for each nodes then if the left value and right value differ by more than one that nodes has children

926905
disposable	dispose
as you know when you finish using a disposable object you should call its dispose methods

926910
derived-class	base-class
i am trying to use reflection to determine which methods a derived-class overrides from a base-class

926910
derived-class	base-class
it is fairly easy to determine if the methods is not overridden but trying to determine if a methods is overridden in a base-class or simply created as virtual in the derived-class is what i am trying to accomplish

926913
32-bit	64bit
it only fails when running on a 64bit win2k3 in 32-bit mode

926917
directory	folder
the problem is that my computer is a virtual folder which doesn t have an equivalent physical directory path

926928
duplicates	sorted
it has to be sorted without duplicates and have an iterator

926934
checkbox	textbox
mostly i just need the admin to be able to specify additional fields as textbox checkbox radio buttons and comboboxes

926944
xlsx	xls
spreadsheetgear for .net can read and write and more xls and xlsx workbooks and supports the same limitations as excel for text - in other words it will just work

926947
debugging	trace
the stack trace has only unmanaged code at the head and i m unable to debugging that with c# express 2008

926952
log4net	nlog
look at open source logging components nlog link text or log4net link text

926954
constructor	object
even so i think a constructor should only contain parameters for those fields that are mandatory at object-creation time to have the object in a valid state

926959
duplicates	sorted
treeset has an iterator is sorted won t have duplicates and is able to see the next higher element by using higher

926964
contains	elements
this will selected just the leaf elements that contains i am a simple string

926974
textmate	emacs
if you use a scriptable editor emacs vi textmate whatever you could redefine the save command as save and make a new version

926981
fclose	fopen
i ran a test a few years ago and dlmwrite was something like 5-10x slower than the fopen printf fclose solution

926994
google-chrome	firefox
this appears to me to be ie and firefox putting the float outside or underneath each li instead of inside where it should be like google-chrome

926994
google-chrome	firefox
if i adjust the position -14px up for ie and firefox it works fine for them but then google-chrome is messed up

926994
google-chrome	firefox
i don t want a single browser hack unless absolutely needed ie do the -14px ofirefoxset for ie firefox and tell google-chrome to ignore it

926995
python	lua
a common solution for this problem at game companies is to have protocol description language or specification in a simple format like xml or python or lua and then have code generation for each target language that generated packet classes with both data structure and serialization

927006
show	next
the designer code show it as returning an int and if i change that manually it just gets undone on the next build

927033
button	popup
what i m trying to achieve is i want to be able to work in a terminal and then have a keyboard shortcut set up which will run a tool which i am writing which displays a little popup windows containing some information and a few button to perform actions

927034
wsdl.exe	navision
and also assuming that you can build a navision extension in .net but that you cannot use wsdl.exe or svcutil.exe the tools for the 2 web-services stacks built-in to .net

927035
selected	checkbox
sidenote i tried looking some other method of storing and updating which rows were selected and just using the checkbox as a display mechanism but ultimately the checkbox was the easiest method for handling everything.

927035
any	set
any ideas on where when or how i need to set up this field so that it won t be passed automatically as a parameter to my updates

927040
content-disposition	content-type
in that case you may try setting the content-type and the content-disposition to attachment on the server for pdf this would mean setting content-type to application pdf and adding content-disposition attachment

927052
.when	ready
assuming you load the file first -- in this example the load operation happens on creationcomplete and the bytes get stored off in loadedfile -- the bytes should be and ready for saving .when the user click save image

927055
file-comparison	diff
the paper an algorithm for differential file-comparison by hunt and mcilroy gives a good description of an early version of the unix diff utility

927069
keyboard	mouse
one of the tenets of pair programming is that only one person is at the keyboard and mouse so all you really need is one-direction screen casting and voice chat

927070
configuration	environment
in environment where you want to declare the configuration you want distributed and have it either apply fully or not apply at all don t end up in an intermediate busted state then package based installation seems appropriate

927079
getter	setter
basically you have to think about any internal state of a class that you give to any other class via getter or by calling another class setter

927079
constructor	object
use copy constructor in your object constructor to make a copy of anything passed in that is mutable

927079
getter	setter
in all cases if there is a question about who owns mutable state document it on the getter or setter or constructor

927103
minimum	max
so by changing min to max we can find the maximum independent set and by compliment the minimum vertex cover since both problem are equivalent

927141
queue	fifo
the queue or fifo is one of the most common data-structures and have native implementations in many languages and frameworks

927141
put	get
python put get

927141
put	get
put get is succinct but does not provide any hint as to the fifo nature of the operations

927146
having	select
well new to the java stuff and having trouble with assigning a class attribute to this select options

927151
ubuntu	linux
in gnome desktop environment ubuntu linux has that by default you could set your preferred applications for e-mail www browsing etc

927153
put	get
put get comes next

927158
value	field
its a custom field that allows adding a regular expression to validate the value entered by user

927164
methods	extend
what you could do is extend one of the container classes and override the childrencreated methods access the elements in the children arrays and set the values you want

927166
compatibility	deprecated
they are not present in any of the .net code base unless you count the vb6 compatibility layer library so should be considered deprecated and therefor ignored

927189
stream	send
the readagain variables just makes it skip reading a new set of bytes in the file stream ie it tries to send the old one again .

927206
sql-server	oracle
i m not acquainted with that version did very few interface jobs and they were all complicated due to db2 s differences from my usual flavours of databases - oracle or sql-server

927206
selected	button
you selected the assignment button then you selected the variables in a list then you selected the value in a list or enter the value if it s fixed

927208
value	field
else this might be a new form field added and therefore create a new value

927209
installation	uninstall
i believe you uninstall ssrs by going through the installation process of sql-server itself and selected to remove a certain component ssrs in this case

927209
selected	button
alternatively probably better is to go to the add remove programs menu and selected sql-server and hit the change button

927210
compact-framework	.net
failure to dispose any drawing related objects graphics font solidbrush pen etc. on the .net compact-framework

927211
webforms	asp.net
i have used spring.net before in webforms but with no code behind as in traditional asp.net how do i use the page validation framework spring.net provides

927211
asp.net-mvc	webforms
my webforms project users spring.web.ui.page but i m worried because the default pages in asp.net-mvc derive from system.web.asp.net-mvc.viewpage so that isn t going to work

927212
put	get
put get - short obvious and generic doesn t assume an implementation and can be used for all sorts of queues lists collections - what s not to like

927213
uinavigationcontroller	uitableview
i m having a problem getting a uinavigationcontroller to lay its table out properly after autorotation when the uitableview is a subview

927261
margins	padding
it looks like it measures the margins from the top of the box and ignores the padding

927263
textbox	onblur
here s a server-side approach to get the onblur attribute on all textbox which should also work with validation grouping

927270
decrement	increment
you ll probably want to override navigationmovement to make the numbers increment decrement on trackball up down and to move the focus within the field while going left right - setting an internal state variables indicating where the focus is and overriding getfocusrect to return an appropriate focus rectangle be sure to call focusremove and focusadd from within navigationmovement to let the framework know you ve updates the focus

927282
global-assembly-cache	gac
the application requires that assembly microsoft.windows.design.extensibility versioning 3.5.0.0 be install in the global-assembly-cache gac first.

927284
margins	padding
i don t have a specific answer but i have struggled with the difirefoxerences between ie and firefox as it relates to margins and padding

927314
contains	set
if you want to bind the members of the collection to the treeview it would be better to create a separate class which will contains the list and set an instance of that class as the datacontext of the windows

927315
attributes	properties
the leading space is important because the classname properties treats the css classes like a single string which ought to match the class attributes on html elements where multiple classes must be separated by spaces

927333
stress-testing	web-testing
2 web-testing and stress-testing

927333
stress-testing	web-testing
there is yet a whole other dedicated grouping separate from the mstest grouping that works on web-testing and stress-testing

927339
cvs	git
i ve used git svn cvs and perforce

927367
contains	any
ultimately it should contains any information that you think is going to be relevant to your application

927375
filtering	sorting
you should care about datatypes when it comes to filtering where-clause or sorting order by

927375
aggregate-functions	sum
or use some aggregate-functions in reports like sum or avg

927386
default	reset
the easier option is to git reset to upstage any changes you ve made since and then git commit --amend which will open your default commit message editor pre-populated with the last commit message

927395
detect	move
this should allow you to detect if your main windows has move

927409
oracle	mysql
if we want to support sql server oracle mysql - does that exclude linq to sql

927411
environment	building
the solution and project files support 5 different building for 5 different environment

927437
contains	elements
the include section uses a list of include elements which contains path patterns

927455
revision	svn
we use redmine to document all tasks and our svn revision are automatically stamped against that

927455
fogbugz	redmine
redmine trac fogbugz bugzilla tfs all good

927469
g++	gcc
another question is how this changes if i m using g++ instead of gcc

927495
host	dns
for extra credit you can set up a wildcard dns entry so that every undefined host asdfasdfasdfas.example.com gets redirected to www.example.com

927499
value	field
i mean by providing a list of value instead of repeating the field name again and again

927507
value	field
the view shows only the field with value in the non-editing mode and in editing mode it adds the unpopulated field too as placeholders

927523
value	field
iâ m trying to import a table into a secured sql database using vb.net but it seems to timeout or so i think and not import properly null value i truncate the table to save the field types and then call the shell function to import the file and

927523
boolean	int
i tried the timeout int parameter -l after the boolean true above and it did not help

927525
hide	show
i have a couple different choices each one will show a different div with a different form and hide the rest

927551
esapi	owasp
i recommend you look into owasp s esapi project

927571
object-reference	instances
message object-reference not set to an instances of an object

927574
command-prompt	cmd
i am trying to compile a c++ application using the following cmd in cmd-prompt

927578
versioning	staging
i m curious what others out there have as a process to patch staging and production schema s and how to manage versioning of the database

927590
sql-server	postgresql
if you re worried about cost you can use sql-server express or postgresql

927597
revision	svn
from a single developer s point of view the main difference between a central system like svn and a decentral system like git is that in svn the revision are linear

927598
webforms	asp.net
currently my website is written in asp.net webforms using a sql-server database

927626
firefox	opera
i was really happy that everything worked great in safari firefox and opera

927631
priority-queue	heap
i have a priority-queue of events but sometimes the event priorities change so i d like to maintain iterators from the event requesters into the heap

927647
contains	any
not having to worry about your svn server is nice no need for constant network access to it so is being able to trivially create repositories they re just a folder contains another .git folder perform any operations commit branching etc etc then decide to put the code on github with a simple command or two

927672
profiling	debugging
i have been using the profiling to debugging queries and procs

927698
revision	svn
how does one grouping a bunch of revision you ve already committed to svn together see jim t s answer in trac

927704
println	output
print and println are meant for human-readable output

927709
arguments	default
the vb chr function takes an arguments in the range 0 to 255 and converts it to a character using the current default code page

927721
action-filter	controller
phil said an action-filter on a controller is just shorthand for applying the attributes to all action methodss of the controller and it is true if i put the same action-filter attributes on the controller and on an action methods it will run twice

927730
output	mode
i recently discovered comint-show-output in emacs shell mode which jumps to the first line of shell output which i find incredibly handy when looking at shell output that exceeds a screen length

927730
shell	bash
i normally use bash but would be fine with switching shell just for this feature

927741
python	php
both php and python have ways to store dates and times in a sensible manner

927766
value	field
at this point i am having an issue where i cannot get the two field to read as separate value

927773
malloc	free
now the biggest time-takers are calls to malloc and free

927774
push	pull
it doesn t make a difference you just have to remember to push and pull whenever you switch to a different machine but you already do this with svn commit update

927774
revision	svn
sure you might say that you can do the same with svn revert reverting back to the revision before you started the crazy idea

927776
unsafe	out
however i cannot figure out how i can set the uploaded file s date timestamp leaving me with only the file size to determine identical files which is unsafe

927790
diagram	erd
an erd diagram is a logical diagram that show entity relationships and their cardinality although it can interpreter as a table relationship diagram or a class diagram at the same time yet it is neither of them and you will still need the other diagrams

927802
google-chrome	firefox
get the layout working in firefox safari google-chrome etc while keeping ie about 80 of the way there

927806
directory	folder
i m trying to checkout the trunk folder of a project into my public_html directory using this command while in public_html

927815
output	cat
if you need to review the output after you ve quit from less you can just cat the log file instead of re-running the command

927828
oracle	mysql
cycle through the results for mysql or further filter on the oracle one

927839
double-quotes	single-quotes
use single-quotes around the value when you set it then use double-quotes around the variables when you expand it

927875
inno-setup	nsis
how about nsis or inno-setup

927876
webforms	asp.net
i saw code in an asp.net mvc site from a guy who had only done webforms before and is a renowned copy paster

927878
put	get
the best you ll get in vailla trac is put a link to the ticket in your commit comment fixed blah blah blah for #123 note the # is how trac will pickup the link

927922
put	get
there s also the issue of marketing--you probably won t spend more money on it but it s a lot harder to get the word out when you can t put a box on an endcap at best buy

927948
command-line	cmd
you can learn more about them in the integrate cmd help type p4 help integrate at the cmd-line

927966
ruby	php
i know there are implementations in php ruby

927973
any	set
short answer there is no way to test for dependents without raising an error as the property itself is set to raise an error if accessed and there aren t any

927975
build-process	ant
the java build-process using ant is measured in minutes

927979
firefox	opera
you prolly know how to test out firefox opera safari with without scripting

927980
bazaar	git
newer distributed source control systems like git bazaar and mercurial aka hg all tend to be better at detecting broad changes done in the file system such as moving directories renaming files and even replacing large chunks of the file system

927985
subclassing	inherited
i m playing with python class inherited and ran into a problem where the inherited __init__ is not being executed if called from the subclassing code below the result i get from active python is

928007
lightbox	embed
you could embed the pdf in an iframe in a lightbox or panel like jkorpela html iframe-pdf.html

928012
temporary	copy
my next step is to copy the data from the .csv file to the database but i m not sure how to keep the file from being deleted from the temporary directory i still need it on the next page where i do the actual copying

928013
base-class	inherited
it s also one less place you need to change code if when you change what a class is inherited from for example you factors out a base-class and change the derivation and don t need to worry about your classes calling the wrong parent constructor

928014
nspopupbuttoncell	nscell
i ve created a custom subclass of nscell with an nsimagecell some nstextfieldcells and an nspopupbuttoncell

928028
haskell	scheme
so for it seems to me like functional languages such as ml haskell lisp arc scheme etc

928034
32-bit	64bit
higher level frameworks such as java and .net allow you to run code on 32-bit and 64bit machines

928036
attributes	properties
each user grouping must have an entirely different set of attributes but they both share certain user properties login password name

928040
perl	c++
i m considering using perl but any suggestions using c c++ would be really welcome

928081
contains	elements
i ve got an object that contains a dozen or so fields i want to bind to form elements so that i can use that object to send the data back to the server to be saved

928089
square-bracket	backslash
how about using backslash in front of the square-bracket

928109
cvs	git
something else to know is that most newer source control systems require some kind of daemon program running on the server subversion git perforce microsoft team foundation server while the older simpler systems just use the file system directly visual source safe cvs and don t require a server program

928110
python	c++
if you need anything more complex than what read or zenity provides change to c++ is really the best method although i d recommend python ruby over c++ for such shell-script-replacement tasks

928110
perl	c++
as i said before if zenity cannot do what you need look into writing your game-thing as a proper script in python ruby perl c++ etc as it sounds like you re pushing the bounds of what a shell-script can do

928124
ironpython	ironruby
hooking into .net to allow proper integration between f# c# vb ironpython ironruby etc - really show the strengths of each

928130
external	host
there are a few paths we can take -- we can code and host in house we can code in-house and host external we can have someone else do the coding and hosting cots etc

928133
lookup	any
we need to be able to lookup any object in the hierarchy based on an objects properties or its relationship to other objects

928133
traversal	parent
specifically this tool would be used to traversal a set of objects that are different versioning of a parent object

928150
tokenize	parsing
if your code is python code python comes with a couple of parsing tokenize ast parser

928170
pointers	stack
in most vm languages variabless can be conceptualized as pointers or references to memory in the heap even if the variables itself is on stack

928176
jdom	xom
it is adaptable to many different object models including dom xom dom4j and jdom

928208
iteration	set
i don t completely understand the sequencing but i m assuming it s because my iteration code is trying to access repeateritems that haven t been set yet

928208
selected	button
so if i must postback in order to get the users selections how can i go about this in the button s eventhandler so that i can get the selected values before that repeater gets databound again

928215
synchronous	.when
there s no nice concept of waiting .when using xmlhttprequest ok yes you can make it synchronous but it ll lock up the browser something fierce

928234
gnome	kde
i use this on gnome and kfmclient on kde

928236
paint.net	photoshop
like most i can do a little here and there with photoshop gimp and paint.net

928244
contains	any
i would like to change the contents of this cell to contains only 2 or any numeric characters just before the string

928266
lgpl	gpl
lgpl icons for use in commercial gpl seems to work for everything else

928268
constructor	object
i agree with one of the previous posters that constructor should be for creating an object at the beginning of its lifetime

928268
constructor	object
using a constructor to hydrate an existing object that is currently in an archived state is counter-intuitive at best

928268
constructor	object

928370
64bit	x86
the vm does all this with a single short instruction possibly one or two bytes instead of 4 or 8 bytes per instruction in machine language depending on 32 or 64bit architecture which guessing should mean around 16 or 32 bytes of x86 for 1-2 bytes of machine code

928926
key-value	key
i need a table that stores key-value pairs so i created one with a column called key and a column called value

928938

before trusting xcode snaphot feature too much may i suggest you to consider source code management with cvs svn or perforce integrated in xcode

929780
markup	xhtml
markup validation service by w3c can validate xhtml

929781
any	set
this will return a brand new point object with the points set to the middle of the given two points without having to concern yourself with any other math

929792
csv	xml
they can be configured via a simple xml file and get their data from static or generated xml or csv files or streams

929802
spaces	output
now it s reading two blank spaces before producing the integer output

929812
factors	primes
you should cache the primes to _list and then use it for both factors and primeord

929832
asp.net-mvc	webforms
didn t scott hanselman at one point say that asp.net-mvc isn t webforms 4.0

929832
webforms	asp.net
i ve taken from that that he means that mvc isn t to replace asp.net at all and it is simply another option to win forms and webforms

929837
value	field
but i don t understand why the object is created with value in those field

929854
rendering	redraw
there seems to be a rendering issue because when you resize opera forcing it to redraw then all the background will appear in white as expected

929857
if-statement	loops
you can surround the for loops with an if-statement if any of your lists are empty

929859
required	checked
is there any way to indicate to resharper that a null reference won t occur because of design-by-contract required checked

929864
jms	jta
atomikos is the inventor of java ee without application server so if any open source jta xa does well in java se then it must be transactionsessentials it was designed for java se right from the start and include jdbc and jms connectors pools so you don t need any application server functionality

929866
implements	abstract
sure i get the behavior that i want added to foo but i lose the most important aspect of creating interfaces in the first place -- being able to define an abstract contract that can be implements in a variety of ways by various classes so that dependent classes need not know about concrete implementations

929885
hash	md5
now a days md5 hash or any other hash for that matter are pre computed for all possible strings and stored for easy access

929885
hash	md5
though in theory md5 is not reversible but using such databases you may find out which text resulted in a particular hash value

929903
jms	jta
consequently it offers premium jdbc and jms pools as well as jta xa functionality and you will find it very easy to integrate into your applications

929979
selected	cell
the following method is called when you selected a cell in your tableview

929982
implements	abstract
this is implements as an abstract base-class to make it reusable

929988
python	java
can someone please tell me if there is an equivalent for python lambda functions in java

929997
macros	basic
if the basic stats you need can be collected in a simple wrapper a quick and kinda dirty trick is just using some #define macros replacement

930005
versioning	migrate
if you migrate from an old php versioning to a recent one you should at least take a look at the notice to know what it is about

930014
jquery	dojo
however most people can probably achieve small results on the web faster widgets mashups opensocial apps etc etc with javascript especially in conjunction with a powerful toolkit such as dojo or jquery

930062
animation	rotation
basically you create an core animation block then do an rotation transform and setup and repeat count

930065
malloc	free
i think if you define a malloc and free in your own .c file include in the project the linker will resolve that version

930069
having	select
well after having called addtodatagridviewexample once or more the program will crash if i click inside datagridviewexample for example the users wants to select a row

930079
detailsview	formview
your choices are the formview or detailsview controls

930079
detailsview	formview
the primary difference between them is that detailsview does all the work for you whereas formview requires you to create your own templates thus allowing greater control

930081
create-table	prepare
so you ll have to execute your drop table statement first and then prepare and execute the create-table statement separately

930105
selected	button
selected debugging exceptions then there s a find button on the dialog so you don t have to browse through all of the possibilities

930128
expression	brackets
destroys original string also assumes expression is well-formed only valid characters and matching brackets

930153
32-bit	64bit
if virtual memory were eliminated all current 32-bit applications and 64bit as well would become obsolete

930163
perl	php
personally i prefer the open source stack perl python or php as i believe there are a lot more resources out there to help you learn them

930163
python	php
php will have the most resources but python is a better choice

930169
build-process	nant
nant which we use in our build-process

930169
perl	ruby
perl python ruby

930183
ironpython	ironruby
ironpython and ironruby do let you leverage all of your .net experience and codebase they don t answer your objection to learning new languages however

930185
unique	words
reads the entire file into memory splits it into words using whitespace converts each word to lower case creates a unique set from the lowercase words counts them and prints the output

930197
subclassing	inherited
if you have an inherited form or any class for that matter you would be able to invoke this function from within the subclassing

930205
svnadmin	dump
the svnadmin dump command is ideal for that

930210
cvs	git
i have just started to use svn for version control but there always is a lot of talk going on about version control system like git mercurial svn cvs etc

930215
cvs	git
the centralized svn cvs etc. versus distributed git mercurial etc. repository is a fundamental difference that reflects the way your development team operates

930217
cvs	git
distributed version control systems dvcss like git mercurial and bazaar do collectively have advantages in flexibility of workflow and operation compared to centralized cvss such as svn or cvs

930217
bazaar	git
on a horses for courses basis you might pragmatically pick hg mercurial if you re going to be using code.google.com bazaar if you re going to use launchpad git if you re going to use github for example

930235
entity-framework	ado.net
i am using the ado.net entity-framework with asp.net-mvc

930249
traffic	packets
1 avoids redoing the expensive state computation but takes a larger hit on traffic more packets to move a much larger css file

930281
atomikos	bitronix
i ve elected to use the bitronix transactional manager to solve this problem although apparently there s at least one other option that wasn t apparent to me at the time atomikos

930284
account	api
if so then you can use the paypal mass pay api which lets you pay one or more users out of the account you are using to call the api

930284
required	checked
edit have just checked and the mass pay api required the website payment pro which costs 30 per month and has a transaction fee of 2.2 â 2.9 + 0.30 usd these only apply to incoming transactions - see for info

930311
nsuserdefaults	nsstring
nsuserdefaults is for user preferences usually basic objects like nsstring or nsnumber

930312
ruby-on-rails	django
so the question is how much django or ruby-on-rails do i need to know if my interest is primarily the user interface part of web development

930325
json	xml
typically what people think of ajax such as posting a comment on youtube and seeing the comment appear instantly with a thank you message for example requires a server side language handling the requests looking up data and returning results as html snippets json data or xml

930336
put	get
you have to actually put statements in the if blocks to get it to step in

930344
compile-time-constant	constants
note how it can t differentiate between y and z even though value of z is a compile-time-constants termed integral constants expression or ice while y is not

930349
colorbox	jquery
i would like to have a thumbnail view of an image load normally and when a user clicks on the image the dynamic picture loads using the colorbox jquery plugin

930350
submitchanges	datacontext
after that i use the datacontext s submitchanges methods

930372
python	java
javascript does functional programming better than python or java but not as easily as the real funcional programming languages

930372
python	java
for instance you should know about hashmaps from java or the equivalent dictionaries in python or property lists in lisp

930375
contains	any
is there any one website which contains many good c# screencasts

930386
contains	set
data-structures which do not contains a contiguous set of values are known as sparse or compressed data-structures

930386
constructor	object
your default constructor for should therefore set the object to a sensible value for this purpose

930411
textbox	button
i m basically mimicking the share button feature on facebook with jquery and what im trying to do is when i click on the textbox area the textbox gets larger by height

930418
superclass	subclass
when you derive from a class and instance the subclass the runtime also instances the superclass right

930418
abstract-class	subclassing
since abstract-class can t be instanced are they not created by the runtime when a subclassing is instanced

930420
logout	login
i would like to change this to login and logout if possible

930423
contains	elements
my guess is that the 0 being written following the free indicates that this is the last elements of the the free block list the first pointer sized word of deallocated memory will contains the lists next pointer

930425
derived-class	base-class
the runtime never creates separate instances of the base-class and the derived-class - it s just that the derived-class instance also has all the variables etc of the base-class and runs the base-class constructor as part of initialization

930429
base-class	inherited
put another way if the original class needs 10 bytes to hold its fields and your inherited class needs 5 bytes to hold its specific fields when you construct an object from your inherited class it would occupy 15 bytes where the first 10 corresponds to the fields from the base-class

930442
arrays	loops
loops is going to be faster than a foreach on an arrays considering that foreach is going to use an enumeration object with a method call to advance to each next time instead of a simple increment of a variable and this is easy to prove with a tight loops run a few million times no disassembly required

930442
machine-code	disassembly
what really makes disassembly il silly is the fact that s it s not real machine-code

930477
linked-list	tree
given a binary tree with left and right child only how do you write a recursive function to make it into a simple linked-list in-place

930487
textbox	button
the floating form contains a textbox named floatingformtextbox and a button named button1

930487
textbox	button
now when i put some text into the textbox of the floating form and click the button the text shows up in the textbox of the main form

930491
linked-list	nodes
make a help function which takes a linked-list and a nodes

930492
linked-list	nodes
you can pass a function or closure that does the right think append to a linked-list or whatever given a nodes argument

930494
associativity	operands
if operators are left associativity bind immediately to the left operands it ll be evaluated as the first

930498
parentheses	operators
in programming languages the associativity or fixity of an operators is a property that determines how operatorss of the same precedence are grouping in the absence of parentheses

930501
base-class	inherited
you could use reflection to do it yourself inherited from a base-class so you don t have to re-implement

930506
linked-list	tree
since your tree will contain all the values you want to contain in the linked-list we have to make sure we reach them all

930506
binary-tree	nodes
let s start with the root nodes which is generally the one you have a reference to when you re talking about a binary-tree

930506
children	nodes
some binary tree only store values in leaf nodes nodes without children most store values also in internal nodes nodes with children

930506
children	nodes
but we know that if the root nodes has children in the left direction then any values we might find in all those nodess will come before the nodes in the root nodes

930506
children	nodes
and we also know that if the root nodes has children in the right direction those values will come after it

930506
linked-list	tree
here s the c# code to process a simple binary tree and append the result to a given linked-list

930507
conditional	operators
is the conditional operators in c# it s easier to look for

930507
operators	keyword
that s where a good book or again a list of operators keyword helps to put symbols into language

930523
parentheses	operators
if you are referring to operators associativity - it is how a language determines how operatorss of the same precedence are grouping in the absence of parentheses

930546
arrays	map
you could use a hash table implementation in javascript to map values to arrays indices

930556
contains	any
presumably you are looking to build something like a search engine that can find a relevant document in a sea of nondescript documents which do not contains any metadata only their textual content

930560
constructor	object
however when i use selectlist for the divisionlist i receive this error no parameterless constructor defined for this object

930578
put	get
i know i could put something in the session and check for it in the get action of the guestbook but i wanted to check if someone could come up with a better solution

930580
background-color	transparency
i was looking to make an arbitrary background-color transparency a while ago and developed this scripting

930580
background-color	transparency
it takes the most popular background-color in an image and creates an alpha mask where the transparency is proportional to the distance from the background-color

930583
gnome	kde
kde or gnome - it s like deciding which fat girl you want to date

930597
hashmap	arrays
javascript basically has two types of collections arrays and hashmap

930598
order	add
you can add a edit to the url in order to edit it

930618
linux	unix
coming from a linux unix background i found that qt was a little better since it was using the ming compilers and some make based constructs

930622
c++	lua
i recently added a bunch of new c++ functions callable by lua and am wondering how to best document them and at the same time also stimulate people to write update documentation for a lot of existing lua call-outs

930658
arrays	loops
it s probable that the implementation of the indexof method just loops over the arrays until it finds the requested value because in the general case that s about all you can do

930673
directory	folder
it doesn t run the tests in the regular output bin folder and it doesn t respect the project s file inclusions copy to output directory

930675
haskell	erlang
how would you go about doing it in erlang or haskell

930683
jquery	.post
here is a .post to a jquery plugin that highlights target words on a html page

930701
if-statement	loops
after teaching him print statements and flow control if-statement for loops etc. my suggestion would be to start off with simple ascii-art patterns that can be generated by for loops and such

930710
value	field
ie rendering my view was causing a mysterious nullreferenceexception to to be thrown when the user s value failed validation on a particular field

930716
javascript	dom
at the moment the only fully supported language and the de-facto standard for dom tree manipulation in the browser is javascript

930716
javascript	dom
do you know of any existent or planned initiative to introduce a better redesigned language of any kind not only javascript for dom tree manipulation and http requests in next generation browsers

930724
javascript	dom
in terms of client side javascript is the only way to manipulate the dom

930734
vbscript	jscript
internet explorer supports pluggable scripting languages although the only one reliably included with ie besides jscript is vbscript

930735
javascript	dom
i m unaware of plans to replace javascript as the de facto means of manipulating the dom

930742
versioning	upgrade
i got a segmentation fault error i googled and some say upgrade to latest versioning of ruby

930752
versioning	upgrade
well based on your own question i d say upgrade to the latest versioning of ruby

930761
queue	fifo
using single-writer single-reader fifo or queue

930766
implements	extends
i m working on some effects and things to get a handle on classes implements extends

930766
implements	extends
the second class mooslidesfx.elements extends mooslidesfx to likewise be implements but rather than just animate the element passed in it will animate it s children in order not looking for a lesson chain right now but it s next on my list

930781
32-bit	64bit
if your getting some sort of not found type error then it may be 32-bit 64bit problem

930781
32-bit	64bit
the 32-bit 64bit interoperation can be very confusing

930790
.net	wcf
sadly it s much too frequent in .net based tools such as biztalk or wcf to only have generic generated documentation so disassembling to c# is sometimes necessary to see what a method is doing in which context to use it

930793
order	add
my initial thoughts are to try some sort of javascript injection in order to add events that my application can respond to

930793
value	field
once the osk is closed i can update form field with the value that was typed

930800
rewrite	rule
this rule rewrite any request with a url path of the form user foobar internally to foobar

930828
selected	textbox
if the text in a textbox is incorrect i want the textbox to get focus and all it s contents selected

930840
methods	extend
i can not hand edit the class and can not extend it - so i need to create a helper utility methods to do this

930842
joomla	drupal
civicrm is a drupal joomla or standalone software package to help nonprofits

930854
frame-rate	fps
the example swf on that page runs at 12 fps but as you can see the lower circle tweens much smoother because it s controlled by a timer that ticks at 60 fps and updates the screens in-depended from the swf frame-rate

930854
frame-rate	fps
do keep in mind though that even the timer ticks at 60 fps in reality the flash player will never be able to achieve this frame-rate

930856
protected	public
same for public protected private public first so everything that can be used from other files is quickly visible when opening the file

930866
perl	php
this would probably mainly boil down to providing a standalone script with doxygen in python php or perl and then optionally embed forms in the automatically created html documentation so that documentation fixes augmentations can be sent to the corresponding script via a browser which in turn would write any modifications back to a corresponding branch

930866
cvs	git
in the long term it would be cool if such a script would support different types of backends cvs svn or git or at least be implemented generically enough so that it is easily extendsible

930869
put	get
ok so i am going to put this solution out that will get you started but please note that this is only a rudimentary implementation of a mediator pattern

930892
google-chrome	firefox
however i tried this in plain old javascript and it worked just fine in ie firefox safari and google-chrome

930892
google-chrome	firefox
edit the following works in firefox safari and google-chrome when using window.load

930892
document-ready	.when
.when using document-ready it only works in firefox

930897
compare-and-swap	atomicity
i m implementing a lock-free mechanism using atomicity double compare-and-swap instructions cmpxchg16b

930911
show	next
that way you d have a step to selected the customer so on the next step you know what cartridges to show

930916
value	field
i understand that field such as html.textbox accept two values the first one being the name and the second one being the value

930916
value	field
but in a case where the form is submitted as ajax and the div where the form is placed is replaced with a view from the server the form field insist on taking the previous value

930916
value	field
the model is empty but the field generated from it take the value of the previous submission

930939
.when	ready
so your html page determines what widget are display .when and the gwt code is ready to handle any situation

930940
return-type	arguments
the return-type of a c++ function can only vary based on explicit templates parameters or the types of its arguments

930944
updating	updates
updating the list each time the alpha value needs to be updates isn t an option

930958
nsstring	uilabel
you can t assign a joke object to a uilabel s text propertyâ it takes nsstring only

930982
ironpython	ironruby
with silverlight 2 you can run client-side code you ve written in c# ironpython ironruby vb.net etc

930984
value	field
in html and http the only thing that gets posted back for a drop down list is the name of the field and the selected value

931019
file-descriptor	pipe
you ll also use dup 2 to set the child end of the pipe to be file-descriptor 1 stdout

931022
vbscript	jscript
as already said you have flash actionscript which is a derived language from javascript and silverlight moonlight ironpython ironruby jscript vbscript c# that can run in the browser via plugins the first one being much more ubiquitous

931030
webrequest	webclient
you can continue using webclient to post instead of get which is the http verb you re currently using with downloadstring but i think you ll find it easier to work with the slightly lower-level classes webrequest and webresponse

931064
handler	service
finally assuming no more interrupts the original handler finishes and normal service resumes

931067
python	java
translators that allow you to convert ruby python c# java obj-j cappuccino similar to obj-c cocoa or processing for canvas to javascript either on the client or before deployment and some of which also feature various abstraction libraries

931067
javascript	dom
i m facing the opposite dilemma chomping at the bit to have a capable server-side javascript dom solution that meets all of my needs

931098
versioning	upgrade
so unless you upgrade your os it will remain the old versioning

931125
unmanaged	c++-cli
c++-cli assemblies have the same pe code than unmanaged binaries right

931157
postgresql	mysql
straight_join is a mysql enhancement by postgresql are you referring to a postgres database

931161
tortoisegit	svn
because switching to tortoisegit bazaar hg you will not be able to access svn repositories

931176
common-lisp	scheme
you may just find out that you ll learn the other later also happened to me -- i had to learn more scheme after one year studying common-lisp

931176
common-lisp	scheme
so it was either scheme or common-lisp to me

931185
managed-code	native-code
a c++ cli assembly can contains native-code which has the potential to be more performant than managed-code

931197
common-lisp	scheme
cs teachers at colleges and universities today particularly the young ones were educated using java c and c++ and they probably learnt either scheme or common-lisp in a course called comparative studies of programming language or programming paradigms which was probably taught by someone who doesn t like any lisp language and taught them about functions lists symbols and higher-order functions

931201
base-class	inherited
i created a base-class for these tables and created a child class for each of tables inherited from this base-class then i had separate mapping files for each of tables

931214
scheme	lisp
i do not know lisp but heres why i think plt scheme is a good choice

931216
host	root
next before going back to the root session you ll need to run xhost to allow other sources to display windows on this host

931216
shell	bash
so then all you have to do is go back to your root session shell and i assume bash run export display 127.0.0.1 1.0

931217
xlib	x11
it depends at what level you re programming -- if you re calling directly into xlib i imagine you know that the first argument to xcreatewindows is a and of course that s how you tell x11 where to create the windows

931242
command-line	cmd
it also installs the hg cmd-line system so you can drop down into that if you need to or if you prefer doing version-control on the cmd line

931260
asp.net-mvc	webforms
once code is complete and all tests pass the ui can be added to utilize the api hooks you ve built and that ui can be webforms asp.net-mvc wpf winforms etc

931294
selected	textbox
so just because i click on a selected box may not lead to the save function but changing something in a textbox may

931345
moss	wss
you do need moss for this function not just wss

931364
g++	gcc
this might be because gcc is being used to link not g++

931370
dictionary	map
naively i ve thought of inserting a key in a hidden span and using a dictionary object in the controller to map edits creation

931419
python	java
stdclass is php s generic empty class kind of like object in java or object in python edit but not actually used as universal base class

931423
python	php
is there a similar or equivalent function in python to the php function htmlspecialchars

931449
authentication	login
can you login as sys with os based authentication

931467
execution	jobs
application functionality is provided by services different plugins create and register services which provide a certain functionality templates persistence scheduling jobs tasks execution security automatic updates etc

931467
stubs	tdd
i know that in the spirit of tdd you should test your code in isolation with mocks stubs and then write integration-testing to see how different modules work together.this works great for libraries but when you re writing applications you want to use the application context and lots of tests looks like integration-testing a bunch of real modules are initialized and passed to my classed or queried directly with applicationcontext.getworkerservice for example

931476
double	int
so far i can only think of maybe having a string arrays of data types int double char etc search for that in the line and then search for the parentheses and then search for the absence of the semicolon so i know it isn t just the declaration of the function

931494
output	mode
only a real c++ compiler can do 100 in which case i d compile in debugging mode g++ -s prog.cpp and get the function names and line numbers from the debugging information of the assembly output prog.s

931494
typedef	struct
anything between a toplevel and is a function body except after typedef class struct union namespace and enum

931513
header-files	linker-error
as far as writing the templates in header-files is concerned you have to do that to avoid getting the linker-error

931520
boost-function	boost-lambda
boost-function and boost-lambda

931527
jsonp	ajax
if you do want to fetch cross-domain data via ajax the way to do it is using jsonp

931527
jsonp	ajax
jsonp was created specifically for the purpose of avoiding the cross-domain limitation of ajax

931528
function-pointers	virtual-functions
if so your choices include virtual-functions function-pointers or std function

931532
controller	routes
your routes would match your url patterns and turn them into a proper route to your controller taking the id s and matching them to the parameters of your actions

931539
lgpl	gpl
with lgpl you only need to share and cover with lgpl or gpl source code that s a direct derivative of the library in question -- changes you may make to that library

931544
prerequisites	nsis
check framework prerequisites 2.0 - check nsis system func

931562
py2exe	exe
py2exe is not the only way and maybe not the best way to put together exe files for python apps -- in particular it hardly if at all supports pyqt

931562
pyinstaller	pyqt
please i beseech you check out pyinstaller which does know about pyqt and linux and mac should you care... -- just make sure you use the svn head checkout not the released version which at this time is seriously out of date an issue that s hopefully going away soon...

931570
value	field
it evaluates to a new record of the same type as x and whose field are initialized to the same as those in x except the ones which are listed after the with which are initialized to those given value

931570
haskell	ocaml
for those who are familiar with haskell the ocaml syntax

931605
uibutton	uiview
the navigation bar is a uiview so you can simply create a regulat uibutton and add it to your navigation bar as a subview

.net	wcf
the first three can be optional if for some reason you don t want one of them to be used although why you would want that i couldn t fathom. however the last one is the deserialization constructor and if you wish your exception to be supported in any kind of distributed environment .net remoting asp.net web services wcf etc. then its is pretty much essential

931634
postgresql	mysql
mysql sql server 2005 2008 oracle postgresql sqllite maybe others

931639
revision	updates
it will also let you to remove rebase old revision in the sub repository without affecting the parent repository where your source code is - the removals of old revision in a sub repository will not mess up the history of the parent repository because you just updates that to which revision the sub repository link in the parent repository points to

931656
filtering	grouping
in my current application i have a full domain model linq to sql extremely lightweight repositories and then use extension methods across iqueryable to filtering sort order based on business requirements and then a service layer which contains services based on grouping of responsibilities such as iregistrationservice register users check availability of login names etc.

931660
constructor	object
but one scenario i have no idea how to implement is that what if i want to do some initializing during object creation ie within constructor and the new object can be used right away..

931662
http-post	post
added information my jobs will either send an email or post data via http-post to other services over wan

931684
execution	jobs
so let me just say there are installments of quartz out there that are managing hundreds-of-thousands of jobs and triggers and that at any given moment in time are execution dozens of jobs â and this excludes using load-balancing

931685
click	mouse
if you click inside your flash movie and drag the mouse outside of it mouse_move event will continue to triggers until you release your mouse

931687
arrays	map
i do not have the option of changing the field names or generating unique field names because the form handler code perl cgi is designed to handle an arrays of input values in this case map

931708
authentication	login
in oracle os-based authentication means that if your ubuntu user account is a member of the dba grouping then you can login as sys without a password by typing

931714
attributes	properties
i would like to experimentally apply an aspect of encapsulation that i read about once where an entity object includes domains for its attributes for its costcentre properties it contains the list of valid cost centres

931715
windows-server	windows
a windows service might suffice...but windows-server 2008 iis7 provide some intriguing new ways of hosting and activating services via windows activation services

931728
csv	xml
the best way is to separate your logic where most of the code is php in different files even directories from your page files where most of the code is html xml csv ...

931743
firefox	opera
well works the same for me in opera firefox and ie6 8

931746
cvs	git
difference between git and cvs

931747
python	java
i m a java programmer but i think that is what you want tested with python 2.6

931751
binary-tree	tree
in binary-tree the right leaf is always smaller then the head and the left leaf is always bigger so you can search in sorted tree in o log n you just need to go right if if the key is smaller than head and to the left if bgger

931753
binary-search-tree	tree
a binary-search-tree is an tree -structure where every node has two children-nodes

931753
binary-tree	tree
the intressting thing with an binary-tree is that we can search for an value in o log n when the tree is properly sorted

931763
updating	updates
what you seem to be asking is why the browser stays at the original page when a tab is updates with content its simple it sees it as another webpage say you had a page that had realtime updating your browser would not switch to that as it sees you are on another page - for all it knows you could be reading an article watching a video etc

931767
linked-list	tree
there exists another variation which is called a randomized binary tree which uses some kind of randomization to make sure the tree doesn t become fully unbalanced which is the same as a linked-list

931826
jax-rs	cxf
jax-rs jsr311 does not define a client api but most jax-rs implementations have one like jersey resteasy or apache cxf

931837
assign	add
you could have an additional timestamp column for when a record was assign to someone and then add an or alternative to the assign_to is null part of the where-clause in the update statement above where you require a certain recensy for an assignment to be valid

931839
virtual-machine	vmware
you could always run xp or your choice in a virtual-machine - vmware if free you can create machine via easyvmx

931847
integer	digits
example is using prefixes for integer values say a customer id where the first two digits represent the customer state and the following digits the actual id of the customer

931860
multiple-inheritance	override
if you would like to override __str__ for other containers tuples you can take advantage of multiple-inheritance

931866
calloc	malloc
note that if you also divert calloc and its implementation calls malloc you may need additional code to check how you re being called

931868
administration	account
if you install sql-server as administration that explains why only the administration account was able to configure your reporting server

931870
abstract	extends
you could also make use of the spl to filtering the contents of a directoryiterator using your isimage function by extends the abstract filteringiterator class

931881
windows-server	windows
we know php hasnâ t always run smoothly on the windows platform so weâ ve now optimized windows-server to support your php applications through a new component fastcgi

931882
format-patch	repo
i tried using git format-patch -- lib playdar.js on the playlick project and then git am on the main playdar repo but the differing file locations in the patch file raised an error

931883
controller	routes
the following code should get you the list of routes for a specific controller

931895
push	pull
whenever you commit push new stuff in main repo you just git pull them back into project

931906
constructor	object
the first one is the default object constructor call

931913
ubuntu-server	linux
you could use ubuntu-server which a variety of hosting providers offer among other gnu linux distros

931915
contains	any
map can contains any arbitrary type as a key while switch is very limited to c++ primitive-types char int enum etc...

931925
javascript	dom
jquery website is a javascript framework that makes working with the dom easier by building lots of high level functionality that can be used to search and interact with the dom

931934
ip-address	proxy
depending on your network topology you may not be able to depend on the outgoing address for a number of reasons ip-address pools dynamic routes multiple layers of nat proxy servers etc

931939
dictionary	arrays
the performance is not as good as the dictionary s o n instead of o logn but you have random-access at the elements like in arrays

931963
controller	routes
is there some way i could somehow get the structure map controller factory to bubble back into the global.asax routes list

931968
google-chrome	firefox
if it s just the colour you are after in firefox you can use colorzilla which lets you eyedrop any colour off the viewport including the google-chrome

931973
difference	count
a class in objective-c does work like an instance -- the main underlying difference is that retain count does nothing on them

931986
order	join
straight_join is a hint that enforces join order in mysql

931986
order	join
if you don t know care what the join order is just omit this keyword

931986
postgresql	mysql
mysql doesn t implement any join methods except for nested loops but postgresql does

931986
order	join
join order makes no sense for merge join and cannot be forced in postgresql for hash join

931986
order	join
you can make some of the columns non-sargable and this will force postgresql to use intended join order in case the optimizer chooses nested-loops

931986
order	join
this will force join order in case nested-loops will be chosen by optimizer

931997
webforms	asp.net
the reason for this is because asp.net webforms doesn t use a normal post ie

931998
utility	gnu
the patch should be readable by the standard gnu patch utility for people who don t have git --- but don t run format-patch with the -m -c etc

932001
value	field
how do i get a maximium daily value of a numerical field over a year in ms-sql

932014
rewrite	rule
i think the rewrite rule looks fine

932028
specifications	w3c
edit also see the w3c specifications at

932031
webforms	asp.net
i have a mixed app asp.net webforms later mvc added and it runs in iis 7 on vista but does not run on cassini on the same box and with the exact same files in the webroot

932031
asp.net-mvc	webforms
actually webforms work as expected but all asp.net-mvc routes are 404

932034
oracle	mysql
mysql 5.4 is a preview test release first one under oracle

932034
oracle	mysql
oracle wants to release mysql more often and be more open for community ideas and use more community code

932044
any	set
within any directory there is a set of names of members and the filesystems enforces the uniqueness constraint that a directory can only have one member with a given name

932050
version-control	cvs
version-control such as cvs is great in eclipse but i suppose support is a bit lagging in other types of version-control

932050
version-control	cvs
project level overlays are there in ecipse but you need to use some kind of version-control system for that cvs subversion etc

932051
asp.net-mvc	webforms
is it maybe so that when you test on cassini you click a url from the webforms app that is browsed on one port and the asp.net-mvc app can t be found because it s running on a different port

932057
windows-vista	windows
configure a report server for local administration on windows-vista and windows server 2008

932058
environment	execution
the execution environment of an applet typically your web browser calls the applet methods at different points depending on what stage of rendering the it s reached

932061
methods	extend
if you want to derive a class to extend or change the name of init you should implement your class and have your methods call init

932086
contains	set
i have a div which contains the javascript to embed a quicktime player when the page is first loaded no .mov file is pointed at by the page so a placeholder div is unhidden and the player div is set to

932086
player	movie
so far so good the user then enters the name of the new movie the placeholder div is hidden and the player div is unhidden

932090
type-safety	generics
type-safety unchecked invocation verifytype string class of the generics method verifytype string class

932108
sequences	unique
also just as importantly most databases can generate unique ids by means of auto-increment columns and or sequences

932109
sequences	unique
all my primary keys were generated from a single sequences so they were all unique across all tables

932116
qapplication	qwidget
you can probably use qapplication setstylesheet or qwidget setstylesheet to get it done

932134
duplicates	contains
as i said though that doesn t help if the arrays contains duplicates because it ll stop as soon as it s found 2 indices even if they both point to the same object

932139
value	field
you could do a standard for-loop relying on the specific field value the calendar class has a field_count field kind of implying you can do something like that but that risks issues across jdk implementations and between versions

932151
touchesbegan	gestures
i m implementss swipe gestures in my customtableviewcell control and so i hvae to implements touchesbegan event

932152
extended-ascii	codepages
if you re about to mention extended-ascii i suspect you actually want encoding.default which is the default codepages for the operating systemd .

932160
show	next
in that show view there should be next previous links that would essentially find the next redfoo in alphabetical order and once at the last redfoo the next record should be the first greenfoo continuing in alphabetical order and so on

932195
internet-explorer	firefox
i ve noticed an issue while developing my pages that s always bothered me while firefox my general dev browser always updates css and images when they change on the server internet-explorer does not always do this

932202
telnet	icmp
however if the site blocks icmp echo then you can always do the telnet to port 80 of some site wget or curl

932206
attributes	properties
the id properties of a control can only be set using the id attributes in the tag and a simple value

932225
updating	updates
in order for the logic that is updating the label to re-execute it must be called from somewhere else whenever the label has been updates

932230
textbox	button
i have a textbox and a button

932230
textbox	button
the button just create an messagebox with the text from the textbox

932233
response	timeout
i d look into the scatter-gather pattern broadcast the query asynchronously with jms or some other messaging technology gather response until a timeout is reached or a minimum number of search results has returned then report the results so far to the end user

932241
solaris	linux
for example running an x86 solaris binary on an x86 linux box

932252
rollback	commit
instead of a savestatus message property we have a haschanges boolean on an editableadapter which wraps our poco and provides commit rollback of changes as well as other calculated properties

932253
solaris	linux
also your example of solaris and linux executables mixing would be fairly easy to implement since the oss are so similar elf for executable format posix apis x window system etc.

932253
freebsd	linux
freebsd can already run linux executables

932253
freebsd	linux
there are a whole lot more linux programs than freebsd programs so freebsd implemented the linux compatibility layer

932253
solaris	linux
however don t expect the reverse solaris bsd executables on linux since there is just no demand for it

932255
postgresql	mysql
i m thinking of choosing between postgresql or mysql

932255
xapian	whoosh
should i use an external search library such as whoosh sphinx or xapian

932259
python	java
the app engine plugin for eclipse is for the java sdk not for the python one

932261
any	set
you can convert any expression to the full set of boolean operations

932263
binary	hex
given wikipedia s article on radix point how would one calculate the binary equivalent of 10.1 or the hex equivalent of 17.17

932275
linux	unix
different operating systems have different system calls eg createprocess in win32 vs fork in linux unix

932280
callback	methods
if you were to use the this reference you ll run into the situation where this within the callback will in fact not refer to the scope in which it was created but to the scope within which it s being executed which most likely will not contain the fields or methods you re expecting to call resulting in errors stating undefined instead

932281
callback	methods
loadinfo 1 means execute this function immediately but you need to pass a callback to the gevent.addlistener methods

932291
command-prompt	cmd
i can run the powershell command file at the ps command-prompt but not in cmd

932295
selected	textbox
character alignment is achieved with fixed-pitch fonts - selected something like courier-new as the font for both textbox and printing

932301
arrays	loops
i eventually want to build a multidimensional arrays so i can loops through each item and add them to a database-table

932306
command-line	cmd
here extensions only add cmd to the hg command-line executable extending the behavior

932313
typedef	struct
typedef struct

932332
e-commerce	product
i m looking for a free open source e-commerce product

932340
tokenize	parsing
given the complexity and intrication of visual basic you will probably need to parsing code using a tokenize parsingr

932347
expression	evaluation
however if you are just evaluation expression you could process the string yourself and calculate the results of the new operators

932359
libcurl	curb
curb-fu is a wrapper around curb which in turn uses libcurl

932360
postgresql	mysql
i can t tell whether you need full-text search on description as i have no indication of what it is -- nor whether you need the reasonable but somewhat rudimentary full-text search that mysql 5.1 and postgresql 8.3 provide or the more powerful one in sphinx.

932360
postgresql	mysql
edit so it seems the only possible need for full-text search might be on description and that looks like it s probably limited enough that either mysql 5.1 or postgresql 8.3 will serve it well

932360
postgresql	mysql
me i have a sweet spot for postgresql even though i m reasonably expert at mysql too but that s a general preference not specifically connected to full-text search issues

932360
postgresql	mysql
this blog does provide one reason to prefer postgresql you can have full-text search and still be transactional while in mysql full-text indexing only work on myisam tables not innodb except if you add sphinx of course also see this follow-on for a bit more on full-text search in postgresql and lucene

932364
value	field
i have got a task table in my database with a priority field contains an integer value from 1 to 4 as a test

932365
put	get
put your table updating code in viewwillappear in stead of viewdidload - that way each time you go back to your parent controller from the child controller the data get reloaded

932389
xsd	xml
specifically the xsd has a target namespace of but the xml has no namespace given

932389
xsd	xml
set up a trivial test case of xsd and xml that you definitely know will fail - use that to track down why you aren t validating

932394
digits	radix
the digits behind the radix point are the same it s just that they represent 1 over the power of two

932396
key-value	key
terminating app due to uncaught exception-handling nsunknownkeyexception-handling reason setvalue forundefinedkey this class is not key-value coding-compliant for the key test.

932402
django-sphinx	sphinx
i am using sphinx with django-sphinx plugins and i would recommend it if you will be doing a lot of searching

932407
digits	base
a terminating number a number which can be represented by a finite number of digits n 1 in base b 1 may end up being a non-terminating number in a different base b 2

932455
for-loop	loops
rather than bitswapping the index every time through the loops you can manually implement a ++ equivalent that uses bits in the wrong order to do a double indexed for-loops

932455
lookup	any
i ve verified that gcc at o3 inlines the increment function but as to whether it s any faster then bitswapping the number via a lookup every time that s for the profiling to say

932502
bufferedimage	graphics2d
the reason being a graphics2d object of the bufferedimage can be obtained in order to produce a better quality scale image

932502
bufferedimage	graphics2d
then using that graphics2d object an image can be drawn to the bufferedimage using the rendering hints specified earlier

932525
python	perl
are the answers at how would you translate this from perl to python

932528
shell	bash
the jal expansion is performed by the shell bash csh whatever not by the system itself so your program is trying to look into the folder named jal not home jal

932531
hash	md5
delicious.com provides feeds to query information about urls but the function only accept an md5 hash of the url you want to look up

932561
ruby	php
php isn t as dynamic as ruby so you

932564
lexer	lex
that in turn ran the command through a lexer parsing done in lex yacc and then called c routines as necessary

932564
python	tcl
i retired python got invented and it looked like the perfect successor to tcl

932575
default	reset
when text is pasted dragged into the control i want to reset its style to the control s default

932583
bison	yacc
i m creating a compiler with lex and yacc actually flex and bison

932586
photoshop	layer
lacking a better analogy speaking in photoshop terms i want master to be the background-layer and each topic branch would be a partly-transparent image layer on top of it with some unique contents

932588
silverlight	wpf
the uniformgrid might not be available in silverlight but someone has ported it from wpf

932609
margins	padding
use margins or padding applied to the scope within the containers

932666
google-chrome	safari
furthermore we tried using ie google-chrome safari to show the same document directly

932668
multiplication	subtract
to convert the fractional part use repeated multiplication by 2 subtract off the integer part at each step

932668
integer	digits
remainders and integer parts greater than 9 must be converted to hex digits directly 10 becomes a 11 becomes b .

932670
integer	numeric
if you know that some data item is supposed to be numeric integer and you deliberately choose not to let the dbms take care of enforcing this then it becomes your responsibility to ensure all sorts of things such as data integrity ensuring that no value a can be entered in the column ensuring that no value 1.5 can be entered in the column such as consistency of system behaviour ensuring that the value 01 is considered equal to the value 1 which is not the behaviour you get from type string .

932678
selected	checkbox
another thing to look out for try putting some other controls like radio checkbox and selected under your control

932681
m2eclipse	maven
i am sure m2eclipse maven plugin for eclipse - the other way around - can do that

932692
windows-xp	windows
in windows-xp there s a smtp service in the iis category under add remove windows components - not sure if vista has that too

932702
endpoint	uri
however this will undermine your other endpoint because now it becomes possible to insert a car record through the generic wrapper and through the car uri

932717
constructor	object
by instantiating the tip object you actually perform constructor call simple function call which handle and update the visual element accordingly but once this object is not referenced by any variables it supposed to be collected by garbage collector

932719
digits	base
you convert the string into a number where each letter represents a digits in base 26 increase the number by one and convert the number back into the string

932722
entity-framework	ado.net
the entity-framework design team and the ado.net team blog have a recent series of posts which talk about the various scenarios supports in ef 4.0 the biggest of which are persistence ignorance and poco support n-tier support t4 templates to name a few

932728
value	field
so after long thinking i have one idea to add new column field to table and store something like checksum in this field this checksum will be calculated based on other value

932730
.when	ready
you can then do other things in your main thread and .when you re ready to kill the host just call servicehost.close

932738
subtraction	addition
it is just addition and subtraction

932778
quicksort	in-place
just like in efficient quicksort algorithms written in haskell you need to use monads state transformers to do stuff in-place

932788
show	next
and then the next page shouldn t show those 100 words again

932801
.when	ready
how do i pass in the selector without crashing so that the new thread can call the selector .when the thread is ready

932821
execution	jobs
i believe calling standby will only stop further execution of triggers it will not stop or abort any jobs that are already execution

932838
ruby	php
there are api client libraries for the most common web languages python php ruby

932843
order	add
my problem with this is that in order to add more kiosk functionality i have to rebuild and redeploy both the kiosk application and the wcf service

932860
setinterval	settimeout
use javascript s settimeout and setinterval functions

932866
required	checked
the one thing that struck me about this was that some methods had no way of knowing or checked who the caller was and others that required an integer number to identify the caller

932867
haskell	python
some ffis make you write code in the target language like haskell where ffi code must be written in haskell and others make you write code in the source language like python where ffi code must be written in c

932869
python	c++
there are tools like sip that will take bunch of c++ header files and produce python bindings for it

932904
installation	environment
when i set up a soft jboss-4.2.3.ga directory and a soft jboss-5.1.0.ga directory i can run the respective bin run.sh commands however both try to use the jboss_home and path environment variables which are set to the first installation jboss-4.2.3

932904
installation	environment
or tell my new jboss 5.1 installation to use another environment variables for jboss_home

932907
rollback	commit
spid a commit rollback and releases the lock at some point

932909
required	checked
no they are not required to reload the files if they appear to be unexpired based on the last checked

932913
value	field
in tables where you need only 1 column as the key and value in that column can be integers when you shouldn t use an identity field

932936
compact-framework	.net
edit the .net compact-framework does not support owner drawing so this technique cannot be used

932967
jquery	.post
and then i started noticing that many people .post questions with the tag javascript but not jquery when every line of their code is jquery--like it s the de facto javascript 2.0 or that they don t even realize they aren t writing javascript but rather jquery

932990
command-line	cmd
windows firewall can be configured from cmd-line using netsh cmd

933004
put	get
however when we put that string in a text node and call toxml on it we get amp

933014
uitextview	nsstring
any idea from a code design standpoint why does the internal implementation of uitextview uses an nsstring but not an nsmutablestring when its content is meant to change often

933023
value	field
the other strange thing is that looking at the data viewer in the app-engine dashboard the author field is stored as type user but the value is user gmail.com and then again when i set it up as parameter the case above that works fine i am declaring the parameter as a string then passing down an instance of user user which gets serialization with a simple tostring i guess

933037
superclass	subclass
i understand why this exception-handling is made but is there any way to cast a superclass to a subclass

933047
superclass	subclass
you can t cast a superclass in a subclass because the subclass may have a bigger interface than the superclass means the subclass can have functions like getunixtimestamp that the superclass doesn t have

933050
implements	super
if you re keen on having your subclass implements a constructor in your date class taking a java.util.date foo and in it call super with foo.gettime

933075
javascript	dom
but i think javascript isn t so bad if you start thinking about dom model and how would one work with it

933075
javascript	dom
many things that are messy with javascript are the result of the way dom model works

933087
value	field
you do an ajax request but the text field in you form still hold their value after the call

933095
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch statements are used to handle exception-handling

933108
value	field
basically tables to delete from will store multiple tables in a single integer based field by creating a bitwise combination of value for tables

933108
value	field
so the value of 3 gets stored in the field

933120
inherited	subclass
so you already can inherited and add properties fields methods to your subclass that will all be handled by reflection if the dynamic path doesn t do the lookup

933129
ruby	php
i m familiar with the c family of languages and i ve dabbled in java php and ruby

933144
multiplication	multiplying
filteringing in the time domain is just multiplication in the frequency domain so you may want to just apply a filtering which is just multiplying each frequency by a value for the function for the filtering you are using

933164
constructor	private
trough the use of overloaded constructor in the sortexpression class that i made i can set a private

933199
cryptography	security
upfront i d like to confess to being a complete newbie to cryptography and password security

933213
python	lua
if you are willing to consider a bytecode interpreter that can be entirely contained within your installation which the python solution you mention would be doing then you might consider using lua and something like srlua to bundle your script along with the interpreter into a single .exe

933216
.when	ready
means .when the document is ready execute this code

933222
pascal	delphi
other than that if you like pascal delphi s compiler can produce native exes

933238
postgresql	mysql
they all support mysql and postgresql among others

933243

json	xml
libraries such as jquery for json and sarissa for xml make it even easier

935125
contains	any
when we distribute qt apps on linux or really any apps that use shared libraries we ship a directory tree which contains the actual executable and associated wrapper scripting at the top with sub-directories containing the shared libraries and any other necessary resources that you don t want to link in

935126
updating	updates
the reason it s not updating is that linq-to-sql doesn t implement inotifycollectionchanged so wpf has no way to tell that the itemssource has been updates

935150
account	api
i found a solution that isn t as resource-heavy as retrieving all users the google reporting api can be used to get the total number of account in a google apps domain

935162
any	set
unicode characters are simply characters in .net so the fact that they may be outside the ascii character set does not imply any additional difficulty

935177
command-prompt	cmd
these can be found by doing the following cmd in the cmd-prompt

935197
order	add
you need to explicitly add the system s console as a tracelistener in order for the output to appear in the console

935200

istream	std
i have a function in c++ that takes in an std istream as the input

935297

935306
children	nodes
i m able to load the xml into a variables but when i try to look at the children nodes of the xml the output tells me there are none

935311
contains	any
as far as i can tell there are no unsecure items --- when i browse to the site with ie7 or firefox 3 i don t get any such warning but if i hit the site with ie6 i get the security informaiton dialog box this page contains both secure and nonsecure items do you want to display te nonsecure items

935317
arrays	loops
when you use an enhanced-for loops there is no need for explicit arrays indexing

935318
value	field
but i have one specific case where i call this line to create a securitytag but the value of the agent field seems to end up as none

935318
value	field
i ve checked that the an_agent object is saved and has a value in its id field

935344
restructuredtext	textile
the built-in markup app uses a filtering templates tag to rendering textile markdown and restructuredtext

935348
assign	add
just add the activex dll as a reference via the project references screen which will generate the interop dll and then use your exisiting code as above to assign the reference in your xaml.vb file

935350
knopflerfish	equinox
equinox s implementation of the configurationadmin service appears not to support fine control over the persistent policy as felix s does and the knopflerfish implementation looks i ve only read the source briefly similar to equinox s

935353
sql-server	mysql
i don t really know mysql only sql-server however when using field names like id and table names like system i d be sure to square bracket all of the table and columns names like so

935380
google-chrome	firefox
because this works fine for me in ie7 google-chrome and firefox

935389
python	ruby
i don t know ruby or python very well

935394
reflection	runtime
runtime reflection system-level

935396

this one will work with both 32-bit and 64bit systems

935417
continuous-integration	build-process
1 as part of our continuous-integration build-process i would like to install everything as-if it were a virgin machine

935423
formatting	printing
however when i printing the report or export to a pdf all of the formatting is there and the report printings fine

935434
constructor	object
this doesn t really answer my question or satisfy my curiosity but it does seem to work if i pull the an_agent object out of the database immediately before trying to use it in the securitytag constructor

935435
display	width
you can get away without a width on browsers that support display inline-block

935436
data-members	instances
notice i have no datacontract and thus no data-members because i am sending back an instances of a predefined class xmlelement

32-bit	64bit
following a friends advice i have just replaced a 64bit version of ubuntu with the 32-bit version on my desktop

935445
administration	account
i would try running vs using administration account

935453
implements	extends
you shouldn t extends or implements a list class to make a phonebookentrylist it s a design error

935460
ironpython	ironruby
but there s pretty good community support in places like the codeplex dlr site and the ironpython and ironruby mailing lists -- including support by some of the dlr developers

935462
localization	translation
is is possible to hook into the localization engine somehow to produce a log of missing translation

935464
32-bit	64bit
between 64bit pointers being twice as wide and needing to load duplicate 64 32 bit libraries if you use so much as one 32-bit only application such as flash you will see outrageous memory usage

935464
32-bit	64bit
i do not recommend 64bit workstations until exceeding the 32-bit memory limit for this reason

935467
pthreads	openmp
is there any reason other than readability to use openmp over pthreads

935474
implements	extends
your problem is that you are trying to extends an interface rather than implements it

935493
assign	add
i believe i can assign it the addhandler in rowcreated but how would i be able to set up the add handler if the button is created in rowdatabound

935514
pthreads	openmp
openmp also has similar advantages in portability in that a lot of compilers for different platforms support it now as with pthreads

935520
exception-handling	error-handling
the useful thing about exception-handling is that they immediately leap out of the current methods and head up the call stack until they re caught and handled which means you can move error-handling logic higher up although ideally not too high

935542
any	set
are set in the code behind since you won t have any mark up when you re done

935544
value	field
so the best i ve been able to come up with is a static class that exposes the constants as static readonly string field that are internally set equal to the code value as follows

935560
sql-server	mysql
michael would placing the id in single quotes or square brackets like in sql-server or whatever works for mysql help fixing the issue

935569
margins	padding
you can also check out the layout-tab to see the offset margins padding and width of the selected element

935573
simplemodal	jquery
how do i close a jquery simplemodal

935602
constructor	private
this basically involves writing a public immutable class with a private constructor and provide public readonly shared properties fields

935602
constructor	private
this is all assuming that vb s access control works the same way as c# s in terms of nested types being able to access the private members in particular the constructor of their outer classes

935610
publishing	release
does anyone know why i can publishing with clickonce when its set to debugging mode but not when its set to release mode

935619
configuration	environment
i m not at all sure that it s the right thing to do but in the past i ve read an environment variables for the path to my configuration file

935624
32-bit	64bit
i thought i remembered a way to set a machine level flag so that all the any cpu .net dlls would be treated as 32-bit and not 64bit by deafult but i can t seem to find it again

935631
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
look at the msdn docs for each of them sortedlist sorteddictionary for details of the performance for different operations in different situtations

935631
sortedlist	sorted
sortedlist actually maintains a sorted arrays rather than using a tree

935632
deployment	install
i see in the system requirements for asp.net-mvc 1.0 that you need to have some flavor of visual-studio 2008 install at the deployment site

935667
printf	scanf
check calls to printf and scanf etc. to make sure that the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string specified and that the conversions specified in the format string make sense

935667

i d prefer to run some oracle queries once each night and store results in some local sql-server tables

935697
windows-server	windows
i assume i should run queries through standard windows scheduler windows-server 2008

935697
sql-server	oracle
how to write a query procedure function that would get data from oracle and put them into a sql-server table possibly recreated before each query run

935698
sql-server	oracle
i suggest you speak to the dba s of the oracle and sql-server databases as there may be other considerations you need to bear in mind

935706
perl	c++
perl comes with a sort of pseudo language called xs for interfacing to c or c++

935706
perl	c++
similarly the planned xs++ distribution contains a complete albeit pointless example of using xs++ to interface c++ and perl

935713
unmanaged	c++-cli
in c++-cli you can call into unmanaged code as if you were writing native code but you can call into c++-cli code from c# as if it were written in c#

935760
updating	updates
basically i want to updates a table periodically such that a process that reads from the table will not get an incomplete result if another process is updating the table

935778
environment	building
best to do some threat analysis and building a social environment where malicious users aren t created or given access in the first place

935787
display	outline
how would you make rows that are the top parent in an outline view which is connected to a nstreecontroller display how many children it has in a text cell

935802
jasper-reports	itext
i m looking at using itext s pdfcopy to merge two pdfs but was hoping jasper-reports might have an easier way.

935809
json	xml
i am trying to aggregate movie times off of google movies search into a usable format such as json or xml

935817
sharing	share
something to look out for here is false sharing where two adjacent data-structures share a cache line and modifications to one invalidates the cache line for the other

935823
sequences	subset
the other thread can be found here generating sequences for subset of a table

935824
json	xml
basically you have to fetch the results page using some server-side scripting and then extract data from it to present in a formated way json xml etc

935826
datamatrix	barcode
i have had good luck using datamatrix format as you can have varying amounts of data and you can size the barcode as you wish

935828
contains	elements
setting the overflow property to auto has the side-effect of causing that elements to contains floats in all modern browsers

935840
pointers	stack
triple faults usually point to a stack overflow or odd stack pointers

935845
istream	std
you can use an instance of std istream that implements its operations with ruby methods on stdin called through the c interface using rb_funcall

935845
istream	std
you can t do it by deriving a class from std istream itself because its methods are not virtual

935845
buffering	streaming
instead you ll need to derive from std streaming_buf and instantiate an istreaming that uses your streaming buffering

935849
filtering	grouping
in management studio you can right click on the tables grouping to create a filtering for the table list

935868
administration	account
it needs to be running as an account which is in the administration grouping on the local machine

935886
command-line	cmd
echo is a cmd that is running inside the context of your cmd-line batch script

935907
numeric	digits
if your barcode only consist of an even number of numeric digits you can quite easily switching to the code c variant to get them down to half the size

935913
children	nodes
when i get to a nodes of type son i want to do another query for its own children

935920
samba	svn
that way you could use something like e-texteditor which comes highly recommended as a great alternative to textmate and have a samba share to a git svn repository on your virtual-machine

935921
viewwillappear	viewdidload
i tried implements viewwillappear and viewdidload in the view controllers but those didn t get called

935931
contains	set
the tricky part though is that my drive containss a set of folders that have folders within folders and contains documents

935932
highlight	selected
by default the selected node highlight is hidden when the control looses focus

935935
margins	padding
you can fix this by adding a 50-pixel padding and negative margins to the left-hand side of the outer

935945
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
i know that when you assign a delegate to a uinavigationcontroller the component uiviewcontroller delegate methods are not called

935965
jasper-reports	itext
i don t think you could do that in jasper-reports but it would be fairly simple in itext

935986
data-visualization	charts
using the flex ant task to build our application results in the flex data-visualization trial watermark being displayed in our charts

936008
cryptography	security
some cryptography theory and hands-on experience with different common flaws in security schemes that people create

936031
ssms	ssis
then you can script the schema out using ssms and export the data using bcp or ssis to sql 2000

936044
compact-framework	.net
testing for and responding to network connections in the .net compact-framework

936085
contains	set
when you set i to 5 arrays i pointed to the cell on the stack contains i

936104
constructor	object
many different date formats can be converted to date object just by passing them to the date constructor

936120
display	width
aside from display the width that is actually available to controls i don t see any other use for this information in xaml though - all of the other scenarios i can think of can use this information implicitly

936123
look-and-feel	substance
if this matters i am using the java substance look-and-feel too

936125
hide	show
i presume if it is hidden hide then fadein will automatically show it

936130
any	set
declaring it as volatile readonly which if my understanding is sound defeats the purpose of volatile by never allowing it to be set won t have any effect on the actual data that s being manipulated the back-end store for the

936147
required	checked
you can do a quick checked with telnet on the required port

936154
selected	button
for windows-xp open the display control panel selected the appearance tab and click the advanced button

936158
font-size	height
the tmemo object does not expose a line height property but if you re not changing the font or font-size at runtime you can determine the line height experimentally at design time

936158
pixels	line
here s the code i used to set the height of a memo that had a line height of 13 pixels

936158
pixels	line
i limited the height to 30 line 396 pixels to keep it on the form

936185
python	perl
is there a portable perl along the lines of portable python

936217
hotmail	gmail
the best part of their services is that they have whitelist agreements with the major email providers hotmail yahoo gmail etc so your email don t end up in the junkmail box

936218
g++	gcc
i am using eclipse in linux and i didn t have any problems compiling after i added -lpthread to the compiler arguments to g++ gcc and linker

936218
g++	gcc
i tried to manually compiling it with gcc and g++ with suffixes -pthread and -lpthread and the result it similar - gcc â pthread no such file or directory

936256
perl	php
but using curl or a php perl python whatever script may be a better idea

936257
perl	php
web server is mostly designed to serve static content though most web servers have plugins to support scripting languages like perl php asp jsp etc

936257
httpserver	webserver
apache tomcat httpserver is webserver and oracle weblogic is application server

936259
any	set
there are any number of patterns for accomplishing this but i d look for someone who has a simple set of well-defined patterns they are fully comfortable with

936264
margins	padding
if you want to have the desired effect you can use padding instead margins always collapse

936272
division	modulo
the easiest way is to use the modulo division operators

936272
division	modulo
modulo division returns the remainder

936283
python	java
it s general purpose like java python c++ etc. so you could use it for most any kind of application

936296
webforms	asp.net
front end ui layer could be asp.net webforms or window used for editing person data

936296
boolean	int
instead of addperson returning a boolean it can return an int 0 success non zero equals failure and the number indicates the reason why it failed

936301
integrated-security	connection-string
the best way to manage this is not to have a secret at all and not to use login pwd in the sql-server connection-string but use integrated-security sspi

936301
credentials	account
this way your application will authenticate to the database using its windows credentials the account on whose behalf your application is running without sending any credentials on the wire regular authentication means login pwd is passed between application and db each time you open a connection and you don t have to store any password

936301
credentials	account
after that you re as secure as the account is secure which is nothing to write home about but it s much better than having credentials passed around between processes

936301
credentials	account
note that anything that runs with the same credentials any code in your application will also run with the rights of the service account

936334
extends	super
ps about validation if we create our own super entities we can there define our validation in my case i have tried as well extends the entities using partials cases and then i can have an entity myphonenumberdetail with my special validation

936365
double	int
when you call intvalue the double value will be cast to an int

936368
constructor	object
the so-called constructor code anything inside the cfcomponent tag that is not inside a cffunction tag will still get run in when the object is instantiated and as a result before your method is actually called

936370
foundation	cocoa
cfnumber is â œtoll-free bridgedâ with its cocoa foundation counterpart nsnumber

936370
carbon	cocoa
see integrating carbon and cocoa in your application for more information on toll-free bridging.

936372
any	set
if don can live without any nulls returned in the result set then adding the is not null predicate on both of those columns may enable an index to be used

936372
any	set
if you you really need the specified result set you can try some alternatives to see if the performance is any better

936380
having	select
i m having trouble getting a hibernate select to return a correctly populated object graph when the select contains joins across many collections

936391
order	add
in order to do what you want you will need to add the id to the viewdata construct

936405
constructor	object
the constructor of form object can take a dictionary of field values

936405
value	field
for the sake of completeness if you do not want to bind the form and you just want to declare initial value for some field you can use the following instead

936415
managed-c++	.lib
i have two managed-c++ projects in a single .sln project .lib and project .libtest

936438
groovy	java
btw if you use groovy which sits on top of java then this uses bigdecimal out of the box

936451
interlocked	atomicity
the win32 interlocked functions provide a mecanism for atomicity operation on data

936451
interlocked	atomicity
the interlocked operations are still atomicity

936455
websphere	ibm
websphere ibm s app server has its own bundled webserver

936461
ruby-on-rails	django
ruby on ruby-on-rails django spring etc. i keep seeing so and so does or doesn t scale well

936467
lighttpd	apache
if you know what you re doing in apache lighttpd or whatever you re serving files with you could set your cache headers just like google s and significantly reduce the amount of data your end user has to download by serving it from your own server

936473
project-management	scrum
and with their recent acquisition of greenhopper they fully integrated scrum into the project-management as well

936487
unsigned	bigint
keep in mind also that mysql suports integers well outside of php s range unsigned bigint is 64 bits

936487
32-bit	64bit
php supports at best 64bit signed ints and less on 32-bit platforms so automatically casting may be undesirable in some contexts

936505
nested	order
by the way not sure if it s visible but for el in 90 52.6223 ... is outside the loop and makes a nested loop with the rest i m not sure if the order is correct or what not

936511
shell	bash
if you are using the bash shell on linux os x using cygwin is to add you .bashrc file

936519
shell	bash
in your .bashrc if you use bash as your login shell

936531
directory	folder
it s in the root directory of the www folder

936535
target-platform	platform
the way you had to debugging device drivers on a windows ce device is using platform builder and even then you won t have a debugging image of your target-platform

936544
click	mouse
fires when the user click the left mouse button on the object

936549
chmod	sudo
sudo chmod -r 2750 home kollar apps kinfonet current

936549
chmod	sudo
sudo chmod -r 2770 home kollar apps kinfonet shared pids

936561
python	php
you can get mod_rewrite to generate a map from external source such as executing a php or python file which can get the data from the database and create a mod_rewrite map

936586
click	mouse
in winforms the click event is raised when either mouse key is clicked

936597
having	select
if i a many-to-many relationship between users and roles and i have an instance of a user entity and several role ids can i insert a relationship between the two types of entities without having any other role data and without doing a select on the roles first

936610
attributes	properties
if you query the user attributes properties in ad the useraccountcontrol properties will be 514 if the account is locked out or 512 if it is ready for login

936612
double	int
if there were a math.pow double int it could probably be more efficient

936615
click	mouse
according to msdn the click event is called not only when the mouse is clicked but also when the enter button is pressed

936615
click	mouse
if you only need to handle mouse click i d move all of your code in the mouseclick event

936615
click	mouse
you can t do it the other way around because the click event doesn t tell you which mouse button if any was clicked

936622
value	field
this gives initial value for the form field but does not triggers validation

936624
value	field
i need to do this if i want to set that field with a value read off an xml file

936627
required	checked
a number of refactorings however required a decent set of tests to checked that the refactoring did not add unexpected behavior

936628
click	mouse
if you want to handle only mouse click - override onmouseclick and don t handle mouseclick event otherwise - override onclick and don t override onmouseclick

936633
kmdf	wdf
since the wfp seems to be for win2k8 vista or better you can use wdf - when you see references to umdf user mode and kmdf kernel mode this is what they are talking about

936637
masstransit	nservicebus
you can see rhino.servicebus nservicebus and masstransit for .net-native implementations and rabbitmq for something different

936637
data-access	nhibernate
n+1 problems with lazy collection because of code-to-implementation data-access leakage - you always need your db context where your query code is etc in comparison to for example lightspeed commercial or nhibernate

936640
asp.net-mvc	webforms
this is because i m using webforms as i still don t know asp.net-mvc well enough to implement it so i have to get the clientid s on the page

936645
inherited	subclass
just subclass phpunit_framework_testcase write your own assert methods and have your test classes inherited from your new subclass

936667
order	add
if customers are more likely to be order 2 widget one in red one in blue add each item separately to the manytomany field and grouping them in your order interface

936668
formatting	printing
then the user can printing the report and never see the missing formatting in the interactive viewer

936707
python	c++
in that process i came to translate a lot of algorithms from python numpy to c++ blas

936712
value	field
to get the value of a text field you use the jquery function val

936713
serialization	marshalling
the serialization issue is because the form class isn t marshalling by reference and you re trying to invoke a method on the class across domains

936735
value	field
apparently access will interpreter null as no - changing the value but sql-server will not interpreter null as a no in a bit field what yes no gets turned into in conversion so it throws a write conflict error when a value is not required and is null

936754
sortedlist	hashtable
i don t know what your elegance-to-maintainability ratio is but for something this straightforward i d consider a hashtable like arnshea mentioned or even something as simple as a sortedlist

936765
arrays	loops
allocating in a loops may cause the individual arrays to end up scattered on multiple non-contiguous pages through the virtual memory space as the allocation loops could be interrupted possibly multiple times by other threads or processes or simply due to the discretion of the allocator filling in small empty memory blocks it happens to have available

936769
contains	any
contains any html markup because it

936793
environment	building
i would like my building scripting to act properly for release and development environment

936807
windows-xp	windows
now if you create a windows and don t process messages for it in some way windowss-xp and up will replace your windows with a ghost windows that has a white client area and task manager will tell the user that the application is not responding

936807
keyboard	mouse
it s a block of memory that can hold a certain number of message objects specifying destination hwnd message id wparam lparam system time when message was posted mouse position when message was posted and some data that allows the derivation of keyboard and mouse button state when the message was posted along with pointers to the head and tail of the queue i assume it s a circular queue

936810
jquery	.post
according to this blog .post the reason it doesn t work when you try to pass the object is that jquery attempts to serialize it

936817
margins	padding
you might have to reset the padding and margins on your ul selector

936826
versioning	staging
it can spell trouble if a versioning of an app works in staging but doesn t in production because of this sort of discrepancy

936838
button	popup
an issue that i m running into is that when i click the login button on the popup login form if the login fails for some reason or if the user needs to update some information before moving on the modal popup is cleared and the user is never notified that they need to change the information and the login cannot proceed

936838
change-password	login
does the modalpopupextender provide the ability somehow to mimic a wizard type of interface so that if my login failed then the next control would be rendered in the popup user must change-password

936841
constructor	object
i have a component i created in c# which had previously been using the default constructor but now i would like it to have its parent form create the object in the designer by passing a reference to itself

936850
value	field
if your contacts table is your only table or has zero relationships based on this id field you could set the identity property to no renumber the value from 1 to count id then set the identity property to yes and reseed the identity for completion using

936850
any	set
in this scenario you could use the above reseed scripting after each set of deletions but change count id to max id once everything is initially and correctly set up this adds a little speed as the table gets larger prior to any additional inserts or foreign key constraint updates

936883
document	editing
parsing format display the document in a rich editing control

936907
financial	banking
if it helps i have a text file that lists the rules for calculating the banking holidays defined for all the major and minor financial centering

936912
attributes	properties
extended attributes are a properties of the filesystems ntfs

936922
contains	any
it works because php automatically converts a bare string an unquoted string which does not correspond to any known symbol into a string which contains the bare string

936930
defined	declare
constraints are defined when they are declare

936936
contains	elements
however the database containss numerous tables whose elements contains human readable names descriptions abstracts etc

936938
cursor	row
so you have to use a cursor copy the row information into an arrays and then step through the arrays printing the values using dmbs_output

936963
grouping	sorting
also you can continually do card sorting exercises right down to page and function levels - you do one card sorting session to understand user needs then you take one grouping of cards and ask users to break that down into ranks of importance

936984
assign	add
if so maybe add the ranges through code manually and assign them using the expected format which is expecting a date object

937007
firefox	opera
web fonts are supported in safari 3.1 the upcoming firefox 3.5 and the upcoming opera 10

937007
webserver	upload
at this point the biggest problems with the implementation in safari firefox and opera is that they require you to upload the original font file to your webserver

937026
python	php
most are in python but i also posted there a php solution

937029
linux	unix
when using a web interface you re likely in a program with its own user in the unix linux sense which is probably not in group root

937045
required	checked
if it is the case that the strings you required are not that many after all then you can just load them all in memory once and use some methods to provide translation by checked a data structure in memory

937050
environment	building
for each of our building with zed we ensure a completely clean working environment but assume that the entire toolchain and utility applications are already install on the machine

937050
configuration	environment
setup your vm library to represent the different build environment configuration that you will need for your product set and load start them on demand as you require builds for different products

937053
gwt-rpc	gwt
the crux of the problem with gwt and gae is that you want to use jdo to persist your objects when using gae and the bytecode manipulation done by the nucleus jdo implementation makes your domain objects no longer work with gwt-rpc

937058
mouseover	mouseup
before jquery 1.4 this was limited to the following events click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout keydown keypress keyup

937083
oracle	mysql
but there is a chance that we might shut down our sqlserver database and go to mysql or oracle

937083
oracle	mysql
oracle and mysql

937095
sql-server	mysql
i ve used it in mysql and sql-server with decent success with out of the box functionality

937148
show	next
i have added the users to the role and it does show the correct count next to the role name

937156
proxy-server	apache
we use apache as a reverse proxy-server

937173
interpreter	runtime
you just can t download arbitrary code at runtime and interpreter it

937178
profiling	trace
i collected some initial trace with sql profiling following several articles on the internet like this one ignore it is referring to sql-server 2005 tools the same principles apply

937184
oracle	mysql
ideally i would like to specify the database system oracle sqlserver mysql etc. in the config file and be able to call escape variablename and it would escape the string contents based on the current database setting in the web.config file

937184
oracle	mysql
at a minimum the project should support oracle sqlserver and mysql

937206
any	set
when compiling i always set it for any cpu

937208
internet-explorer	firefox
the web browser has been configured to send local credentials if asked an internet-explorer option available in firefox via plugin not sure about other browsers

937244
webforms	asp.net
take following example of code asp.net webforms

937244
webforms	asp.net
or any other way to avoid typecasting and in general have a strong typed view for asp.net webforms

937260
sql-server	oracle
but practically speaking if you wish to develop a product for both oracle and sql-server you re talking major overhead

937260
sql-server	oracle
if you haven t installed an oracle and a sql-server test server you probably haven t even started

937276
click	mouse
apps like gmail in basic html view work perfectly gmail in normal view works although i use the jaws cursor a lot to simulate a mouse stackoverflow works fine google spreadsheets is completely inaccessible google docs is mostly inaccessible and google reader works fine although i have to use the jaws cursor to click on options like expanded or list view

937280
put	get
i just don t know how to run a query which would get data from oracle and put into mssql on regular basis without manual interaction

937281
radio-button	selected
now i have to click each radio-button twice before it gets checked and the selected radio-button is not being persisted

937281
radio	click
how do i eliminate the need for 2x click on the radio button

937282
plugins	add-on
to disable flash you can go to the tools- add-on in firefox and then in the plugins tab disable the shockwave flash plugin

937296
directory	folder
the simplest way without changing a lot of configuration is to put everything in the public folder you mention into your public_html folder then place all the other contents like the application and library folders into the directory up from public_html

937309
base-class	inherited
the answers by womp and qua are i think the correct ones however if your 12 types all inherited from some common base-class as your original question suggests you can write the methods such that it works with your types and only your types as such

937340
document-ready	.when
imho because jquery-load is async your entire page can load before the library has loaded so the effects that you do on document-ready are sometimes visibly noticeable to the user .when they are applied

937350
highlight	selected
you could try and set a background colour for the text selected but the default blue highlight will probably ruin your effect

937364
webforms	asp.net
i have an asp.net 3.5 gridview on a webforms

937364
databound	gridview
i ve tried calling datasource from the gridview databound method and calling gridview.rows x .dataitem

937364
object-reference	instances
in each case i only get a null reference exception-handling object-reference not set to an instances of an object

937376
queue	fifo
you should probably wrap it to protect the integrity of the queue fifo only

937418
json	xml
wcf can allow you to use web services and soap rest xml or json over http or a binary format over tcp among other options

937418
.net	wcf
update based on your additional explanation i m going to suggest you look at the rest stuff in wcf for .net 3.5

937418
.net	wcf
in php it s very easy to implement a rest-style service and with wcf the same is true for .net

937418
put	get
then you could ship some example service code to your uppercase clients to get them started on building what they need to receive your outbound put post messages

937421
document	element
live works by attaching your event handler to the document not to the element

937421
mouseover	mouseup
as ichiban noted these supported events are click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout keydown keypress keyup

937453
webforms	asp.net
asp.net design templates - for webforms

937468
triggers	insert
i wish to have a triggers so that when an update insert or delete occurs i then do the following

937474
triggers	insert
sql triggers provide an implicitly-defined table called insert which returns the affected rows allowing you to do things like

937474
triggers	insert
regarding your code sample you ll want to create separate insert update and delete triggers if you are performing separate actions for each

937475
http-post	post
the code below uses http-post to post nsdata to a webserver

937478
contains	any
on an update deleted and inserted contains the before and after copy of any updated rows

937484
contains	set
in response to the cdn_folderchanged message you can get and set the contents of the clistctrl that contains the files

937487
authentication	login
using this principal you can check whether the user is authentication and get a login name of the user

937487
authentication	login
this is due to the reason that after login an authentication cookie is set and this cookie contains limited amount of information

937487
authentication	login
and on each request after login only this cookie is checked if it exists and valid - user is authentication

937491
syntax-error	syntax
this gives syntax-error invalid syntax

937492
64bit	x86
why not just always compile for x86 does the 64bit runtime give you any benefit

937493
selected	button
selected it and click view button

937496
any	set
you will not get any exception-handling any more if there are errors in a floating point calculation instead the result variables will be set to either nan inf+ or inf-

937510
project-management	project
whenever ive analysed my project schedules it turns out about 50 of the time goes into design project-management quality control and auxiliry tasks

937524
dependency-injection	interceptor
i am aware that this is an example of the service-location pattern not the dependency-injection pattern but the point was to illustrate interceptor and registering them with a container not to illustrate dependency-injection.

937557
filtering	grouping
grouping indices are filtering according

937557
filtering	grouping
words grouping filtering has higher

937559
environment	execution
it may seem like it s execution only once when you run with the django development server but in a production environment it will get executed quite often

937570
constructor	private
also the constructor is declared private

937585
perl	php
if it is passing an object in java perl php python and ruby it is automatically pass-by-reference and the instance variables values of the object can be changed

937596
fortran	perl
many other languages support such pass by reference -- perl fortran pascal visual basic .

937596
python	java
in your update you put java and python in the same category but that s wrong you could not reproduce your example with java

937596
python	java
python and java s style is sometimes known as by object reference as opposed to by variable reference what s passed or assigned is a reference to the object so if the object has mutators the callee can invoke those mutators and thus alter the object not to a variable so that after the call the variable if any used to pass the argument still refers to the same object never to another object

937596
python	java
this distinction is most clear to see with immutable objects such as in both java and python numbers and strings

937605
uitableview	uiview
the uitoolbar has two views a uiview w uitextviews and a uiview w uitableview

937605
uitableview	uiview
i tab back to the uiview w uitextviews select some data and then tab back to the uitableview but none of the delegate methods get called like viewdidload or initwithnibname or anything thus the data in the table is stale

937635
processor	cpu
for instance i have a network-intensive java process -- it s the only thing running and the cpu is at 99 but only 55 of that is reported as processor cpu

937638
contains	elements
if the selector does not find any matches then it contains an arrays with 0 elements

937638
document	element
each element in the arrays is essentially a reference to the matching dom element in the html document

937644
constructor	object
again you can use the domobjecttoreference in the jquery constructor to create another reference to that object

937647
gridview	formview
a gridview or a formview can support automatic updates only if it is used with some kind of a properly configured datasource objectdatasource sqldatasource etc.

937654
frame	width
when requesting the size of the loaded swf like you do it will return the width and height of the entire surface of the first frame not that of the stage

937663
hide	show
when the user does another search that returns results you hide this control and show the results in the list view normally

937684
directory	folder
the image is in the same directory as all of my source code and it s under the resources folder in the xcode project

937685
asp.net-mvc	webforms
etag s in asp.net-mvc are the same as webforms or httphandlers

937690
putty	pscp
you can use the scp client that comes with putty pscp

937694
perforce	git
to be fair i have limited experience with git and none with hg but one thing i miss about svn perforce etc the few times i do use it is a nice low integer revision number i can report to other developers

937718
macros	vba
the front end fe contains the links to tables queries forms reports macros if any and vba code

937718
contains	any
the back end be contains tables indexes relationships and a startup form that tells the user to not think about making any changes and to exit immediately

937720
linked-list	queue
if you don t need to search the queue and queue don t generally need to be searched then a linked-list

937730
.when	ready
.when you are waiting on a kernel object your thread won t be granted any cpu time as it is known by the scheduling that there is no work ready

937736
research	metrics
nodexl is developed by microsoft research and pretty neat it has visualization algorithms and some metrics but it is still in its early stages of development

937736
networkx	graphviz
however if you know python then i would definitely recommend networkx and its cousin pygraphviz which is an interface to graphviz

937748
linked-list	queue
if the order is important and queue are then a linked-list

937750
document	element
it is a good idea to start with the surrounding element for the area you are manipulating to avoid having to search the entire document

937760
driver	kernel
the problem may also be a kernel level fault that is not driver related

937775
double	int
once the size of an int is exceeded every added bit to the original bit-fields will double the storage space

937775
double	int
once the size of an int is exceeded every added bit also double the number of and operations needed to implement the logic

937779
controller	routes
using something like .. .. scripting myscript.js seems to work fine for routes that are the traditional controller action id but are more fragile for anything more or less complex than that

937793
show	next
you view won t show up if you comment out because then in the next line your self.navigationcontroller property won t be set

937800
virtual-functions	member-functions
as others have said the member-functions of your class themselves do not take up per object spaces but the existence of virtual-functions in that class s interface generally implies the existence of a virtual table essentially a lookup table of function pointers used to dynamically resolve the proper function implementation to call at runtime

937800
data-members	private
finally access specifiers public private protected grant the compiler certain leeway with packing of data-members

937804
environment	building
in a lamp environment i often create an account on the production server and checkout the development files as if i were developing there do the building and then deploy locally

937810
populate	row
but looks like the table gets rendered with no data and when the async process finishes the table gets populate but donâ t get resized to fit the screen so only show me one row

937818
binary	hex
also the value of the mask in hex when converted to binary doesn t have zeroes in the least 5 significant places as the question says so i am not sure how it will mask the least 5 sig places

937829
32-bit	64bit
why not just build your assemblies for both architectures 32-bit and 64bit specifically include both in your installer and then at install time detect which version of this dependent assembly your client has and then install the appropriate architecture version of your application

937829
binaries	install
this way there s no messing around modifying binaries manually or needing to include corflags in your install

937870
version-control	git
remember that git and mercurial are both dvcs distributed version-control which is quite different than a central vcs

937870
bazaar	git
i chose bazaar and git for the experience

937872
linked-list	arrays
if you link to each of these arrays positions from your item represented as a linked-list which are of length k using a pointer to the bit position object as the node value you can invalidate a bunch of items by simply deleting the bit position object

937878
duplicates	contains
if you wanted to get fancy your stack couldn t exceed number of bits without contains duplicates or impossible scenarios

937890
jquery	.post
when using jquery to .post data back to the server i m getting some strange behavior

937894
selected	textbox
if you re forcing the isselected property i d also give the first textbox a name and set the focus after you set the selected tab

937926
web-services	ntlm
there is lots of info around about connecting to sharepoint 3.0 web-services with wcf and ntlm impersonation

937934
32-bit	64bit
most boring the jit can optimize depending on 32-bit 64bit underlying os or even potentially depending on the exact processor architecture

937934
value	field
most interesting the jit could optimize out conditional branches in a class that depend only on a readonly field because at least theoretically that value will never change during the execution of the class

937942
worksheet	excel
but since this is just for excel you can use the build in worksheet function index for arrays slicing

937948
parsing	comma
i am using pcre for some regex parsing and i need to search a string for words in a specific pattern let s say all words in a string of words separated by comma and put them into a string vector

937979
python	tcl
i am using tcl from python tkinter module like below

937979
python	tcl
you can see tcl version 8.3 is selected by python

937979
python	tcl
tcl8.3 does not have expect package so i can not use expect package in python tcl tk

937994
comet	chat
i am going to implement a comet chat

937994
comet	chat
i just want to choose the best way to implement a comet chat client

938018
contains	elements
and if your elements has those two class referenced properties contains in both of them will be applied to it if only one only those properties gets applied

938020
32-bit	64bit
database between 32-bit and 64bit

938038
division	modulo
i need to implements a simple macros that finds the modulo of two numbers on a processor that doesn t have a division operators think arm

938038
subtraction	division
i could use division by repeated subtraction but i don t know if this was the most efficient or easiest to work with

938047
debian	linux
i have debian linux installed on the server

938052
spaces	output
and takes the output of ls and cuts it apart into arguments wherever there are spaces newlines or tabs

938076
put	get
not to mention that if he puts in his own email he can put in any random address too flooding some poor shmuck s inbox and possibly causing your mail server to get blacklisted.

938084
put	get
what it certainly doesn t do is check if the http verb is a post or a get which most people assume you can see this if you set up a simple page and put the viewstate and eventvalidation if present fields in the query string then check ispostback

938090
execute	prepare
it s faster pdo caches the query in the prepare and then uses the parameters passed in execute

938095
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i have an nsstring or nsmutablestring and would like to get the number of occurrences of a particular character

938099
python	tcl
i think the version of tcl tk is used by python is determined at compiling time

938099
python	tcl
so you need to look at the code recompile python against the version of tcl tk you want to use

938102
ip-address	hostname
you ll need to make sure that both the user account and its granted permissions are set for the appropriate hostname or ip-address you will be connecting from

938109
dictionary	arrays
keep arrays or dictionary and increment the count for character then repeat

938117
background-color	transparency
thus you can make the background-color transparency black which will fool the system into using a white caret which is not visible

938120
perl	php
in pcre perl compatible regular expressions which is what you re using with preg_ in php the pattern is input along side the expression options like so

938126
iteration	elements
i am using the struts iterator tag and trying to get 3 elements of my list in 1 iteration

938126
iteration	elements
my list has 18 elements and in a single iteration i want to print out 3 elements

938154
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
this is why apple defines delegate methods like viewdidappear viewwillappear otherwise we would not need them as we would know precisely when these events occur

938163
value	field
are you trying to just search for a particular value in field or asking for a full blown query designer

938164
command-line	cmd
it does not call the standard php cmd that you access through the cmd-line

938165
onmouseover	mouseover
the requirement is that i need img1 on mouseover and img2 on mouseout which is working fine but on click i need the div to be opened and img2 get frozen and in again click div disappears and onmouseover and onmouseout states working

938177
mootools	extjs
mootools jq extjs have their own growl notification projects

938184
emacs	vim
in practice i ve found that to be a pain in linux more less harder to grep emacs vim and in windows notepad i have to go through menus to enable auto-wrap for example

938199
cherrypy	django
i ve personally never used cherrypy so i don t know precisely what s being installed and how it s used but i ve done this same thing with django without a hitch

938204
database-design	denormalization
this ultimately speeds up the querying process and is sound reasoning for denormalization of portions of a database-design

938227
google-chrome	firefox
while it works just fine in firefox google-chrome safari and opera

938247
selected	textbox
then run and select items in the gridview and the textbox should automagically be updated with the selected details

938263
virtual-machine	vmware
the solution will normally use to test the application which need rely on these kind of requirements is vmware or equivelant virtual-machine software vitrual box etc.

938286
nsmutablearray	nsarray
if you really want to see this type of functionality i think you should follow the nsarray nsmutablearray design pattern

938295
contains	set
one scripting functoid inline xslt call templates with no input or output contains a variables which selected attributes points at the templates with the node set to calculate

938310
command-prompt	cmd
in windows you can do this using the set cmd in a cmd-prompt

938321
windows-live	hotmail
live mail hotmail they go for your option b and support microsoft outlook using csv outlook express using csv windows contacts windows-live hotmail yahoo

938321
hotmail	gmail
facebook they let you type in your email address and if they know it yahoo gmail hotmail etc they will ask you for your password and retrieve your contacts automatically

938322
contains	elements
i have re-written what you originally posted and it captures the following elementss contains within an elements

938326
subtract	add
semaphore at the very simplest is just a counter you can add and subtract from with a single atomic operation

938328
selected	button
are the controls i have to selected the date now when i press the ok button i handle the data including the date

938355
associations	model
hasandbelongstomany between two model is in reality shorthand for three model associated through both a hasmany and a belongsto associations

938361
authentication	impersonation
my asp.net site is using integrated authentication with impersonation turned off

938383
highlight	selected
when i make a selection single mode listbox_items screen is highlight the row selected but event selectedindexchanged is not triggers

938403
keyboard	mouse
losing keyboard focus to flash basically removes my browser s functionality until i use the mouse to click elsewhere i use mozilla firefox

938403
keyboard	mouse
normal browser shortcuts are rendered useless by having to use the mouse to return keyboard focus to the browser

938408
nsstring	nsdata
now within this methods i pass the nsdata object into the following command to get a nsstring representation of the data received

938412
web-applications	webserver
i m maintaining webserver software on which users can deploy web-applications

938412
web-applications	webserver
web-applications run as separate processes the webserver launches a web application process forwards the http request to the web application and forwards the web application s response back to the http client

938426
constructor	object
in python if code in your constructor fails the object ends up not being defined

938427
logout	login
user should be redirected to the login page after registration and after logout

938427
authentication	logout
in the case of registration the user is not authentication and in the case of logout since the session changes this system cannot be used

938427
logout	login
add to that the built in login and logout functions from django.contrib.auth.views return a httpresponseredirect which make it impossible to add another variables to the templates

938449
action-filter	controller
and then add an action-filter like this that you could apply to all requests via a base controller object as you mentioned

938450
constructor	private
integration of the two add a factory method to do both phases and make the constructor protected private to prevent instantation outside the factory method

938453
constructor	object
if the code is needed to properly construct the object there reallyb is no alternative although you can abstract the code into subfunctions or better into the constructor of subobjects

938456
netbeans-platform	netbeans
ireport based on the netbeans-platform works as standalone application just like the classic one even if it can be installed and used as netbeans plugin too

938465
value	field
i m dynamically sending the field value to mysql when a blur event occurs

938465
value	field
however when this field is inserted it doesn t recognise and the blur event isn t picking up when any value has been entered on the new fields

938465
document-ready	.when
how do i get the mysql updates jquery code to recognise .when the extra form fields are made visible after the document-ready initialisation has already been completed

938487
http-status-codes	http-status
http-status-codes are fine for other uses as well but take care to use them only for http-status not application status

938487
json	xml
for application status you should consider using a standard json object or soap or xml or whatever format you are using

938490
conditional	operators
yes - it s the conditional operators and the syntax is exactly as you ve written it

938493
arguments	default
one common and idiomatic solution to this problem is to capture the value of m at the time that the lambda is created by using it as the default arguments of an optional parameter

938495
conditional	operators
javascript has the conditional operators so it s perfectly legitimate to do

938528
document	element
i borrow this idea after understanding who most of the javascript frameworks work but most of them work on a div element rather that just to the document it self

938542
feedback	account
what i would like to do is provide the user the option to give feedback on a programme which can then be taken into account during the generation of any subsequent programmes

938564
sql-server	oracle
we had to test against different databases of course and i needed to write an extension to handle like queries appropriately but then it ran against sql-server oracle and hsqldb for testing with no issues

938576
show	next
when i enter particular records id like 15 it should show that details of 15 and if i click next it show next records id..etc

938580
contains	elements
what is odd is that when i debugging i can see that the splist is correctly initialized and contains the elements of my list

938590
children	nodes
current i have a nodes with two children left and right then during travel if some condition in this example intersect the children are visited

938592
data-access	nhibernate
it is simply a lot more efficient to use for instance nhibernate my orm of choice for creating using and maintaining the data-access layer

938595
document	editing
after filling out or editing the data he then can press continue which brings him to the review page where he can decide to really create or update the document or go back and change something

938649
put	get
if you don t have an upper boundary for the total size use pool on a rope - when the big chunk of memory runs out get a new one and put these chunks in a list

938657
gestures	onfling
watch in awe as your overridden methods are hit both the onclick view v of the activity and the onfling of the gestures listener

938670
pointers	stack
since alloca allocations are cummulative i suggest you do a first alloca to store the this pointers thus becoming the base of stack keep track of how many elements your stack can hold and allocate only the size needed

938677
constructor	object
in c++ the task of a constructor is to construct an object

938677
constructor	object
constructor fails the object ends

938702
linked-list	arrays
try to work on an arrayslist or even an arrays so the memory you re accessing is contiguous instead of potentially fragmented the way it might be with a linked-list

938704
primitive	int
primitive non-nullable int

938707
selected	button
if a user enters or selected some values in the form s controls performs a postback and then presses the browser s back button or does a javascript history.back you are viewing the page as it was before the postback took place

938738
fadein	show
you can animate it after the fadein completes using the callback as show below

938745
value	field
my bad the field year didnâ t have a value mistake in my code

938757
constructor	object
the constructor is guaranteed to be run only by one thread you cannot contruct twice but you must warrant that no thread access the object before it is fully constructed

938757
constructor	object
usually when you talk about constructor of a singleton you are in fact talking about the static method that creates the object but not the real constructor

938766
contains	elements
this in your example is not a dom elements that contains any subelementss of class feedback-selected so the find function can t find them

938795
credentials	ntlm
for example if i perform a head request to your web service and one of the http headers in its response is www-authenticate ntlm then the credentials stored in defaultcredentials would be encrypted using ntlm and then sent up with the full get post put whatever

938795
webserver	security
however if your webserver replies with www-authenticate basic for a particular resource which would involve sending the creds in clear text encoded note not encrypted as base64 you ll get an argumentexception as it s considered a security exception to send your account s credentials over basic auth

938795
credentials	ntlm
as long as your webserver only requests ntlm for your web service you can be certain that any sensible client won t send credentials in clear text

938795
credentials	ntlm
using the .net classes in the ..net framework you can be sure that if you use defaultcredentials and don t manually inject a basic auth header yourself your credentials will be sent encrypted using ntlm

938795
credentials	account
if it s a client application running under a user s account the credentials will be that user s

938795
credentials	account
if it s an asp.net application that s communicating with your web service it will use the credentials for the account that the app pool is running under by default this is network_service

938819
pointers	stack
the function alloca allocates a chunk of memory from stack stack size is increased by moving stack pointers

938826
keyboard	mouse
i am a big fan of shortcuts in vs2008 it can save a lot of time and keep your fingers on the keyboard instead of the mouse

938828
semantic-web	ontology
i m working on a semantic-web application in which assembly of an ontology is beeing used

938840
contains	any
you can terminate any function type with end but doing so is not required unless the m-file contains a nested function

938859
double	int
double tjd int ipl int32 iflag

938884
idisposable	ienumerator
the non-generic ienumerator doesn t extend idisposable but the c# compiler still generates code to call dispose conditional

938897
directory	folder
at the moment i m getting a list of directory by using my.computer.filesystem.getdirectory however this obviously fails when the folder is password protected

938898
extends	final
and i wish to extends this configuration and add a new item to the listeners arrays property such that the final configuration is effectively

938898
implements	extends
i wish to implements my configuration using the decorator pattern such that i can build my containers and then extends it as needed for different scenarios

938903
show	next
also i want to be able to track the positioning of the on-screen notifications so that if the next check finds more to show it knows where the last currently visible one is and the new ones are show below the others

938909
google-chrome	firefox
when google-chrome or firefox is used on this page

938915
value	field
my bad the field year didnâ t have a value mistake in my code

938916
exception-handling	try-catch
code that is littered with try-catch blocks is difficult to read and means that your exception-handling code is not contained in one place for ease of maintenance

938937
player	movie
in flashdevelop in project properties... change test movie to play in external player

938949
contains	any
you could perhaps say that namespaces are always public so they are exposed to potential clients even though they may not contains any public types

938987
value	field
i wish to get a list of all strings that are used in a .net assembly including the â œstaticâ value that local variables are set to parameters passed to methods field at set to etc

938989
itemtemplate	itemscontrol
i have a scrollviewer and inside it an itemscontrol and within itemtemplate i have a usercontrol

938996
detect	move
i suppose a hack would be to override the minimize button and move the form off screen then detect the form becoming active again and moving it back to the old location

938999
realloc	free
would be fine of course you need realloc free also to be setup as appropiate

938999
realloc	malloc
if you want to get fancy make free realloc auto-detect which heap handle on it s own by evaluating the address of the pointers or even adding some logic to allow malloc to identify which heap to use based on it s thread id and building a heierarchy of per-thread heaps and shared global heap s pools

939023
filtering	sorting
no filtering sorting and page 1 - this will help in a small way for performance

939023
filtering	sorting
for navigation back to the list you may need a new small controller which accepts simply the listresult.key hash value and redirects re-creates the state of the list view paging filtering and sorting included from the lookup in the repo

939023
controller	routes
and extend the life of routes that are continuously being used by adding time to the stamp of a listresult item when it s requested via the new controller

939024
linux	unix
as we could see the problem of finding the location of running executable is quite tricky and platform-specific in linux and unix

939029
updating	updates
any kind of modularization is good since it makes updating the software easier you do not have to updates the whole program binary if a bug is fixed in the program

939066
javascript	dom
it is basically a client side javascript framework which helps you in manipulating the dom and many other functions

939108
duplicates	contains
note that the duplicates entries are counted each time tally would contains

939109
document	element
do i have to iterate over every element on the document get the font-size calculate a new size and set it back

939117
subclassing	base-class
it s a long time since i ve done this so i can t remember off hand whether you ll be able to access pdfsettings from the subclassing or if you ll have to cast the variables to the base-class first

939120
push	pull
this is the hg-git plugins for mercurial adding the ability to push to and pull from a git server repository from hg

939120
version-control	git
with the robust backend data stores in both mercurial and git i think the line between these two competing version-control systems will become quite blurred in the near future

939148
compatibility	platform
and it will be a darned site quicker as well at the cost of cross platform compatibility

939150
base-class	inherited
the pdfsettings property would be defined in your base printjob class and each of the specific print job classes would inherited from that base-class

939155
audio	ogg
converting the ogg file to pcm should be possible in managed code but because there is no native support for audio in .net you really have 3 options

939155
audio	ogg
once you have your pcm data using a ogg c lib or managed code something like this of course there are licencing issues with mp3 you will need a way to play it unfortunatly .net does not provide any direct assess to your sound card or methods to play streaming audio

939186
double-quotes	single-quotes
it has something to do with using single-quotes instead of double-quotes

939189
ddms	adb
you can examine your log via adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse

939193
actionscript	mxml
i mean for example if i have my actionscript and mxml files and compile them to a swf can i get the source back out of the swf file

939194
attributes	properties
-g variables seems to be equivalent to eclipse - project properties - java compiler - add variables attributes to generated class files

939200
double-quotes	single-quotes
remember strings with double-quotes parsing variables in the string strings with single-quotes do not

939202
selected	cells
it depends on whether or not you want to allow people to selected cells or not

939206
jquery	.post
as for your specific example i haven t used the .post function in jquery but a quick scan of the documentation suggests the call back should be a function pointer with the following signature

939218
json	xml
some transfer the data in the form of xml other just plain text others use json

939219
json	xml
where you might hear competition is between xml and json json having the advantage of being typically lighter and in native javascript already xml having the advantage of portability and toolsets

939222
perl	c++
json is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the c-family of languages including c c++ c# java javascript perl python and many others

939227
nsstring	nsdata
you don t have to retain the nsdata arrays since its content will be converted copied into the new nsstring object

939237
push	pull
to do this kind of thing i would prefer to use message queue and a consistent storage engine like a database with processing clients that pull work from the queue perform the job and push results to another queue with jobs not being executed in some timeframe made available for others to process

939241
shell	bash
assuming you re using the bash shell the following can be helpful when composing long command lines

939241
command-line	cmd
once finished save the cmd-line and bash will run the cmd

939263
hide	show
hide each page as a tab so they are actually there but just not show

939266
http	ssl
the service is located on a http address ssl

939270
hide	show
i m currently using the title attributes of my a tag to show and hide images that correspond with this tag

939273
json	xml
that data can be in any sort of format but most commonly xml html and yes json

939273
json	csv
so as already mentioned json is a data format much like xml or csv just with a different set of formatting rules

939305
checkbox	button
the exact scenario when this happens is a checkbox is ticked against each item the button is clicked and the onclick mthod processes this item and the checkbox is cleared

939323
webforms	asp.net
i have an asp.net webforms app that connects to a web service all the functionality is on one page that has lots of difference states and i use a multi view to display the correct html depending on the current state

939323
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have to stick with the webforms platform so i can t move to asp.net-mvc

939328
exception-handling	try-catch
debugging over those lines or separating the code into two try-catch blocks would help you narrow down which one if the exception-handling does not have any information

939351
nsscanner	nsstring
whenever you are looking for things in a nsstring try using nsscanner first

939388
mousemove	mouseover
things like losing focus mouseover mousemove etc

939407
ruby-on-rails	django
ruby-on-rails was absolutely shot-down as a toy struts is just too huge for the apps we do django s name makes these old folks nervous oil gas industry but finally finally microsoft has come out with mvc 1.0

939418
memcached	ncache
to answer your question i have heard excellent things about ncache and memcached

939423
webforms	asp.net
should i pursue asp.net webforms or asp.net mvc

939423
webforms	asp.net
how to decide which is right webforms or mvc when doing asp.net

939423
webforms	asp.net
biggest advantage to using asp.net mvc vs webforms

939423
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc versus webforms

939451
attributes	properties
to preserve names in the class file for debugging purposes try project properties java compiler then add variables attributes to generated class files see eclipse help

939461
deployment	install
the bottomline for the powers to be is that you can create a build in a single step simplifying deployment creating install patches etc

939463
ruby-on-rails	django
ruby-on-rails and django both follow the model view controller mvc pattern so sounds like you will just be creating a load of work for yourself

939465
ruby-on-rails	django
when looking at ruby-on-rails or django and legacy database integration what does legacy database really mean

939473
data-access	ado.net
everyone else on the team has been stuck in 1.1 2.0 land for the past 3 years using hand cut ado.net sqlhelper code for the data-access layer

939487
innodb	myisam
it s also harder to backup innodb tables than myisam because with the latter if the table is flushed you can just copy the files but the former has issues

939513
associations	model
the table for each would be the same title body tags published_at but each model might have different associations or different statuses or a different workflow so each has custom code in their own class

939516
contains	set
you could partition the graph into one upper set u contains all your target roots r and such that if x in u then all parents of x are in u

939544
contains	any
corollary question so there s no way to construct a struct literal contains any empty cell arrays

939554
json	xml
i prefer to request json data rather than xml or html

939566
google-chrome	safari
the certificate appears valid when i view it in iss and it works fine for ie safari and google-chrome

939567
pointers	stack
i would like to be able to determine if a pointers is on stack or not at runtime for a number of reasons

939567
pointers	stack
in microsft c vc 6 7 8 is there a way to bounds check a pointers to see if it in on stack or not

939573
compatibility	legacy
legacy system -- a computer system or application program which continues to be used because of the cost of replacing or redesigning it and often despite its poor competitiveness and compatibility with modern equivalents

939573
compatibility	legacy
if legacy software only runs on antiquated hardware the cost of maintaining this may eventually outweigh the cost of replacing both the software and hardware unless some form of emulation or backward compatibility allows the software to run on new hardware

939593
windows-server	windows
you do not need any third-party applications and you need at minimum one windows-server installation and one windows client xp vista 7 installation

939603
value	field
note if any of the value field is

939611
expression	evaluation
i guess what is happening is the optimizer is not using the subquery as a shortcut and instead is evaluation the mid expression before the search conditions from sequence table

939616
triggers	insert
triggers must alawys account for multiple record insert updates or deletes

939621
http	ssl
4 i think that s the ssl required error that redirects to http

939622
32-bit	64bit
anyone has a clue why the same line compiles fine for 32-bit but fails for 64bit with such a high level error

939637
getter	setter
you can prevent changes to the reference by using a private or internal setter but you cannot prevent changes to the object itself if it s exposed by a getter

939639
put	get
you can put that into the get part of the url such as yourpage.jsp

939640
value	field
if you pass empty cell arrayss as field value to struct it assumes you want an empty structure arrays with the given field names

939640
value	field
to pass an empty cell arrays as an actual field value you would do the following

939640
any	set
incidentally any time you want to set a field value to a cell arrays using struct requires that you encompass it in another cell arrays

939640
contains	elements
for example this creates a single structure elements with fields that contains a cell arrays and a vector

939645
configuration	logging
to use a custom logging handler with file configuration i had to do the following

939646
pointers	stack
create a variables on stack in a function isonstack void pointers

939672
postback	ajax
sessions - this will need you to postback the state information back to the server via ajax as the client updates the page

939680
constructor	object
if unsure copy the object which requires a copy constructor and saves you from trying to copy uncopyable objects

939693
oracle	mysql
mysql skills are rather limited and since i find myself working with a db oracle a lot lately i would like to get beyond the basic select statements

939693
filtering	grouping
i want to write queries that do things like get data from multiple tables sum quantities compare dates grouping filtering etc

939703
scientific-notation	digits
it works great for anything under 7 digits but if the number is 7 digits it turns it into scientific-notation or what ever they call that

939705
event-listener	listener
you can remove an event-listener but you have to pass the exact listener returned when you added one

939715
children	nodes
then i want to perform aggregates eg.combine districts data at state level so obtain all the children for a nodes easily - this is the second criteria

939738
nsmutablestring	nsstring
as i think you re overwriting an nsmutablestring pointers with an nsstring which might cause a memory leak

939741
pointers	stack
isonstack needs to create its own local variables and check if the pointers passed is between stack base and the address in the current stack frame

939752
fwrite	fclose
if you have php5 you can use file_put_contents as the inverse operation of file_get_contents and avoid the whole fopen fwrite fclose

939752
fwrite	fclose
that is fine for small posts but if the filesizes tend into megabytes it would be better do to it entirely with fopen fread fwrite fclose so your memory usage will never exceed for example 8kb

939769
hide	show
i would say the best way if you absolutly can not use the flash cs4 would be to have a series of loader objects and the hide and show them on every in sequence

939770
memcheck	valgrind
also run valgrind s memcheck and see what that says

939790
stream	send
hey i m currently trying to send an image file to a webserver using a web request a memory stream and an image object

939809
deployment	install
we ve had some trouble with our desktop deployment as the default install will only push for the current user as opposed to the local machine but we ve fixed that with a post-install registry hack

939831
procedure	records
the stored procedure then returns these records to the order processor to be acted upon

939834
json	xml
being new to ajax i would like to understand which data exchange format - json or xml - would be easier to work with while doing ajax in ruby-on-rails

939838
bullet	physx
havok ode newton aka oxnewton bullet physx and raw build-in physics in some 3d engines

939838
physx	gpu
why should i use anything but nvidia physx if i can make use of its amazing performance if i need it due to gpu processing

939845
user-interface	look-and-feel
it s a suser-interfacete of asp.net controls which mimic the native look-and-feel of iphone user-interface elements

939851
base-class	inherited
the base-class for filestream system.io.stream implements idisposable filestream just inherited it

939853
children	nodes
i have a nodes which has two children an html text and an html element

939858
updating	updates
i m trying to implement a real-time updating search bar which updatess a treeview when search phrase changes however i don t quite manage to get it to updates the way i want

939871
updating	updates
an alternative would be to narrow down the rows you updates - for example by only updating the most recent the one with the highest id or using a combinations of fields that make the record unique

939874
interpolation	splines
in particular i need a way to represent a curve splines that passes through a set of known 3d points and a way of finding other points on the curve splines by subdivision interpolation

939887
stderr	stdout
it s worth knowing the difference between stdin stdout and stderr - they all have their uses

939887
stderr	stdout
in particular stdout should be used for normal program output whereas stderr should be reserved only for error messages abnormal program execution

939901
pointers	stack
there may be instructions which facilitate the declaration of a variables such as updating stack pointers to make space for a variables

939903
constructor	object
to use reflection and create a object by invoking the corresponding constructor i wrote code as follows

939911
json	xml
prototype is agnostic regarding json or xml because its ajax.request object automatically evaluates either response format

939911
json	xml
in addition controllers in ruby-on-rails will handle json or xml equally well using the respond_to method and activerecord models automatically include both to_json and to_xml methods

939914
hide	show
i want to use an image of a calendar to show hide the jquery datepicker

939920
arrays	map
the map is supposed to be an arrays of unsigned 32 bit integers

939920
arrays	map
declare map as an arrays of integers

939920
pixels	line
so if the image width is 55 for example you set 32 pixels with map 0 then set 23 pixels with map 1 then begin with the next line of the image the one next to the bottom at the first bit of map 2

939943
protected	public
the constructor is protected - if you make it public or use getdeclaredconstructor instead of getconstructor it should work

939944
log4net	nlog
there are some areas where additional functionality is useful or sometimes the functionality exists but is not well documented however this does not mean that the entire logging framework which is designed to be extensible should be thrown away and completely replaced like some popular alternatives nlog log4net common.logging and even entlib logging

939944
logging	trace
you might also want to consider separate trace sources for activity tracing vs general other logging as it can make it a bit easier to configure filtering exactly how you want them

939944
contains	set
usually this is a database-table or an application log file and contains structured data a set of fields

939944
logging	trace
in generally you should co-ordinate logging of activities across different systems write to your application log at the same time as you increase your performance counter and log to your trace system

939944
debugging	trace
3 debugging trace - text file or maybe xml or database

939944
debugging	trace
whilst an application log may have fields for to from amount etc. verbose debugging trace may be whatever a programmer puts in checking values x value y false or random comments markers like done it trying again

939944
put	get
one important practice is to make sure things you put in application log files or the windows event log also get logged to the trace system with the same details timestamp

939946
cross-domain	xss
i tried to do cross-domain referencing xss and it worked with one caveat - user gets a security warning this page is trying to access information that is not under its control

939950
hide	show
disable or even hide the link in the onclick handler and then reenable or show it when you get a response

939951
attr	src
i attr src arguments i

939967
32-bit	64bit
this is running on a x64 server so i can t use any of the standard debugging diagnostic tools because even though there is a 64bit version of it it only attaches to iis running in 32-bit mode

939976
svnadmin	dump
you can create a dump file using svnadmin dump then import to a new repository with svnadmin load

939984
svnadmin	dump
repository maintenance - migrating repository data elsewhere has this note about using svnadmin dump as of versioning 1.7

939989
g++	gcc
for example i know that invoking gcc through the name g++ instead of gcc causes gcc to behave differently it treats .c files as c++ source and links-in the c++ standard library

939990
svnadmin	dump
with history you would need to use the svnadmin dump

939995
contains	elements
the main thread is probably not guarenteed to be called main though - might be better to check for a stack trace elements that contains main

940002
value	field
i want to write a methods that will accept the type of one of these static classes and a string value and determine whether the value is one of the static field values

940002
value	field
what i can t figure out is how to get the static field value without an instance

940005
session-cookies	cookies
for session-cookies cookies without an expiry value that live as long as the browser is open this is probably an in-memory data structure

940017
forms-authentication	credentials
when this feature is turned on for say forms-authentication and the user emails his or her url to some other user the second user will automatically log on to the server with the credentials of the first user

940045
worksheet	excel
i have a web page which links to an excel 2007 worksheet

940103
pointers	stack
with a local buffer the space is allocated by the compiler simply by moving stack pointers the right number of bytes

940120
setinterval	settimeout
how is the value returned from setinterval and settimeout the ones used to clear the timers calculated

malloc	free
if you have done any kind of study in algorithmic efficiency big o notation and the like you d know or be able to work out that most free store implementations can make no guarantees on the lower or even upper bounds of the algorithim iterations that will be executed to find an available block in the free store to satisfy the new malloc request

940132
python	c++
i am new to c++ python mixed language programming and do not have much idea about python c api

940132
python	c++
i just started using boost.python to wrap a c++ library for python

940135
setinterval	settimeout
in firefox itâ s just integer incrementing on each call of settimeout or setinterval

940148
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval are from

940155
value	field
set name value field etc.

940156
click	mouse

940157
internet-explorer	firefox
this works well in both internet-explorer 6+ and firefox 3+

940189
triggers	insert
i have a triggers that gets insert and updates to a view

940189
triggers	insert
for the first loop name id and for the second it will be col2 which was not insert so the value of value should be null and i continue to loop through the possible column names until i finish and the triggers is processed

940189
triggers	insert
when using integration service when the updating is going on any insert or updates to the view will call the triggers

940192
subtract	add
the idea i use in this is to extend the hours a day have from 24h to 27h +3 but only where cardeventtime is less or equal to 03 00 00 24h i add 24h and to cardeventdate subtract 1d

940194
default-value	default
i ve tried setting a default-value at a fraction of a second in to see if there is a problem where the values of the properties i m animation aren t default as expected

940195
jquery	dojo
i m just starting a project that will have a browser based web application using php and possibly an ajax framework like dojo or jquery that is presented to the user from within a kiosk unit

940198

specifically i m displaying the most recent blogs from the wordpress rss feed on the home page

940224
firefox	opera
tested this under opera 9 safari 3 firefox 3 and ie 7

940224
setinterval	settimeout
all returned integer value starting at 1 and then incrementing by 1 for each call to settimeout and setinterval

940238
mbunit	nunit
for example i was previously using mbunit but now i use nunit

940244
firefox	safari
you could use css 3 border-radius property which will work on firefox and safari

940254
websphere	ibm
on windows the jar is located in the plugins directory for me this is c program files ibm websphere appserver plugins

940258
value	field
certain form fillers will detect the field using the names i ve used and try to fill them automatically by setting the value to whatever the user has previously used for similarly named field

940261
python	ruby
i don t know about ruby but the standard for python is py2exe to create windows binaries

940317
json	xml
json xml as data feeds

940322
checkbox	button
every form element needs to have an unique name except multiple checkbox and button that allow you to choose one multiple options for one data field

940324
host	root
you have to know what you are doing and never host any of the user content under the root domain

940378
jqmodal	jquery
other options would be using the jquery ui plugin or jqmodal depending on your needs

940388
contains	set
i don t have xcode in front of me but i think if you right option click on the file in your resources listing to get at the preferences for the file you can set it to be relative to the project contains directory etc

940396
credentials	security
for this particular application the credentials were passed as part of the datacontract so we had basichttpbinding security mode none

940416
margins	padding
i changed ul.validation-summary-errors to zero out the margins and padding and removed the width

940419
constructor	object
the datacontext object should have a constructor that takes a connection string as a parameter

940449
database-replication	database-mirroring
we re upgrading our sql servers from 2000 to 2005 and we will probably use either database-replication or database-mirroring

940464
bug-tracking	trac
trac has the tightest subversion integration and work really nicely for both bug-tracking and project-management

940464
continuous-integration	teamcity
teamcity is a continuous-integration and build server that connects well to subversion and a host of other things

940471
put	get
this is for a high precision tool so we re willing to put in a lot of effort to get what we need

940479
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome both give me this problem

940480
webserver	host
if a webserver or browser treats the host header as case-sensitive that s a bug

940508
hide	show
how would make a status item when the actually button is click in the menu bar not in a drop down menu show or hide a windows

940511
strong-typing	types
strong-typing is your friend here since it allows you to track types and usages in a much better fashion than weak typing

940523
parentheses	operators
uses of can usually be eliminated by adding parentheses unless the operators is used in a section

940532
standard-library	boost
add in some boost stuff for what are essentially standard-library extensions as well

940536
boost	stl
c++ boost stl

940544
centering	fixed
the salient part of such a control would be a 9 part grid in which 4 parts were of fixed size the corners two parts had fixed height and variables widths centering top and centering bottom two parts had fixed widths and variables height left centering and right centering and the final part had variables height and width the middle

940544
margins	padding
where slice is a property of type system.windows.size so that you can use it like the margins padding etc

940545
standard-library	boost
i leave out boost for two reasons 1 i don t consider it required by newbs and 2 much of it is planned to be rolled into the standard-library once c++0x replaces the old standard

940557
linux	unix
if it s a unix linux system and you care about hidden files which will be missed by you need to do

940561
bug-tracking	trac
trac has the tightest subversion integration and work really nicely for both bug-tracking and project-management

940563
python	perl
i am writing a python extension to provide access to solaris kstat data in the same spirit as the shipping perl library sun solaris kstat and i have a question about conditionally returning a list or a single object

940570
webforms	asp.net
those are two critical chunks of data that asp.net webforms needs to be able to properly propogate a full postback

940573
debugging	trace
finally if you want to be really lazy you can use a single static method to do all your debugging output one that just delegates to system.out.println and add a couple lines to get a stack trace grab only the calling line method and print it out before the debugging statement giving you a poor-man s logging utility

940601
click	mouse
you ll implement code in your custom view to react to mouse click by putting up a windows

940604
directory	folder
i created wsp solution added my class file and changed the output directory to the bin folder

940605
aggregate	grouping
if your rowcount is correct then your sums grouping aggregate will all be correct

940611
value	field
i am wondering if it is possible to access fields from the returned rows using some sort of prefix notation see example above instead of having to use the ordinal positioning to access a value in the row in the case where both tables contains overlapping field names

940615
postgresql	mysql
sqlserver probably has an equivalent of the explain plan statement that oracle postgresql and mysql all support in one form or another

940631
job-queue	queue
a job-queue with multiple workers system not sure of the correct terminology - message queue

940631
haskell	erlang
also unlike the reasons say haskell or erlang are so concurrent parallelisable

940631
shell	bash
it s entirely language-agnostic - you can trivially implement such a system in c or python or any other language even using shell scripting whereas i doubt bash will get software transactional memory or join-calculus anytime soon

940665
put	get
in other words if i put a bunch of stuff into google base if any of it shows up in a regular google search is there a way for me to control what parameters get passed to the landing page and thus what search is performed on the landing page or is that out of my control

940691
configuration	environment
if the permituserenvironment option is set in the sshd configuration you can add your path setting to .ssh environment

940709
executable	jar
instead of looking for this java_swt i instead changed my bash executable the application bundle launches to references my jar file directly

940709
shell	bash
the bash shell is pretty basic and solves the threading problem between swt and mac with the -xstartonfirstthread call

940709
shell	bash
here is the bash shell the pound sign isnt displayed in the first line before the

940725
executable	jar
i have the application bundle refernce my jar file directly using a bash script as the executable called by the info.plist file

940782
python	c++
if you need to keep that interface you have to write a wrapper function that takes a list from python does the proper conversion and calls your orginal c++ function

940782
boost	stl
please note that boost python offers some built-in mechanism to convert python containers to stl compatible containers

940787
for-loop	arrays
when ever you need to you could then iterate over the arrays in a for-loop looking for the first item with a value

940797
cassini	iis
i haven t had any trouble with cassini but you might try iis just for grins

940804
python	java
in java the flexibility provided by a dependency injection framework is vital while in python it usually results in unneeded complexity

940818
web-services	api
jsr 262 defines a connector for the jmx remote api that uses web-services to make jmx instrumentation available remotely

940825
any	set
now when i set the custom itemrenderer s horizontal and vertical scrollbar policies to off i get the vertical scrolling on the datagrid that i want the individual cells stretch to accommodate the full height of the contents but i don t get any horizontal-scrolling

940844
superclass	inherited
is there such a methods like class.getmethodss which only give us the class s methodss without those which are inherited from its superclass

940851
javascript	dom
perhaps i m misunderstanding but if the embedded component can signal a dom event you can catch it with javascript and replace some splash image with the actual loaded player

940876
contains	any
the line the userservice needs the usergateway means that one of the functions contains a variables or call that needs the usergateway not necessarily that the userservice has any intrinsic need for it

940877
methods	extend
should i extend and rename the old methods and wrap it into a new one like

940877
arguments	default
or should i declare a default arguments in the header file like

940892
configuration	environment
i want assests_cache_dir to default to cache but be able to set in an environment configuration file

940896
c++	lua
one example is a toy factorial program in c++ and lua

940901
value	field
essentially it means that it will attempt to convert any field into those value if possible instead of leaving them as a string

940907
nested	order
as far as i know in order for the browser to render the page the div must have been filled with x|d html which would mean that the source of the page after being rendered is still just nested markup so theoretically there should be a final version of the page source

940929
radio-button	selected
on selected first radio-button a textbox will be shown which allows to enter date values

940929
radio-button	selected
on selected the second radio-button the textbox gets hidden

940929
radio-button	selected
for the first time when i selected first radio-button and entered date and clicked next to navigate to next page and came back to this page again and clicked second radio-button and clicked next to continue and again i came back to this page and without changing any option click continue its not allowing to navigate and shows an error

940935
c++	lua
try to implement a lua table in c c++ you ll see the strength of lua right there

940935
c++	lua
c++ stl may help but it is going to be a lot more verbose than lua

940972
methodology	waterfall
if some companies have a waterfall methodology that works well for them why should they switching to agile

940980
strcmp	printf
for c string.h for functions like strcpy strcmp memcpy and the like and stdio.h for printf and friends

940981
any	set
the translation of a dal.transactioncode to bal.transactioncode will most likely not work in any operation where you are trying to set equality

940982
python	c++
there are several reasons why one might wish to extend python in c or c++ such as

940982
python	c++
exposing a c++ class library to python

940982
python	c++
embedding python inside a c c++ application

940998
hide	show
show hide nodes

941005
contains	any
the api contains any shared data types entities enumerations service interfaces etc

941015
controllers	routes
that s how i d handle it - hardcode your routes to your controllers in routes.php then have a matchall route that will work for your promo codes

941015
controllers	routes
this allows you to keep legacy urls as well as use a lot of the standard cake stuff you probably will just have to explicitly state each of your controllers routes not such a chore... additionally it will let you do some cool stuff with 404 errors -- you can put some logic in there to try and figure out where they were trying to go so you can superpower your 404 s

941027
put	get
but it can also be used to put and delete data as well as get header information etc

941041
interpreter	runtime
you will gain a large performance boost using c from python assuming your code is well written etc because python is interpreter at runtime whereas c is compiled beforehand

941046
put	get
is some of the articles are too long and get truncated when i put them into my mssql database

941052
c++	lua
for an example of where lua fits better then c++ look at distributing scripts

941052
c++	lua
unlike c++ though lua doesn t have to be compiled and can be restricted

941054
web-config	app-config
there s alot of configuration to do in the app-config web-config file just to make it work

941054
configuration	environment
you can use the configuration file to change how logging works depending on the environment log exceptions for production log everything for dev etc.

941069
contains	any
collections may contains almost any

941092
lightbox	thickbox
you should change from using lightbox to thickbox looks like you might be experimenting with it in your code

941092
lightbox	thickbox
lightbox is for images only even though you ve made it work its pretty ugly putting all that in the title tag and pretty wrong thickbox will let you include your form

941097
any	set
you can subscribe any kind of result set that means any kind of query as long as it conforms to the restrictions of the supported statements

941110
quirks-mode	doctype
that may cause ie7 to render in quirks-mode as if a doctype was not there at all according to this page

941113
javascript	dom
is there an event in jquery javascript or the dom in general that i can subscribe to that will notify me when an element become visible or invisible display none

941142
versioning	upgrade
instead of making a stateful scripting that always checks the current state and acts based on that state deploy via a series of stateless scriptinging that upgrade from well known versioning

941148
managed-code	unmanaged
write some code capable of parsing the dll for the manifest indicating which assemblies are referenced this need not be managed-code - the unmanaged introspection api microsoft provides may even do this for you and the dll format specification is both public and unlikely to radically change in the near future

941173
installation	building
i want to building a suggestion list where that when i enter php it knows to suggest web development and if i enter data recovery or software installation it suggests information technology.

941188
instrumentation	profiling
for more general profiling like object allocation you want to use instrumentation which is also part of apple s developer tools suite

941198
configuration	logging
i use the apache commons logging api with a log4j configuration file the log4j configuration file is simple easy for a novice to understand and has numerous examples to work from

941198
configuration	logging
i prefer using the commons logging api because its agnostic about its configuration file

941236
value	field
getting static field value of a type using reflection

941241
click	mouse
i haven t used this myself -- i ve only ever used an nsstatusitem with a menu attached -- so i don t know when the message is sent when the mouse button is click or when it s released

941287
reflection	runtime
the desktop app now loads this dll at runtime with reflection and then instantiates the object inside it based on a shared dll with an interface definition like this

941292
mouseleave	mouseenter
here s a little code snippet i used with an image map and mouseenter mouseleave events

941294
click	mouse
colorize is a jquery plugins to add background color to alternate table rows highlight a row column on mouse over and colorize a row column when you click your mouse button over it

941294
click	mouse
a repeat mouse click reverts the row to the original background color

941298
thickbox	jquery
it seems that when the for the thickbox control is injected into the dom after the initial load jquery is no longer able to do its magic and intercept the anchor link request

941311
ruby	php
there are also php and ruby versions available there.

941323
dependency-injection	inject
spring for dependency-injection transaction management security and for adding interceptors and for getting the possibility to inject different implementations of interfaces when in unit-test as oppose to deployed on a server

941325
quicksort	heapsort
the canonical example is quicksort which has a worst time of o n 2 while heapsort s is o n logn

941325
quicksort	heapsort
in practice however quicksort is usually faster then heapsort

941325
quicksort	heapsort
each iteration in quicksort is a lot simpler than heapsort

941326
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
what would happen if you call close on a sqlconnection object before you call close on a sqldatareader using that connection

941331
revision	updates
each tsql script will updates the revision number in the database as it applies

941338
shell	bash
btw - i use bash as my default shell

941355
appdata	temp
c windows assembly gac_msil system.web.mvc 1.0.0.0__31bf3856ad364e35 system.web.mvc.dll and in my appdata local temp temporary

941357
any	set
i basically need to be able to exclude a set of objects and the only way i think i can do this is to be able to get a list of objectid from my managed objects arrays and create another expression in my predicate to ensure that any objects returned don t have the same objectid

941359
shell	bash
the c shell has a mechanism for doing arguments to aliases but bash and the korn shell don t because the function mechanism is more flexible and offers the same capability

941386
getter	setter
if i need a constructor i ll add one and the same goes for special getter and setter

941391
fwrite	fclose
file_put_contents in php5 or a combinations of fopen fwrite fclose in php4 should do the job

941425
vb.net	vb6
in either vb6 or vb.net just add the com+ dll to your references and you can call the object in this manner

941439
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
however you should close dispose the sqldatareader also otherwise it will keep a reference to the sqlconnection object keeping them both in memory

941439
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
eventually the finalizer will dispose the sqldatareader object if you don t do it and then the sqlconnection object can also be collected but you have no control over when that happens

941451
export	report
i am having a minor issue playing with my exported crystal report i can generate the reports just fine on our website however when i attempt to export them to word documents i don t quite get a document i can do much with

941460
silverlight	wpf
after all there are all kinds of awesome silverlight wpf demos on the web that look great and really sell the tech

941470
execution	exit
the problem is when i go to exit and try to close or destroy the main frame the frame.close never completes it s execution although it does disappear and the other program refuses to close unless killed with taskmanager

941491
linked-list	tree
similarly many more abstract data structures and algorithms are often directly provided by such high level languages so you don t have to re-invent the wheel and re-implement it if all you need is a standard container think linked-list tree map etc

941491
python	lua
so you can get a fairly good roi when using a fairly abstract scripting language such as lua or even python especially if the corresponding language comes with a good library of core functionality

941494
contains	any
right now those entries don t really contains any explanations but their names look promising

941498
hide	show
i would like to use tabs but i m stuck with .net 2.0 and from what i can gather the only way to hide show tabs are to remove them and re-add them

941498
hide	show
i could make custom controls for each and either have them all loaded and hide show when necessary which i have done in the past on projects or dispose and re-instantiate them.

941506
binary-tree	nodes
if you use an arrays to store your binary-tree you can quickly index any element the children of the nodes at index n are at index n+1 2 and n+1 2-1

941506
any	set
using a bitset to describe the set gives you a fast check for membership but doesn t seem to lend itself to making the problem any easier

941524
click	mouse
the other alternative i can think of would be to try programmatically control the mouse to actually click the button

941545
directory	folder
an easier approach would be to create a solution that contains all the projects you need modify the references between them to use project references change the projects so their output folder all point to the same directory and then setup the project references so that copy local is set to false

941560
boost	stl
regarding c++ the he boost library is the most used library so you should start by looking there if you already know c++ contrary to what i saw in some of the previous answers you must understand that the stl is now part of the standard and so part of the c++ language

941560
platform	gpl
remember that before you invest some time learning a new api you should selected the ones that aren t too recent and are truly free with no strings attached and no platform lockin this include the gpl license since it will limit you to produce gpl code

941569
dialog	pop-up
if i m generating a binary file inside flash player how do i pop-up a save dialog for the file without sending it up the the server first

941581
space	input
it can say that the time or space used by algorithm a grows at a different rate than algorithm b when the input grows

941582
bug-tracking	trac
bug-tracking systems like trac are designed to have one ticket for each problem intrinsics to the program so a ticket is closed by modifying the program

941584
integer	short
the result of any math performed on byte or short types is implicitly cast back to an integer

941593
data-access	nhibernate
nhibernate data-access

941596
function-pointers	member-functions
unless passthis is a static member function what you ve done can t work because regular member-functions can t be passed as a function-pointers the way you are doing it among other things you ve got no this parameter

941603
double	int
i don t know for sure but i assume that int longs and double are given more space because they are pretty large as it is

941603
32-bit	64bit
also they are multiples of 4 which are more efficient for computers to handle due to the width of the internal data bus being 4 bytes or 32-bit 64bit is getting more prevalent now wide

941626
c++	lua
i created a lua module with a very large number of wrapped c++ classes using swig

941626
contains	elements
as though the expression on the right side of the was an object of the same type as the elements contains the data field to be reassigned

941637
dialog	pop-up
the filereference.save methods will pop-up a dialog for the user to choose where to save the file so the filename given is just a suggested filename

941651
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
and my application crushes apparently because of having a uinavigationcontroller in uitabbarcontroller

941654
revision	svn
version of the application as opposed to technical internal version number used by the vcs like revision for svn or sha-1 for git or id for clearcase or...

941668
message	alert
in the latter case it is best to swallow the message and log an error or fire some other alert

941685
spritebatch	xna
in xna when is it appropriate to render your game content using more than one spritebatch

941691
jms	jta
atomikos transactionsessentials is a free open source jta xa with connection pools for jdbc and jms

941696
value	field
i specified above i want to make this browsable in the designer but how do i set those two value as options rather than knowing to specify field single etc

941696
attributes	properties
is there another attributes that i can decorate the properties with to list these options out or do i need to create an enum which works

941701
user-controls	ascx
ascx user-controls

941705
entity-framework	nhibernate
check out nhibernate for a good entity-framework alternative

941706
nspopupbuttoncell	nscell
i have an nspopupbuttoncell inside a custom nscell and i m using

941706
selected	cell
my problem is that although the menu pops up just fine and you can select an item from the menu when an item is selected the cell does not change its selected item to match the chosen one from the menu

941706
selected	cell
however if i comment out the line in copy with zone which copies the cell then it behaves properly as far as selection goes changing to match the selected item although every single row will then have that same selected item

941717
wicket	jsf
for web projects keep a light web container if you have to combined with something like wicket to avoid the complexity of jsp jsf or struts

941750
32-bit	64bit
versions supporting 16-bit real and protected modes 32-bit and 64bit are all supported

941800
any	set
as far as i m aware it s not possible to set any useful properties on the image in a generic uitableviewcell

941809
scala	java
i have been doing mostly java and common lisp in the meantime with a short strides to c flex scala and haskell

941818
any	set
i can t find any on-line documentation on it but it will allow you to essentially apply a set of macros definitions to the code

941821
checkbox	textbox
whenever i try to change the checked attribute or trigger a click call the click function explicitely etc. i the checkbox gets checked but the css is never changed and the textbox is never refreshed with the currently selected element s

941821
selected	checkbox
if i want to selected the checkbox with the tra value with javascript code and make sure it behaves properly how can i achieve this

941825
selected	cells
how do i deselect unselect any selected cells in an nsbrowser

941838
versioning	migrate
in a soa scenario it is much easier because you can keep your old api change the internal integration so that it works with the changed tables and allow consumers to migrate to the new versioning on their own schedule

941845
internet-explorer	firefox
i have event handler javascript code to add a row to the table which works fine under firefox but is completely ignored under internet-explorer

941848
value	field
i need to search a data contract which is also a list with name as the field to search and value as the value of the field

941857
malloc	free
if for some reason unknown to me you need to store your pointers in a void then free it you should use malloc and free

941862
keydown	keyup
it does however detect enter on the keydown and keyup events

941862
keydown	keyup
keyup keydown fire on all keys

941871
environment	building
if you want to be confident your powershell scripting work put as much effort as possible into building a perfect staging environment so as to test all these systems as accurately as possible

941879
contains	set
so either i am in a sick chicken vs egg cycle or i need to set the permissions on the contains directory...but how

quirks-mode	doctype
comments before the doctype are allowed but cause all ie versions to revert to quirks-mode

941900
boost	stl
it wouldn t hurt to know use stl boost though

941905
google-docs	spreadsheet
the google-docs api has an option to export a spreadsheet in any supported format

941907
boost	stl
there it would be more productive to go with stl and specially boost

941911
boost	stl
about libraries first learn about the stl and learn to use boost as a standard stl extension

941927
directory	folder
do a ls -l on the parent directory and see what user and grouping has access to this folder

941945
system.web	.net
you need to add a reference to the system.web assembly look in the .net tab

941946
mac-address	packets
change the mac-address so that there are no packets collisions

941946
hosts-file	hosts
but changing the hosts will still point back to you

941946
hosts-file	hosts
for example you server name was myserver and it was pointed 192.168.1.100 which was the local ip has hosts entry then if you copy the server give it ip 192.168.1.150 and edit the hosts and point myserver to 192.168.1.150 the systemd will still work flawlessly

941951
order	add
i agree with that but i also wanted to add that if you re working with void pointers in order to allocate contiguous arrays or something similar that you can do this with new so that you ll be able to use delete safely with ahem a little of extra work

941960
profiling	trace
it s pretty interesting to watch actually you may want to fire up profiling and trace the lock acquisition release of some simple queries

941978
webforms	asp.net
2 of the devs and the tech lead have worked together before on asp.net webforms project and are confident using that technology

941980
error-handling	try-catch
break it up into multiple sps add try-catch blocks and error-handling remember division by 0 is not a trapable error and set up a job to execute each one in sequence

941990
binary	hex
that being said you can always recode any data to say base64 or hex or binary or whatever you prefer that doesn t have a pipe character

942002
webforms	asp.net
if your devs have only used asp.net webforms to build sites and never another web technology they are in for a lot of learning

942005
msbuild	nant
so i guess solutions that work with .net in any of various version-control systems or build environments msbuild nant cruisecontrol are fair game

942016
linux	bsd
almost every user operating system i m thinking here on linux windows bsd etc uses a virtual memory model

942017
16-bit	8bit
in fact for x86 64 processors performing 32-bit or 16-bit operations are less efficient than 64-bit or 8bit operations due to the operand prefix byte that has to be decoded

942017
16-bit	8bit
on 32-bit machines performing 16-bit operations entail the same penalty but there are still dedicated opcodes for 8bit operations

942022
malloc	free
if you want to use void why don t you use just malloc free

942022
malloc	free
the bottom line is use malloc free if you want to use void

942025
execute	prepare
strut 2 will execute prepare everytime before it invokes your action methods

942026
rhino-mocks	nunit
we use rhino-mocks and nunit for our .net projects

942027
jmock	junit
the n j-series of frameworks nunit junit nmock jmock etc. are typically parallel ports of each other or are based on the same starting principles

942029
revision	svn
i use the svn revision number as the build version in the attributes against the assembly

942031
windows-xp	windows
the 3gb parameter. at best windows-xp and vista will go as far as 3 gb of ram and that s basically the limit for windows

942053
data-structures	dictionary
the base class library in .net has some excellent data-structures for collections list queue stack dictionary but oddly enough it does not contain any data-structures for binary trees

942053
binary-tree	nodes
i m actually interested in a binary-tree - one that exposes its structure so that you can do things like extract subtrees or perform post-fix traversal on the nodes

942094
firefox	safari
this was working but unfortunately both firefox and safari show up as netscape

942110
directory	folder
for instance call it to convert the path for a folder in program files to a path in program files x86 or vice versa when running on a 64-bit system. i need to do this so that when the user is presented with a directory in the gui as when browsing for files or directories he sees the real directory rather than what the app itself thinks it sees

942110
32-bit	64bit
by default the product is installed under program files on a 32-bit system while on a 64bit system it s installed under program files x86

942111
google-chrome	firefox
that checks out in google-chrome firefox opera safari.

942135
functional-programming	imperative
i don t think there s any real point to use linq here since you re trying to build a response string and are thus performing a task most suited to imperative rather than functional-programming

942141
configuration	environment
although the approach used by tomafro is quite easy to use another approach is to use a database.yml-style configuration file that can be split according to environment

942144
value	field
the problem is the name_id field which is filles with 0 and should be have the same value as the id in the contacts-table

942149
mouseleave	mouseenter
what i want to do is to be able to handle the onmouseenter and onmouseleave events for listboxitem which will start the doubleanimation for that listboxitem - i want to enlarge its font on mouseenter and restore to original size on mouseleave

942154
utility	gnu
i suggest using the dumpbin utility or gnu s objdump to determine what takes the most spaces

942211
textbox	button
so it has a couple labels textbox and a button

942212
alignment	layout
the default section alignment for most pe files is 4k to align with the natural system memory layout

942216
base-class	inherited
i prefer to create a page base-class inherited from system.web.ui.page and expose a datacontext property

942223
punctuation	words
this matches words digits and a number of punctuation characters though by no means all

942227
revision	updates
the build is optional on projects that updates often i attach the revision number on there to see where we are sitting

942228
spring	guice
in combination with some sort of dependency injection mechanism factory pattern for construction of urlgenerator clients frameworks like spring or guice service locator pattern this will break the cyclic compile-time dependencies

942239
xsd	xml
by structured format i mean an xml file for each story that has a defined xml schema xsd file

942239
xsd	xml
2 by structured format i mean something like an xml schema xsd file

942262
value	field
my problem now is that i don t want the first value to be selecteded by default i need to force the user to selected a value from the list to avoid errors where they didn t pick that field and by default a value was assigned

942266
python	c++
in c c++ whitespace don t contribute to structure like in python

942267
continuous-integration	teamcity
i am a newbie to teamcity and continuous-integration

942267
directory	folder
however i discovered that the checkout directory -setting was wrong it pointed one folder above where it should be hence adding all new files from svn in the wrong place but still building on the old ones

942268
hide	next
how do i hide existing commands or commandbarbutton controls on the next ide load

942276
checkbox	button
in this example if the button is clicked the checkbox is set to false however if the user attempts to check the checkbox again the checkbox is unresponsive

942277
entity-framework	ado.net
i am using ado.net entity-framework to connect to it

942285
getter	setter
if you annotations the methods hibernate will use getter and setter

942291
contains	any
the checkout directory should not contains any files you care about

942292
browser-detection	google-chrome
if you must have browser-detection despite the warnings against it ppk s routine is current even up through google-chrome and iphone

942306
if-statement	loops
you could eliminate the if-statement in the loops by only loopsing to less than the square root and check for square root integer-ness outside the loops

942306
factors	primes
my first thought was to pre-compute a list of primes and only test against those but i assume you are quite deliberately counting non-prime factors

942317
constructor	object
how can i instantiate an object by specifying the classname and ideally the parameters to be passed through to the constructor

942357
mousedown	mouseup
in this wpf dragdrop sample they call capturemouse on mousedown and release it on mouseup

942361
networkx	graphviz
networkx is a robust library which has built-in visualization but also has an interface to graphviz using pygraphviz

942361
ruby	php
ubigraph has interfaces to different languages including python and networkx has ubigraph support ruby php java c c++ c# haskell and ocaml

942361
linux	osx
you can always use an off-the-shelf package such as graphviz win linux osx pajek win ucinet win or even visio win

942395
mousedown	mouseup
button to handle mouseup when you put the mousedown on the button and move the mouse before you release the button

942397
terminal	prompt
our windows-users login to the application via a terminal application or commaind prompt

942448
document	element
we have a app which uses httpwebbrokerbridge it works fine in delphi2006 but when i recompile using delphi2009 i get edomparsererror exception-handling with message xml document must have a top level element

942474
fadeout	fadein
in ie8 while fadeout is doing its thing the entire text block shifts up 2-3 pixels and then back down 2-3 pixels upon fadein

942481
onmousemove	onmouseup
the switch is used in several other functions onmousemove onmouseup and it seems like bad design big switch copied in several functions

942489
contains	set
each category can contains sub categories and there is no set limit to the depth of sub categories

942495
delphi	c++
at last im using builder c++ not delphi so the code i post may have errors

942506
document	element
what s likely happening is the element is being taken out of the expected document flow append to body or a new parent is insert and this is append to that etc.. and the css rules that would normally apply do not in this case

942545
contains	elements
before i get there i get an invalidoperationexception saying the sequence contains no elements

942545
exception-handling	try-catch
this seems really weird to me especially as i don t want to establish control flow with exception-handling encapsulate in try-catch and return true false in the respective parts

942551
combinations	permutation
edit there are two very similar functions as well permutation and combinations

942551
duplicates	elements
product generates every possible pairing of elements including all duplicates

942551
duplicates	elements
permutations generates all unique orderings of each unique pair of elements eliminating the x x duplicates

942561
show	next
if the one xcode show me isn t in the class i want how can i get to the next result

942620
aggregate-functions	sum
the development version of django has aggregate-functions like avg count max min stddev sum and variance link text

942647
cvs	git
scm if i m using cvs svn git

942658
subtraction	division
i started using a simple division by repeated subtraction algorithm to implement this

942678
slidedown	slideup
slidedown slideup animation

942678
firefox	safari
i am experiencing the error in safari 3 and firefox 3.1 for os x

942716
shell	bash
in a comment in response to a shell question user tinkertim said that it was easy to hack ksh to use the bash autocompletion library

942717
google-maps	openlayers
in case anyone else needs to do something like this i m looking at openlayers which mimics google-maps in a javascript framework

942723
triggers	insert
i don t want my stored procedure to have the entire triggers within it so i would like to move most of it to a stored procedure but i won t know the fields in the insert and deleted tables

942726
ruby	php
i m looking ruby on rails and php hosting service shared space or a dedicated server

942726
ruby	php
php and can upgrade to ruby on rails later with additional cost

942726
ruby	php
ruby on rails and php

942726
dreamhost	bluehost
i ve looked at dreamhost bluehost and railsplayground and all of them seem to have pros and cons

942728
google-chrome	firefox
for example if you normally use firefox try safari or opera or google-chrome or msie instead

942735
mod-proxy-balancer	mod-proxy
i have mod-proxy and mod-proxy-balancer setup as a load balancing reverse-proxy

942750
ostream	std
if you really want to keep using std clog for the tee instead of sending output to a different stream you need to work one level lower instead of deriving from ostream derive from streambuf

942758
sql-server	oracle
how often have you seen in your application lifetime a change from sql-server to oracle

942769
json	xml
switching from atom xml to json content should not affect the idea

942773
python	c++
i used it with c++ though not python

942784
factorization	primes
to compute this find the primes factorization using your list of primess

942784
factors	primes
the number you are taking the factors out of will be getting smaller so you can do the square root test on the smaller intermediate numbers to see if you need to continue up the list of primes

942784
factorization	primes
once you have the primes factorization it is easy to find the number of divisors

942784
factors	primes
then since each divisor uses the same primes factors with exponents less than or equal to those in n including the possibility of 0 the number of divisors is i+1 j+1 k+1

942786
swing	swt
depending on who you ask it is either wonderful or evil since it competes with swing and makes use of native os widgets swt

942794
player	movie
your problem is finding the movie player view

942803
boost	stl
stl and boost

942810
postgresql	mysql
this is admittedly similar to but not a duplicate of comparison of full text search engine - lucene sphinx postgresql mysql

942825
checkbox	button
here i ve moved the button.click eventtrigger to a surrounding stackpanel and added a new eventtrigger on the the checkbox.click to stop the button s storyboard when the checkbox is clicked

942825
checkbox	button
this lets us check and uncheck the checkbox when it is clicked on and gives us the desired unchecking behavior from the button as well

942834
uitableview	uilabel
for an iphone i ve got a uitableview that is grouped has one section and in which i ve set up a section header that s a uilabel object from the nib

942869
increment	reset
-- determine the increment value required to reset the sequences

942885
margins	padding
one possible solution to this is to replace h2 margins with padding

942926
pointers	stack
your esp extended stack pointers the low value holds the top of your stack and the ebp extended base pointers usually the bottom

942940
postgresql	mysql
see for example the list of postgresql aggregate functions and the list of mysql aggregate functions

942951
json	xml
my content type is xml at the moment but i plan to support json in future

942951
http-status-codes	bad-request
i am already handling certain error cases with http-status-codes 401 for authentication 403 for authentication and 404 for plain bad-request uris

942991
shell	bash
if you re in bash or a similar shell try this

942996
contains	set
i ve created an mxd which contains my feature class and i ve configured it to show one of the attributes as a label - both the feature class and the label are set to be visible at all scales

943001
order	add
add your list and corresponding order into a datatable

943003
font-size	height
you won t be able to change the height of the font alone but you can adjust the font-size to work with the line height you have set

943023
performance-testing	profiling
performance-testing can be quite simple such as measuring and recording page load times in a development environment and using techniques like applicaiton profiling to identify and fix bottlenecks

943059
stdin	pipe
if you want to maintain the chroot jail yet still need the privileges to chmod the current directory you re going to have to figure out how to use sudo with the -s option and pipe the root password to stdin in order to get the priviledges

943080
sql-server	teradata
try to realize that sql-server and teradata are very different beasts most of the concepts will not transition well

943080
sql-server	teradata
unfortunately i do not know much about sql-server so i cannot say what tools in sql-server appear in teradata

943110
hide	show
i quickly slapped this together but it does show the second console briefly and then hide it

943131
xsd	xml
i m running into real difficulties validating xml with xsd

943131
xsd	xml
i should prefix all of this and state up front i m new to xsd and validation so i m not sure if it s a code issue or an xml issue

943131
xsd	xml
i ve been to xml api hell and back with the bajillion different options and think that i ve found what would be the ideal strategy for validating xml with xsd

943131
xsd	xml
note my xml and xsd are coming from a database so i don t need to read anything from disk

943131
xsd	xml
it has a textbox for xsd txtxsd a textbox for xml txtxml a textbox for the result txtresult and a button to start the validation btnvalidate

943131
xsd	xml
as a test i put in valid xml but what i think should not conform to the xsd above

943147
xlsx	xls
spreadsheetgear for .net can read xls or xlsx workbooks and can print to the default printer without display any dialog boxes see the workbookview.print methods

943161
versioning	upgrade
when the api releases a new versioning and you need to upgrade

943171
textchanged	textbox
i wanted to access the textchanged event of the textbox but in the event properties of the usercontrol i don t see the events for the textbox

943200
synchronous	.when
.when you say no to enable c++ exception-handling then compiler s synchronous model of exception-handling gx or ehsc is not chosen

943209
xsd	xml
well for one - your xsd defines a xml namespace which is not present in your xml test file - therefore nothing in your xml test file will be validated

943209
document	element
also using an element named might not be a great idea - since the directive is a pre-defined directive and should not appear as tag name elsewhere in your document

943216
button	popup
in visual-studio i click the run button and it popup with only windows-mobile 5 devices to run on

943230
contains	set
a single source file should contains a set of preferably closely related functions

943262
ruby	php
which framework in php is most closely cloned to activerecord ruby on rail

943270
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.0.10 gecko 2009042316 firefox 3.0.10 .net clr

943272
procedure	records
we will have a stored procedure calculate the daily totals every night to a second table - then its just a simple matter of adding up 30 days worth of pre-calculated totals not a matter of counting joining and summing a ba-zillion records

943273
lazy-evaluation	maybe
if a given report is unlikely to be needed daily or more often you could do a lazy-evaluation report generation storing a copy from the first time it s created for a given day and maybe use a file naming scheme something like repabc_05032009.xls as a marker for a given day s report

943274
author	posts
what you probably want to do is mark all the posts the visitor not the author already voted on

943276
webforms	asp.net
one asp.net for webforms

943286
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
that said cakephp is probably the php framework with the most similarities to ruby-on-rails in general

943307
vb.net	vb6
if all you are wanting is to check the component responds when called then use a quick vbscript rather than building something in vb6 vb.net

943315
javascript	dom
after reading this post about how most current javascript libraries implement tests for a dom loaded event

943316
virtual-machine	vmware
intall vmware on your machine then create a new virtual-machine with the necessary software installed

943347
forwarding	port
to a firewall in between or most likely that port forwarding isn t set up in your router for requests coming to your external ip-address to be forwarded to the machine where you have bugzilla set up

943347
forwarding	port
check for instructions on how to do port forwarding

943347
ifconfig	linux
web server listening to outside requests this can be tested from the same internal network via the local network ip address what you see typing in a command line console ipconfig in windows and ifconfig in linux

943347
forwarding	port
port forwarding so the router forwarding the requests received on the webserver port to the webserver machine this gets tested in the same way as firewalls in the router that is you must have your friend or yourself from the house of your friend try to connect to the dyn dns name set up or to the external ip as reported by whatsmyip.org

943361
any	set
are there any iis properties to set to make it run

943372
forwarding	port
look for a setting called port forwardinging or application setting which allows you to forwarding all incoming traffic on your router to a particular ip-address

943372
host	dns
there are several sites which can provide you a free dynamic dns host

943395
strncpy	strcpy
using strncpy rather than strcpy to copy 123456 will ensure that any extra spaces beyond the end of string null terminator is also initialised to null as long as you specify n as being 100 for your example

943395
memset	malloc
otherwise without initialising the memory allocated by malloc to null memset num 0 100 then it is conceivable that you could step beyond the end of the string

943415
package-managers	aptitude
the package-managers aptitude and apt-get are good for auto updating those software you don t really bother about developing with every day like media player browsers

943417
enumerator	any
edit every enumerator type has an underlying type which can be any integral type except char

943464
perl	c++
for instance - is used in many languages at least c c++ and perl

943464
perl	c++
some languages have lines that start with the character # these include c c++ and perl

943475
bugzilla	trac
the bugzilla and trac systems mentioned are nice but geared towards bug tracking which is just very different from a tool you d want to use in a helpdesk-type setup where end users would raise incidents

943481
controllers	routes
basically it checks for a promo code in url excluding those in the controllers arrays your regular routes won t be messed up

943497
any	set
i would strongly advise you to not use this as a regular developping habbit making an event set another callback through code is a sure way to debugging hell but if you really don t find any other way to do it.

943529
driver	kernel
the mmap call can be used on a device file and the corresponding kernel driver can then decide to map kernel memory to user address spaces

943532
filesystems	fat
fat or fat32 filesystems st_mtime

943532
filesystems	fat
is it possible that you re using files on a fat filesystems

943534
rhino-mocks	mbunit
we use mbunit and rhino-mocks for testing

943534
mbunit	nunit
perhaps it can be found in nunit also but i found it in mbunit first

943536
application-pool	was
the ssrs application-pool in iis for the reports manager is running as the network service user which was being used as the connection context even though the application using the service is loging in as the limited user

943540
postgresql	oracle
oracle microsoft sql server ibm db2 and postgresql 8.4 currently in beta support sql extensions

943552
google-chrome	safari
if your ie google-chrome or safari do not show a warning when visiting your secured page it means that you have added this new certificate to trusted certificates database of your account

943558
installation	building
first you could building against your local iis installation as it appears you currently do

943558
windows-vista	windows
that means that all of your boxes should likely be upgraded to windows-vista or windows 2008 server or windows 7 as it is running iis 7.5

943563
filesystems	fat
for example for entries in a fat filesystems the finest resolution for modification time is 2 seconds

943575
configuration	environment
do i have to set some special configuration within the framework properties to be able to use the osgi environment from the jar file

943592
constructor	object
update this can t be in the constructor because setdefaults should be called from an external class at a particular point in time rather than each time the object is constructed.

943595
linux	unix
in order to work with unix linux you should get into the unix philosophy

943597
constructor	object
why not set these defaults when you create the object in the constructor

943597
constructor	object
a default is -imho- a value that should be assigned to a property when no specific value is given to that property so i think it is a good idea to set those default-values when the object is created in the constructor or via a factory

943635
contains	elements
i would like to create a new arrays contains all the elements from x that begin at index 3 and ends in index 7

943642
user-interface	look-and-feel
with synth look-and-feel you will need to fully define how your user-interface components look like you can t just

943642
user-interface	look-and-feel
but if you just need to simply modify colors reusing your default look-and-feel you can use the following snippets to initialize user-interface of combo box

943664
appdata	temp
c users username appdata local temp temporary asp.net files

943682
subtraction	addition
completely un-tested but that s a hell of a reduction for the addition of a one-line methods to arrays and performing a single extra subtraction in a model

943688
command-line	cmd
if this is the cmd-line a typical cmd looks like this

943699
scrollable	panels
the following code produces pretty much what i want but the scrollable panels on the left doesn t scroll

943701
contains	lookup
if there is really no other possible solution then i d say either check user names against whatever data source determines what the reserved words are or make a lookup file table structure somewhere that contains all the reserved words

943712
asp.net-mvc	wcf
i have started using asp.net-mvc and as traditional way i want to keep my data access layer in wcf service

943724
bug-tracking	redmine
redmine is our tool of choice for bug-tracking systems here

943726
temporary	copy
svn checkout your project from the repository to a local working copy temporary directory

943727
javascript	dom
for example discussions of javascript often assume the browser context and the manipulation of a html dom without anyone having to expressly say so

943727
attributes	properties
for example a properties of a type may be described either using an attributes or an element as long as its name can be interpreted correctly

943746
data-uri	data-url
unless you use a data-url useful for small images the browser will make two requests one for the html and one for the image

943749
javascript	dom
then another which contains pure javascript and uses ajax to update the dom and communicate with the web service

943749
controllers	routes
the web service has a routing engine that routes the requests to the different controllers

943749
javascript	dom
the models in turn must return poco objects or dtos and return these to the javascript which injects them into the dom

943813
contains	any
the data contains the payload usually for read operations and the message contains any additional metadata or useful messages such as error messages when the response is false

943822
ruby-on-rails	django
django or ruby-on-rails

ruby-on-rails	django
feature differentiation ruby-on-rails django

943827
click	mouse
as i don t think we can explicitly control the show hide of the context menu stripes i decided to trap the right mouse button click on the control with which the contextmenustripes is associated

943827
click	mouse
however to my amazement the event doesn t get fired upon mouse right click but fires only for left click

943846
click	mouse
in winforms there s also the click event - which does get fired for a right mouse click

943846
radio-button	checkbox
significantly button checkbox richtextbox and radio-button and a few others don t raise and event on right click

943893
pixels	line
if all you want is a preview you could read it line by line skipping every n line and for each line skip every n pixels

943921
shell	bash
unlike the os.environ columns value which i can t access in spite of using bash as my standard shell the data will also be up-to-date whereas i believe the os.environ columns value would only be valid for the time of the launch of the python interpreter suppose the user resized the windows since then

943973
display	height
so i make a listbox with height as 25 so that it will display only one item at a time and the vertical scroll feels like a updown controls

943973
selected	listbox
can any idea to get the value shown in listbox without selected it

943983
python	perl
note that while python regexp implementation and many others such as perl s can do this this is no longer a regular expression in the narrow sense of the word

943996
attributes	properties
i am using guid s and want the db to default these values therefore i want to change the default linqtosl behaviour to add the attributes to the id properties

944010
contains	elements
as i understand it you only want elements to be shown if they satisfy what s contains in all three arrays

944025
macports	fink
that appears to do everything you want and is available on macports and fink

944030
for-loop	loops
just a quick note i would do what schnalle does but in your code i would change the for-loops to a while loops as you are not doing anything with the i

944031
.war	jar
this meant the jar files would now be exported in the .war when deploying to tomcat

944033
pointers	stack
how would it work if dlg wasn t a pointers but declared on stack - wouldn t the destructor destroy the windows when dlg goes out of scope

944041
filtering	sorting
check out sun s tutorial for jtables and look at the sorting and filtering section

944042
ref	out
what you need is to change out to out or ref this tells the runtime that hservice is a pointers

944060
quicksort	in-place
arrays are powerful but complex to reason about since they are inherently mutable but that allows some powerful optimizations where needed for example efficient quicksort implementations really need to be able to swap elements in-place

944060
hashtable	set
this is where the common functional convention on almost everything being immutable helps by doing this it becomes far easier to not care too much about the concrete implementation of the collection and think solely about it s externally visible behaviour a red balck tree for a set or a hashtable - it doesn t matter to consumers its just a set

944069
listboxitem	selected
well since you are using wpf you can change the templates of your listboxitem and change it s look to nothing when the item is selected i mean remove the trigger that s all

944090
javascript	dom
i am trying to use the various techniques with dynamic png images images added after the page has been loaded using javascript dom

944102
background-image	transparency
one caveat through this applies to all fixes i believe is that you can not make a background-image of an element be transparency

944111
scala	java
in the blog post things i do not like in scala i read that when the equals sign are missing the method will return unit same as java s void so methods that return a value must use the equals sign

944135
contains	elements
this xpath expression looks for every img elements whose class attributes does not contains the string pretty

944137
asp.net-mvc	wcf
you just need to move your dataaccess layer into a wcf service expose it and then call it from your asp.net-mvc application

944137
asp.net-mvc	wcf
2 the following blog goes through the process of writing a layered asp.net-mvc applicaiton with a wcf service parts iii iv specifically concentrate on wcf mvc interaction

944139
twitter	tweets
the second queries twitter for the tweets to display

944139
twitter	tweets
note that as this will reduce the number of displayed tweets if some of the repsonses from twitter are replies so you have to increase the count parameter in the call to allow for that

944162
sql-server	oracle
does anyone know of an open source database proxy where it can serve as an intermediary between a closed-source client application and either a sql-server and or oracle

944163
associations	model
to each of your model since the through option just specifies a second associations which it should use to find the other side

944172
web-services	api
use the cocoa web service api pdf to access the sharepoint web-services

944187
highlight	cell
i would like to produce that effect when moving the mouse over any cell in the grid - highlight the row label for the row the mouse is currently hovering over

944233
traffic	packets
as well i recommend using wireshark to analyze the basic network traffic between your client and an existing database although it only understands the basic of the protocols you can get a feel for the general packets structure

944235
automake	gnu
i m trying to use the gnu autoconf automake toolchain for the first time so the answer to my question might be trivial

944241
function-pointers	function-call
you re passing in a function-pointers to another function-call

944244
contains	set
you get a result set where the first record of each id contains the maximum length and the longest initial string for each id

944245
implements	extends
in other words it would extends arrayobject or implements arrayaccess or something along those lines

944253
radiobuttonlist	updatepanel
we had some strange issues when using updatepanel and radiobuttonlist in that a postback was not occuring when you changed the values

944253
hide	show
you change the value of the radiobuttonlist and the textbox will show hide accordingly

944253
radiobuttonlist	updatepanel
the only solution i have found is to not use a trigger for the radiobuttonlist but to put it within the updatepanel

944301
arrayiterator	arrayobject
why don t you change the function signature to allow only arrayobject s arrayiterator s arrayaccess s iteratoraggregate s iterator s or traversable s depending on what you d like to do inside the function

944303
scrollable	panels
now here is some code stolen from perlmongers that creates a scrollable panels with a bunch of button

944360
updatepanel	gridview
i have a updatepanel with a gridview inside

944360
updatepanel	gridview
the gridview works fine when it loads from the start if i look at the view source all data is there but when a postback is done on that updatepanel and click view source again the other data i fetched was not there

944367
concurrent-programming	java.util.concurrent
be sure to take a look at the new java.util.concurrent classes which make concurrent-programming much easier and less error-prone

944376
arrays	loops
you can also use a stack of records to push and pop the bounds and write a loops instead of making recursive calls also it will use less memory since the pointer to the arrays won t need to be replicated for all the calls

944376
pointers	stack
edit i ve noticed that the internal procedure doesn t take the pointers as parameter so forget that part _ anyway stack frame has more information than just the parameters of the function so it will be still more memory efficient and the main point was that the heap were the data stack is allocated is usually larger than the process stack

944399
bazaar	git
you can also use svn simultaneously with git mercurial bazaar - some projects actually do so

944411
value	field
i m creating an infopath form and what i m trying to do is populate an extra textbox with the inital value of the field only while loading

944418
constructor	object
has a short remark that states that bitmapimage object created using this constructor are automatically initialized

944426
selected	textbox
so if yes is initially selected clicking no will postback and the textbox will be removed

944426
radio	click
but the html for the radio button hasn t changed so click yes now will not postback as there s no javascript to do this

944449
licensing	lgpl
only the lgpl dll itself is covered by the licensing requirement

944460
selected	button
you can choose between them by clicking the menu button on the system browser and selected choose new default browser

944479
double	int
rather it is a way to declare pointer to a function which takes int as argument and returns double same as the prototype

944496
function-composition	combinators
tacit programming point-free programming is a programming paradigm in which a function definition does not include information regarding its arguments using combinators and function-composition ... instead of variables

944502
anchor	iframe
so i ve got an an iframe in a div tag in an anchor tag with a timestamp-generated url

944517
background-color	transparency
make sure your background-color is not set to transparency

944524
order	join
this is actually an model inner join order on .

944541
queue	fifo
i read that you can queue up actionscript events somehow so that events are processed in a fifo basis

944544
contains	set
based on the fact that a node set cannot contains the same node twice a union of two nodes has a node count of 1 if they are the same node

944589
command-line	cmd
after becoming comfortable with svn for awhile i then used the tortoisesvn client to make a commit which worked but the command-line client now gives me a client too old get a newer client error on all cmd

944592
any	set
also is there any way to set a business rule like that is always checked without the try except finally so if at anytime throughout the code x is less than 0 an error is raised like if you set at the start of a function anywhere within the function where x becomes less then 0 an exception-handling is raised

944602
persistent	transient
i couldn t create a transient which is not persistent to the database property

944603
value	field
so what i would like is some code to use reflection to output all of the primitive field and properties to a text file as name value pairs and then do the same for any non-primitive objects in the object graph recursively

944608
silverlight	wpf
what is the difference between wpf and silverlight application

944608
silverlight	wpf
what are the exact differences between wpf and silverlight

944618
arcgis	arcmap
debugging any custom arcgis extension or sample which runs arcmap

944630
silverlight	wpf
while there are similarities between the functionality provided by both wpf and silverlight in terms of user interface components and support for xaml silverlight is a much small framework containing a subset of wpf functionality

944630
silverlight	wpf
newer versions of silverlight actually contain some functionality not found in wpf so it is no longer a true subset

944636
versioning	upgrade
if you bought your copy of dterm the upgrade to the next versioning is free regardless of when you purchased dterm

944642
peer	p2p
other extreme p2p radio system source peer

944642
twisted	pyro
if you want to learn how to do these things though playing with a few different approaches makes sense and you should definitely check out twisted the standard answer to this question pyro the standard-library tools

944644
comet	chat
this technique used to be used for things like chat but i m thinking about using it for a comet type application

944645
32-bit	64bit

they will then be ready .when the program runs the next time

944665
widget	button
i would like to create a user-interface where a portion of the windows contains a frame for opengl rendering and the rest would contain other qt widget such as button and so on

944706
derived-class	base-class
the new keyword allows you to hide a member of a base-class in a derived-class rather than override it

944706
derived-class	base-class
this means that calls to such members using a base-class reference still access the base-class code not derived-class code

944706
derived-class	inherited
however if your derived-class is not sealed classes that inherited from it could introduce the same types of problems by hiding the delivery property with a version of their own

944742
document	element
also if an xml document allows an element or any of its ancestors to appear more than once with in a parent element you will need to track the specific index of that element

944760
double	int
this works since modf takes the int part of the double and returns the fractional part

944765
contains	elements
elements contains the closest parent

944773
jtable	jlist
you should be able to use a similar process to find child components in jlist or jtable which also use this renderer pattern

944775
message	alert
the user gets the default alert message box

944780
malloc	free
if you just want a buffer use malloc free

944786

944816
unsigned	short
unsigned short len

944816
unsigned	short
unsigned short code

944818
contains	any
when i load this object from the .net 1.1 assembly it loads fine but as soon as i load the xsl transform an exception-handling occurs and it doesn t contains any useful information as to what went wrong

944824
methods	extend
similarly you would have abcvalidator which would provide implementation for other methods visitcountry visitsomethinelse and it would extend from storevalidator

944826
silverlight	wpf
wpf currently ships or has available more user controls than silverlight

944826
silverlight	wpf
in addition silverlight defaults to oneway databinding if none is set while wpf uses the default mode specified by the dependency property

944826
silverlight	wpf
there are huge differences in cryptography silverlight has 20 classes in the namespace while wpf has access to 107

944826
silverlight	wpf
the silverlight toolkit and the wpf toolkit both address some of the shortcomings of each technology

944827
silverlight	wpf
things that wpf has that silverlight doesn t full 3d engine based on directx windows integration such as windows 7 taskbar thumbnails and system registry availability as well as access to the full .net including oracle support

944831
ubuntu	debian
this way you should get the maximum benefits 1 all the bleeding edge features you want 2 proper debian ubuntu package which you may easily uninstall upgrade and deploy to any number of debian machines

944839
integer	zero
several of the soap objects have nullable integer properties which get converted to zero during the soap-to-local-object conversion process

944865
blacklist	whitelist
you can restrict access to a site via a blacklist whitelist in the iis control panels directory security tab

944881
webforms	asp.net
it sounds to me like you re referring more to webforms classes in system.web.ui instead of asp.net

944881
webforms	asp.net
while webforms are one way of doing web applications in asp.net it is not the only way

944920
launch4j	izpack
izpack + launch4j

944925
audio	ogg
i was wondering if anyone knew how to convert an mp3 audio file to an ogg audio file

944939
textbox	button
the selected record consists of textbox es and combobox es that are disabled until the edit button is clicked

944952
children	nodes
the object treenodes can accept treenodesvisitor s which means he just calls it s visit methods for the nodes and or it s children

944962
32-bit	64bit
i have the 32-bit compiled dll when i try to use it in 64bit application it fails to load

944966
processor	cpu
in a multiprocessor system or a multicore processor intel quad core core two duo etc.. does each cpu core processor have its own cache memory data and program cache

944967
triggers	insert
i d say it would be better to load to a staging table which always matches the required expectations for an entity have the users make their dataflows to populate the staging table and then use a single insert update in a sql command task to update your view via an instead of triggers right

944983
subclassing	superclass
one of the requirements is that you have a grouping of related classes a set of subclassing with a single superclass

945003
put	get
it takes in a url and a request methods get post put etc and i want to be able to parsing the url and open a httpurlconnection or httpurlconnection based on whether it is http or http assume the given urls will always be correct

945003
any	set
then that will automatically create a urlconnection that can accept both http and http but if i do this then i can t find any way to set a request methods get post etc since only the httpurlconnection or httpurlconnection classes have the setrequestmethods methods

945009
audio	ogg
you need a mp3 decoder and a ogg encoder and a little bit of glue code around that opening files setting up the codecs piping raw audio data around ect.

945012
directory	folder
in this case the settings.xml file is in the current directory but i normally put it in the user s app data folder because you can always write to that

945024
myfaces	mojarra
i m migrating from myfaces 1.2.6 to mojarra 1.2

945024
richfaces	tomahawk
my application also uses facelets tomahawk and richfaces

945025
procedure	records
that is when the form is opened and the records are loaded onto the form my event procedure is called up for every

945026
configuration	logging
i would use that rather than trying to wrap every service call if all that you are trying to do is some logging which wcf is already very good at doing if you turn diagnostics on in the configuration file and common things like that around your service calls

945039
audio	ogg
keep in mind that moving from a lossy format to a lossy format will reduce the quality of the audio more than moving from a lossless format flac cd audio apple lossless codec to a lossy format mp3 ogg m4a

945050
contains	elements
caveat is that other types of nodes will be ignored and xml document may contains diffrent elements so this might not work for every type of node encountered

945059
callback	methods
for the first one i would use code generation to automatically create the aysnc and callback logic for all the methods

945073
32-bit	64bit
windows can not load a 32-bit dll into a 64bit process - this is a limitation that you can not circumvent

945073
32-bit	64bit
x86 - 32-bit - can not be loaded into a 64bit process

945073
32-bit	64bit
x64 - 64bit - can not be executed on a 32-bit machine

945073
32-bit	64bit
32-bit process on 64bit machine - dll is loaded as 32-bit

945077
delphi	autoit
i don t know of any direct way in delphi but what you can do is write a small script in autoit autohotkey and keep that script running in system tray so that it will automatically close the messagebox

945091
code-reuse	modularity
i think oop has a good ring to it because it has associated itself with good programming practices like encapsulation data hiding code-reuse modularity et.c

945119
jquery-slider	slider
does anyone know how to get a bubble to appear above the jquery-slider control when the user is moving the slider pointer

945123
.net	wcf
having watched nikhils mix 09 presentation it would appear that .net ria services would replace our wcf and buslog sections

945123
.net	wcf
how easy is it to implement a wcf service over a .net ria service

945139
order	join
join hints can alter the order or methods of access of a table

945149
lookup	any
one way to get rid of bookmark lookup is to use covering indexes - an index which has the filtering columns first but then also include any other columns which you would need in the covered query

945151
xsd	xml
this operates on rng xml syntax and produces an intermediate representation of the schema which is none of xsd rng rnc

945151
document	editing
after you get the .rnc you can use it to guide the editing of an xml document

945175
subtyping	generics
if you want to work on orders genericsally without knowledge of any specific subtyping or generics parameter you need to abstract out what you need into a base class or an interface and facade the delivery.tostring with a method on the new order class

945193
debugging	trace
i ask because i couldn t find the stack trace in visual-studio while debugging an exception that occurred

945196
paradox	bde
connecting to bde paradox from c#

945198
contains	any
the response of this request would contains a html fragment string which the reseller can inject into any page

revision	updates
i seem to remember being able to get tortoisesvn to set the last-modified timestamp for files to the timestamp from the revision when performing an updates

945202
webforms	asp.net
we re looking at using https in our asp.net webforms application for a shopping cart section

945206
any	set
it simply returns an object from set - any object

945207
triggers	insert
our ticketing system let s us read the database directly but updates need to be done either through a web service or an insert to a special staging table and then calling a web service to triggers the processing of their business logic

945211
g++	gcc
i am trying to link a .a library that was built with gcc to a program built using g++

945236
compact-framework	.net
i m doing an app in .net compact-framework 3.5 and i need to do some charting xy bar graph pie and so on and stuff .

945237
.when	ready
.when s it going to be ready

945273
global-assembly-cache	gac
would the websites webserver machine run faster if i registered one set of the dll s into the global-assembly-cache and each site used the dll s in the gac

945278
rewrite	rule
how about this rewrite rule

945282
defined	declare
you can also declare and defined the function in one go by moving the whole function above the function that calls it but this wont always work if you have two functions which reference eachother you have to have a separate declaration

945293
subtract	time
that is what i do buy subtract 150000 time 15 00 00

945293
integer	zero
if your cardeventtime is sting not integer then you must ensure that it has leading zero 020000 not 20000 otherwise the min max will not sort it properly so that 20000 is higher then 150000

945320
any	set
is there any way to accurately set a specified sleep time

945354
document	element
a variety of delphi demos i ve built today with delphi 2009 update 3 4 applied all seem to result in the client of any localhost web service i try to consume returning an xml document must have a top level element error

945363
versioning	upgrade
try clearing the option always upgrade to the install versioning of office

945368
selected	checkbox
however you can accomplish the same thing by going to debugging exceptions and make sure that the checkbox in the common language runtime exceptions row are selected

945398
nsarraycontroller	nstreecontroller
i also have an nsarraycontroller in each of the sub-view controllers which is bound to the nstreecontroller via some overly-complicated keypaths

945416
swing	awt
this is often called the swing or awt event thread

945416
swing	awt
build a list of items and be able to do something else you should use a thread other than the awt event thread the main swing one

945416
swing	awt
so in these cases you spawn a new thread and do what you have to and when the results finally come back you then somehow have to create an event that can be executed by the awt swing dispatcher

945428
google-chrome	opera
i need to do google-chrome opera hacks because of a font replacement script wanted by the client that breaks things.

945431
document	element
every xml document must have a top level element

945466
base-class	inherited
now if you really want to make your life easier then you can create an abstract base-class that all your custom grid controls will inherited from

945482
ubuntu	debian
tested on the default installations of ubuntu intrepid jaunty and debian lenny and those are affected too

945498
nested-lists	tree
usually tree are defined as a list of subtree plus potentially some data and thus i think a semantic transformation into html should use some nested-lists and if you want that dynamicness in there make sure that you keep all the lists open and close them with javascript so they are open if the user has javascript disabled

945502
lotus	ibm
it only works if i install lotus notes in a path shorter than c program files ibm lotus notes where works perfectly

945502
lotus	ibm
if i install it in for example c archivos de programa ibm lotus notes it can find my dll but cannot load the library

945509
double	int
say you have a function with 3 parameters that are int and it returns a double

945512
iteration	elements
i am tryng to loop through an xml doc and i am still getting the first elements in the second iteration not sure what i am missing

945515
swt	rcp
if your plugins are rcp rich client platform pluginss with swt you could use swtbot

945516
system-requirements	branding
i do not recommend specific branding of computer hardware however there are certain system-requirements which matlab needs to run properly

945522
hide	show
honestly i d just make a regular windows and hide show it as appropriate - just have an itemscontrol whose datatemplate is a menuitem

945536
procedure	records
i ve found some articles about using the randomview view and the getnewid function to pull back randomized records but they are using this methods with linq to sql which allows functions and stored procedure to be used with no return-value or a scalar return-value

945536
order	add
what i want to do is to simply add a column to my linq query that contains a newly generated guid so that i can order by the new guids and take a specific number of records randomly

945545
png	gif
i allow them to upload png gif and jpeg images

945553
checkbox	textbox
textbox checkbox etc

945563
order	add
notice that in order to support databinding you will have to manually handle that event on whatever control s you choose to add

945572
dbase	bde
the bde could work with several file types foxpro dbase paradox ascii and sometimes even access

945583
linux	unix
on unix linux use

945584
dbd	dbi
i d like to know if it s possible to execute more than one sql statement within a single execute or do call using dbd oracle via perl dbi

945584
oracle	mysql
as a related example dbd mysql has a mysql_multi_statements connection option that explicitly enables this feature. i can t shake the feeling that there s some similar perhaps undocumented and obscure oracle oci option that s accessible somehow via dbd oracle that will enable the same thing

945586
lgpl	gpl
however i have not personally used this package and it s gpl not lgpl so it will contaminate the rest of your source if you wish to use this in a proprietary product

945589
32-bit	16-bit
the formats are 16-bit per pixel rgb 32-bit per pixel rgb indexed etc

945599
type-safety	generics
this is still far from perfect your example doesn t show why the base class needs to know about the delivery strategy at all and it would make much more sense to be generics with a constraint but this at least allows you to use the same name for the property and get type-safety

945602
checkbox	textbox
basically i have to render a checkbox in one situation while in another i have to render a textbox

945617
scala	java
as understand it scala uses the java virtual machine

order	add
in order to get a longish piece to connect to points that are close together i have to add a loop

945627
response.redirect	redirecttoaction
i m guessing that the response.redirect and server.transfer throw errors because in asp.net-mvc you should be calling the redirecttoaction methods from the controllers

945641
hash	md5
the md5 function is over twice as fast and the sha1 hash is about 35 faster

945650
javascript	dom
after doing some research i found aptana jaxer a open source software that allows you to run ajax html javascript and dom modification server-side

945655
double	int
however the chance that you re going to run out of bits when working with int or longs or double etc

in your while-loops you loops until print_names points to nothing and then you pass it to display_names

945691
dialog	pop-up
my friend insisted that the best you could do was pop-up the print dialog for the user they would have to click print themselves

945691

945752
log4net	nlog
still i think that log4net and other frameworks nlog common.logging and even entlib went the wrong way by implementing their own logging system from the ground up changing even the way you write log statements in the first place

945764

some of these classes are not public protected as such in the api docs they wont have links to the class documentation

945785
.doc	xls
in my application my users can import files pdf xls .doc to a table or export them to a folder

945787
similarity	distance
the main difference between the two is that cosine similarity will yield a stronger indicator when two document have the same word multiple times in the document while hamming distance doesn t care how often the individual tokens come up

945797
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have been using webforms for most of my career and have recently become interested in .net asp.net-mvc

cross-domain	xss
the goal is to use this say as one more step in xss support when combined with the cross-domain permission files

945859
javascript	dom
flash vars is still in the dom but this would allow only the loader to know the value of the key very hard for javascript and we can lock down flash pretty well not to expose the value to any loaded swfs and cross domain files can limit any reading of xml files back on the originating server only by the original swf only one from that domain

the major potential drawback of the first style is that you cannot effectively assign object to the constructor s prototype which is useful and more efficient if you are creating a lot of the same object

947398
put	get
also put a file share on and store all the installers for development tools you d use - so you can easily get all the bits you need to set up a new development workstation

947408
transparency	frame
in response to your extra credit question you could do this improvement yourself by only drawing the changed part of the image on the new frame and setting the rest to be transparency

947410
contains	set
however i want to point out something in your second set of code that isn t too savory - namely the fact that you are assigning things new properties on the object contains in the this keyword - do you realize what that object is

947410
constructor	object
when you do that the this keyword inside the body of the constructor function is assigned a brand new object as though the first line in the body were something like

947414
persistence	hibernate
i would suggest that whoever made this comment has not read java persistence with hibernate which is a great reference

947440
implements	extends
by extends the application class and implements it as a singleton you get an object that will exist whenever any of your application components exist providing a centralized place to store and transfer complex object data between application components

947440
serialization	marshalling
aidl is a way of defining how to serialization an object into os primitives so that it can be marshalling across process boundaries if the service you re binding to is running in a separate application

947455
json	xml
json xml or plain

947455
json	xml
you could use xml or json or just plain html

947460
continuous-integration	teamcity
teamcity - continuous-integration

947461
quicksort	heapsort
in addition to the above the stl s sorting algorithm is introsort which is a mixture of quicksort and heapsort it fails over from quicksort to heapsort if the former is doing poorly

947473
profiling	debugging
many people recommend this for the debugging project profiling

947475
constructor	object
in your second example when you call create within the scope of the function this is the global object which is always the case when you call a bare function without using it as a constructor or accessing it as a property a method call

947512
authentication	login
i am using the asp.net login control for authentication

947513
mouseover	mouseout
i am halfway there but when you mouseout it disappears before you can mouseover any of the items

947514
innodb	myisam
if you tried to change the storage engine for this table from to myisam innodb and something went wrong then indices in this table could have been screwed up

947515
debugging	trace
if you mean debugging messages you probably should be using trace not debugging and use trace switches and trace listeners defined in the configuration file to control logging behavior at runtime

947515
any	set
the exception-handling class uses information from the .pdb file irrespective of whether or not you ve set any compilation constants

947523
message-queue	messaging
my understanding is that what they migrated to scala is the message-queue from a ruby-orm-db backed solution to a distributed messaging system with scala

947525
communication	messages
a third for distributed algorithms such as in secure multiparty computation is to count the amount of data transmitted across the network commonly measured in rounds of communication or number of messages

947531
lookup	any
lookup the exp_continue command -- it prevents the current command from returning so it can find any subsequent password prompts

947534
pointers	stack
in your code above you use a pointers to an overlapped struct that lives on stack in your call to writefileex

947534
typedef	struct
typedef struct _myoverlapped

947538
binaries	install
i have a vague recollection that if you take binaries compiled under debugging to a computer that doesn t have the debugging c runtime libraries install which usually means it doesn t have an ide so most users fall into this category it will barf with an error message

947539
malloc	free
it turns out that in the c runtime a counter used to aid debugging was being incremented each time a malloc free was performed

947564
environment	execution
i think that whatever your basis for modelling execution time spaces using o n... notations you are assuming a normalized environment

947568
authentication	login
changed the web.config file in root folder authentication section to change the login path to the new usercontroller and login method

947568
logout	login
change the logonusercontrol actionlinks to point to the new usercontrol and login and logout methods

947570
set	bag
depending on your feature set and user-interface there may be some other session state for the user but that shouldn t need to apply to the direct rp-op communications and you can use your standard bag of tricks

947581
filtering	sorting
also if you are looking at sorting and filtering i m guessing you re going to be using some kind of grid

947620
put	get
i then put in variables like #username# into the html that get replaced in code

947637
average	min
in more real situation if we have about 12 concurrent calls and default 1 min send timeout and if service calls process more than 10 seconds in average than we can easily get timeout exception-handling with the last two calls 12 2 10 sec 60 sec because they will wait all others

947639
credentials	security
if you re sufficiently concerned about security and security-in-depth you might consider storing the user credentials in a completely separate data store from your domain data

947643
transparency	frame
a layered windows will let you make your normal windows frame transparency or semi-transparency so that the content you draw will appear to float above the desktop and other windowss

947664
updating	updates
i vaguely remember a problem i read about where one of the orms you listed were updating every column so it appeared a user changed all the columns in the table when they really updates a single column

947671
logging	trace
we have no problems logging stack trace for release code however we do always ship the .pdb files with our releases

947686
contains	any
where a user has multiple trials a trial does not internally map to any users and contains details about the trial name description settings and a usertrial contains information specific to an instance of a user s trial expiration date for example

947687
worksheet	excel
is there a way to convince crystal reports to export a page group whatever to separate worksheet when exporting to excel data only

947711
arrays	map
you could use a std map instead of a simple arrays

947719
selected	textbox
validating is useful if you want to cancel the leave from tab enter click etc and keep the textbox selected

947722
worksheet	excel
according to the documentation you cannot export a report directly to multiple worksheet in a single excel workbook

947722
worksheet	excel
when the limit of 65536 rows in excel is reached though the exporter does create a new worksheet but you are not in control

947723
arrays	map
instead of arrays use a map

947726
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
there is a free c# ide sharpdevelop 3.1 which has integrated profiler and it is compatible with visual-studio solutions

947729
xml-serialization	xml
this article should be useful to understand xml-serialization with xml web services

947733
any	set
are there any character set oddities eg are you using a multi-byte character set

947733
varchar2	clob
last thought is try a clob instead of a varchar2 4000

947750
hash	md5
avoid the use of a fast and cheap hash such as md5 or sha1

947765
getter	setter
however synthesized getter and setter do more than just retaining and releasing

947775
installation	building
the only way to get 2.4 on ubuntu right now is to building from source -- and if you decide to do that please read how not to break mono installation first

947788
linux	unix
is there any way to use standard linux unix command line tools to sort this file by only the first two columns

947801
arrays	loops
if you ve recently been studying arrays and loops in your class though the method you describe is probably what your instructor is expecting

947801
arrays	loops
i wouldn t try to get too far ahead of your instructor since the arrays and loops method is probably the sort of thing you ll need to be very familiar with when you take your exams

947802
c++	lua
i m trying to write some c++ classes for interfacing with lua and i am confused about the following

947802
c++	lua
with the following lua code i understand it and it works by properly lual_getn returns 3 in the zcharacterfisherman.commands c++ set newindex function

947802
c++	lua
all objects are defined in c++ and the c++ objects hold all the object members so i am trying to just connect lua to those c++ objects

947817
debugging	trace
i do some mpi-related debugging with log trace but you can also run gdb if you re using mpich2 mpich2 and gdb

947824
dependency-injection	service-locator
i think you mean you want to use mef in this instance like a service-locator rather than a dependency-injection container

947835
oracle	mysql
i m not sure what the database type is oracle mysql etc...

947835
oracle	mysql
i ve wanted to know if the database type was oracle or mysql if there is a big learning curve for connecting to one of these across the internet

947842
constructor	object
the objects you provide as arguments as part of the service request must be marked with serializable and based on some of the answers posted before mine you also need to make sure your custom object does not contain any parameters in the constructor

947855
xsd	xml
define your xml format as an xsd

947893
data-structures	map
are there any map data-structures that have at least o log n insertion deletion access and merging

947905
having	select
hey i m having trouble with the time portion of the calendar date select gem

947928
superclass	subclass
normally equals in general should not be implemented to return true between itself and its subclass although there are plenty that do due to covariance issues the superclass will think it equals the subclass but the subclass won t think it equals the superclass so this type of implementation of equals is tricky no matter what you do

947949
cucumber	selenium
i have an application with a bunch of cucumber tests and i tried using selenium with it today

947973
arrays	loops
i ve thought about using a loops in the code behind on something like the init function to create an arrays of new objects setting their attributes and hoping it is passed into the aspx file but it didn t work

947975
ms-access	mysql
i am trying to use a rake task to migrate some legacy data from ms-access to mysql

947984

947995
csv	xml
i have implemented a csv file builder that takes in an xml document applies a xsl transform to it and appends it to a file

947995
csv	xml
i have a large number of xml documents to add to this csv file and after multiple calls to it it occasionally throws an ioexception the process cannot access the file batch.csv because it is being used by another process

947999
dictionary	map
for the example given where the strings are used as keys to a map or dictionary i would lean toward use of an enum or other object instead

948029

948058
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
what i ended up doing to solve the problem was to create a uinavigationcontroller and push the uiviewcontroller based class onto it and then do presentmodalviewcontroller to the navigation controller s instance

948059

948084
spaces	output
each ship s windows display simulated output from a virtual global spaces but the ships and their contents don t really move relative to each other

948104
debugging	trace
when an exception occurs in your application like attempting to access something in a null class or trying to access element 10 in an arrays that only has 9 the debug player will pop up a windows stating that an exception has occurred and give you a stack trace even if you re not actively debugging the app

948109
account	api
when passing a system string to an api function you have to take into account the new tchar maps to setting in the project options

948115
children	nodes
in most scene graphs you ll have parent nodess that each contain children in this case each ship would be a nodes and the people rooms furniture etc inside the ship are children

you ll have to do a little work with nsdatecomponents converted using an nscalendar typically the user s default calendar to figure out the start and end nsdate value and compare use those to compare your time interval to

948127
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
i would definitely spend some time looking over nscalendar and nsdatecomponents in the docs though you might find a better methods than what i m suggesting for what you need to do

shell	bash
you can see bash s execute_cmd.c#execute_disk_command being called from execute_cmd.c#execute_pipeline xsh s process.c#process_run being called from jobs.c#job_run and even every single one of busybox s various small and minimal shell splits them up

948372
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
if all you care about is the date on the calendar then you ll create the nsdate then use an nscalendar to get nsdatecomponents for the date

948379
constructor	object
it would be better for you to create your own type of object constructor complete with dosomething function rather than extending the built-in arrays

948384
web-services	api
fetch tacks the given resource name onto the base uri of the web-services say uses the restlet client api to fetch an xml representation then deserializes the fetched xml into a data transfer object a pojo

once all words are processed go through each word in the data structure giving a unique integer to those with a count greater than one

948421
expression	evaluation
if i close visual-studio i get another create instance failed box but this time the details portion says an expression evaluation is already in progress.

948423
subclassing	abc
for example header-files that declare classes need to be imported directly in subclassing header-files and header-files declaring protocolss might well be imported directly although youy can use protocols abc

948444
widget	button
to clarify the custom widget are interactive contain button so the solution requires more than painting a widget

948461
fadein	show
in my current dilemma i m using a javascript paginator with a fadein to show the next page s worth of content over 0.75 sec because if i do not do it the change causes a tiny flicker distracting to me but maybe if i was in the user chair i would be screaming just show me the page already

948470
any	set
when processing a batch of records if any of them fail business rule validations the entire set of inserted data is rolled back for data integrity

948497
constructor	object
however when using the object from another executable the constructor destructor plus multiple other functions work however 2 functions are not found by the linker

948525
json	xml
personally i think using jax-rs is the best way to deal with data binding be that xml or json

948530
linked-list	arrays
consider a linked-list type command with it s next pointer and a argv arrays

948540
double	int
similarly this can be extended to int long float double types as well

948540
double	int
floating point types such as float and double are also represented by a bits in memory but their data representation differs from int data types such as byte and int in that they will store a value in memory as binary fractions and exponents

948560
lookup	any
you can lookup items by any of the ids names or properties

948564
factors	matrix
there are n 2 relationships in a matrix that would determine if character a could attack or use ability m on character b ignoring other factors for now

rar	zip
for other compression formats the docs say truezip ships with archive drivers for zip tar and all derivatives jar tar.gz tar.bz2 tzp ... . no rar that i know of

948576
visualvm	jdk6
the visualvm which comes with jdk6 has a basic profiling inside it

visualvm is provided with the jdk so if you have the jdk6 installed you likely have it installed as well

948602
udp	tcp
this is why tcp is different to udp

948627
value	field
for example mysql enables this by allowing 00 values in date and datetime fields - eg 2009-00-00 will save directly to a mysql date field but this value does not translate consistently when parsing by most programming languages date libraries

948631
order	join
since there are no join in the app engine datastore it might be necessary to have things less normalized than usual for the typical sql database in order to ensure that queries that check permissions are fast ones that determine whether a link is to be displayed

948637
nsarray	plist
if your plist file contains keys and values you would make the second line an nsdictionary instead of nsarray

948640
contains	set
e.g. if only a few pairs of classes out of the 25 have the invisibility property the map in that case might contains only the few exception-handling that do have that property for a boolean property like this a std set might actually be a preferable implementation in c+_

948640
dictionary	map
some oo languages have multi-dispatch common lisp and dylan are the two that come to mind at the moment but for all the vast majority of languages that lack it this is a good approach in some cases you ll find that a centralized map dictionary is restrictive and refactor to a dynamic visitor design pattern or the like but thanks to the getter function such refactorings will be pretty transparent to all the rest of your code

948642
value	field
but recently when coding an external application that consumes the crmservice i realised that the service will allow a business entity or dynamic entity to be created using the create methods even if the required field do not exist or contains a value

948660
authentication	login
i m trying to use the mstscax.dll microsoft remote desktop control to login to a vista machine that requires network level authentication

948660
remote-desktop	rdp
one hint is that both royal ts and vista s remote-desktop create a authoriztion prompt that looks like the one from creduipromptforwindowscredentialss this makes me belive that i might be able to use a function like that to get the credentials and then possibly use publishercertificatechain to tell rdp about it

948664
.net	wcf
the back end i will most probably be coding up in .net using c# and wcf services

948668
unsigned	integer
shifts the bits in c one to the right which ends up being the same as doing an integer division by 2 for unsigned or positive integers

948678
ruby	php
they just pass it to php or ruby or whatever

948682
spaces	output
when output in html the encapsulated php lines are dropped but the white spaces used to format them are left in and throws the view source formatting all out of whack

948691
data-structures	tree
edit i should probably clarify what i m looking for i m interested in what sort of data-structures would be used to store the syntax tree how a breeding operation might be performed that sort of thing

948695
any	set
if you can pull off a comparison and set the sspov bit before the 9th clock cycle this should generate a nack this is quite sketchy if you have any interrupts running

dojo is currently slightly less popular than jquery has 8.4 million hits on google search vs 4.3 million for but that s still way popular enough to ensure it won t go away any time soon

948779
multithreading	wait
component 2 this component has 2 parts an i o bound part receiving data from component 1 and a cpu bound part assembling the packets you can look at the problem as a whole make sure to saturate your link when you want to measure the cpu bound part if is is a multithreading component you can look for ways to improve look if you don t get 100 cpu utilization and you can measure time required to assembly x messages from this you can calculate average wait time to process a message this can be used later to drive the general performance characteristic of your system and provide and sla for your users you are going to guarantee a response time within x millisecond for example

948795
perl	php
i am trying to come up with a regular expression in perl matching multiple patterns and returning all of them like preg_match_all in php does

with asp.net web-services and with wcf services with aspcompatibilitymoderequirements set the browser will send any authentication cookie to them so you can check if the current user is authentication and you can also perform authentication

948830
webserver	upload
however shared objects are intrinsically linked to the location of the swf so a user could sidestep the above method by viewing a second copy of the swf that they had saved locally or upload to a different webserver or whatever

948832
perl	php
it doesn t have to be with php it could be something that is run like a perl script or something if something like that would be able to do the job better though i m not sure why that would be just leaving my options open here

948852
selected	button
i need to allow the user to browse to the directory selected the database hit the button and prepare a connection string

948854

easier to learn and justify perl and python programmers will have no trouble

948912
unsigned	short
note that behaves differently on unsigned types whether char short long or long long than on signed types

948919
contains	elements
in ie dealing with z-index for elements contains within the same containing block can be quirky at times

948919
contains	elements
try moving your dialog_box out to a higher-level contains block say the body elements and see how that works

948927
ruby-on-rails	django
it s not a full-stack solution like django or ruby-on-rails

948963
configuration	installation
for them it makes greater sense to buy everything software license installation configuration support services from a single vendor

948973
jquery	.post
there s not really a lot of jquery code to .post i m using the cycle plugin and in the onbefore function i m just calling next.src

948973
javascript	dom
my jquery and javascript foo isn t sufficient to really understand what the cycle plugin is doing to generate next - i think it s the dom element for the next image being cycled in if you re familiar with what cycle does

948975
compression	streaming
from pdf specification version 1.5 there are two new methods of compression object streaming and cross reference streaming

948975
compression	streaming
it s also possible to pre-process the streaming data using a predictor function which will improve the compression level of the data

948975
compression	streaming
the second type of compression offered is the use of object streaming

948975
compression	streaming
the compression will be better if you grouping similar objects together into an object streaming

directory	folder
i think i need to make some changes in the .htaccess file present in the public folder of my rails_root directory but i am not sure

949093
playstation	xbox
think of it this way - even single-purpose machines where developers have full control over the hardware with digital signing and all the tricks possible like the xbox or playstation can t manage to keep third-party code out

949147
always-on-top	transparency
to solve this i cheated a little and created a secondary form that opens over the video feed this had no borders was set to always-on-top and given transparency i drew directly onto this form

949155
redmine	trac
is it possible to migrate a trac database to redmine if the two systems are in different machines any other way than by copying trac to the other machine

button	popup
i m attempting to implement a feature where a user can select some text in a webview and after releasing the mouse button a small windows will popup to allow the user to perform some operations on the selected text

949264
constructor	object
if you were to treat schedule as a pojo and argue that an object is not responsible for validating itself - i would have to move all of the code in the constructor to the business layer s validator class

949266
version-control	git
i have been using git for my projects and now a new developer will join but he has not used any version-control before

949268
instances	self
self inside formfield_for_foreignkey refers to the modeladmin instances and while that does have a model attributes it s not the order model instances it s a modelbase reference

949287
hash	md5
thus a 128 bits md5 hash value would result in a 128 bit 8 bit byte 16 byte long string

949304
push	pull
this is assuming that the fork will create a project for him where he can push his changes to github then you can pull from his github project then push it to the main one where he pull from

949327
order	add
but in case i got it wrong and you re displaying some kind of catalog so you want users to be able to bookmark pages than you just need to add some obfuscation mechanism that will create a complex string based on the id kind of encoding the id before sending it to the url and decoding it in code in order to obtain the actual id

949346
internet-explorer	google-chrome
raphaã l currently supports firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ opera 9.5+ google-chrome 2.0+ and internet-explorer 6.0+

the problem not only applies to nimbus but also to the default look-and-feel

949378
firefox	opera
does for firefox opera safari etc

949412
debian	linux
if you work in non-debian linux another way to set up a default font for emacs is to add emacs customisation to the file .xdefaults in debian any file in etc x11 xresources is used

949413
interface-builder	iboutlet
for the others set up iboutlet in your controllers and hook them up in interface-builder

949428
any	set
those settings are not going to have any effect when set via ini_set

949429
quadtree	octree
something like a quadtree or octree is common in 3d worlds although you could overlay a grid too or track arbitrary regions etc

949429
data-structures	tree
basically it s a simple data-structures problem of giving yourself some sort of access to n navgraph nodes without needing an o n search to find where you are and your choices tend to come down to some sort of tree or some sort of hash table

949431
internet-explorer	google-chrome
this piece of javascript code works fine in firefox and google-chrome but fails with the error object expected in internet-explorer 8

949451
executable	jar
and i used eclipse s export to runnable jar function to make it into a executable jar-file test.jar

949459
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox google-chrome and opera browsers

949487
webserver	security
hint forking is not possible from within a webserver environment for security reasons

949499
constructor	private
note your constructor is private

949501
environment	restart
oracle jdeveloper had a copy of oc4j bundled and it was possible to make changes on-the-fly without restart the containers again this may not be possible given your environment

949508
expression	evaluation
modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression

949539
input-field	selected
difference is after a file has been selected the input-field receives the focus again but remember you have a listener on the onfocus event

949542
executable-jar	jar
note i know you created the jar using eclipse but you might want to know how does an executable-jar works

949543
aes	rsa
i have to implement a digital envelope using aes and rsa but i am having problems with the .net implementation of the rsa algorithm

949543
aes	rsa
i have managed to encrypt the data aes with the random symmetric key but now i have to encrypt the key with rsa

949543
exponent	modulo
the key is an arrays of bytes and the public key i have tells me only the modulo and the public exponent both arrayss of bytes

949543
aes	rsa
using only those two parameters how can i encrypt my aes generated key with rsa

949543
exponent	modulo
afterwards the public key is read from the public key file and the modulo and the exponent are in their appropriate byte arrays

949543
exponent	modulo
currently the modulo is 128 bytes and the exponent 64 bytes

949554
show	next
ie if you are on the fist page previous is stil show and if you are on the last page next is show

949556
32-bit	64bit
i think microsoft detours may be of help but the free edition is 32-bit only and my drivers are pure 64bit

949569
administration	account
i have access to the administration account originally used to create these packages and have other packages encrypted by the same person but using a different password that i know

949575
git-repo	repo
you could dump the current svn repo filtering out the .git directory and create another svn repo based on this filteringing dump and use this new one as a basis for the git-repo

949601
exponent	modulo
so what you need are the rsaparameters but all you need to set are the modulo and the exponent to encrypt

949611
directory	folder
the easiest thing to do is set the target directory for the 64-bit dll to be a x64 subdirectory of your target folder

949625
any	set
unless you actually need to pass around this set of parameter very frequently with the same data i don t see any need

949632
conditional	operators
if conditional are needed then extension methods and arbitrary expression can be used null-coalescing operators

949650
textbox	button
i wrote a simple usercontrol that has 2 labels 2 textbox and 1 button

949654
firefox	safari
works in firefox and browsers with webkit core safari konqueror

949659
directory	folder
d libs orm subsonic_2.1_final_source src subsonic bin debugging directory to that command-line tools folder .

949694
executable	jar
the fact that in windows you might have an association with javaw.exe means this will be launched by the os when you double-click on the jar like a .txt file being opened automatically with notepad it doesn t make the .txt an executable file

949713
shipping	tax
and i don t want to put the satchmo apps product shipping tax etc directly into the python django path

949727
private-key	rsa
somehow there s a difference bewteen a .net rsa private-key and a bouncycastle rsa private-key and i can t put my finger on it

949731
content-disposition	content-type
if you wanted to determine what a given url resolved to you could issue a head request and inspect the content-type and content-disposition headers to see if the content is of a type that implies an underlying file but even that s not bulletproof since images pdf etc

949754
any	set
i am wondering if there s any set of special url or apis on google-maps that given a pair of locations two city names would return the route coordinates that makes the path of the route from city a to city b

949771
promise	future
future and promise are dataflow or dataflow-like constructs found in many modern languages

949771
verilog	vhdl
vhdl verilog and other hardware description languages are essentially dataflow

949771
autodesk	revit
dynamo for autodesk revit screenshot

949776
printf	strlen
you can fix it by testing how many strings you have and the greatest strlen of them and start by allocating chunk to output before you enter your printf loop

949791
contains	any
they usually include filtering that recover the uploaded files so when the process gets to your server the request doesn t contains any attached file

949801
python	c++
i ve learned python by my own and i am using it to make a lot of nice tools that would be too long to write in c++

949801
python	c++
python has just a very positive influence on my c++ skills

949806
callback	methods
i would like to avoid callback methods in every view if at all possible

949864
triggers	insert
there is an after insert triggers on table2 which is used to log mutaties on table2 into an third table aptly named mutations

949864
triggers	insert
simplified version of the triggers real version does an insert per column and it also inserts the old value

949908
.when	ready
start with the idea of keeping these as simple as possible for as long as possible so you ll be ready for the more complex testing topics .when they re needed

949913
automake	gnu
by default automake perform check for conformance to gnu standards

949922
credentials	security
providing your security policy allows this you can give the application-pool that runs your wfe web application the same credentials as the central administration application-pool

949930
triggers	insert
the fetch_status thus get s its value from your cursor contained in your after insert triggers

949938
order	add
users enter pick an item from the combobox add a comment and add the item to the listview.this is the flow.i have a master table for the combobox i have its selectedvalue bound to a item field in the ordertable and the textbox.text bound to comments field in order table.fine up to now

949955
iteration	elements
this allows us to execute any arbitrary code against every elements in the collection using the fastest possible iteration methods

949959
32-bit	64bit
i had two dll s one for 32-bit one for 64bit

949959
32-bit	64bit
logically i thought i d place the 32-bit dll under c windows system32 and the 64bit dll under c windows syswow64

949962
return-type	arguments
you have to declare the literals accessability return-type methods arguments .

949981
low-level	hardware
of course this is after the arduino-specific hardware setup so if you have such low-level stuff that it really has to go before main then you need some constructor magic

950010
linux	unix
in unix linux world dlls are called shared libraries and typically have .so or .o extension

950011
32-bit	64bit
syswow64 wasn t intended for the dlls of 64-bit systems it s actually something like windows on windows64 meaning the bits you need to run 32-bit apps on a 64bit windows

950014
vbscript	jscript
if possible vbscript or jscript via windows scripting host

950015
shared-objects	.so
in linux dll s equivalents are kind of anyway shared-objects .so

950015
kdevelop	cdt
of course instead of compiling everything manually it s highly recommended to use a make file or an ide such as eclipse with cdt or kdevelop or pick your favorite here that will create one for you behind the scenes

950056
administration	account
the file on the server gets created under the administration s account and thus web-user-iis account wouldn t have access to that file and thus would be unable to access it

950084
coalesce	nvl
are there non obvious difference between nvl and coalesce in oracle

950084
coalesce	nvl
the obvious difference are that coalesce will return the first non null item in its parameter list whereas nvl only takes two parameters and returns the first if it is not null otherwise it returns the second

950084
coalesce	nvl
it seems that nvl may just be a base case versioning of coalesce

950103
coalesce	nvl
nvl always evaluates both arguments while coalesce stops evaluation whenever it finds first non- null

950106
paradox	dbase
based on experience with shared file databases dbase paradox and the like this doesn t scale well

950107
driver	kernel
under ubuntu 8.04 firmware is tied to kernel version the same way driver modules are

950107
ubuntu	debian
when i compile the 2.6.24-24-generic ubuntu kernel according the alternate build method the old-fashioned debian way i get the appropriate modules directory and all my devices work except those requiring firmware such as my intel wireless card ipw2200 module

950107
driver	kernel
now somewhere in between the driver calling request_firmware and firmware_helper looking at the environment variables the kernel package name is getting prepended to the firmware name

950110
.net-assembly	ildasm
if you want a tool that comes with the microsoft sdk rather than third party use ildasm the .net-assembly disassembler

950146
google-chrome	firefox
according to this stackoverflow answer they are supported but behind flags in google-chrome 60 firefox 54 and ms edge 15 with only safari 10.1 providing support without flags

950157
any	set
otherwise retain the correct hits and process them to see if any pattern can be established generate a new set of name-value pairs

950165
directory	folder
with maven and axistools-maven-plugin the generated sources are places in a different source folder in the target directory

950182
document	element
the # selector selected an element with the id #first1 in the html document which would be the first div since id s are supposed to be unique

950194
put	get
look into why using put post get and others is important

950198
value	field
b specify the parameters as object field value - for example user name would refer to the name field in some user object

950202
c-preprocessor	macros
see macros definition and expansion in c-preprocessor

950211
json	xml
any serialization solutions json xml binary yaml ... are fine

950218
json	xml
not sure about a xml path but you could convert the json to xml easily - after all both are tree structures

950234
attributes	properties
there are attributes that can be applied to classes and or properties that control serialization

950235
required	checked
then on restrict pages i just checked to see if the user had the required level of access to view the page

950258
for-loop	loops
if it s limited to the scope of the for-loops definitely declare it inside the loops

950269
webforms	asp.net
is there a realistic way to implement a webforms stylegridview in asp.net mvc with inline editing

950270
windows-xp	windows
the file name is slightly misleading - the downloadable pdf file shows these guidelines both for windows vista and windows-xp

950272
value	field
so for example if i have a field with the value johan and i pull up the form and clear out that value it still says johan after the update

950289
spaces	output
if i was examining the output i ll run it through tidy to clean it up if it were required to take a good look at it - but validators don t care about extra spaces or tabs either

950296
bazaar	git
distributed version control systems are just for you look for bazaar git or mercurial

950340
show	next
so that the portion that doesn t fit on the screen isn t show as opposed to show on the next line

950349
updating	updates
as has been previously stated hibernate will updates the object that you call updates on and then cascade down to any subsequent objects that require updating following the rules you specify in the cascade attributes

950349
persistence	hibernate
is via an intermediate assocation class . java persistence with hibernate p

950351
look-and-feel	nimbus
i suggest never using gtk or nimbus look-and-feel if you plan on customizing the look in any way

950370
logfile	tail
i recommend instead to use log4j and watch the logfile either with a tail command - there s also a tail for windows - either with an eclipse plugins like logwatcher

950371
message	toast
we are considering a jabber-based solution but has anyone used a jabber client to pop up alert messages on the screen like .net send does as opposed to just bringing a chat windows to the front or display a temporary toast message near the system tray

950371
message	alert
we need the alert message to be persistent and only dismissed by the user indicating they have seen it

950374
.net	wcf
the great majority of the bcl base class library is available on mono with the exception of some of the .net 3.0 3.5 stuff such as wpf which has minimal support currently and wcf almost non-existent support

950374
unique	words
what s quite cool and unique about the mono c# compiler is that is now offers a compiler service - in other words true dynamic compilation from code without using the codedom

950378
click	mouse
the mouse is not being moved or click

950384
oracle	mysql
you can use them with access oracle sql server mysql anything

950384
business-objects	data-access
my normal procedure is to have a sort of one-way translation tier between the business and data-access layers so that the business layer only deals with business-objects and the data layer only returns generic data

950384
business-objects	data-access
i ll write my data-access methods to return datatables or datareaders the the translation tier will use a factory pattern to convert those rows into the desired strongly-typed business-objects

950387
value	field
of course after using as my empty value i had to trim it whenever i needed to check if the field was indeed blank

950395
build-process	ant
i m interested to move a project based on seam 2.1.1 from ant to maven to integrate some tools in the build-process like testability explorer and others

950417
xsd	xml
what graphical software do you recomend to validate a xml file against xsd definition file

950428
favicon	web
i have no favicon on my web site so there are numerous of failed log entry and i decided to rewrite favicon get request to a page that will generate blank file and return it to a browser

950455
google-search	adsense
if you need your site searchable try adding a google-search box through adsense and setting up a sitemap

950484
debugging	trace
i would suggest debugging your extension with the help of wt trace and watch data - it is particularly useful when you need to locate the exact subroutine that is returning an error which might provide you with better insight on the problem

950498
space	input
you could use one thread with two non-blocking sockets and use selected to wait for incoming input and space in output queue

950503
message	toast
openfire is a java based jabber server that seems to be targeted to a corporate business environment and provides the toast message feature with their spark client

950504
value	field
if you don t have a unique value you can still expand the above code to check for all field instead of just the id and use and to connect them id not in ... and other_field not in ... etc

950511
credentials	security
if so is the channel failing to be created correctly - as with message security the client and server must perform the hadnshake both providing their credentials to open a security channel

950525
first-class-functions	lambda
not really used unrealscript but you could surely achieve the same thing in any language that supports first-class-functions lambda

950538
cassini	iis
yet when i rebuild and run the site again on my local machine with iis not cassini the value of system.configuration.configurationmanager.appsettings prod still returns true instead of false

950544
order	add
i have some legacy sql and i want to split it up into it s constituent parts then add more criteria an order by clause etc

950575
order	join
you could write some units tests say one test that does 1000000 inserts one that performs some selected simple or complex - grouping by join etc one that does some deletes and run these tests either in order or in parallel or even multiple instances of one of the tests or whatever

950587
textbox	button
now from the xcode s interface buser-interfacelder i want to be able to instantiate that squareclass into a square object with global scope in such a way that when i create actions from any user-interface controls i.e textbox button etc... i want to be able to call methods of that object within those actions

950600
buffering	streaming
it supports streaming of enumerator items so you can skip records etc - rather than buffering everything but to efficiently seek to a random element i expect you d need some kind of index

950606
groovy	java
one of the improvements we are looking into at the moment is using groovy instead of java for the tests

950626
cassini	iis
the comment with iis not cassini could mean you have a published separate version in iis

950634
buffering	streaming
obviously it s a lot more efficient to read into a buffering than to read a byte at a time but this reduces the number of statements as you don t need to declare both a buffering and a variables to hold the return-value from streaming

950646
python	c++
personally i think the easiest method i ve seen for this is languages like python and ruby which allow manipulation of the interface but it s a runtime mechanism to c++ s compile time metaprogramming facilities so it is like comparing apples and oranges

950659
credentials	security
i ve been digging through wcf security in an apparently vain attempt to create a service endpoint behavior that allows me to specify the client username password credentials but not to authenticate them i m happy to use the built in functionality for that

950659
.net	wcf
i m using wcf with .net 3.5 sp1

950668
oracle	mysql
since it can with oracle mysql and ms server server it has remained a perfect database solution for us

950690
command-pattern	visitor
this one illustrates how to use visitor + command-pattern cooperation

950697
double	int
as far as i know though any numerical type int double decimal etc. will

950709
constructor	object
the compiler must see the declaration of the class for two reasons it must know the size it must allocate as others have already pointed out but also because the compiler must know how to construct the object does it have a default constructor implicitly defined default constructor no default constructor

950709
constructor	object
the compiler must know even if the object can be created with a no argument constructor

950717
typedef	struct
you start by typedef ing a struct providing create destroy functions and then other setters getters doers to operate on that struct

950717
typedef	struct
typedef struct

950717
typedef	struct
the important point is this as soon as you typedef a struct users of the type are not allowed to access its members

950717
typedef	struct
a typedef struct means private keep out

950724
strategy-pattern	composite
i am trying to convert my visitor pattern explained in the prior post into a composite strategy-pattern

950754
deployment	install
ideally i d like to do this in a platform-independent pure java way as the install will need to run on several different platforms but in case this isn t possible solutions for windows are preferred as that s the most common deployment platform

950756
value	field
when i have a form field name that is the same name as a field in the route the value passed in is my form field data not the route data

950769
font-size	display
once they have chosen a font-size and click done that view goes away and the tableview display again

950793
data-structures	tree
engineering programming courses usually cover simple algorithmic concepts like recursion and divide-and-conquer quicksort and the fft and simple data-structures like linked lists and tree

950794
implements	extends
if you create a class extends uiview then you can make the file s owner for your xib implements the extended class

950795
disposable	dispose
also the presence of a close methods might imply that the type is disposable e.g if you have a reference to an xmlreader which is idisposable you can t see the dispose methods because it is implements explicitly

950819
selected	button
i believe if you go to the server explorer view - server explorer click the add connection button and selected microsoft sql-server compact 3.5 .net data provider for microsoft sql-server compact 3.5 might say 2.0 in your case as your data source there is an option to choose a database from your local computer or from an activesync connected device

950824
virtual-machine	vmware
i am using a virtual-machine vmware to run my confluence jira and svn inside a server with 3 other virtual-machines

950845
deployment	install
large-scale deployment is not the easiest task though as you technically need to install 2 applications on the device

950851
highlight	selected
you can selected large sections by simply highlight a range and hitting the spaces bar

950856
prerequisites	nsis
then i use nsis to pack the msi the bootstrapper and the prerequisites framework sql ce... into a single setup.exe

950860
textbox	button
the interface will change in time the client will want this button to the left not on the right colored blue not yellow this textbox larger and a different font these are details for later if you provide an interface with the specs you risk discussing those minor details instead of the important functionalities

950863
dictionary	arrays
javascript objects and jscript dictionary are both associative arrays

950867
compact-framework	.net
retrieving the windows ce device id with the microsoft .net compact-framework

950868
concatenation	comma
interesting note notice that i wanted the roles flattened out and concatenation with comma so i did this using a wrapper accessor that uses the aggregate operator

950878
put	get
and i have a servlet which tries to get the parameter that i put in the ajax methods but isn t finding any parameters in the request object

950878
arrays	loops
i ve also tried putting a bigger arrays in the params and that doesnt work either the loops still doesn t iterate

950889
arrays	loops
it is an arrays so you can loops over it easily using foreach

950917
xsd	xml
if databinding is what you are after then you can use the xsd tool generate a clr class for you from your xml schema if it exists

950927
javascript	dom
javascript resource requests are indeed blocking but there are ways around this to wit dom injected script tags in the head and ajax requests which without seeing the page myself is likely to be what s happening here

950928
credentials	account
most clients are domain account and connect to the service using their default credentials

950928
.net	wcf
the .net framework provides these as a homogenous way to provide network credentials but with wcf this seems to have been thrown out in favour of a new incompatible system based on the unrelated system.servicemodel.description.clientcredentials class

950928
system.net	wcf
it s also a bit inconsistent the system.net mailsettings smtp network configuration element allows credentials to be specified so why not wcf

950963
revision	svn
prevent edits to revision props other than svn log

950963
revision	svn
prevents edits to revision properties other than svn log alternate version

950975
arrays	loops
when i perform a foreach loops over an associatve arrays in php the order in which it is performed is the order in which it is defined

950992
binary	hex
when i open such a binary formatted serialization stream using a hex viewer a simple drag ndrop into vs will do i can see there s assembly information contained in this stream

950995
dictionary	map
map dictionary collection stack

951003
document	element
the markup in the document following the root element must be well-formed

951003
document	element
rg.jdom.input.jdomparseexception error on line 92 the markup in the document following the root element must be well-formed

951025
getter	setter
if you use setprice to do this then setproduct would also do this and they would forever call each other in the second line hence i create an explicit link methods instead of using the setter and getter

951033
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval do everything you need

951055
while-loop	loops
running a sleep or a while-loops will cause the user s browser to hang until the loops is done

951077
configuration	environment
we use rsa protected configuration to encrypt sections of our web.config manually after the webapp has been deployed to the new environment

951099
any	set
the easiest way is to go to any directory that contains your configuration file and set a property on it

951123
worksheet	excel
it turns out this provider was able to connect correctly to an excel 2003 worksheet but couldn t read it

951123
worksheet	excel
thus i opened the worksheet in excel 2007 and re-saved it in the .xlsx format and changed my connection string accordingly

951131
radio	click
for radio button you should use the click event

951131
radio-button	selected
although it may sound strange but the click event will also fire when selected the radio-button with the keyboard so there are no issues with accessibility

951134
contains	any
setting bundles are based on plist files and do not contains any code

951152
strncpy	strcpy
basically you can t write a drop in replacement for strcpy that takes the same arguments and hope to avoid the problems that produced strncpy in the first place and better replacements beyond that

951153
stderr	stdout
try iirc the log output of cvs is to stderr not stdout so the pipe doesn t catch that by default

951157
twitter	tweets
d get the newest tweets from twitter update the object serialization it and write in the cache again

951168
value	field
or for an bunch of boolean value you can store them in a varbinary field and use the bitwise exclusive operator to compare them--you should end up with 0s

951176
children	nodes
the selector #counts span will pick up any tags that are a child of #counts or a children of its children etc. so my guess is that you re accidentally selected more nodes than you meant to grab

951183
compact-framework	.net
the .net compact-framework is basically a subset from the full framework so it is pretty similar

951184
scriptaculous	jquery
scriptaculous provides some nice effects but in my opinion has been surpassed by jquery and its available plugins

951189
arraylist	treeset
i too typically use arraylist but i will use treeset or hashset depending on the circumstances

951192
scriptaculous	jquery
prototype and scriptaculous jquery mootools or moofx are some

951197
contains	elements
if that returns 10000 then the elements contains a different value than you think so you can try

951203
value	field
firstly the django docs strongly recommend not using null value for string-based field such as charfield or textfield

951207
markup	xhtml
i have a huge swathe of xhtml 1 compliant markup

951211
silverlight	wpf
i m clearly missing something important about how resources or xaml files are processed or used in a project i did not have any experience with wpf before silverlight

951212
value	field
3 when i assign value to ultramaskededitor field it display them on the screen with what appears to be random numbers of spaces inserted

951214
scriptaculous	jquery
i d personally say that mootools and prototype scriptaculous are the two best libraries if your only interested in the gui aspect of it although jquery has also recently seriously stepped up its animations and effects

951236
getattr	setattr
using getattr and setattr

951241
contains	any
it s easy enough to iterate through the controls collection recursively but i d also like to check on first load whether the control exists in any of the templates contenttemplate edititemtemplate itemtemplate selecteditemtemplate etc contains in a control as well

951247
document	element
the obvious question is the markup in the document following the root element well-formed

951252
xsd	xml
i have a sql dts job pull an xml file and doing a sqlxmlbulkload using an xsd file

951262
value	field
in groovy i have a parent class and a child class where the parent class s constructor tries setting the value of a field of the parent class using a closure as in the following code

951262
value	field
i don t understand why groovy thinks the value field is a property of the child class

951273
web-applications	webserver
assuming that the webserver has multiple cpus i suppose that you could assign this web app to its own application pool and set the affinity to a particular processor to limit the impact on the other web-applications

951281
groovy	java
as cesar said type checking is a run-time process one of the major reasons that groovy is slower than java not that that s really bad

951293
double-quotes	single-quotes
python offers exactly the same choice single or double-quotes are equivalent and my preferences like yours is for single-quotes -- fewer pixels less-cluttered appearance is how i rationalize it

951301
rollback	commit
now i could just open it in myresource use a regular servlet filtering to make sure i always close it but then i don t know when to rollback and when to commit the session

951325
postgresql	mysql
i m contemplating the switch mainly because of the more permissive license and tend to hear a lot of internet murmuring about how much better postgresql is than mysql but not many specifics

951325
updating	updates
on duplicates key updates makes inserting updating many to many tables quick and painless

951334
webforms	asp.net
i ve been working with asp.net webforms for about 5 years now and am fairly confident my code is at least secure enough to stop most known attacks

951350
export-to-pdf	export
if you re offering export functionality via the reportviewer the user can still export-to-pdf and print that

951352
shell	bash
there is contention that the -x option in bash is different from other shell see the comments

951352
solaris	linux
on other systems for example solaris and some more modern variants of linux bin sh is not bash and the two command lines would give slightly different results

951352
shell	bash
when debugging a bash shell script it will be sensible and sane â necessary even â to use the shell named in the shebang line with the -x option

951354
scriptaculous	jquery
my vote goes for prototype scriptaculous combo or jquery as well

951368
postgresql	mysql
postgresql s most useful features which mysql lacks in my opinion are

951374
genetic-algorithm	heuristics
i already have a tsp heuristics based on a genetic-algorithm it assumes a complete graph starts with a set of random solutions as a population and works to improve the population for a number of generations

951376
put	get
what i want is to get vehicles assigned to x user and put it in a drop-down

951387
wordpress	blogs
what i m lookin for could be simplifyed ith the articles-custom-fields in wordpress blogs

951416
elevated-privileges	privileges
this requires that the application is executed with elevated-privilegess for which we use a manifest containing a trustinfo section. this further requires that the .msi is configured to run this application without impersonation which otherwise confounds the privileges elevation.

951435
textbox	button
i have a webforms textbox in a gridview and i want to higlight the text on a button click

951435
selected	textbox
selected works on windows forms textbox but not webforms textbox

951439
value	field
so now you can retrieve data in 1 fast query split field to categories and parsing their value by their respective datatypes with your code without performance issues

951477
ruby	php
we are trying to calculate a hmac-sha256 digest in coldfusion and we are using the hmac cfc but in one case it is producing a different result for the digest compared to ones generated in different languages - have tried the same data using ruby php and get the expected result

951489
exception-handling	try-catch
in my experience the biggest problem with try-catch blocks are we often try to catch exception-handling too generically

951489
exception-handling	try-catch
for instance if i wrap my main function with a try-catch block that catches ... i am basically trying to not allow my program to crash b c of a thrown exception-handling

951514
getter	setter
if you really have all those getter and setter then you need to validate your class better than in the constructor

951519
python	c++
the example below is for python but the ideas apply to c++ as well

951523
.net	wcf
from my extensive delightful experience reading .net and wcf documentation that

951535
databound	gridview
a templates is used to render multiple copies of a databound control a databound dropdownlist in several rows in a gridview come from one templates

951546
associations	model
your proposed model is composed of two database patterns an entity-attribute-value table and a polymorphic associations

951546
json	xml
if you don t need to access the additional attributes in queries then you can serialize the attribute value mapping to a text field in some standard serialization json xml

951556
communication	messages
one trick i read about but the site is now gone is to use a flash module to handle socket communication and relay messages to javascript

951556
google-chrome	safari
ie6 7 8 ff3 safari google-chrome

951563
callback	methods
the callback on the animation methods are called after the previous animation is complete

951571
exception-handling	try-catch
in most languages entering and exiting a try-catch block via the normal methods is free it s only when an exception-handling is thrown that the exception-handling handler looks up where to handle the exception-handling

951573
put	get
with this you will get an runtime error if you try to put something into list that is not assignable from objtype

951590
radio-button	selected
then you lose the functionality of clicking on the labels to selected deselected your radio-button so you will have to add a mouse listener

951598
perl	php
and of course your php ends up looking like perl

951616
any	set
set -e makes the scripting stop immediately if any external program returns a non-zero exit status

951633
arrays	loops
switched to an arrays and now i don t even notice the loops running

951641
selected	textbox
this should ensure that when the onfocus event is raised the textbox will be selected as well

951651
meta-inf	war
within the resources directory you might also have a meta-inf directory and or a web-inf directory in an application packaged as a war

951662
mouseover	mouseout
if you use the jquery library you can use the .hover event which merges the mouseover and mouseout event and helps you with the timing and child elements

951699
callback	methods
that should add the errors it might be caused by a model callback or maybe something that your validate methods does

951700
sql-server	oracle
think about oracle sequences and sql-server identity fields for example

951714
spaces	output
there aren t any line-breaks or spaces in the output produced but i hope it gives you the general idea

951716
internet-explorer	firefox
i have firefox as the default browser and of course internet-explorer

951719
compact-framework	.net
windows mobile c++ or .net compact-framework javame if you install the java runtime manually

951725
perl	php
it s got a great design is written in c and uses swig for language bindings java perl php python ruby tcl. i know people have had it running on most of the major platforms

951727
meta-inf	jar
meta-inf for jar files

951771
32-bit	64bit
so in the mixed structure you have 3 32-bit integer after them there must be inserted an other 32bit padding to have the 64bit integer correctly aligned

951771
32-bit	64bit
the size difference should vanish if you insert and even number of 32-bit field before your 64bit field

951773
session-cookies	cookies
definitely an interesting idea to use persistent claimed_id cookies rather than persistent session-cookies in order to make the user s life easier -- they only have to log out of their op and close the browser

951784
32-bit	64bit
this is caused due to structure aligning struct a has 3 32-bit values followed by a 64bit one

951784
32-bit	64bit
regardless of the packing of the first 3 elements the 64bit element definitely won t start between boundaries taking up half of two separate 64bit values on 64bit so there is at least a 32-bit padding between the 3rd and 4th element

951816
zend-framework	cakephp
i ve not used cakephp - my experience is with zend-framework which i like a lot not that it s flawless

951822
pascal	basic
pascal stang s avrlib provides libraries for basic networking arp ip icmp dhcp etc. which could be built upon to provide http and snmp if you find nothing pre-coded

951830
primitive-types	reference-type
primitive-types and reference-type are completely separate

951830
primitive	int
a primitive int is not a subtyping of int nor object

951848
comparator	sortedset
of course it could be done with a custom comparator a sortedset of custom objects or by simply sorting the arrays and then searching for the indices in the original arrays shudder

951855
lookup	any
consider the impact that new table will have on unit-testing how to verify the contents of the lookup table are valid and not changed any overlap

951880
javascript	dom
if you want to do it via javascript this code should work for most dom browsers.

951888
display	height
and display none isn t the same as setting it to zero height

951891
ms-access	mysql
i m migrating some data from ms-access 2003 to mysql 5.0 using ruby 1.8.6 on windows xp writing a rake task to do this

951927
strncpy	strcpy
by declaring strcpy and strlen forbidden and taking 2-3 days out of the project to replace them with custom strncpy strnlen in all these projects we suddenly could run for days instead of hours

951958
lightbox	jquery
i am using a jquery plugin called lightbox which is great btw

951958
lightbox	preload
problem is i am accessing images on external sites and i think they are blocking lightbox from preload them

951987
contains	elements
you can affect the document with contains the iframe by setting and getting variables from the windows elements

951991
hash	md5
prf generation in ssl uses both md5 and sha1 in a bid to prevent the system from being compromised if one of the hash algorithms were sufficiently compromised

951992
having	select
the query works as expected when i comment out sum invoices.amount from the select and having clause so its definitely connected to my invoices.amount field

952008
javascript	dom
you could always add the preload img tags to the dom in a hidden div instead of loading them with javascript

952011
codeigniter	symfony
there are a multitude of php frameworks out there cake symfony codeigniter zend etc. and each has it s advantages and disadvantages

952040
silverlight	wpf
do you have any best practices for setting up header lines forms also known as header details in wpf or silverlight

952058
exception-handling	try-catch
since this is all runtime based entering or exiting a try-catch produces no penalty good but throwing an exception-handling involves potentially many lookups producing a much slower throw

952058
exception-handling	try-catch
i personally prefer the not-having-to-pay for try-catch blocks because exception-handling should be a very rare circumstance

952058
exception-handling	try-catch
this produces a cost during entering and exiting a try-catch block however when an exception-handling is thrown the runtime mechanism can quickly pop off the stack to find where to go

952066
silverlight	wpf
there are many gems that would be relevant in the composite client appilcation guidance even though you re not using wpf or silverlight

952070
javascript	dom
functions that are called in the tag s onload event are only fired when the dom is loaded however it does not wait for external dependencies such as javascript files and css to load so you can be sure that when your somefunc function is called if attached to the tag s onload event the elements in the page have been loaded

952090
thickbox	jquery
jquery for dom manipulation and thickbox my favorite light box plugin but i use prototype for ajax right now

952126
scheme	lua
most naturally written in lexically scoped languages scheme javascript lua

952127
jsplitpane	jtable
i am working inside of a quite complex eclipse based application and having a problem with a jtable based custom component inside of a jsplitpane

952127
selected	cell
the specific problem that i m having right now is that the table component is selected the wrong cell when i click on it

952127
selected	cell
if i select a cell in row 0 column 0 the cell that actually gets selected is at row 2 column 0 which is about 20 pixels below the actual click

952127
selection	cell
this only happens if the table is in a jsplitpane though if i just add the table itself to a panels cell selection is correct

952127
show	next
because of all the custom components involved i can t actually get a small app that show the problem but i have the next best thing which is an app that show the layout that i have of course it doesn t actually have the same problems

952137
python	perl
longer since python 2 s is integer division while perl s is floating-point

952156
unordered	iterator
sadly the msdn docs on for each state that the for each construct is there explicit for cases where the order of the iterator is unimportant unordered sets and the like

952158
json	xml
you can return some sort of encoded data json xml and insert that into the correct spot on the page

952162
show	next
because of all the custom components involved i can t actually get a small app that show the problem but i have the next best thing which is an app that show the layout that i have of course it doesn t actually have the same problems

952162
jsplitpane	jtable
for jtable and jsplitpane work fine alone

952165
double-quotes	spaces
use double-quotes whenever you work with files to allow files with spaces in the name

952178
triggers	insert
the audit triggers for each table should insert into an auditrecord table which captures the table name primary key id action type insert update delete original field values and updated field values

952181
value	field
as yishai said if you don t assign a value boolean field default to false

952183
having	select
what happens if you comment out the having clause but leave sum invoices.amount in the select clause

952183
aggregate-functions	sum
collation settings can affect some aggregate-functions but admittedly i don t see why it would alter the results of sum

952186
python	ruby
d language especially the 2.0 version has learnt from ruby python and lots of modern languages without keeping source compatibility with c still allowing for raw access to the metal

952190
order	add
i don t reorder methods or properties when i add a new because the visual-studio editor order them in the object selection drop-down-list

952204
ncover	fxcop
ncover nunit fxcop sandcastle wix lokad shared-libraries autofac fxcop etc

952204
project-management	project
project-management approach start project in a pm style a lot of planning clarification and prototyping get to the first release minimal functionality all services are mocked plain user-interface then turn on continuous-integration and switch to agile while still using pm to plan and schedule on a larger scale

952227
for-loop	arrays
to reverse an use enumerable.reverse - but if you need to iterate in reverse over a collection which is indexed by position such as an arrays or then it would be more efficient to use a for-loop starting at the end and working backwards

952264
directory	folder
the code above works well for recursively finding what files directory lie in a folder on my c

952268
comma	words
i have a plain text file with words which are separated by comma for example

952279
vbscript	jscript
implement such as vbscript jscript

952282
exception-handling	try-catch
2 get rid of that try-catch block as it will eat all exception-handling including the ones you want to know about

952311
foundation	cocoa
kvo also serves as part of the foundation of cocoa bindings which are unfortunately not present in the iphone sdk

952317
textbox	button
i decided to go with c# because it was so easy to just open a form and plop some button and textbox on it

952319
administration	host
wsh provides a low-memory scripting host that is ideal for non-interactive scripting needs such as logon scripting administration scripting and so on

952319
protected-mode	real-mode
wsh can be run from either the protected-mode windows-based host wscript.exe or the real-mode command shell-based host cscript.exe

952333
seam	jsf
also since seam knits together jsf and ejb3 so the next step is to learn each of these

952337
procedural-programming	procedural
you re asking for a comparison between a procedural language and a functional language so i feel your question can be answered here what is the difference between procedural-programming and functional-programming

952340
associations	model
the model specified in your model associations should be in lowercase with each word being separated by an underscore

952365
csv	xml
i m trying to write an xslt that will transform an xml document that i have to a csv file

952374
unique	words
i presumed you wanted the words to be unique on a single line rather than throughout the file

952379
functional-programming	imperative
two main benefits of functional-programming languages compared to imperative languages are 1

952379
functional-programming	imperative
both imperative and functional-programming languages have their uses

952384
double	int
typedef std list std pair int double pairlist

952443
functional-programming	imperative
general benefits of functional-programming over imperative languages

952443
functional-programming	imperative
the advantages of c# are that it s often more accurate to imperative -applications user-interface imperative algorithms than a functional-programming language that the .net it uses is designed imperatively and that it s more widespread

952444
webforms	asp.net
however let is be said that you can use asp.net webforms and produce some decent applications

952444
httphandler	httpmodule
control of html is yours through httpmodule and httphandler and some of the issues mentioned above are fixed in asp.net 4.0

952444
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i just listened to a great podcast comparing asp.net-mvc and webforms

952454
cisco	ipsec
i cannot run the cisco ipsec client sw on the host because it is 64bit cisco doesn t support 64bit on its ipsec client product and i don t have alot of choices at the moment in terms of moving to cisco s ssl vpn client anyconnect

952460
put	get
that can get you into trouble if you maybe have oracle.dataaccess installed on your dev machine which would put it in the gac but when you deploy you just copy the .dll into place on the production machine

952476
panels	grid
when writing the xaml for my user-controls should i remove grid and use dock panels or what

952498
panels	grid
you can nest a grid in a dock panels and vice versa

952511
windows-xp	windows
non-ie users the sound is the program events windows default beep windows-xp ding.wav

952518
display	width
if i give textrenderer.measuretext some text to measure and width to use it will return the height needed to display that text

952518
display	width
if i give that text width and height to a linklabel it would display the text in the width and height provided with nothing clipped off

952541
key-value	key
i am building some postgresql tables from python dictionary where the key-value pairs correspond to column key and field value

952544
keyboard	mouse
is there a way to open that menu with the keyboard so i don t have to reach my mouse

952545
contains	elements
in this example chainedlistitem is a container for an elements of a single-linked list which contains a field of the very same type to point to the next item in the list

952557
instances	private
i m not sure how you would even access the instances since it is private

952579
configuration	logging
websphere has that though not very streamlined but you can also alter connection pool sizes data sources thread pool sizes change the logging configuration very high granularity and activate memory and jvm profiling

952595
double	int
with value types any struct including int float double etc the type is passed with zeros so the following are equivalent

952599
swing	swt
examine the documentation for swing or swt for information on the event models of those gui toolkits

952625
firefox	opera
the page break works in firefox and ie but not in safari 4 nor opera

952625
safari	opera
i can t seem to find a way to force a page break within a table in safari and opera

952647
append	input
is there a way to construct an input stream or reader that transparently append all these files so that

952648
python	ruby
the thing is it has to be written in python or in ruby and have a verbose mode trace mode or very helpful debugging techniques

952648
python	ruby
edit when i said debugging i wasn t referring to debugging python or ruby

952657
double	int
edit i ve experimented a bit and i noticed that performance improved a bit by converting the coordinates which were previously in double to int to prevent wpf anti-aliasing sub-pixel lines

952659
hash	md5
the best way would be to use a hash function such as md5 or sha1 to generate it then you can truncate it at the desired length

952663
sql-server	oracle
the one thing i ve found frustrating is finding a simple way to test an oracle stored proc such as sql-server s exec sp_name param1 param2 paramn syntax

952665
conditional	operators
conditional operators

952665
conditional	operators
the conditional operators the question mark and colon in expression like has some ability to tell you if two types can be coerced into a third type that article is about c++ but the type-safety of the conditional operators is the same in c

952665
conditional	operators
both of these techniques typeof and the conditional operators are limited to what information is available at compile time

952681
ms-access	oracle
i need to create a linked table from ms-access to a view in oracle

952681
any	set
is there any way i can specify the primary key or tell access not to set a primary key so that the primary key prompt doesn t appear

952686
udp	tcp
any kind of proprietary communication protocol running over udp or tcp would fit this description

udp	tcp
we have a handful of applications that communicate with embedded systems using tcp and udp all using specialized protocols

952706
httpd.conf	.htaccess
to my httpd.conf in the hope that my .htaccess file in the htdocs folder will be picked up with the following rules

952710
udp	tcp
this would mean udp tcp peer-to-peer etc

952720
udp	tcp
that ranges from third party communication products like tibco to fix over tcp sockets to in-house frameworks over udp multicast

952727
direct3d	directx
edit changed directx in original answer to direct3d

952739
webforms	asp.net
i m working on a web site written using asp.net webforms

952742
firefox	safari
tested in safari 4 and firefox 3

952761
insertafter	appendto
in particular you should look at append content appendto content prepend content prependto content replacewith content after content before content insertafter content and insertbefore content

952776
communication	messages
in your case i d guess that directshow is communication with another com object internally. if it s properly written a modal loop will still dispatch messages to the other windows on the same thread

952780
oracle	mysql
the rake task to dump the schema calls into the activerecord connection adapter for mysql and oracle

952780
postgresql	firebird
postgresql sqlite sql server and firebird call out to a vendor-provided executable

952786
any	set
typically any kind of entire result set object will not be fully constructed until the full row set has been received successfully

952786
enumerator	any
however an enumerator object like getfirstrow getnextrow typically will bring down a chunk of rows at a time so you wouldn t know the connection died until the current buffer was exhausted if it buffers any rows and it tries to fetch the next row from the db

952821
arrays	loops
i have two loops running in my code i want to use an element from an arrays as the key in a second arrays but am unsure how to do this with smarty

952825
git-status	git-add
but if i do git-add . and then git-status i get

952831
variables	boolean
if that s not possible you can use a simple boolean variables to protect the structure

952831
any	set
if it s set then simply abort any attempt to update it or queue the update for later

952835
twitter	tweets
is it possible using the twitter api to retrieve a list of all hashtags present within a single tweets

952852
contains	any
any argument that contains whitespace should be surrounded in

952861
firefox	gecko
sometimes it is the gecko engine firefox that misbehaves

952861
internet-explorer	opera
that is not only should internet-explorer ignore the firefox-only rules but also webkit and opera should

952864
value	field
usually this means the jvm was unable to complete static initialization for that class assign value to any static field and run any blocks

952870
contains	any
a non-clustered index on the column will yield the same performance as the clustered key as long as the non-clustered index contains all the fields in the index or as include columns for any selected statement against it a so-called covering index

952870
contains	lookup
with a covering index you achieve the same result - if the index plus any include columns contains all the columns your selected statement needs to retrieve you can satisfy the query just by looking at the index - there s no need to jump from the non-clustered index into the actual table to fetch more data bookmark lookup which tends to be slow for lots of lookup

952910
emacs	vim
in fact that was the main reason i switched from emacs to vim

952934
git-branch	git-rebase
duplicating the patch queue onto an old maintentance branch - use git-branch and git-rebase

952943
methods	extend
the extend methods in your example modifies x instead of returning a useful value which reduce expects

952964
for-loop	loops
the most common scenario for update is when you change a property say label1.text which will invalidate the label in a for-loops and that loops is temporarily blocking the message-loops

952976
strstr	strchr
that reads thousands of transactions files using the normal fopen fgets etc which we parsing using normal c functions strstr strchr etc and return back a normalized char

952988
32-bit	64bit
so far the only difference i see is that addroledef takes a 64bit unsigned integer as one of the parameters and addrole takes a 32-bit unsigned integer

953017
click	mouse
when using a touch screen monitor the mouse does not move out of the button so the raised border stays on screen even when you click on a different button

953079
innodb	myisam
innodb enforces foreign keys myisam does not

953083
any	set
is there any way to set the scroll positioning to a default value

953092
environment	building
the error-handling is only needed to avoid scripting errors when someone building the project on a environment without the correct folder structure

953145
digits	zero
to_char format model fm00 give two digits leading zero

953150
google-maps	bing-maps
the user could enter something like this similar to google-maps bing-maps etc...

953153
ubuntu	linux
i tried to install the linux jdk 1.4 from the sun download site on ubuntu 9.04 but it wouldnt install

953156
windows-xp	windows
home users ended up with shudder windows me instead which was released about the same time and for that reason have almost completely moved on to windows-xp

953173
rabbitmq	activemq
for implementations that can run on the windows platform activemq runs on windows as does rabbitmq

953176
required	checked
this required me to checked that the dll is registered and register if it isn t but seems this is the only way i can find and keep my sanity to get this done

953185
tokenize	parsing
and that would pretty much rule out using separate lexing parsing phases since the linq parsing would define a whole different set of tokenize rules than the parent parsing

953197
document	element
in xslt is there a way to determine where you are in an xml document when processing an element

953197
document	element
the context of this question i have a very large very deep document that i want to traverse exhaustively generically using recursion and if i find an element with a particular attributes i want to know where i found it

953203
ruby	php
ideally this would be a way via php ruby or the linux command line

953219
document	element
it will walk every element in an xml document and output the path to that element in a style similar to the one you ve described

953220
any	set
if you can set that point to any arbitrary location then there is no reason to make that data private

953224
arrays	map
a lua table is an associative arrays that can map values of any type except nil to values of any type again except nil

953244
typedef	struct
therefore it s fairly common to typedef struct foo as foo

953250
sqldatasource	gridview
bulk edit with gridview without xxxdatasource sqldatasource objectdatasource etc.

953251
georss	kml
ve has some nice capabilities of late including georss and kml support simple layers etc

953260
player	movie
this offers you a good detail tutorial on using the youtube-api and the chormeless player so you can control the movie on your own

953278
primitive	int
so if you ve got an int object you can just call compare or intvalue and if you ve got the primitive just check the value directly

953295
constructor	object
edit thanks i get that i just need another graphics object but the graphics object by itself does not have a public constructor so what i am looking for is a suggestion on what object i need to substatiate to be able to create a graphics object to draw on

953305
assign	add
then the control s event handler will be able apply the changes and add or remove controls assign different id s etc.

953343
value	field
the nsoutlineview has a custom nstextfieldcell subclass that adds an image next to the text field so i am passing the nsmanagedobject s value to it as an nsmutabledictionary called itemdictionary so i can pull and set the title and ischecked key value

953343
value	field
where i am running into issues is updating the text field s value and passing that changed value back to my managed object instance

953351
moss	wss
spm will allow you to extract the moss wss created xml that describes the list view it show up in the left hand property grid which you can then plop into your manifest.xml

953355
wordpress	phpbb
for example a blog running off wordpress a forum phpbb a store etc

953371
expression-blend	wpf
well not having expression-blend it seems that the tool xamlpadx allows you to extract the control template of the standard wpf slider

953372
document	element
document type does not allow element

953378
document	element
you probably have your element in your so essentially you re trying to create an in the head of your document which doesn t work

953388
conditional	operators
or using the ternary conditional operators

953403
parentheses	braces
unbalanced parentheses braces or brackets are not permitted

953403
parentheses	braces
you can parsing in two stages by groupinging parentheses braces brackets and then recursively parsing each grouping

953404
driver	kernel
kernel driver calls request_firmware fw_entry firmware device

953404
driver	kernel
kernel request_firmware returns and the driver has the firmware

953404
driver	kernel
kernel driver driver code calls release_firmware fw_entry releasing

953405
getter	setter
in the following setter i can access the property backing field directly or through the getter

953415
textbox	button
i have the following html which displays 3 textbox and an add button

953431
getter-setter	setter
this way only the getter-setter have access to the unprotected variables and you can confirm any invariants about this value looking only at the getter and setter rather than at the whole class

953435
any	set
if the userâ s task is simply to navigate to a particular set of parameters at the â œleavesâ of the hierarchy i probably wouldnâ t use any of the above options

953435
checkbox	textbox
this continues until the user gets to the end of the hierarchy at which time the windows displays the parameters using the appropriate controls textbox option buttons checkbox

953439
getter	setter
in the following setter i can access property backing field directly or through the getter

953503
tokenize	parsing
scanner-less parsing was invented to help solve the problem of composing different grammars the problem being that you quickly find that you can t write a universal tokenize scanner

953521
has-many-through	associations
this seems like it s not quite a has-many-through associations and not quite a polymorphic associations

953552
delphi	c++
if you need a rad environment for productivity then tools like delphi or c++ builder will give you a very fcl like feel delphi s vcl was architected by anders hejlsberg before he moved to ms so probably no co-incidence that c# feels very familiar to delphites

953560
server-side-includes	ssi
what about using server-side-includes ssi #

953587
vb.net	vb6
as3 c++ c# vb.net vb6 delphi java or similar languages will be fine for answers

953602
textarea	textbox
i m using tinymce textarea or textbox for an event logger app and i need the text to be formatted a certain way

953602
textarea	textbox
i can t figure out how to do this without a table which i cannot nest in the textarea or textbox

953625
perl	ruby
if i wanted to get a handle on the likelihood of a malicious gem occurring i d look at whether malicious packages have been detected in any language eg python egs or perl s cpan how likely it is that a malicious package has been produced without anyone noticing and whether ruby is at any greater risk than other languages

953627
value	field
in that case you can create a class with two properties one for the label and one for the value of that field

953633
frame-rate	fps
just to clarify i set the header fps using the swf metadata tag - swf frame-rate 60 - and the stage fps using stage.frame-rate 60

953635
hide	show
i m trying to hide show items based off of their workflow being approved using moss 2007

953647
nullpointerexception	classcastexception
if you were to search the java bug database just before 1.5 was released you d find seven times more bugs with nullpointerexception than classcastexception

953652
buffering	streaming
open a file streaming load the image into memory in a byte buffering

953652
buffering	streaming
open a webrequest.create with your url set methods to post nice long timeout request.content length to the length of the byte buffering open an instance of a streaming to your instance of the request.getrequeststreaming

953652
streamreader	writer
create a binary writer using the stream write the filebuffer close em open the web response start a streamreader to getresponsestream and check the bytes received match what you sent

953661
selected	checkbox
in interface builder if you selected the text field you can deselected the adjust to fit checkbox in the textfield attributes

953665
reliability	robustness
the .net effect of using generics especially in large programs is improved reliability and robustness

953672
contains	set
i think that it is important to point out the v3 api is a very early developer release and contains only a very basic set of features

953674
value	field
i am not sure if there is a better way to do this but this extension is very helpful whenever i want to have control over the default value of field in my object

953678
32-bit	64bit
and now i cannot launch the 32 bit application from the chm file because a 64bit process cannot load a 32-bit process

953678
32-bit	64bit
not sure what you mean by load a 32-bit process but a 32-bit process can most certainly create a 64bit process

953678
32-bit	64bit
for example if i have myapp32.exe a 32-bit application it can absolutely launch myapp64.exe a 64bit application

953678
32-bit	64bit
when you read about incompatibilities between 32- and 64bit code it refers to a 32-bit application loading a 64bit dll or vice versa

953687
winpcap	libpcap
on your libpcap question look at the winpcap links page and you will find jnetpcap

953689
textarea	textbox
you cannot -layout- content in a textbox or textarea

953704
contains	any
everything works fine when i am running the program in debugging mode and it uses the dll as intended but as soon as i go to build the project i get an errors that it could not reslove this reference and namespace of type specifier in the imports modbustcp doesn t contains any public member or cannot be found.

953708
python	lua
lisp python lua c++ java c

953710
member-functions	inline
i am trying to use inline member-functions of a particular class

953710
put	get
for some reason if i put the inline keyword in either one of the implementation and declaration as well as in both places i get linker errors as shown

953710
member-functions	inline
what needs to be in order to get rid of this error what am i doing wrong in terms of making these inline member-functions

953714
python	java
i m happy with a library in python java c++ c or something like that

953716
google-chrome	safari
you d need to look at google-chrome ie safari and any other browser you re interested in

953756
contains	set
first the set contains integer s are used in a for-each loop

953756
primitive	int
each element is declared to be an int and that is allowed as the int is unboxed back to the primitive int

953756
primitive	int
in the above lines autoboxing is in play -- the primitive int value 10 and 42 are being autoboxing into int objects which are being added to the set

953790
controller	routes
so you must have some code in your index.php file that routes the requested url to the appropriate controller correct

953795
any	set
in append.php you ll want to grab the contents of the output buffer clear the buffer and do any other processing of the content you want in this example i set a default page title

953810
keydown	keyup
handle the keydown and or the keyup event on your root grid

953813
keydown	keyup
silverlight 2 supports the keyup and keydown events only i believe - not keypress

953814
postgresql	mysql
postgresql has more established support for this but mysql has played catch up in the last year or so and has a working method of this in the latest versions

953814
postgresql	mysql
mysql s version is apparently marginally faster than postgresql but lacks some of the more advanced spatial features therefore it s pretty much limited to finding records that match a certain range of coordinates

953814
postgresql	mysql
i can t speak for microsoft s sql solution but for huge amounts of data you are going to want to stick with postgresql mysql for performance--unless you want to go with oracle but even then the performance difference would be negligible

953820
value	field
once the page has loaded manipulate the dom to remove the text value from the password field if the last login attempt was invalid

953828
http	ssl
that error means that the tidssliohandlersocketopenssl.passthrough property is being set to false which would happen when posting to an http url before tidssliohandlersocketopenssl.init has been called to intialize the ssl context first

953831
bind-variables	procedure
you just need a scripting that calls your stored procedure and has a bind-variables for the ref cursor output to display it in toad s grid in the editor windows

953842
constructor	private
see hibernate and spring transactions - using private constructor static factory methods but not a solution for avoiding the reflectively set properties or fields part

953846
versioning	staging
in addition it allows you to test the code on multiple target platforms while staging the latest versioning

953854
c++	lua
a large application using lua at its core such as adobe photoshop lightroom has an outer c c++ program that hosts the lua interpreter and provides access to its core features by registering c functions with that interpreter

953854
interpreter	runtime
i have found in my own projects that it is often the case that the stock standalone lua interpreter lua.exe or wlua.exe is sufficient for the outer application when combined with iup loaded at runtime along with one or two custom dll-based lua modules coded in c that implement features that require that level of performance or features that are implemented via other c-callable libraries

953858
constructor	object
these containers allow factory classes to collect your dependencies together and inject them as a single object into your constructor

953862
nofollow	noindex
to that i would think that a reasonable strategy would be to set 404 pages and placeholder pages to noindex nofollow and noarchive in their meta-tags

953874
hide	show
this is a callback for a jquery ajax function basically what is does is when all ajax is finished .ajaxstop it hide the loader then show the content

953889
ruby	php
but if you want to be cutting edge and possibly less stable.. then learn java or c# or ruby php asp.net for web dev

953893
hide	show
a solution we have done commercially in the past is basically the daemon writes to a log typically db with a date time stamp about what its doing and the web frontend just show the latest x amount of entries from the log with a little toggle to hide all of the looked in directory no file found messages worked fairly well we upgraded it later on with ajax timer that reloaded every 20 seconds

953896
sharing	share
for different repositories sharing the same libs i use an external reference to the repository hosting the libs so that they all share the same code

953898
postgresql	mysql
now if i want to put it on my own linode vps i have to configure mod_python or mod_wsgi as well as memcache ngix mysql or postgresql etc

953900
coldfusion	railo
of course this means that some frameworks are going to have to be rewritten for railo since this breaks full compatibility with adobe coldfusion

953911
any	set
is there any way to set the type of a func at runtime

953927
margins	padding
also you ll have to make sure that the body and html elements don t have any margins or padding

953930
any	set
i do not have any knowledge of the kerberos side of things because our environment was set up by an out and out kerberos guru and has fancy stuff like mutual trust set up between the ad domain that the sql-server is running in and the kerberos domain that my client was running in

953930
debugging	trace
i found the pyodbc to unixodbc to freetds odbc to tds integration pretty hard to trace debugging

953931
margins	padding
plus some padding margins and background-color code i think is inconsequential

953931
google-chrome	firefox
i don t completely understand why i have to have the sidebar div first but it this code works fine in firefox google-chrome safari windows and ie8

953943
platform	lgpl
as for the selectedion of external libraries you will be best served if you can stay away from platform dependent code libraries even if it seems more complex in the long run it will be more useful for you as an quick example you can trade directx for opengl the later is a bit more complex but more portable but it all depends on how complex you intend to be on your game you can selected a more general graphics engine ogre 3d lgpl and somehow bypass that low-level knowledge learning the basic of opengl would also be a well invested time even if you do skip direct use of it

953950
integer	digits
1 if your table uses integer keys likely add a check-sum digits to the identifier

953950
hash	md5
this has to be unique and usually not sequential - examples are a uuid guid or a hash md5 of the integer id but be careful of characters that are not compatible with http

953984
value	field
sometimes the property means something distinct to the value of the backing field in your example the property raises an event

954021
value	field
could i use reflection and store the property value of the employee object as fields in a lucene document plus store a binary-serialization version of the employee object into another field in the same lucene document

954024
switching	screens
no switching to full screens mode

954040
firefox	safari
html5 defines a contenteditable attribute that can be applied to any element including the body element it s supported in ie which i think invented the attribute safari 2.0 and firefox 3.x where x is at least 5

954047
google-chrome	safari
tested and confirmed in ff3 google-chrome safari win and most importantly ie6 ie7 even though i still hate ie

954069
processor	cpu
core two duo etc.. does each cpu core processor have its own cache

954085
logging	trace
p s there is this log switch command in devenv command but from what i learn it s only logging the activities not the stack trace

954088
value	field
in this case you would not want to access the field because you probably cannot guarantee that the value you are setting is above 0

954113
element	dynamic
numerical weather prediction finite element analysis computational fluid dynamic cfd computational physics and computational chemistry are just some of the areas in which you ll find it used

954129
tuples	set
if your language of choice supports sets a set of start end tuples is what you might be looking for

954141
dynamic-memory-allocation	fortran
i can t speak for other shops but i know that several of us use fortran 90 exclusively but there are many that still use fortran 77 because it s what they know what they re comfortable with and apparently things like dynamic-memory-allocation and free-form formatting aren t important to them

954143
click	mouse
probably the simplest is on each click event make a call top a methods that moves the mouse off off the button

954143
click	mouse
if that is not enough then you can disable the button that was click on move the mouse off refresh it and re-enable it

954171
button	popup
i ve a popup windows in which i need to enter values in somefields and click on submit button upon which the value is inserted in the main page

954171
value	field
i m able to insert the value into tht field and click on the submit button but after this the execution stops and i get the error timeout while internet-explorer busy

954181
unique	words
i m working on a large project i won t bother to summarize it here but this section of the project is to take a very large document of text minimum of around 50 000 words not unique and output each unique word in order of most used to least used probably top three will be a an and the

954181
unique	words
i was reading of counting sort and i like it but my concern is that the range of value will be too large compared to the number of unique words

954198
for-loop	loops
this allows a for-loops to be written as a foreach loops

954207
capacity	storage
it s far simpler than ensuring your local server static file storage is reliably backed up and you never have to worry about capacity

954212
value	field
field are automatically assigned the default value when the class is initialized

954224
arguments	default
the first optional arguments will also be used as the text in the running heads by default

954237
perl	php
python is a popular web language but it is well over shadowed by .net php java perl even ruby in popularity

954237
perl	php
.net and java have major corporate backers perl has been around forever php is ultra easy for beginners and ruby has been given james dean cool status

954239
silverlight	wpf
working with observablecollections in wpf and silverlight i often need to modify ordered lists without recreating them

954251
codeigniter	cakephp
i also know that i18n is supported in zend cakephp and codeigniter

954265
configuration	environment
detailed build documents for your environment that explain the configuration of all all machines and their software

954265
configuration	environment
a scripted install and config of sharepoint have you noticed there is a lot of things you need to do to get a sp environment off the ground after the initial configuration wizard completes

954265
installation	environment
lastly develop your site as sharepoint artifacts features webparts etc. and keep those under source code control along with all the build scripting and installation scripting needed to add them to the environment

954266
toolchain	gnu
the last c++ projects i worked on were a visual-c++ 6 project designed to interact with visual basic for mobile devices and several projects using the gnu toolchain circa gcc versions 2.x to 3.2

954268
textbox	button
if there are more results then the user should be able to click the next button to have the new data imported into the textbox

954278
libavcodec	ffmpeg
libavcodec a library behind ffmpeg and other heavily-used programs supports some common real video formats

954279
required	checked
while probing it checked for multiple combinations by append .dll or .exe looking in folder named assembly.exe .dll looking for assemblies targeted for specific cultures if required

954281
version-control	git
we are using git for version-control maven for our build system and we have bug tracking and continuous integration systems running so i believe the tools are there

954282
dictionary	arrays
for example here s my dictionary debugify i have these for list datatable param arrays etc.

954309
revision	svn
you would create a vendor branch for the open source java project in your main repo from their last svn revision before your modifications

954330
scheme	lisp
scheme macros hygienic macros are completely different from traditional lisp macros

954330
scheme	lisp
some implementations of scheme offer lisp macros in addition to scheme macros but this is not required by the scheme standard

954350
fieldset	labels
i recently found out about the fieldset and labels tags

954353
selected	checkbox
i m after a small jquery script that will check the appropriate checkbox based on what value is selected in a select element input

954364
.when	ready
that way the client proxy is automatically closed and disposed of .when the scope of the using block ends and your channel from the client to the server is release and the server is ready to receive another call from another client

954380
directory	folder
go into iis find the virtual directory that contains your project go into properties for that folder and in the virtual directory tab you ll see application settings near the bottom

954393
communication	messages
all that http will do is encrypt the communication between two points and prevent eavesdroppers -- it won t confirm who it was that sent the messages

954393
communication	messages
neither will it assure secure communication if your messages is then forwarded

954411
switching	router
this confusion may be encouraged by manufacturers putting the two logically separate devices in one piece of hardware a router with a 4-port switching

954411
switching	router
while we re at it a wireless router w 4 port switching is actually logically three separate devices router switching and access point

954418
safari	opera
yes this attributes first appeared in ie then it was added in mozilla about the end of 2003 then in opera 9 and safari 2

954445
typedef	struct
typedef struct #39

any	set
i need to write a code snippet that would compare multiple arrayss and produce the set that match the data in those arrayss produce the data set only in arrays a but not in arrays b c d in arrays b but not in a c d being able to handle any number of arrayss dynamically looped

954451
scala	java
the code should utilize anonymous functions in scala not like a regular array looping like in java

954478
integration	payment
so i m working on an app in django however this is my first time venturing into advance integration for a webapp with payment systems i used to work with paypal 2checkout so it was pretty no-skill-required

954487
data-annotations	xval
i never fully checked out the nerd diner example but other best practices include typed views and using a datamodeler that allows for easy validation see xval or the data-annotations model binder

954489
cursor	row
you do not have to use a cursor to insert each column as a separate row

954498
detect	move
i need a way to detect when the slider is not being move yet hasn t been release

954518
http	ssl
is there a way for some one to sneak in the to see data if my service is over http and the caller in my case is hosted on http service is on secure ssl host while caller is on simple http

954531
python	php
there is a way to keep a text file on my server but that only my php and python scripts would be able to read it and if the user just type the url of the file will obtain a forbitten state

954531
python	php
tha file will contain my database user and passord and other stuff like it must be in text-format becose i need to have just 1 file but i ll need to read it by many languages php and python for example in an easy way probably in json structure

954532
attributes	properties
any properties that don t have the data-members attributes will not be serialization

954534
http	ssl
either the conversation between those two is secured by ssl http but then both ends need to participate or not

954548
constructor	object
for any subclass of object with a static class member datum i want to be able to initialize create with a pointer to the constructor of that subclass

954568
http	ssl
when you connect to a server marked with server side ssl server marked with http it sends a copy of its cert to the client your browser which verifies if its a genuine cert

954575
filesystems	symlink
when you checkout a tree containing the link it restores the object as a symlink regardless of whether the target filesystems object exists or not

954597
udp	tcp
however i m looking for more than just what s below tcp udp sockets

954605
uiimage	nsdata
m stuck m trying to create an uiimage from a byte arrays which i get from a webservice.it comes embedded in a xml.i can parsing the xml and get the byte arrays as a string.then i convert the byte arrays which is in nsstring to nsdata

954613
lookup	any
although i can t give you an exact example in excel i m pretty certain excel has a function or two to lookup value from any website using a get request

954620
udp	tcp
if you need to know this type of information you need to build it into the format that you layer ontop of udp like the tcp sequence number

954620
udp	tcp
also note that the tcp sequence number implementation also helps to detect out of order packets take may happen when using udp

954622
ip-address	hostname
the remote host value tries to perform a dns lookup on the ip-address to give you a hostname if the resolvehosts attributes is set to true

954629
ip-address	hostname
h is the hostname and a is the ip-address

954629
ip-address	hostname
if hostnamelookups is set to on then the server will try to determine the hostname and log it in place of the ip-address

954648
frame	width
if you are adding a new view you should be sure to set the frame property to a positioning and width and height that will not cause it to be bigger than it should

954667
command-line	cmd
the app adds a filename as the first and only cmd-line argument to the extension so the cmd it runs looks like

954670
void	main
public static void main string arguments

954675
getter	setter
a and b don t have any behavior - they are java beans with getter and setter

954685
jndi	jdbc
i want to look up an object from a servlet to jdbc through jndi

954693
value	field
use between and the actual field value instead

954708
controller	routes
it seems my rspec route for controller phones action edit works...it should be phones 123 edit and is according to rspec tests and rake routes

954711
device-orientation	accelerometer
hai i use accelerometer to rotate uiimageview through device-orientation like uiinterfaceorientationlandscaperight etc

954711
device-orientation	accelerometer
if i dont use device-orientation if i put iphone on the table accelerometer must work in particular angle.the device is in uiinterfaceorientationportrait how can i do it

954724
getter	setter
instead access their getter and setter using reflection

954739
compact-framework	.net
have you set your project to be a .net compact-framework 3.5 project

954762
stateless	stateful
i recently took the time to change all the stateful skins to stateless skins and my cpu droped from about 40 to about 3-4

954766
value	field
personally i have the id field in the value object - i treat it as another attributes of the value object such as name location etc

954767
32-bit	64bit
the difference between the two is that the one that works is a 32-bit server and the one where it doesn t work is a 64bit server

954781
perl	awk
you can then use grep sed awk or even perl to filter out things of interest

954781
python	perl
you could also dive into perl or python -- but i will not suggest a start from scratch on that for what you need here

954790
decrement	increment
controllers updates your model increment decrement variables perform actions change user name and so on

954795
return-type	arguments
unfortunately it doesn t describe this certain function yet but you should be able to find some functions with similar arguments and return-type there and use them as the basis for your call

954804
meta-inf	jar
you can try looking inside the jar s manifest.mf in the meta-inf directory - it should indicate what version yo re working with

954818
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
i would like to be able to automate data entry to an openoffice.org spreadsheet using a powershell scripting in the same way that excel can be automated using powershell see this scriptinging guy example

954851
hide	show
or alternatively i need to hide show details on my existing masterpage dependant on the active theme hope that makes sense

954862
revision	svn
make sure that revision is the latest revision with commits under the svn trunkurl http svn repos psl academypro asp 20.net trunk path

954904
firefox	safari
the contenteditable property for ie firefox and safari

954926
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
i would like to be able to automate creating spreadsheets and adding data to an openoffice.org spreadsheet using a scripting any scriptinging language is acceptable - powershell python or even javascripting

954935
click	mouse
the problem is the autocomplete feature gets triggers on mouse click in the textbox and not on keypress

954950
python	java
python code from a java program

954961
oracle-xe	oracle
place the dump files in c oracle-xe app oracle admin xe dpdump

954977
abstract-class	pure-virtual
they are usually emulated with abstract-class with pure-virtual functions

955010
openoffice.org	uno
also maybe you would take a look at openoffice.org s uno .

955011
selected	button
just dowlnoad reflector run it selected appropriate version of the framework 3.5 for example click on search button add methods selectedion at the right of the search box and type registerrequirescontrolstate - this method belongs to page class control needs to invoke this method to be become

955013
updating	updates
when the status of only some rows changes in each updates then updating only the changed rows should also improve performance

955038
any	set
you can set it to any of these properties

955040
skype4java	skype
you can use the skype4java wrapper for the skype api

955043
gettext	poedit
i am aware of question poedit workaround for dynamic gettext .

955058
mouseover	mouseout
bind a mouseover event handler to the env. elts.content element that will set the env.paused value to true and a mouseout event handler to set it back to false

955085
menuitem	button
this code shows that the delegate command from the visual-studio mvvm templates works differently when used with menuitem and button

955092
gethashcode	equals
you d definitely also want to implement and as well as all the corresponding operators and overrides of equals gethashcode etc

955100
asp.net-mvc	wcf
just to add more my new project is in asp.net-mvc so is it wise to use ado.net data service rather than wcf service with it which will probably act somewhat like m model of mvc

955110
value	field
because the legacy system has a very limited field width when the value are added the descriptions are abbreviated

955111
textbox	button
so when you click the button the focus shifts to the button writing the textbox s value back to _theinput

955113
webforms	asp.net
the problem of too big pages is not in a asp.net ajax but i don t like it anyway but in the asp.net webforms abstraction

955113
checkbox	textbox
also when you have only one form with a lot of editing controls in it all values of inputs html inputs in asp.net - textbox checkbox and so on will be sent back to the server on each postback

955113
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i made my choice - no more webforms hello asp.net-mvc

955113
webforms	asp.net
this is veery thicky and hard approach for asp.net webforms

955113
webforms	asp.net
and another stone in the asp.net webforms side -

955142
contains	elements
the scenario is having an elements with a bottom margin then directly below it an elements that contains floating elementss which are cleared at the end the container elements could have say a bottom border that should sit just under the floating elementss it contains

955153
base-class	inherited
create a base-class of your own and have your pages inherited from that

955153
base-class	inherited
for example create a base-class called basepage which inherited from system.web.ui.page

955153
value	field
you can modify the code so that it won t need to hit the database each time the page is refreshed by using controlstate to check whether the custom field have value before populating them again from the database

955154
webforms	asp.net
the example below is for asp.net mvc but a similar approach could be used with webforms

955155
contains	elements
now suppose that the subject you would like to observe is a container and you would like to observe the container itself elements addition and deletion of elementss and also the contains elementss state updates of the container elementss

955155
linked-list	tree
for instance would it be faster to say always use balanced tree even if you are observing a linked-list

955155
contains	elements
if m observers have to iterate through the list contains n elements then updating takes o n m expected time

955159
pointers	stack
once you have runtime polymorphism in c consider if foo is a function pointers rather than a function name checking stack by any means other than built-in tests on every call has proven to be either impossible or not worth the effort

955167
postgresql	oracle
i need a postgresql function to return a virtual table like in oracle with custom content

955182
binary	hex
if that still doesn t do what you want in terms of hex binary i suggest you email its author preferably with a patch

955211
attributes	properties
also you can try to use some attributes and mark with it ignored properties and add some generic common code to ignore all marked properties

955217
synchronous	.when
i need to make a synchronous request to the last.fm api but .when i use get and json together the request becomes asynchronous

955235
contains	elements
generally if your observers need to identify small changes an attributes change or adding an elements the notification message should contains enough information that they can do this efficiently

955236
callback	methods
my client connects to the server calling a login methods where i save the clients callback channel by doing

955236
callback	methods
i ve tested this by launching the server for debugging in the visual-studio detaching it launching the client calling the above mentioned login methods putting a break point in the implemented callback methods of the client and making the server send a response to the client

955240
web-inf	liferay
this is not sufficient to deploy the portlets since liferay needs to augment the web.xml in my portlets web-inf to insert servlet mapping tags

955264
youtube	vimeo
my client has come back saying he wants to play mp4s on the site - plus being able to embed some other videos from youtube vimeo etc..

955265
versioning	upgrade
however it can be a bit fiddly to set up currently due to it requiring newer the latest versioning of the air sdk see the release notes on how to upgrade

955272
authentication	login
if there is an authentication dialog you must make sure that the soapclient uses the required login credentials on retrieving the wsdl document

955272
authentication	login
the problem is that soapclient will only send the credentials given with the login and password options as well as the local_cert option when using certificate authentication on creating the client when invoking the service not when fetching the wsdl see here

955279
required	checked
if i checked the checkbox as required i need to get a to a div

955282
keyboard	mouse
there are many managed wrappers for doing global system hooks for mouse and keyboard

955283
inherited	subclass
i need to add the specific parameters of corresponding subclass that inherited the class pointed to in the service of the wsdl

955286
youtube	vimeo
now if you re client is only really talking about embedding videos in blog entries or articles that s a very trivial task youtube vimeo and other video sharing sites already supply the html embed code that s needed to display a video on a page

955288
response	timeout
it is technically possible to set this timeout using a jsf mechanism - you could use a phase listener to check for a session after render response though you would still have to cast to the servlet api to set the timeout

955288
meta-inf	jar
a global phase listener defined in a jar with a meta-inf faces-config.xml can be dropped into multiple wars allowing you to easily reuse the functionality

955309
required	checked
i ve tried my best to tracking down what component could required .net 3.5 first by checked and rebuilding everything and then using ildasm to look at the file headers

955351
ip-address	hostname
is it also possible to log which ip-address or hostname has requested that file

955358
ruby	php
example java servlet ruby rails php apache .

955366
silverlight	wpf
i am just getting started with linq wpf and silverlight

955386
ethernet	packets
and a datagram is a layer-1 or layer-2 unit such as the several ethernet datagrams that might make up the fragments of an ip packets

955403
ethernet	packets
i think packets refers to the chunks of data transferred on a lower layer like ethernet and message is used for higher level information exchange

955409
constructor	object
so you would end up with an intermediate mydotnettype which would take as a constructor argument mytype the com object and expose it out as a read-only property

955418
execute	declare
since main must first execute to start the lua interpreter etc. but if i declare myvar afterwards it will not be global

955420
frame-rate	fps
sometimes you may get 61-62 fps when frame-rate is at 60 but it never really exceeds it .

955431
textbox	button
i am working on a project where i have to validate the given smtp server i.e in a textbox user will provide the detail and then he will click on a test button

955438
scriptaculous	jquery
in time i got more and more into jquery and now i want to replace my current scriptaculous scripts with jquery scripts

955451
sql-server	oracle
i have much more experience with oracle but very likely the same applies to sql-server as well

955456
32-bit	64bit
the intptr.size property is returned in bytes 8 bits per byte so it is equal to 4 on a 32-bit cpu and 8 on a 64bit cpu

955456
32-bit	64bit
since we talk about 32-bit and 64bit processors rather than 4-byte or 8-byte processors i like to do the comparison in bits which makes it more clear what is going on

955468
version-control	cvs
cvs does not have a single revision number like more modern version-control systems

955498
32-bit	64bit
there is still a small chance that some geek is running a 32-bit version on a 64bit computer

955527
arrays	map
an is absolutely equivalent to the associative arrays map hash whatever you call it known to many programming languages

955547
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in webforms i would have just bound the control then inserted another item however it seems this is not possible with asp.net-mvc am i right in thinking i will need to add some javascript to the view to add this new item once the dropdownlist has been bound

955549
sftp	ftps
it supports sftp ftp and ftps

955575
vb.net	vb6
the second biggest issue i have personally observed is vb6 developers writing vb6 code in vb.net

955578
logging	trace
when i turn on wcf logging and trace it with logging application block i get something like this about 100 of this logs for one login attempt

955582
radio-button	button
the ux folks will give it a once over to pretty it up but for now it works as a radio-button that looks like a toggle button or just a button but has a groupname

955604
32-bit	64bit
flag it s a x86 64bit cpu even if you have 32-bit linux installed

955604
powerpc	arm
not sure if this works for non x86 cpus as well such as powerpc or arm

955610
pascal	delphi
free pascal compiler lazarus is not close to the latest delphi features but it is quite stable even though there are still bugs to find out

955680
quickbooks	qbfc
qbfc - this is the windows com dcom way to communicate with quickbooks

955680
web-applications	security
rds is a security nightmare and not really meant for integrating web-applications

955692
authentication	login
openid handles authentication but the web app owner still has full control over the rights assigned to that login

955693
pagespeed	yslow
google just release pagespeed a plugins for firebug just like yslow and it s got some pretty cool features

955739
difference	zero
there s a very little in the difference for a single call where very little tends to zero

955751
python	ruby
i m looking for a python equivalent of ruby s halcyon - a framework focused on web service -type applications rather than html-page-oriented ones

955776
terminate	timeout
you can also set an idle timeout in minutes after which a worker process is terminate

955801
value	field
all of my custom field work except one which is a repeating value editor

955801
value	field
here is the code for the definition of the repeating value field

955801
value	field
obj.args.parent is an alias for the field that opened the repeating value editor windows

955809
webforms	asp.net
i m thinking of implementing the state design pattern on an asp.net webforms

955824
boolean-expression	operators
when a type implements the true operators instances of that type can be used as a boolean-expression

955824
boolean-expression	operators
when a boolean-expression is of a type that cannot be implicitly converted to bool but does implement operators true then following evaluation of the expression the operators true implementation provided by that type is invoked to produce a bool value

955841
ironpython	ironruby
i ve been reading up on f# ironruby and ironpython

955841
ironpython	ironruby
ironpython seems to catch my eye the most although i m not completely closed to ironruby

955841
ironpython	ironruby
f# as i understand it is still more of a research language so i m a bit wary of writing production code using it - ironpython and ironruby have also pre-existed for several years whereas f# is completely new

955862
integer	zero
what i was planning to do was hash the first value the key into a 32-bit integer which will then be a key to a sparse structure where the value will be added all start at zero number and be negative

955862
32-bit	x86
given that they keys are short and alphanumeric is there an way to generate a hash algorithm that is fast on 32-bit x86 architectures

955881
dom4j	xom
here s yet another solution using the xom library that competes with my dom4j answer

955881
dom4j	xom
this is part of my quest to find a good dom4j replacement where xom was suggested as one option.

955881
dom4j	xom
now adding the child node is simple and similar as with dom4j except that xom doesn t let you add the original root element which already belongs to newnodedocument

955909
base-class	inherited
it s just a class that inherited from the attributes base-class

955914
children	nodes
when the nodes is moved all its children will be moved with it

955922
64bit	x86
adding true support for enc to the 64bit clr is unfortunately a large work item and other features were prioritized over this given the work around of changing the platform target to x86

955947
buffering	streaming
the important point is that this will use the operating system file buffering more efficiently because you reuse the same input streaming instead of reopening the file at the beginning and then seeking

955953
getter	setter
while most answers focus on the design encapsulation standpoint and i agree to the general consensus why not use setter getter

955953
getter	setter
i d like to add that once you ve hunted for a bug in some large legacy code bases with public members you ll never ever ever write a class without setter getter

955953
getter	setter
1 setter getter you put a breakpoints 5 minutes later bug is solved

955960
versioning	upgrade
i ve tried everything from deleting the msadc folder from iis and re-adding it i ve uninstaller sql native and reinstalled it and subsequently upgrade it to the newest versioning

955987
stderr	stdout
stream stderr stdin or stdout

955989
event-listener	listener
since it keeps a weak reference to the event-listener it doesn t force the listener to live

955993
ironpython	ironruby
additionally f# will be include in visual-studio 2010 whereas ironpython and ironruby require extra steps to integrate them with visual-studio

955993
ironpython	ironruby
that said asp.net and asp.net-mvc support for f# is pretty much non-existent whereas ironpython and ironruby have various efforts underway already

955999
textarea	textbox
this is working fine with textbox controls and dropdownlists etc however when i add the htmlattributes to the textarea it stops working claiming that the best overloaded methods has some invalid arguments the code that is failing is

956004
haskell	c++
you do realize that haskell is not c++ right

956016
contains	any
if the computer name portion of the requested url contains periods such as and internet-explorer assumes that the requested address exists on the internet and does not pass any credentials automatically

956017
base-class	inherited
and then you make your spiffycontrol inherited that base-class like

956021
double-quotes	single-quotes
i tried using single-quotes two double-quotes nothing works

956022
json	xml
in our case the dispatcher accepts both soap and http get aka rest requests and has to return either a soap response or a rest response any one of xml json html

956043
gethashcode	equals
the tuples needs to override gethashcode equals and iequatable

956046
silverlight	wpf
it s tweaked specifically to work with wpf and silverlight and makes use of databinding in order to glue everything together

956047
loading	gif
i m looking for any tutorials articles about inserting a loading gif while elements load i ve seen it in a few sites

956098
hide	show
a general strategy is to place the loading image in a div or span tag and show or hide it when you want to show it

956098
hide	show
if you want to show it initially just place a jquery hide function on the div or span in the jquery on ready function

956098
hide	show
see the jquery docs on show and hide

956104
perl	ruby
i am looking for a static analysis tool for python ruby sql cobol perl pl sql sql similar to find bugs and check style

956109
hide	show
the following will show a loading image pre-existing then load some html retrieved via ajax then upon completion it will hide the loading image

956114
implements	extends
to accomplish this i also had to create a new class that implements com.adobe.cairngorm.commands.icommand that i extends for all commands in my projects

956122
any	set
should i set righttoleft peroperty for any controls in forms to yes or true

956124
getter	setter
in some cases for visibility you might want certain parts of the code to see the concrete class and have access to the setter and some others to see only getter give them access to the interface only

956124
protected	public
this cannot always be achieved with public protected private

956155
getter	setter
however i ve noticed that getter and setter aren t really used in c# as they are in java or php and and i suspect that there is a better more succinct standard way to do this in c#

956165
attributes	properties
each row has a button whose isenabled attributes is bound to the isenabled properties of classa

956166
directory	folder
so something in the .svn folder for that directory is amiss

956168
select	union
first select from the union selects the records for the grouping header

956168
select	union
second select from the union selects all the records for the grouping header

956172
xstream	jdom
you can use any decent xml library like jdom or xom or xstream

956180
getter	setter
i ve noticed that getter and setter aren t really used in c# as they are in java or php

956180
getter	setter
yes and the reason is simple .net s properties offer a special syntactic sugar to express getter and setter

956184
versioning	upgrade
today i got an update notification asking me to upgrade internet-explorer to versioning 8

956186
getter	setter
properties are just syntactic sugar for the getter setter methods you would normally do in java

956202
difference	zero
lfwidth - if lfwidth is zero the aspect ratio of the device is matched against the digitization aspect ratio of the available fonts to find the closest match determined by the absolute value of the difference

956206
google-chrome	firefox
i m currently developing web sites for ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox safari opera and google-chrome all on the same machine

956206
firefox	safari
to get back to ie6 i use the beta of microsoft superpreview if you haven t seen it check it out...they re going to offer firefox and safari rendering to it last i checked

956210
nested	order
the best you can achieve is nested order lists

956230
constructor	object
since string object are immutable going to a via tochararray swapping the characters then making a new string from via the constructor would work

956233
google-chrome	firefox
in safari google-chrome firefox i get back something like bar note the leading forward slash

956244
contains	any
for any control where this is important anything contains text i imagine

956246
mime	rfc
see rfc 1341 mime 7 for more info

956254
versioning	upgrade
after trying ie8 s developer tools press f12 and seeing how nice it is i can say that its a must to upgrade and you have many other ways to test on previous versioning as previous answers listed

956255
delphi	vb6
delphi allows this as does vb6 but realbasic doesn t and says you should put the code into a method that is then called by both the menu and the button

956267
procedure	records
for instances suppose you wanted to call a stored procedure that safely deletes all associated records for a given customer

956274
google-chrome	opera
i have also this to say the sites i build usually don t have display problems under ie8 and look the same as ff3 opera konqueror google-chrome etc.

958436
job-queue	queue
using a custom threadpool there s a job-queue all pages to be downloaded are queue up and each thread takes one and downloads

958442
value	field
if you are going to use the soundex algorithm i would suggest updating the table first with the value of the soundex field rather than computing it as you go long

958443
highlight	selected
is there a way to disable the behavior of highlight the selected row when touch

958460
apache-mina	mina
i m creating a test platform for a protocols project based on mina

958467
variables	boolean
you can store up to 64 boolean variables into a single bigint column as a mask with one bool per bit and compute the match extremely fast as bit_count the_column user_preferences which will count how many bits are equal between the column and the mask giving the user s preferences should php give you problems manipulating 64-bit integers you can use two columnns of 32 bits each summing the two bit counts will still be very fast

958472
scrollable	resize
what i want is a div in the middle of them all and so it resize and is scrollable based on the visitors browser size

958503
cucumber	selenium
in selenium you can t have transactional fixtures so writing cucumber steps will be a bit more fun but whatever

958515
document	element
any structure-aware sgml or xml editor can edit document whose root is any element defined by the dtd

958515
document	element
the doctype declaration at the start of the file declares which element the document is using as its root

958547
defined	declare
say the next event is defined as a delegation declare thusly

958555
button	popup
when i click the calendar button to trigger the calendar popup the calendar displays normally

958557
margins	padding
there are ways using large padding and negative margins though they fail at a number of things

958597
archive	corrupt
although it creates a bz2 file and its size seems to be right 1 7 mb from a 5mb directory but the archive itself is corrupt i cannot open it neither with ark nor with command-line tar

958600
multiple-languages	locale
i assume that if you are dealing with locale you need to handle multiple-languages

958602
quirks-mode	doctype
i have seen this issue on pages with invalid old doctype with ie6-7 in quirks-mode

958608
linux	unix
on a unix linux system

958618
ruby	php
php is a programming language ror is a framework built on ruby

958618
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
it would be easier to compare a php framework such as cakephp or codeigniter to ruby-on-rails than just php to ruby-on-rails

958622
dictionary	arrays
i have an arrays of dictionary

958622
dictionary	arrays
my real problem is i had a nested arrays and i wasn t actually evaluating the dictionary

958631
decrement	increment
in response to the comment asking if counter_cache will work if a non ruby-on-rails app alters the data well it can but not in the default way as ruby-on-rails increment and decrement the counter at save time

958638
value	field
getting static field value of a type using reflection

958639
ruby	php
ruby is better than php

958650
dictionary	arrays
it should work - as long as the data variable is actually an arrays containing a dictionary with the key sport

958672
ruby-on-rails	django
its a very capable framework - and i find it makes lighter work of application development than the equivalent in ruby-on-rails or django

958672
ruby-on-rails	django
lift itself has cherry-picked a lot of features from existent frameworks - ruby-on-rails and django included - to form imho a best of breed framework

958672
scala	java
but i would say that you need to have a reasonable knowledge of java and an understanding of scala in order to get the most out of lift

958672
scala	java
as a more direct answer to your question in terms of ease i would say that if you are unfamiliar with java scala ruby and python then of the three your best bet would be rails - as ruby is a beautiful language nigh on self-explanatory well documented introduces the majority of oo concepts and is very easy to learn

958678
factors	primes
factors a given product into primes seems easy but then partitioning the list of primes into the desired number of factors stumps me

958680
selected	button
i can click on different button to selected different views one of which displays a table

958680
selected	cell
when i selected a cell on that row i want to display a new view

958681
ruby	php
i used to work with imagick in php then moved to ruby and start using rmagick

958684
constructor	object
it is creating a const class object holding the size constructor destructor etc

958688
defined	declare
i m looking at a vb.net class that i didn t write that is declare mustinherit abstract in c# i believe that has three methods all of which are defined as shared static in c#

958688
derived-class	inherited
my thinking is no because by making it mustinherited you re essentially saying you can t create an instance of this class - you must inherited from it and create an instance of the derived-class

958699
g++	gcc
it s gcc g++ for windows

958700
value	field
the idea is that you will walk through the posted form field and fix the broken checkbox value

958713
static-class	inherited
a vb module and c# static-class are virtually identical members are associated with the type rather than an instances and you cannot inherited from them

958719
imagemagick	minimagick
alternatively you could use minimagick which is a wrapper for the imagemagick command-line client

958737
linux	osx
i utilize rsync to do a similar thing between my laptop osx and desktop linux

958750
codedom	.net
xmlserialization in .net uses code generation to create c# source code wich is then compiled which ultimately uses csharpcodeprovider which is part of codedom. codedom compiles source very similarly to the command line csc.exe compiler so temporary intermediate object files often need to be created on disk before the final assembly can be generated regardless of whether its an in-memory assembly or not.

958755
debian	linux
i m a .net developer but have dabbled in linux a bit so i m not completely turned off to the idea of an ubuntu or debian server.

958772
python	perl
many maintenance scripts and subversion hooks are written and available in perl and python which are available for both windows and linux

958777
order	join
another possibility is to index separately on startnum and endnum order wouldn t matter and see if it will use both indexes in sequence and then do some kind of join

958779
configuration	installation
i imagine the installation and configuration process might go off with fewer hitches if installed on linux just because of the package management but that s assuming some experience with the package system of whatever_distro

958779
configuration	installation
if you re familiar with windows i bet you ll find the installation and configuration process easier there

958800
any	set
however with that said if you control both the parent page and the page being iframed you can json_encode the arrays in the page being iframed and set it to javascript variables then on load pass it to a javascript function on the parent page assuming not violating any browser domain sandbox constraints

958801
webforms	asp.net
there is also chapters that cover integrating jquery with asp.net mvc and how you might utilize framework components authorization membership roles personalization caching etc from traditional webforms applications

958806
python	java
i am quite new to java and would like to learn java using an interactive shell like i did with python using ipython

958815
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you don t already know webforms then stick to learning just asp.net-mvc right now so that you don t confuse yourself

958815
webforms	asp.net
mvc and webforms both work under asp.net so a lot of things you ll learn while playing with mvc will carry over to webforms

958822
bison	yacc
the main problem with regular bison the gnu implementation of yacc stems from the c typing

958823
defined	declare
to defined the symbols with a constant address that refers in this case to the location we decided that the sdram controllers will map the sdram memory and in c i declare it like

958823
constructor	object
also initializers for the data segment and the internally generated lists of constructor of global object all get located near the text segment

958835
linux	unix
in linux unix you might use fcntl or flock

958836
selected	button
just right-click on the expander button click customize notification icons that s what it s called in vista may vary in other os versions find your app s tray icon in the list and selected show

958858
mocking	stubs
if you go straight to a mocking framework it s easy to use mocks when you wanted stubs and vice versa -- there is a big difference

958871
copy-constructor	constructor
if you omit all constructor from your class declaration then the compiler supplies a default and a copy-constructor for you

958871
copy-constructor	constructor
if you declare any constructor then the compiler supplies no default or copy-constructor so you must implement your own

958884
reference-type	generics
i m trying to make a generics one for obvious reasons but i get a the type t must be a reference-type in order to use it as parameter tentity in the generics type or method system.data.linq.table exception while doing this

958907
spring	seam
what are the advantages disadvantages of seam over spring

958907
spring	seam
why would i use seam in lieu of spring

958919
business-process	integration
business-process integration jbpm

958919
spring	seam
from framework deathmatch spring vs seam

958934
defined	declare
if possible do not defined structures just declare their names and use opaque pointers in the interface

958935
contains	any
a story should be more fluid and dynamic and represent the real business requirement as a customer i need to see all of the stores that contains the products i am looking for so that i may purchase what i need at a great price. from that user story you would then end up with tasks that define the more technical aspects of creating this page i am extrapolating a lot from what i read in your question...forgive me for any artistic license i take in expanding the concept

958965
any	set
is there any options to set session never expire

958981
administration	account
changing the service account is the same as for any other windows service - via control panels administration tools services

958988
global-variables	call
isn t myvar simply a global-variables and won t the procedural code unwrap everything onto the call stack determine the value

958997
contains	any
now you bust or break out of any contains iframe automatically

958999
for-loop	loops
if you re not creating cr whatever it is inside the for-loops then you re modifying the same object over and over each time through the loops

959006
archive	backup
for example i have a full backup on sunday and i have all archive logs from sunday to wednesday

959014
imagemagick	libjpeg
imagemagick uses libjpeg a.k.a independent jpeg grouping library

959014
imagemagick	libjpeg
if you improve the speed of libjpeg imagemagick jpeg speed will increase

959015
google-chrome	firefox
vista ie8 firefox 3 google-chrome safari

959024
click	mouse
i presently have to resort to using the mouse to click the and v labels in the tooltip which isn t particularly effective

959026
contains	lookup
basically this says find all occurrences of ... contains word characters and replace that value with the value from a lookup table being the global replace_values

959036
firefox	opera
came up with this and it seems to work at least in firefox and the opera browser

959042
textbox	button
start with the cursor in the tell us what you were just doing textbox so it s easy for them to give you feedback just a matter of typing something and hitting enter or clicking the button with only three words on it

959050
registration	login
i am trying to build the login registration page for my website i am facing problems with he auth component

959054
ubuntu	linux
here s the tcp_info struct for my up-to-date ubuntu linux

959071
.when	ready
5 waiting not ready for the processor .when ready it will be rescheduled

959080
web.py	web2py
there are several frameworks available django web2py - similar to django but many say it s simpler to use there is also turbogears web.py pylons

959080
python	php
along the lines of bridging - you could use interprocess communication to have php and python application in daemon mode talk to each other

959096
subclassing	base-class
i was mainly looking for feedback on whether it was usual to break up the connection details into their own base-class with subclassing for logical units classes

959105
winpcap	libpcap
try winpcap then it gives you a lot of features along with the popular nix library libpcap api

959107
versioning	downgrade
my next step was to downgrade www mechanize to versioning 0.8.5

959107
mechanize	hpricot
so the problem here is that mechanize 0.8.5 has a dependency on hpricot instead of nokogiri which works flawlessly

959124
passthru	exec
i used to have a site that was using exec system and passthru in php to execute grep sed and other tools on text files

959126
button	popup
creating a menu and calling it s popup method if the right mouse button was pressed

959131
arguments	default
so your default a is pushed each time you do not pass an a as arguments

959135
factors	primes
to solve this all you need is a primes factorization of your target number and then use a combinatorial approach to form all possible sub-products from these factors

959135
factorization	primes
it s inefficiently but even large numbers have a small primes factorization

959135
factors	primes
i ll leave it to you to generate the primes factors but this seems to work for

959152
textbox	button
i decided to go with c# because it was so easy to just open a form and plop some button and textbox on it

959152
profiling	debugging
i suggest you also learn how to debugging and profiling your program

959160
bmp	gif
there is no information in the xml file about whether the image is jpg gif bmp

959161
oracle	mysql
i have been given an assignment to get the feasibility for making a dll which takes some inputs such as database name mysql access sql oracle etc. and some more inputs to generate a query and based on that the dll should return a recordset to the application

959162
punctuation	words
in this model each word is a feature - this requires tokenizing the sequences which means separating words and punctuation from each other

959169
oracle	mysql
the popular databases - oracle sybase ms sql server mysql - have slight differences in the sql grammar they allow

959176
interpreter	runtime
oh and you don t compile python programs they are interpreter at runtime

959191
png	gif
delphi 2009 comes with built in support for jpeg bmp gif and png

959191
png	gif
for earlier versions of delphi you may need to find third party implementations for png and gif but in delphi 2009 you simply add the jpeg pngimage and gifimg units to your uses clause

959194
background-image	transparency
it seems that ie7 doesn t like that you have assigned the background-image to the container .nav and that just shines through the transparency backrounds of actual links

959214
integer	digits
you can t use a char to represent an integer longer than 1 digits so i m going to assume you did in fact mean char

959227
google-chrome	firefox
after talking to paul o b a css guru this is a good solution that works in ie 6 7 8 firefox 3 and google-chrome

959242
order	add
i find it interesting that if i don t add parameters in the order they were defined in

959256
pagespeed	yslow
you may also want to look at tools like yslow or pagespeed if you re looking for other ways of improving the performance of a web page

959257
order	add
then simply add them in the right order

959259
configuration	installation
have you set fxcop installation root setting in the runner configuration

959261
sigint	exit
trapping ctrl-c or sigint and subsequently calling removehook for a clean exit would be nice to have but is not essential

959276
base-class	inherited
the best advice i ever received for ood was to look to the smallest object that each logical branch of your app can be distilled to it probably on has native types for properties with .net there no point in reinventing framework objects either so they can be in your base-class and then using inherited polymorphism and encapsulation to expand on those base-classes until you have an object that encapsulates the logical branch

959277
contains	any
it does not contains any gzip-specific header information

959280
boolean	int
as for the int and other numerical and boolean types - those have a fixed system-given length - no problems there

959280
xsd	xml
unless your xml has a schema xsd file which limits the string lengths the string fields from an xml can be any length really so after reading them in your datatable can t really know what the defined max length can be

959283
32-bit	x86
on my 32-bit x86 system your program uses only about 40 mb of memory

959296
malloc	free
free is for use when you malloc memory at runtime not for freeing memory allocated by the compiler at compile time

959298
malloc	free
it was not allocated with malloc so you cannot free it with free

959302
scriptaculous	jquery
if you want animation then you can use jquery scriptaculous or other javascript libraries

959308
malloc	free
in your example you are populating the entries of this arrays by allocating memory using malloc and setting each element of the arrays this is the memory that you should free and not the statically allocated arrays itself

959308
arrays	loops
so instead of calling free new_display you will need to loops through the arrays entries and do free new_display i this way you are freeing only what you have allocated

959313
google-chrome	firefox
but my neither firefox nor google-chrome reflect the recent changes

959318
debian	linux
this is happening on os x when on linux debian it works

959322
value	field
from your code i could only think of getting the value using the field name

959322
value	field
although your code seems correct i always prefer using field names to get the value instead of index positioning that can be easily changed in a number of situations

959324
bazaar	git
examples include git-bisect in git hg bisect in mercurial earlier available as hbisect extension and bzr-bisect plugin for bazaar

959324
plugins	add-on
do you use version-control system or some add-on extension plugins for revision control system or some third-party tool which implements such algorithm beside allowing to simply skip untestable commits by going to neighbour revision

959324
driver	kernel
when using advanced features of git there is one situation where you can have a whole branch of untestable commits or at least hard to test namely where you use subtree merge to join histories of two separate projects full linux kernel with some driver developed separately using subtree merge

959337
backwards-compatibility	legacy
in the app-config file of a .net application there is a element that allows you to configure various behaviours of the clr usually for backwards-compatibility with legacy behaviours

959352
value	field
why not have a next ticket id field on the project table - when creating a new ticket get this value increment it and set the ticket id to the previous value

959358
browser-cache	caching
i ve definitely run into cases where even after refreshing my browser-caching and any other caching i had control over there was still an external proxy or server-side caching that couldn t be forcibly refreshed

959368
mstest	nunit
our 200+ developer shop just moved away from mstest to nunit and so far we ve not encountered issues with lack of tool support in fact rather the opposite it seems that the support infrastructure around nunit is very extensive

959414
bug-tracking	workitem
where possible such as when using tfs for bug-tracking and source control link the checkin directly to an appropriate workitem

959422
any	set
i m pretty sure the pre-processor definition is set up and my macros name doesn t clash with any apple symbols

959427
abstract	extends
to introduce the concept of form beans an abstract getformbean methods was declared extends the stupidframeworkbasehandler class

959437
fadeout	fadein
this is working fine with the fadein fadeout effects

959437
fadeout	fadein
my ultimate requirement is to fadeout the current content.show the loading message.show the data coming from server with a fadein effect

959449
hide	show
i haven t tested this but why not just show hide a gif animation

959475
shell	bash
at a previous workplace we used to have a highly-refined bash function called run-only-once that we could write into any long-running shell script and then call it at the start of the script which would check to see whether the script was already running as another process and if so exit with a notification to stdout

959483
expander	grid
i m trying to force a grid expander to reevaluate whether it needs a scrollbar as it s showing emptiness

959483
gridsplitter	grid
this causes the grid to resize to about 6 times the height it needs to be as the windows is showing then it doesn t spring back and the only way to see what s at the bottom of the windows is to either scroll or move the gridsplitter back up to where it should be and resize the windows

959483
expander	grid
invalidatemeasure and updatelayout on the problem expander and invalidatearrange invalidatescrollinfo invalidatevisual and updatelayout on the grid above it but it won t shrink back

959490
contains	elements
but let s say i have a container which contains multiple elements s

959494
postgresql	mysql
then you can install apache and mysql or postgresql on that vm just via the standard packaging tools apt-get install and there s no danger of polluting your windows environment

959496
callback	methods
in which case i d say split out the extra stuff into a separate methods so that remove on the container can call the extra stuff on the element without the recursive callback

959500
hide	show
it helps us creating interfaces that always look good no matter if we show or hide certain grouping panels

959501
having	select
i m having a problem with deadlock on select update on sql-server 2008

959521
.when	ready
i run my css through it once i m done and ready to deliver or .when my stylesheet becomes too messy to handle

959526
attributes	properties
is there any nhibernate search library which doesn t require attributes on your entity properties

959531
firefox	safari
unfortunately ie7 floats the image outside the rhs boundary of the parent div see whereas firefox and safari display the float and wrapped text within the parent div s boundary the black vertical lines are the lhs rhs boundaries of the parent div

959532
value	field
instantiate your model with initial value for the missing but required field

959532
any	set
use and manually set any extra required fields

959546
.when	ready
.when i m ready to deploy to a production-environment a tiny ruby scripting expands those import statements into a single file thereby reducing the number of http requests required

959561
nsresponder	nstextview
you won t use much functionality from the superclass besides maintaining a collection of tab view items and you ll end up implements a number of nstextview and nsresponder methods to get the drawing and event handling working correctly

959571
exception-handling	error-handling
you get error-handling with exception-handling and the ability to debugging execution as a bonus

959581
administration	account
however my account has a flag associated with it that signals i am an administration

959591
any	set
in just about any formally structured set of information you start reading either from the start towards the end or occasionally from the end towards the beginning street addresses for example. but in sql especially selected queries in order to properly understand its meaning you have to start in the middle at the from clause

959600
export	report
we need to generate report and export them to excel

959608
relational-database	rdbms
it features a transactional object database which can store not only content and custom data but also dynamic html templates scripting a search-engine and relational-database rdbms connections and code

959626
thickbox	jquery
this works fine in my page.in my page i have some links on which when i click using jquery s load method i am getting some data from the server page and loading into it. the data i m getting is a grid which contains some images .my problem is that my thickbox is working fine when it is hardcoded in my page but when i am taking it from server and loading to a div its not working instead of showing the new page in modal dialog its redirecting the browser to load that page

959637
keyboard	mouse
you obviously need to support mouse clicks which is fairly easy but you should make sure your keyboard support works too and that s a little more tricky you ll need to run timers to switch the tab after no keyboard access after half a second have a look at the way os x does it

959642
getter	setter
please make dpart1 to dpart1 and change the getter and setter again

959650
vertex-shader	shader
pixels shader fragment shader in opengl - calculates the colour of a pixels on the screen based on what the vertex-shader passes in bound textures and user-added data

959650
put	get
those pixels then get put on the current draw buffer screen backbuffer render-to-texture whatever

959650

logout	login
i have a created a login system in php with logout functions etc

959670
contains	any
the form can contains any kind of control

959673
decrement	increment
if the first windows sets a cookie number_of_windowss 1 that is increment for each opened windows then on windows close the ajax request is fired only if number_of_windowss equals to 1 otherwise it just decrement number_of_windowss

959675
32-bit	16-bit
i had no success with cairo either as it seems limited to 24 32-bit formats and doesn t have a 16-bit format format_rgb16_565 is unsupported and deprecated

959678
postback	ajax
the only way to do this is to do regular ajax postback to the server that the user is still on your page

959718
callback	methods
it allows anyone who wants to be notified when is clicked to register a callback methods

959725
speech-synthesis	text-to-speech
it turns out that there s a speech-synthesis markup which can be used to provide clues to the text-to-speech converter about which syllable to place accents etc

959738
notepad++	scite
other people like scite notepad++ or any of a slew of others

959765
value	field
memset would be how you wipe memory in c but in c++ you need to provide default value for each field or explicitly initialize them in the constructor

959782
constructor	object
i m not sure why the text object doesn t take its content in the constructor but that s just the way it in simplemented in xml.dom.minidom

959783
jquery	dojo
the plugd plugin extends dojo to act like jquery

959784
constructor	object
for an object with a constructor that initialises its members

959786
delphi	c++
since caskey s answer only concerns c++ my answer for delphi

959786
data-members	constructor
â data-members with no default constructor

959800
constructor	object
in delphi the tobject constructor zero-initializes the heap-allocated always on the heap because tobjects cannot be stack-instantiated in delphi memory of the object thereby clearing all member variables

959804
sql-server	oracle
i would like to get the functionality of connect by prior of oracle in sql-server 2000 2005 2008

959808
pylons	django
django is great and very well documented but you should probably look at pylons first for its documentions on unicode packaging deployment and testing and for its better wsgi support

959820
row	col
my question is how to make row col transposition

959821
sql-server	postgresql
in sql-server ibm db2 or postgresql 8.4 as well as in the sql standard for what that s worth

959821
select	union
oracle s start with clause becomes the first nested select the base case of the recursion to be union ed with the recursive part which is just another select

959822
tcp-ip	tcp
however it looks as though hkey_local_machine system currentcontrolset services tcp-ip linkage bind is the key where each adapter with tcp ip enabled is stored

959829
spring	guice
people forget that java annotations and their use in frameworks like guice and spring were inspired by aop

959849
order	add
if you require an artifical order an order you cannot create dynamicaly by sorting on some columns you have to add a positioning column

959867
archetypes	appfuse
not a real archetypes yet but maybe an example how to do it in context to appfuse

959882
integer	zero
i d suggest stripping off the leading zero and keeping them in integer columns restoring leading zero in reports or whatever if you really need to

959882
integer	zero
iow if there s just one zero value you declare that the column is not integer

959884
webforms	asp.net
this solution is valid for both winforms webforms and asp.net mvc

959884
fieldset	labels
simply design the form as you would normally with just the form elements textbox labels alignment fieldset borders etc and then both pages can read the properties that you expose in the user-controls create a get property for each form element

959908
player	movie
i want to increase or decrease or even mute the volume of movie player by my program instead of the button in movie player

959914
variables	boolean
i think this could be solved by a boolean value global to the class make it an instance variables of course

959914
variables	boolean
it checks if the boolean variables and if it is true

959926
constructor	private
you ll need to define your own copy constructor or at least create a stub private copy constructor if you don t think you need a copy constructor

959929
oracle-xe	oracle
in fact it even uses oracle 10g express edition oracle-xe

959931
double	int
how about trying to use a double or long instead of int for product

959964
openbsd	linux
see the openbsd faq specifically section 9.4 - running linux binaries on openbsd

959967
integer	digits
url shortening services rather use a auto incremented integer value like a supplementary database id and encode that with base64 or other encodings to have more information per character 64 instead of just 10 like digits

959985
hotmail	gmail
it works great with gmail hotmail and many other email clients - displaying the html content without a problem

959986
hash	md5
shortest hash is 32 character length how ever you can use first 8 characters of md5 hash

959988
shell	bash
its a shell that does syntax highlighting and auto complete bash functions pretty print logging history and many such things

960015
data-uri	data-url
also what i d try is to detect data-url support in that browser and have the scripting load different stylesheets base on that info

960028
getter	setter
rather use getter setter

960032
constructor	object
myapp s constructor creates a new internetexporer object passing iquitable this

960035
processor	cpu
assuming this isn t a question in reference to some crazy low end processor you take a tremendous speed hit to access memory outside of your cpu caches so unless you re algorithm is doing math on a very few numbers enough that they all basically fit within the l1 and l2 caches you re not going to notice any speed up from optimizing any of your arithmetic

960042
naming-conventions	conventions
i would think view as it s not really the viewcontroller but curious on what the conventions is or at least what your naming-conventionss are for xibs

960045
integer	digits
if you re only looking at the last four digits you don t need anything larger than an integer

960052
python	ruby
if you are from ruby background you should be able to handle another interpreted language which is what python is too

960053
command-line	cmd
you can use the --no-auth-cache switch via the svn.exe cmd-line client to specify that you want to be prompted for new credentials on just this one cmd

960080
callback	methods
this is a simplification of the problem and i have tried a few methods to get around this such as using bind instead of the callback notation

960081
instrumentation	trace
the image below shows the stack trace from instrumentation and the corresponding code in xcode

960084
pdcurses	ncurses
if it has to be console only i would suggest using something like ncurses or pdcurses to create a text based interface

960099
configuration	logging
i have a stupid java logging problem i m loading the logging configuration from my app configuration file - but it just doesn t log anything after reading the file which looks pretty much like the examples you will find on the .net except for the additional application configuration - removing this also doesn t help

960111
http	ssl
if the browser is viewing an page in ssl through https then it ll request that asset with the https protocol otherwise it ll request it with http

960126
double	int
if all your math is in the integer domain double and floats do exactly the same as int and also can be compared safely

960133
configuration	logging
you can set your logging configuration file through command line

960145
json	xml
you can then use a parsing library or service to convert from hcalendar to icalendar or some other useful format like xml or json

960164
access-control	authentication
i m building a site right now that requires an admin section and before writing that code i thought i d try to get a good discussion debate started on how best to structure authentication and access-control with a particular eye to well tested methodologies from the oop world

960173
dbase	bde
otherwise you can use .db files dbase - xbase bde should be able to handle them directly

960175
compact-framework	.net
to install .net compact-framework

960175
compact-framework	.net
verify if the .net compact-framework 2.0 service pack 2 or later

960175
compact-framework	.net
download and install the .net compact-framework 2.0 service pack 2

960175
compact-framework	.net
the .net compact-framework 2.0 service

960179
silverlight	wpf
can anyone suggest whether i should use wpf or silverlight which one should i choose to change the application per the client requirement

960184
arrays	map
the problem with not using an arrays to store the 4 billion or so ints is that you need a function that does a one to one random map across a domain of 4 billion ints

960204
illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception
in foo a nullpointerexception is thrown if the caller passes in null whereas bar throws illegalargumentexception

960204
illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception
you throw nullpointerexception in foo but illegalargumentexception in bar

960211
put	get
methods can have get post put and delete

960217
profiling	trace
however just like sql profiling what these objects do under the covers is to execute the sql trace stored procs or variations thereof to create run and manage the trace

960217
profiling	trace
if you use 1 profilingr instance to profiling another or use a profilingr to profiling itself by removing the not like sql profilingr... filtering criteria from the trace i think it s an application name filtering then you ll see exactly what it is that profilingr is doing is the same as what you would do in sql or what the smo objects will do from an api

960226
put	get
can you do that or would you get blasted demoted put on the to be laid off pile

960232
webserver	upload
i m looking for a zero config multi-user datbase that my winforms application can easily upload to a webserver folder together with 1 or 2 classic asp pages and am looking for some suggestions recommendations

960234
constructor	object
what is curious here is that the .xmlfileerrorlog part of that string show up red as a resharper error indicating that it cannot resolve symbol .ctor which when i look at the elmah.dll in reflector shows this object to require either a string or an idicationary in either of the two public constructor

960235
widget	button
similar to say how the clock widget behaves in mac os dashboard when you click the i button the whole widget rotates

960236
terminal	prompt
i set up my prompt command so that the titles of all my terminal windows tell me what host and directory i m in

960240
directory	folder
i have tried setting specific directory permissions for the sql-server agent account on the databasebackups folder but still get the same error

960241
forwarding	port
i have set up my ssl correctly i can checkout no problems even remotely due to port forwarding

960249
silverlight	wpf
from silverlight wpf you can call to web services meaning you can easily reuse your business layers although you just may need to wrap them

960263
digits	base
notice that each base 8 digits can be represented with 3 bits 000 for 0 through 111 for 7

960287
put	get
you could put the binary value in an arrays lets say i 64 iterate through it get the power depending on its position and keep adding it to the double

960288
configuration	environment
most often but not exclusively this was after installing a third party script app library which was error free in the developers environment but not mine because of a php or server configuration difference or missing dependency which would have normally output an error immediately alerting to what the issue was but not when the dev adds the magic

960312
hosts-file	hosts
i believe you can override this by commenting out the ipv6 localhost entry your hosts

960321
any	set
do you have the sender address set to something valid so you can see if there are any failure messages coming back

960332
put	get
i went ahead and set a variables to the name i put the hashmap in the modelandview under top line but i m not sure if that s the right way to get at that object

960354
pascal	delphi
so if your read the original gof design patterns book you can easily apply its concepts to delphi 2009 and all its previous versions even some of turbo pascal

960375
calloc	malloc
changing malloc to calloc in the texture2d source fixed the problem

960389
malloc	free
all malloc ing happens on startup and all free ing happens at the end of the application which in practice is never since the main part of the application is in an infinite loop

960390
thickbox	jquery
as far as i remember thickbox is initialized when dom is ready on ready event of jquery

960404
32-bit	x86
biggest standard integral data type is unsigned long long int - on my system 32-bit linux on x86 it has range 0 - 1.8 10 20 which is not enough for you so you need to create your own type struct or arrays and write basic math basically you just need an addition for that type

960422
hosts-file	hosts
i d suggest that you put an entry in your etc hosts so that dietron resolves either to your local ip-address or your loopback 127.0.0.1 and then access the server with

960449
primitive-types	generics
unfortunately i don t believe there really is a better way of doing this due to the nature of java s handling of primitive-types boxing arrays and generics

960450
selected	textbox
if you want to selected all the textbox you can do

960463
class-diagram	ooad
we today take uml s class-diagram and other ooad approach for granted but it was something that was discovered along the way

960470
instrumentation	profiling
i m looking for profiling techniques for evaluating and reducing image size waste in the same vein as shark and instrumentation help for run-time evaluation

960480
silverlight	wpf
if your xaml isn t hugely complex i d consider sl3 - but going from wpf to silverlight is trickier than the other way around - there are understandably big gaps

960481
realloc	malloc
a crash in realloc or malloc or free can be triggers by writing past the bounds of a memory block -- and this can happen anywhere else in your program

960501
put	get
currently it copies a file from the first fpt server to the local computer where it runs using ftp get and then copies it to the second ftp server using ftp put

960501
telnet	ftp
one idea is to create a java telnet session and and send a couple of ftp commands

960526
margins	padding
you ll probably want some margins or padding on the inner divs so that that the content doesn t cover your drop shadows

960531
telnet	scp
if you can use rcp 1 or scp 1 however you don t need the intermediate copy or a telnet session

960531
telnet	ssh
if you do use a remote session consider using ssh 1 instead of telnet

960534
telnet	ssh
telnet ssh should work

960537
contains	any
i have an image a map the image must be contains in a jframe and asked whether there are any java methods that given coordinates x y must make a kind of water mark or repaint the picture only in the specified coordinate

960556
lookup	any
this type of thing might be for a lookup table but are there any alternate table designs that might accomplish this better

960567
iteration	set
i set it to 2 milliseconds in each iteration in each thread why 2ms

960577
internet-explorer	opera
but it only works in internet-explorer and opera thanks julien

960583
queue	fifo
to dequeue doesn t mean to release. it means pull off the queue of cached no-longer-in-use reusable cells. it s called dequeuing because it s a fifo queue of cells and you are pulling the first one off

960591
boolean	int
because it generalizes better to any number of columns with linearly growing instead of quadratically growing amount of coding it s even neater in sql dialects that don t require explicit casting of boolean aka bit to int but i m not sure if sql-server is one of those

960594
push	pull
and rebasing commits is not okay cause i push to a bare repository which then has a hook that pull that to a working directory that is the testing server that is accessible by others

960607
exception-handling	try-catch
it s good that you ve got try-catch blocks around the code of your threadstart handler otherwise an exception-handling would just quietly delete the thread

960608
getter	setter
now if i want to customize the getter or the setter the field must be explicit as it was in c#2.0

960609
processor	cpu
note also that using maximum cpu is generally a good thing especially on modern processor

960622
subtract	add
now that vb has this feature would clscompliant attribute care if you have normal static-methods like add subtract instead of operator overloads only

960628
jsonp	ajax
here s a summary of cross-domain ajax techniques the only real non-proxy solution as richiehindle pointed out being jsonp

960633
postgresql	firebird
i would use normal database say mysql postgresql firebird etc. on server

960637
defined	declare
if from foo.c you call a function that is declare in bar.h and defined in bar.c then the compiler can only see that the function exists

960638
.net	wcf
wcf has great support for msmq if you re using .net

960651
iteration	tuples
also if the return value must be a list you could just change the yield i to yield list i but for iteration purposes the tuples will work just fine

960663
traversal	parent
the loop will traversal through each parent until it failed to cast

960666
.net	wcf
look into wcf for inter-process communication in .net

960679
integer	digits
for example a 4 2 is an integer of 19 729 decimal digits

960679
32-bit	64bit
i suspect that your 32-bit or 64bit depending on your architecture integers are overflowing and you re getting into infinite loops because of those issues

960682
export	report
not an asp.net page but one possible option would be to export the report as a snapshot .snp file

960697
keyboard	mouse
3 do the same thing hooking the various mouse and keyboard emulation functions

960701
contains	any
and if i then update to that tagged changeset at some later date the working copy won t contains any knowledge of that tag

960706
google-chrome	firefox
that works in firefox and google-chrome but not ie7 i don t know why

960716
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
take a look at the eventwaithandle manualresetevent autoresetevent classes

960719
traversal	parent
this would enable you to simply traversal the dom and easily check the parent ancestor nodes so that the replacements can be performed by changing the innertext property of the appropiate element

960720
entity-relationship	diagram
it can genentity-relationshipate sql for seventity-relationshipal diffentity-relationshipent databases as well as entity-relationship diagram and even code

960723
mapping	unique
the reason for storing them this way is because there is a one-to-one mapping between the different object types the channeldata is unique to each podcast feed

960749
shopping-cart	cart
however the problem i have now is when you click the paypal add to cart button the paypal shopping-cart reports the following error

960750
ruby	php
the toolset in php does not seem as robust and deep as it is in the ruby rails communities

960754
calloc	malloc
make sure that all your variables have a default-value and that all dynamic memory is zeroed out before you use it use calloc rather than malloc

960763
highlight	cell
if the datagrid doesn t have any provision of doing this for arguments s sake do i have to get the co-ordinates of the mouse in relation to the cell and then highlight the closest cell

960778
interpolation	cosine
i have algorithms for all these operations and many more quaternions to from euler angles of any rotation sequences to from rotation matrices direction cosine matrices quaternion interpolation matching positioning rate etc

960780
oracle	mysql
anyone have any experience with this for oracle sql server and mysql

960796
highlight	cell
if you want a hover style in ie6 and you only need to highlight a single cell you can do better by using an tag inside each cell

960799
tcp-ip	tcp
when the underlying tcp connection is dropped either by the client or the server the tcp-ip stack on the other side detects this and notifies the application

960809
32-bit	16-bit
take your 32-bit input cut it into two 16-bit halves l and r then repeat the

960824
carbon	cocoa
the apple guidelines talk about using a source list - how do i create this source list either in carbon or cocoa

960852
conditional	operators
you can then just keep saying or in c# the || operators in the where conditional

960853
put	get
you can put your class in a module and then you won t get the error because you ll be defining set within a namespace

960866
for-loop	arrays
it s trivially easy to construct a new arrays from an arguments object with a simple for-loop

960868
required	checked
it does provide useful stats have a look at an example output for ant but it does required you to have already done a svnlog of the repository and have a working copy checked out to perform the analysis on

960870
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately array.from and rest parameters are currently only implemented in newer versions of firefox and google-chrome check the browser compatibility table in the above links but you can use a transpiler like babel to efficently write es6 code with really low compatibility issues

960876
entity-framework	data-access
in the same line as linq to sql entity-framework llblgen and others orm tools remove most of the need to write stored procedures to handle common data-access crud for your business objects

960878
javascript	dom
as paolo mentions in his comment it is much more effective to reference the by an id - that goes directly on the javascript document.getelementbyid method which is way faster than going over the entire dom tree in search for one element.

960888
double	int
int to object or int to double

960895
double	int
your oggplayer is an iplay double not an iplay int

960895
double	int
you can t cast an iplay int to an iplay object or an iplay double to an iplay int like that

960907
double	int
note however that regardless the second will not work because there is no inheritance relationship between double and int

960921
contains	any
if you re releasing a build instead of the xcode project folder the only thing you may want to check is the embeddable provision file though i did glance at it quickly and it doesn t look like it contains any sensitive data

960928
32-bit	64bit
in a true 64bit machine the data path is 64bits wide and so moving 64bits takes exactly to a first approximation as many cycles as moving 32-bit on a 32 bit machine

960941
web-services	api
that solution doesn t seem to be the best either though because i am now making a rest client to touch my own web-services api from the exact same website

960941
web-services	api
the last solution that comes to mind is to put the validation on my user model and throw an exception up the web-services api when validation is triggered

960944
python	c++
- even when i m going to implement it in c++ python or whatever

960944
abstract-class	subclassing
if after reading paul s reasoning you find yourself agreeing with him you re going to be using a lot more abstract-class in the future to allow subclassing

960955
uibutton	uiview
i created another uiview based nib file with the contents for now just some uibutton objects of my reusable view and uiview subclass .m and .h files and then set the nib file s owner class to my newly created class name

960955
viewdidload	addsubview
then i added most of the code from j.biard i changed the rect to 50 50 100 100 left out the setdelegate out for now as i am just trying to get it working visually for now and i found that self.view addsubview view worked much better than self addsubview view to the end of the viewdidload methods of the first view controllers that is display when the app fires up

960958
ruby	php
php empty is pretty much the same as the ruby equivalent empty

960981
project-management	scrum
edit also your tool choice is probably dictated by your technology platform - team foundation s work items and pluginss methodologies see cochango s scrum plugins can arguably be described as an agile project-management tool

960990
sniffing	packets
my question boils down to this is the login information encrypted through ssl before it is posted to the secure server therefore preventing any man-in-the-middle packets sniffing

961032
any	set
a table with a single column is a set -- as long as you don t care about ordering the values or associating any other info with them it seems fine

961051
implements	extends
public class mainclass extends whateversuperclass implements whateverinterface

961068
svnadmin	dump
you can just dump the repository from visualsvn with the standard svnadmin tools and load it into something else very easily

961079
selected	button
what is the best way to print the selected member of the boxes added with the button event

961086
subclassing	base-class
note the interface has the base-class and the implementation has the subclassing

961113
administration	account
if you add the agent account temporary to the administration grouping and it works then this points to permissions being the source of the not terribly helpful â œthe system cannot find the file specifiedâ error

961138
sniffing	packets
if you post over ssl then the information will travel over the wire encrypted and will prevent packets sniffing

961138
credentials	security
this could be a security hole where the user s credentials are actually secure but your application web site is not protected from being accessed by individuals who have actually not authenticated themselves

961150
getter	setter
the getter would work as a is also a b but the setter wouldn t work since the implementation expects an a while the interface allows you to set theobject to b

961159
firefox	safari
firefox and safari however simply ignore the comma

961168
value	field
so we named the table contactcomplements and the field simply value

961183
methods	extend
if you wish to extend to tetration then i suggest you write a fastpower algorithm probably using the binary methods and then with that methods you can write a tetration function

961183
multiplication	exponentiation
what is important to note about the ackerman function is it essentially defines the heirachy of additive functions on the integers a 1 n is addition a 2 n is multiplication a 3 n is exponentiation a 4 n is tetration and after 5 the functions grow too fast to be applicable to very much

961183
multiplication	addition
another way to look at addition multiplication etc is

961186
contains	elements
if you match a complete elements you just plug it back in--you don t care if it contains the target string

961206
value	field
value would be as good a name as any for the field in question

961217
put	get
i m a serial unfinisher - repeatedly i put very skeletal open source code out mostly on code.google.com and see if i can attract other developers to get synergy

961234
value	field
have a table that stores a link to an entry in the record table a link to an entry in the field table and the field value

961244
any	set
use almost any character in the current code page for a name including unicode characters and characters in the extended character set 128â 255 except for the following

961244
integer	zero
characters whose integer representations are in the range from zero through 31 are not allowed

961257
calendar	daypilot
based on your description the daypilot lite calendar control from daypilot.org looks promising it renders an outlook style day-at-a-glance hourly view

961265
csv	xml
getarrays index get s an arrays by index returns xml or even maybe csv

961265
csv	xml
putarrays index data puts data an arrays by index data is xml or even maybe csv

961284
textbox	button
i have a windows form application c# framework 3.5 with several textbox button and labels

961295
32-bit	16-bit
if you have memory mapped onto a bus for example you might want to know that you are doing a 16-bit access instead of a 32-bit access

961309
aggregate	grouping
otherwise your aggregate grouping by will apply to all your columns and you ll end up with a potentially random bed_id and bed_num from the aggregate

961312
put	get
so its better to put the validation inside foo even if it will get called repeatedly

961322
tuples	any
in input lets the user enter any expression a tuples

961339
authentication	login
typically you d have a login function that accepts a username and a password authentication them and sets a cookie

961341
cross-domain	xss
this is not xss but cross-domain access - xss is a security vulnerability where you are echoing user-input back into an html page without encoding it

961349
division	modulo
the modulo operators tells you the remainder of a division of two numbers

961352
division	modulo
it checks if the modulo of the division

961359
json	xml
if performance is not critical you could load the data in json or xml and pass it back to server-side and do the processing

961359
.net	wcf
see .net by example calling a wcf service from javascript

961367
return-type	arguments
can i have a function with zero arguments and no return-type

961376
configuration	logging
the tomcat configuration page s logging in tomcat includes an example of increasing logging of sessions

961377
hide	show
i then use animate instead of hide and show to try to solve the problem

961392
python	c++
edit the languages i m familiar with are c++ and python

961410
httpwebrequest	webrequest
private httpwebrequest webrequest

961413
methods	extend
it has nothing to do with multiplying integers but you should probably be using the extend methods

961417
hide	show
may be you tool also have drawing setting to hide some part of the operation to reduce the width for instance to show or not the parameters or their direction their type etc

961418
progress-bar	progress
note that one common approach is to show a progress-bar which indicates i m making progress but doesn t try to guess how much is left to download

961428
environment	building
i seem to remember there have been changes around security of building dynamic methods to make it feasible for lambda expression generating expression tree to call private methods to work even in relatively low trust environment

961435
consistency	acid
consistency in acid means only valid data will be written

961444
linked-list	queue
the freebsd openbsd sys queue is another good option for a generic macro based linked-list

961457
attributes	properties
here s a solution that uses the sourceindex attributes note that sourceindex is an ie only properties but qtp simulates it on firefox so the same script will work on both browsers

961457
contains	elements
it doesn t assume anything about the elements contains the text if you know that this is the entire text in the elements you can remove the s and or add an html tag for much better performance

961467
javascript	dom
i am generating an asp.net radio button list control in my server side code.i am calling this page from my javascript via ajax.i want to load the radiobutton list control genearted to my dom using jquery s load method.i want to return the html of the control which i generated.is there any property wwhich would return the innnerhtml html of the control

961478
constructor	object
if it needs 10 values then it isn t unheard of to pass 10 values into the constructor - but what you describe sounds more like an entity object

961487
haskell	sml
pretty much all functional languages from the ml lineage miranda haskell ocml f# sml etc. don t require parentheses for function calls

961514
xquery	xslt
saxon sa supports streaming for xslt and xquery for details see

961517
user-controls	tabcontrol
you can add user-controls to the tab pages of a tabcontrol on a form

961527
contains	elements
xml schema does not allow to put any constraints on the text of an elements that contains mixed content

961542
bmp	gif
it loads jpg gif bmp etc

961551
contains	set
it s a set of com apis contains tts and sr engines

961555
where-clause	sql
standard sql doesn t allow you to refer to a column alias in a where-clause

961568
pagespeed	yslow
tools like yslow and google pagespeed will give you suggestions about how to speed up the page both loading and rendering

961578
authentication	login
you re not really doing the authentication any more if your having the user login via their facebook account now facebook is handling the authentication and you just have to link it to the account that facebook gives you

961578
authentication	login
yes but say i use a function like login facebookuid how does the backend check that the user is actually logged in with facebook and is actually authentication

961578
account	userid
if they don t have an active session then it will ask them to log into their account and return you the facebook userid

961590
any	set
this isn t the nicest thing to provide but you won t get any working validation otherwise as you need a language locale set in order to have a sensible alpha validation an a isn t a letter in chinese

961592
python	ruby
this capability was added to the clr in order to support dynamic languages like ruby and python

961607
data-structures	map
build up a map of the data-structures this way and if you want you can also delve into the function call flows to build up some form of sequence diagram

961609
checkboxlist	gridview
i have gridview i have column that should be checkboxlist like dropdownlist column but how can i let the list appear when click in the column

961619
display	height
otherwise the component gets assigned the preferred height which is the maximum height to display all at once

961647
webforms	asp.net
webforms and asp.net mvc

961650
quicksort	heapsort
the stl sort may depend on the implementation but as wikipedia says it is usually introsort a combination of quicksort and heapsort

961662
quicksort	mergesort
in most cases quicksort will run faster than mergesort even though the worst-case execution time is longer

961671
.net	wcf
the easiest way in .net is likely to be expose a wcf service easy enough to self host a wcf server use the servicehost class and have the client s connect to that

961696
tuples	set
c.extend takes an iterable a list tuples set custom iterables as an input

961701
hide	show
then i would hide show myradiobuttonlist.visible false true the list depending on some conditional

961701
user-controls	ascx
the intellisense will just show you the elements which you placed on your aspx ascx code and for which the designer has created appropriate variables in the designer file that is attached to your page user-controls

961707
for-loop	arrays
currently i am using a for-loop with 2 index variables for each arrays so only plus operations but all the managed arrays checks will not compare to a c pointer method

961720
contains	any
what i couldn t figure out was how to get a change to any of these textbox to propegate back up to the viewmodel of the page contains the addresscontrol

961725
put	get
in your example get a pointer to the alpha tag in all the xml documents and put the contents of all of them into a new document s alpha if they re not present there already

961730
ref	out
c# also has the out keyword which is a lot like ref except that with ref arguments must be initializer before calling the methods and with out you must assign a value in the receiving methods

961743
ref	out
it details clearly the exact behaviour and usage of passing parameters by value by reference ref and by output out

961779
put	get
i guess one way to do that is to get all apis exposed from the dll using dumpbin and put breakpoints on all those from windbg

961779
windows-xp	windows
btw i am working on windows-xp and want to monitor one executable which calls some windows system dll functions

961790
typedef	struct
use typedef with struct definitions so you don t need to scatter the struct keyword throughout the code

961798
asp.net-mvc	webforms
with asp.net-mvc you are rendering your html stream much more directly than the abstracted pseudo-stateful box that webforms wraps you up in

961817
haskell	ocaml
in functional programming languages ml haskell f# ocaml any function just has one argument - multi-parameter-functions are represented by passing tuples or currying

961817
perl	ruby
ruby and perl allow subroutines to be called without parentheses vbc-style languages visual basic vbscript do this too

961817
scheme	lisp
lisp scheme don t need parentheses for their function calls too but there are many parentheses anyway

961838
spawn	exit
i want to spawn the child processes and forget about them they will process some data write the output to the terminal which i could read with pexpect and then exit

961859
subclassing	base-class
now i m creating the variables without static keyword on the base-class and using extern keyword to reach in the subclassing and does it work

961861
order	add
in order to make your user story a bit more descriptive can you add

961862
any	set
i would just set an isrestoringstate property in your appdelegate and check that during viewwillappear if it s set run your restore for that view including pushing any visible child view

961882
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i tried to create an iphone application with uitabbarcontroller and some uinavigationcontroller inside it and faced the same problems as mamcx

961885
contains	set
write a set of functions to convert back and forth between object that may contains dbnull and nullable .net variables

961898
anycpu	ngen
as long as you are not ngen ing any assemblies it would be better to leave as anycpu and let the jit target the architecture

961911
contains	any
a redirect response itself doesn t contains any data

961925
unsafe	out
obviously the unsafe code is the fastest but i was surprised to see that the cls couldn t figure out that that it can drop the index checks when dealing with jagged-arrays

961939
expression	evaluation
if lazy evaluation is an issue then you probably don t want a generator expression

961942
vbscript	vb6
the answers covering 80386 assembler vb6 and vbscript have been removed

961967
primitive	int
it is a typedef for a primitive int type

961969
widget	button
also as arve systad said changing such basic widget of the os is a no-goâ though one should be careful with changing button then too

961980
rewrite	rule
after that you can use the following rule to rewrite that subdomain internally to a folder with the same name

961993
negative-number	zero
trying to compute the logarithm for a negative-number or zero will result in a math domain error in python

961995
contains	elements
also be aware that while linqtosql will happily translate lists contains a vast number of items i ve seen it do over 50 000 elements sql-server will only accept 2 100 parameters for a single query

961997
order	add
this way the various patterns of access that you need to add over time are separated from the order domain object

962014
nstextview	nsbutton
you can have an nstextview that responds to click but you should consider using nsbutton instead

962015
selected	button
upon selected 3 items from the list and clicking the add button the alert displays 11 13 10

962043
contains	set
your reader will then contains a single row with one column containsing the number of rows in the result set

962049
actionscript	mxml
for flex you can only do mxml and actionscript although there s an option to compile c c++ code using alchemy

962062
python	java
jpype allows python programs having full access to java class libraries

962066
contains	any
... and if i then update to that tagged changeset at some later date the working copy won t contains any knowledge of that tag

962091
background-color	display
basically you need to display a grid of cells each of which has a foreground and background-color

962092
keydown	keyup
it would propably be the easiest to extends the textbox class and add logic so that it behaves like a console respond to the keypressed keyup keydown events or similar

962096
endpoint	uri
be sure to assign a different address to your wshttpbinding endpoint otherwise you will get an error saying that you have two endpoint listening on the same uri

962113
basic	vba
ms-access visual basic for applications vba was also pretty bad

962139
hide	next
the next step in the asp.net-mvc obfuscation i gather is to hide the code in 3 or 4 different files

962149
space	input
this will match one optional white space on ether end of the input or value and he has removed the end of line marker

962156
parentheses	keyword
enclosing the procedure call parameters in parentheses requires using the call keyword

962163
itemtemplate	gridview
if the user control is a part of the itemtemplate on the grid since your user control is created while rows of the gridview are created you can only this after you bind your gridview

962166
constructor	object
the title mentions something about string s constructor but since you don t show any code that calls a constructor i m forced to assume the problem is actually in the caller of this function where two string object would be constructed for the parameters

962169
callgrind	gprof
also to get a good understanding of the basic calltree during startup the initialization procedure you may want to consider using gprof or callgrind valgrind

962169
directory	folder
in addition i would recommend to directly start commenting the source code yourself by adding plain text files to each subfolder describing the contents of each code directory the purpose of each individual file and basically everything that s useful from a high level point of view to grasp the project s overall structure so that you can basically refer to some form of index file detailing the internal structure of each source code folder

962171
constructor	object
essentially during the call to the base classes constructor the object is not yet of the derived type and thus the base type s implementation of the virtual function is called and not the derived type s

962181
malloc	free
can the repeated alloc free alloc_memory is a simple wrapper around glib s malloc calls hurt performance and how badly

962187
http	ssl
i m currently working on a php openid provider that will work over http hence ssl encrypted

962201
haskell	ocaml
the incredible type system aka haskell and ocaml praat is coming to you

962201
arrays	loops
to show the arrays type let me introduce a tiny loops

962201
selected	button
so if you want to perform operation on a given file you must selected the file in the list programmatically and then push the different button to take some actions

962206
vmware	esx
optional set up vmware vsphere esx or find a hosting service that already has one

962206
switching	router
switching over to web box 2 using whatever router methods you chose

962218
pointers	stack
if you are allocating the same size item hundreds of thousands of times then why not just maintain a heap of your objects since these seem to be relatively simple don t contains pointers to other allocated memory and free onto your own heap or stack actually

962218
average	max
of course the initial allocations and other allocations as the program is running when it needs to expand this memory may cause fragmentation but if you are really worried about this you can run some stats and find the average max typical size of your heap during runs and pre-allocate this at once when the program starts up avoiding fragmentation

962220
extends	super
super t so we can add a rule for animal to a dog validator assuming dog extends animal

962224
configuration	logging
you don t appear to have posted all the relevant information - for example where is your logging configuration file

962224
configuration	logging
the issue about custom handlers is easily explained if you look at the logging documentation for configuration see

962224
configuration	logging
this explains that any handler class described in the configuration file is eval d in the logging packages namespace

962225
dom4j	xom
this answer is part of my evaluation of xom which was suggested as one option in my question about the best java xml library to replace dom4j

962232
python	perl
it quickly led me to rewrite it all in python and scrap perl completely it was that or me quitting

962232
python	perl
the python version was so much more usable and supportable that 10 years later it is still in use and from what i hear no one is allowed to use perl at that company again

962236
temporary	rvalue
if it is truly not an lvalue it is an rvalue - and a useful heuristic for rvalue is that they represent hidden temporary objects that the compiler instantiates to make your code work

962236
temporary	rvalue
when you bind an rvalue to a const reference you basically extend the temporary object s life-time to the life-time in this case scope of the reference and the compiler can not just destroy it at the end of that expression - so you end up with a reference to a valid object

962236
constructor	object
there are some other issues with your code such as why you are destroying and creating the memory that your object exclusively points to upon each assignment and the lack of a copy constructor and destructor and if no one has addressed them by the time this post appears i will

962248
url-encoding	url
because this page is a top result for google searches on the topic i think it s worth mentioning some work that has been done on url normalization with python that goes beyond url-encoding space characters

962255
stderr	stdout
i want to continue using stdout so redirecting stderr into stdout is not helpful in this case

962262
versioning	downgrade
your two main options as far as i can tell are to rewrite your code to not use fattach or to downgrade to a kernel versioning 2.4.5 or lower

962268
stderr	stdout
redirected stderr to stdout stdout to dev-null and then use the backticks or to capture the redirected stderr

962282
mouse-listeners	mouselistener
what i d effectively want to do is to be able to attach the mouselistener to the background of the gui for the tabs - but how to accomplish something like this

962298
constructor	object
if the base class constructor calls a method that is overriden in the derived class the call will actually be handled at the derived level calling a method on an unconstructed object yielding unexpected results

962301
binary	octal
when converting from binary to octal it s more easy each 3 bits give you 1 digit in octal

962320
digits	base
writing n in base b takes ceiling log base b n digits

962320
binary	octal
the ratio you noticed octal binary is log base 8 n log base 2 n 3

962323
callback	methods
what i am questioning is the thread-safety of passing in instance methods of objects instantiated in one thread in the case of this recipe the gui thread as deferred callback and errback methods for a reactor running in a separate thread

962327
digits	base
if you have a number that s x digits long in base b then the maximum value that can be represented is b x - 1

962327
digits	base
so if you want to know how many digits it might take in base c then you have to find the number y that c y - 1 is at least as big as b x - 1

962332
default	reset
it will reset all set options to the default value

962352
hide	show
note that you could just as easily use create free instead of show hide

962365
profiling	trace
use trace or profiling to see what it is doing on that page

962373
ubuntu	debian
if you don t want to use cpan to get the module both debian and ubuntu have a libnet-subnets-perl package

962386
product	invoice
cannot convert product invoice order_discount decimal 0.00 order_price ... order_adjust none order_value none delete false id 92 quantity 8 to decimal

962393
export	report
i have a friend experiencing problems testing a web site of mine that provides a csv export for a report

962399
vbscript	basic
i find myself avoid having to use vbscript visual basic 6 the most

962399
scala	java
i use primarily c++ javascript java for most tasks and dabble in ruby scala erlang python assembler perl when the need arises

962399
vbscript	vb6
my issue with vbscript and vb6 is when i use them to script windows or office applications the right domain for them - i find myself struggling with the language they fall short of being the right tool

962399
vbscript	jscript
while there are certain things that work better with vbscript such as passing arrays back and forth from com objects is slightly easier although it is easier to pass event handlers into com components with jscript i am still surprised by the amount of coders that still use vbscript to script windows - i bet if they wrote the same program in both languages they would find that jscript works with you much more than vbscript because of jscript s native hash data types and closures

962399
vbscript	vba
vb6 vba though a little better than vbscript in general still has many similar issues where for their domain they require much more boiler plate to do simple tasks than what i would like and have seen in other scripting languages

962493
daemons	systemd
8 systemd administration commands and daemons

962508
.when	ready
which hooks the complete event which is signalled .when the data is ready

962509
javascript	dom
anyway you can replace all marquee elements in the dom to span s with javascript

962512
splitter	panels
one possible solution is to use a panels as my right side and then use a splitter inside this panelss for vertical splitting but it doesn t really feels like the right way

962531
loading	gif
i want to have an element that can be loaded with an image but before the image is fully loaded i want it to show a loading gif done this using css

962531
hide	show
i think i should be showing the image where the alert is using hide show but im not quite sure how to reference it from inside the function

962531
loading	gif
i want to use the same div for the loading gif then the final image

962549
click	mouse
it will also be triggers even when the checkbox changes in another way than click with the mouse

962551
radix-sort	quicksort
a simple case has recently bitten me when i tried to improve a quicksort sorting of short strings by employing radix-sort

962551
radix-sort	quicksort
turns out for short strings this linear time radix-sort was faster than quicksort but there was a tipping point for still relatively short strings since radix-sort crucially depends on the length of the strings you sort

962563
silverlight	wpf
recently i ve been dipping into xaml silverlight wpf and really struggling with designing a ui using xaml

962601
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine with firefox and ie but not with opera or google-chrome

962601
google-chrome	opera
in google-chrome opera everything seems to work ok in script one

962601
google-chrome	opera
any ideas why this doesn t work with opera or google-chrome

962601
google-chrome	firefox
i now have it working in firefox ie and google-chrome but opera seems to refuse to load any .js files at all now

962604
uitableview	uiswitch
i ve set up a uitableview with several custom uitableviewcell s that have some uitextfield s and uiswitch s based on settings.app

962604
value	field
my question is when a user click the save button in the navigation bar what s the beat way to access these text field and switch controls to save their value

962606
constructor	private
if you do not add a public before the town constructor it will be private

962610
stderr	stdout
on windows use eclipsec.exe instead of eclipse.exe to have build output written to stdout stderr and so that the call blocks until completion

962611
webserver	security
depending on the security configuration of your webserver the recommended default permissions of 755 for directories and 644 for files should be reasonably secure

962612
echo	die
but if you re not sure one way to debugging something like this is to add echo or die statements in various places to see what s happening in the code

962613
json	xml
you may start out with only xml-based views eg xhtml voicexml for voice browsing xml for web services but what happens when you decide you also need json views to support ajax interactions

962613
json	xml
json javascript literals use a different escape mechanism than xml

962614
worksheet	excel
if i embed a powerpoint presentation within an excel worksheet then within the powerpoint set up chart objects on each slide can i go into the data table for the chart object and have it refer back to the excel spreadsheet for its data

962618
value	field
there are multiple other problems with this code but the biggest is that the last line returns the whole cleaned_data dictionary rather than the value of this particular field - i suspect this is the cause of the error you are seeing

962637
google-chrome	opera
opera and google-chrome might be a little less messy than you re hoping for

962649
logout	login
create 2 methods in the service login logout

962650
defined	declare
essentially you need to have a function-prototypes before you can use friend on it within the class however you also need the class to be declare in order to properly defined the function-prototypes

962661
python	c++
any suggestions pointers or ideas welcome it doesn t matter if any code is in php or python or c++ or asp.

962706
expression	evaluation
ssrs expressions are evaluated using visual basic which usually does a full not a short-circuit evaluation of all operands in an expression in iif cond truexp falsexp besides cond both truexp and falsexp are evaluated and may throw regardless of the value of cond

962712
any	set
is there any way to only set the bottom spacing

962730
deep-copy	object
it s probably because they want to force you to think about whether you need a shallow copy of your object or a deep-copy

962749
solaris	aix
i_recvfd is part of the streams extensions which are normally only present in system v based unixy operating systems aix and solaris for example

962749
linux	bsd
others like linux and bsd do not support it and probably never will as posix now has an alternative using sendmsg and recvmsg

962753
gnome	kde
take a look at dbus yes for windows too which is the modern spiritual heir of various componentry frameworks corba gnome bonobo kde s dcom

962758
put	get
you just loop through your list and put all elements smaller than your pivot at the beginning and all others at the end - which is not enough to get a sorted list

962761
google-chrome	opera
so i suspect that when it comes to execute waiter opera and google-chrome encounters that interval is undefined and just silently drops out of functiontwo maybe stops script

962770
google-chrome	firefox
we ve seen huge leaps in javascript engine performance already from google-chrome safari and firefox

962786
contains	any
so if you re using a framework of any kind the header include file on each page would contains the

962791
pixels	line
you might consider using guidelines see guidelineset on msdn and overriding the rectangles onrender methods so that their boundaries line up with the pixels boundaries of the device

962791
pixels	line
internally it s exactly what snapstodevicepixels is using to ensure that objects line up with the device s pixels but by placing guidelines manually you ll be able to control when the snapping behaviour is applied and when it is not so when your image is zoomed all of the way out you can avoid drawing guidelines or only draw guidelines where your shapes lie next to other shapes and rely on wpf s anti-aliasing to take care of the rest

962791
silverlight	wpf
it seems like microsoft is aware of this problem too - wpf 4.0 is expected to feature layout rounding which like the version in silverlight rounds off non-integer values at the render pass when layout rounding has been enabled

962797
internet-explorer	firefox
i know it works in firefox 3 and internet-explorer 8 but not in ie7

962806
32-bit	64bit
10 9 is key constant for unsigned int of 32-bit and unsigned long long int of 64bit

962806
multiplication	multiplying
multiplying is just multiplication and scale and propagate the integer overflow

962806
32-bit	64bit
a number bigger than 64bit can never occur in a multiplication because c is an unsigned integer of 32-bit and k is a unsigned short of 16-bit

962814
panels	grid
for me it wasn t until i understood that there were different types of panels that laid things out differently and that i could express what i wanted to accomplish in a number of different ways a dockpanel with one child set to dockpanel.dock bottom usually has the same result as a two-row grid with the first row s height set to and the second row s height set to auto that i really felt comfortable laying things out in wpf

962815
any	set
after that you should be able to set the z-index order as you can with any other html element

962819
hide	show
if your not a 100 satisfied with the reportviewer s toolbar you can always hide it and show your own

962835
arrays	loops
if you re sorting objects you could loops through the coords arrays and do something like

962843
keyboard	mouse
constructing a scripting effectively ruins your wrists as you re swapping between keyboard and mouse thousands of times an hour typing stuff into the the little configuration boxes and re-arranging your lines of code

962848
margins	padding
this article overviews how alignment margins padding work in xaml

962859
command-line	cmd
note you probably need to specify the username and password for the cmd consult the cmd-line for details

962874
pixels	line
a horizontal line from say 0 100 to 639 100 results in a rectangle only 1 pixels high

962874
pixels	line
so for a large diagonal line going from one corner to the other in order to match the bounding box you have setup- a region would have to specify either every set of pixels on each vertical line or the entire bounding box

962888
selected	textbox
postback controls such as dropdownlist and textbox restore their posted state the selected item of a dropdown ist posted even when viewstate is disabled because even with viewstate disabled the control is still able to post its value

962890
quicksort	mergesort
it s easy to see that mergesort does as it s symmetric but reasoning about something like bubblesort or more importantly quicksort or heapsort is not

962901
shell	bash
i know on nix machines for bash shell i can use ctrl-d

962913
expression	evaluation
there is no native facility in java for evaluation strings as expression

962924
dictionary	arrays
i would also use this declaration of the dictionary otherwise you could get an arrays of dictionaries

962929
enterprise	platform
gwt is going to become the go-to platform for enterprise java web app development

activerecord	datamapper
i am trying to use datamapper in a ruby-on-rails app as an alternative to activerecord

962955
activerecord	datamapper
i believe this is tied to an activerecord helper - is there an alternative way of reporting validation failures in the view for datamapper

962960
gethashcode	equals
there is any tool or technique that helps implementing equals and gethashcode

962971
value	field
the strongly typed version performs a reference equality check object.referenceequals object object and then compares the value of all field well only those that you tell the generator to include

962971
value	field
as for gethashcode a smart factorisation of the field s gethashcode value are combined using unchecked to avoid overflow exception-handling if you use the compiler s checked option

962971
value	field
each of the field s value apart from the first one are multiplied by prime numbers before being combined

962974
click	mouse
i want to be able to click and drag the dial and it will rotate to follow the mouse

963006
fieldset	margins
it looks like your first problem is that your order lists have no left margins style so the numbers for the list pop out of the fieldset

963006
order	add
to fix that just add some margin to your order lists

963011
any	set
i m not saying this is neccesarily any better than the slice filtering solution above but it s often worth considering passing your templates a context object with everything set up nicely

963017
gethashcode	equals
as for a generic equals and gethashcode there s a technique based on serialization that might work for you

963029
radio-button	button

mocking	stubs
if it s because you dont want to bring in a mocking framework you could code up some simple stubs as you need them

963037
opacity	shadow
you ll probably want to tweak the opacity of the black color the forth component in components and change the shadow parameters

963039
ruby	php
i see a lot of benchmarks between php python ruby etc all over the internet

963040
python	ruby
well don t you think they might prefer to write them in ruby or python

963040
python	ruby
perhaps that s why people are interested in measuring ruby and python performance

963040
ruby	php
performance actually is important which is why they are concerned about ruby and python and php s performance

963047
ruby	php
i m not a ruby fan for the same reason i m not a fan of the heavyweight php frameworks like cakephp or symfony i find these frameworks overly invasive and so heavyweight that you re not doing php anymore

963051
design-time	designer
however at design-time none of this startup code executes so the designer bombs and fails to load the page

963071
markup	xhtml
the proper xhtml markup is

963090
activerecord	datamapper
however using datamapper in place of activerecord in ruby-on-rails why would this line

963096
digits	radix
for example binary 0.11001101001001 is decimal 0.80133056640625 both 14 digits after the radix point

963099
click	mouse
capturing the mouse ensures that your control will continue to get mouse updates even when the user mouses off of the control until they let go of the click and by getting the positioning of the mouse relative to the current element the control your calculation should always be the same regardless of where the control actually renders on screen

963100
contains	any
one way the code i gave doesn t match the code you gave is in the situation where a line doesn t contains any distances

963110
put	get
for some reason anything i put into a textbox does not get saved

963131
contains	elements
a particular class has a hashtable contains 1..n elements

963132
mootools	extjs
user-interface mootools dojo and extjs will have you working with very solid code

963147
contains	set
it helps try an keep the sensitive information contains in a concise set of configuration files -- i would not spread it out put it one place and guard that place

963156
error-handling	try-catch
see lazy error-handling in java for an overview of how to eliminate try-catch blocks using an option type

963171
arrays	loops
however to get the forum s to display i need to set the arrays value 0 and obviously this isnt going to work during a foreach loops how do i loops the categories then loops the forums inside of categories

963180
mootools	extjs
user-interface mootools dojo and extjs will have you working with very solid code

963185
arrays	map
given the above well you could use any sort of structure something tree-like an arrays anything to keep track of the individual states and define what to do in each state hence some of the suggestions to use function pointers - have a state map to a function pointer which indicates what to do at that state.

963194
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
use a waithandle like manualresetevent or autoresetevent

963204
glut	glu
the second way uses the x11 libraries glut glu gl

963204
freeglut	glut
glut v4 freeglut

963204
glut	x11
libglut-devel -- x11 version of glut freeglut this will also pick all dependent packages

963212
driver	kernel
you need a real address not virtual which you can only get inside the kernel or by writing a driver to relay one to userspace

963214
margins	padding
the classes on id slideshow set dimensions padding margins positioning etc

963214
slideshow	gif
the hide-slideshow css file does a display none on #slideshow and the adjust class around the animated gif does some pushing and pulling to get it where it needs to be which is where the slideshow would be if it wasn t hidden

963214
google-chrome	safari
i ve tested this in ff3 ie7 ie8 google-chrome and safari win

963214
document	element
i get an error that says document type does not allow element link here

963229
hide	show
also most decent starter frameworks such as html5 boilerplate and modernizr will do this using css classes on the html tag so you have a global way to hide show content from your css file instead of using javascript

963249
constructor	object
that you could memset this 0 sizeof theobject a c++ object in its constructor with no negative consequences

963292
any	set
in eclipse if i set a breakpoint in my blog_controller and then choose the debugging button it seems to use the ruby-debugging-ide gem to execute the code but i get this unhelpful output and no option to step into any source

963295
panels	grid
i had to add the grid on a panels

963310
innodb	myisam
both tables must use the innodb storage engine myisam doesn t support referential integrity constraints

i have a simple form that lists to-do items with a checkbox to the left of them and an update button at the bottom as so

963364
scala	java
i have a number of runnable programs written in java that i d like to set into one class that would run those one after another in scala

963393
web-applications	gwt
i would therefore like to know whether it is possible to edit java syntax and otherwise set visual-studio up to built web-applications for gwt

963402
selected	cell
i m using a tableview to display a list of rows and when selected i want additional controls to appear right below the cell probably in another view which i will control

963402
selected	cell
so far i ve managed to get a reference to the selected cell by running through the visiblecells arrays in the tableview but the frame property always returns a y-coordinate of 0 no matter what scroll position the table is in

963417
versioning	upgrade
now i upgrade it to 2010 versioning i wanna send it back to my friend so he should be able to use it

963418
google-chrome	firefox
one of the methods i came across while surfing the .net was to have an intermediate page that shows the animation while loading the actual page using javascript location.href .so i figure use a couple of ajax calls from the intermediate page to a servlet to get the feedback.problem is it works fine in ie 6 7 and firefox 3.but the ajax callbacks dont seem to be getting executed in case of google-chrome and opera the location.href part seems to mess it up and the callbacks never get executed

963425
scala	java
i m tired of having gazillion property files xml files and other type of configuration files in java and wonder if there s best practice to handle those someway more efficient in scala

963428
contains	any
you re best bet is to encrypt any file contains sensitive information before adding it to version-control

963436
access-control	authentication
the authentication and the access-control role based stuff are all available as seperate plugins gems to the best of my knowledge and that s a good thing as they are different beasts

963446
value	field
how often are you really going to have field in your database that will have ientical value that you can look up like that

963449
jquery	.post
you could do this in one call by getting a whole html page as a response with the ajax get or .post methods and carving up parts of it to dole out in the success callback function or if you wanted to do it for each piece of the page you wanted to update separately you could use jquery s load method

963451
attributes	properties
i thought this query would return all object nodes where there is a properties node that has a refobjectid attributes that equals the objectid attributes of the object node and no refpropertyid attributes .

963476
contains	any
you can have arbitrary strings there including ones which happen to contains html tags the only issue with your example is the inner which would confuse any parsing

963481
any	set
in any case one of the answers to the question about java mentions changing the character set to iso-8859-1

963488
digits	base
it may be too late or too irrelevant to make this suggestion but could you store each byte as two base 10 digits or one base 100 instead of one base 256

963488
subtraction	addition
if you haven t implemented division yet then that implies all you have is addition subtraction and maybe multiplication

963506
hide	show
the complete table is dynamically constructed in loop and only after that should the tabs should hide and show each of the table corresponding to each tab

963518
twitter	gmail
choose all contacts from facebook twitter digg gmail or msn to send the email to

963525
python	perl
i d still use perl or python or any scripting language

963547
constructor	object
the purpose of the constructor is to construct an object

963549
thickbox	jquery
i personally recommend jquery and thickbox jmodal or impromptu

963557
innodb	myisam
mysql supports a few different types of tables but the most commonly used are myisam and innodb

963557
innodb	myisam
myisam in mysql 5.6+also innodb tables are the types of tables that mysql supports for full-text indexes

963557
innodb	myisam
if this value is anything except myisam or innodb then mysql will throw an error if your trying to add fulltext indexes

963558
jquery	dojo
things like jquery with a few plugins or dojo might have something like that in its dijit library

963587
seam	jsf
to implemented proper layering i suggest you put your configuration in some kind of globally accessible bean instantiated by seam probably populated from a .properties file which you reference in your jsf pages

963588
solaris	linux
it is a pretty solid interface though it still has slightly limited portability works out of the box on linux but not on solaris for example - needs some tweaks

963594
export	report
but i found that report service can t export to ms-word by itself

963601
xml-serialization	xml
i am using the datagridview control for reading and writing an xml file through xml-serialization

963604
base-class	inherited
to me this smells like you d like to have a base-class doing the setup kind of things and then have your test classes inherited from this base and only add the new testing functionality

963622
jeditable	jquery
when jeditable calls jquery s ajax it sets ajax options like this

963648
dom4j	xom
this answer is part of my evaluation of xom which is a strong contender in my quest for finding the best java xml library to replace dom4j .

963676
export	report
i m not sure what you mean by report service can t export to ms-word by itself

963676
export	report
report services 2008 can export to all of the formats you mentioned excel pdf word and html it s one of its basic features

963693
numerical	nan
the dictionary works fine for non-nan numerical range values but when the key is nan nan numericalrange object then the dictionary throws a keynotfoundexception

963718
arrays	map
lists arrayss stacks whatever in php everthing is an ordered map misleadingly called arrays

963718
arrays	map
php arrayss an arrays in php is actually an ordered map

963718
dictionary	arrays
it can be treated as an arrays list vector hash table an implementation of a map dictionary collection stack queue and probably more

963719
entity-framework	ado.net
edit it seems ado.net entity-framework is already oracle friendly

963726
constructor	object
you can do this either by passing the listview object or parent windows to the class constructor or storing it in a static variables that is accessible by the class

963726
constructor	object
again you can do this as a static method or pass the main program object s this pointer into the class constructor

963737
constructor	object
the constructor is supposed to create the object

963737
constructor	object
that seems to me to be a lot more logical than the constructor is supposed to create the object and load its data from the filesystem

963743
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net data services relies on the ado.net entity-framework and that definitely also supports oracle

963750
hide	show
remove hide the silverlight object show a nicer and more descriptive message to the user and a refresh link to start up the silverlight page again we run a full-sized silverlight application so if the silverlight object isn t working the customer might as well reload anyway

963750
restart	reload
somehow reload the object tag automatically to avoid having the customer perform any actions to get going again perhaps combined with some notice to the customer that the system restart

963759
constructor	object
a constructor should really do the minimum amount of work simply initialise the object ready for use and leave it at that

963759
constructor	object
it is easy to provide several constructor to initialise the object with different information you might be able to pass in your own class rather than a string that can supply the pathname

963759
constructor	object
in the constructor the object is not fully formed so it can be dangerous to do work - calling a virtual function inside a constructor is a very bad idea

963764
subtraction	division
i succeeded at making adding subtraction and multiplication work correctly but i am quite stuck at division

963770
order	add
add a row to the shopping-cart with the quantity descption and amount of the order

963791
google-chrome	firefox
both opera and google-chrome as well safari display the same result as firefox the right result

wpf does this better then silverlight though i don t know if there are improvements in sl3

963823
centering	fixed
i am trying to centering a paragraph tag with some text in it within a div but i can t seem to centering it using margins 0 auto without having to specify a fixed width for the paragraph

963823
centering	fixed
does anyone know how i can centering the paragraph tag within the div without having to specify a fixed width for the paragraph or without using tables

963824
32-bit	64bit
for a sequence to wrap you d need 2 billion records in a single table 32-bit or 10 18 with 64bit pk s

963826
selection	cell
after that it restores the current cell selection

963829
.net	wcf
service references are .net 3.0+ and part of the wcf way of doing things

963834
meta-tags	meta
there is a known problem in ie6 that do not correctly support the content-disposition meta tag and there are some gotchas in how to compose the various meta-tags

963841
any	set
this calculation can cause an overflow in the upshift of the x y remainder if this remainder has any bits set in the high 32-bit causing an incorrect answer

963858
cygwin	gnu
if you have cygwin installed you already own a nice gnu utility to achive this head

963872
google-chrome	firefox
using the code below i tested in firefox opera google-chrome ie6 7 8

963888
firefox	opera
get some inspection tool like firebug for firefox or dragonfly for opera and see which rules are applied to the box you want and its inner elements

963898
value	field
a significant example for this is thinking a combination of two or more field is unique and thus can become a primary key whereas in the future you want to allow nulls or other non-unique value in them

963904
constructor	object
using prototype.js i create a custom object which is going to be a parameter on a constructor

963906
javascript	dom
another way to do this is to create the dom elements on the fly with javascript

963913
pixels	line
still if any line of html can affect any pixels you simply cannot partially load a page

963919
put	get
when running in dev using cassini that s usually the place i have to put modules to get them running

963970
mbunit	nunit
nunit mbunit xunit all offer some kind of rowtest functionality which allows you to read data from excel and use that as input for your watin tests

963972
keyword	term
but how do i specify the keyword search term

963975
cassini	iis
cassini the development webserver provided with iis uses the iis6 module syntax so you must duplicate the module add like so

963994
contains	any
further to my last question i d like to know if current browsers can read attributes values without any quotes even if the value contains slashes like

964006
required	checked
i always prefer checked for conditional that required a break or return rather than those that would need lengthy code execution

964026
compact-framework	.net
is there some way how to make scrollbar wider in winforms for .net compact-framework

964026
compact-framework	.net
windows mobile 6.0 .net compact-framework 3.5

964033
instances	self
here all the instances will get func as the execute methods and will get self passed as an arguments

964048
contains	any
but this is really annoying and doesn t appear to have any good reason the fact that my project contains about 100 objects is not an excuse

964060
conditional	operators
trinary conditional operators

964072
button	popup
i have a form consisting of one textbox and button.on clicking on button one popup appears which contains one datagrid from which i can select value such that value appears in textbox using javascript .in ie6 and ie7 i can select value from grid in popup but in ie8 mozilla and google-chrome iam not able to select.what may be the reason.can anybody help to solve this issue

964072

following javascript i used to bind value selected in popup to textbox

964081
registration	login
if you want to handle login and user registration you should actually

964091
iteration	tuples
the first overload stops the iteration through the tuples after we reach the last record type

964092
web-config	app-config
the maxreceivedmessgesize is in the .config file of the app web-config or app-config etc

964098
dialog	pop-up
should pop-up a download this file dialog

964102
contains	any
run jaxb on the original schema which will specify the content of test as a string or any it has to otherwise it cannot contains a cdata declaration

964102
document	element
at runtime you need to parsing the xml document using jaxb then navigate to the test element and parsing that element again using jaxb

964105
32-bit	64bit
it s written to do 64bit unsigned divisions using 32-bit arithmetic only so you can t directly cut n paste the code

964105
subtract	division
btw - the ordinary shift and subtract algorithm for division would work as well

964108
any	set
uml does not require you to produce any specific set of diagrams

964121
font-size	height
i would like to know if there s any way to change the height of a segment control or perhaps changing the font-size of the control

964129
authentication	login
i ve dealt with login authentication systems earlier and i find several shortcomings in this method

964129
salt	md5
better approach to store md5 of username+password+email+salt in the database salt being random and stored together with the user s record

964131
latitude-longitude	street-address
you need to use core location to get the current location but with that latitude-longitude pair you can get maps to route you from there to a street-address or location

964147
webforms	asp.net
i ve found the following question and answer which refers to scott hanselmans post on mixing forms and mvc can i use asp.net mvc together with regular asp.net webforms

964158
contains	elements
if you search descendant paths like a you will have to decide when to terminate the search or it may continue forever imagine in a elements a that contains b which contains a

964237
contains	set
to workaround set up a local webserver e.g tomcat and access the html file contains the applet through it

964260
postback	ajax
the sites you see that do provide this functionality generally use flash or an iframe so that the postback occurs in the iframe and gives the illusion of an ajax request

964261
web-services	security
i ve read the asnwers to some of the security related questions and found out something about challenge response authentication and three pass protocol but nothing was directly related to web-services

964270
google-chrome	firefox
using a quick sample html doc at end of answer i tested this with firefox 3.5 beta 4 google-chrome 2 and ie 7

964284
value	field
an additional field contains a numeric value

964284
value	field
records in my table and setting the value of this new field to the same as

should set the value of new field in all records to that of the existing field

964294
twitter	tweets
how can i get a list of the tweets of a particular twitter account s followers

964295
http	ssl
then maybe https with either ssl client certificates or http auth or http digest authentication

964309
checkbox	button
control templates are a way to change the look feel of a control for example making a round button of changing the check mark graphics of a checkbox

964331
version-control	git
all my projects are under version-control using git

964341
gethashcode	tostring
override equals gethashcode and tostring

964355
http	ssl
typically one either uses ssl http or else ws-security

964355
web-services	security
however if security actually matters one typically learns about security in web-services first

964366
low-level	hardware
dma sata are hardware low-level techlonogies and aren t visible to any programming language whatsoever

964379
contains	elements
also have a look at the java.nio package which contains faster i o elements than java.io

964379
arrays	loops
furthermore the arrays class has methods for comparing byte arrays build in maybe these can also be used to make things faster and clear up your loops a bit

964386
select	union
union select ct_cid as level2 from cat_tree where ct_sid sid_int and ct_parent in level1

964396
put	get
but only if i put the full path home csiz desktop c++ ep0 program data file.t it will get me a 0

964416
filtering	grouping
i know about view filtering but i really want hide the view completly from this grouping

964417
formatting	printing
if you want to printing a floating-point number to a desired precision you can use output formatting codes like the following

964431
select	union
notice the parens are only needed in the sub-select not the union select

964446
expression-blend	designer
you could also argue that the expression-blend tool speeds ui development time significantly and gives you the opportunity to offload much ui work to a designer or ui specialist

964449
select	union
the answers already given are correct for your query however if in the future you want to append the results of two or more select statements together you should take a look at union or union all

964449
union-all	union
union removes duplicates from the results union-all doesn t and is therefore faster

964451
environment	execution
if you want to execute a scripting which was written for execution in a browser environment you need to provide a full browser -like environment

964462
environment	execution
so it s either an initialization scripting or passing the path of your data directory in an environment variables execution it like so .

964499
type-conversion	int
if you have an enum-typed property and your database column is an int type-conversion is automatic

964511
cvs	git
we re considering migrating from cvs to git

964523
egit	jgit
the egit project is implements eclipse tooling on top of the jgit java implementation of git much stable now

964541
value	field
sometimes char type is more usable than int - fixed size char doesn t take much storage room and you can see enumerated value directly in database field

964549
click	mouse
ok i have an event to check whether the mouse pointers is in the upper corner of the form and i don t have an double click event for the form

964559
arrays	loops
if you need to do additional filtering of the database result just use a loops to copy the data to a target arrays and continue whenever you encounter a row that should be omitted from the result

964564
keyboard	mouse
update snipped since apparently you can t write global windows hooks in .net managed code except some low level mouse or keyboard hooks

964570
execution	jobs
it uses a thread pool so you can have multiple threads execution jobs without needing a new thread for every job

964575
any	set
the test before set doesn t make any sense - code without test is cleaner and also a bit faster

964575
function-call	inline
as a side note - it makes sense to inline functions like this because overhead on function-call is bigger then function body although optimising compiler should do it without second thought

964596
selected	checkbox
you should use the debugging exceptions menu to bring up the exceptions dialog and selected the checkbox thrown on any kind of exception for which you want the development environment to break during debuggingging

964617
select	union
union select without the all throws the same error but only once

964623
exception-handling	try-catch
you can catch any access exception-handling by using a try-catch block

964662
javascript	dom
ie6 in general causes lots of issues involving javascript and dom manipulation among other things.

964668
pascal	delphi
i love delphi and it has been my first choice as development languages ever since the day it replaced turbo borland pascal but nowadays the competition .net for example has become just as powerful to use

contains	elements
in a asp.net application asp.net-mvc i have a foreach loop that loops through a structure that may contains or not some elements

964713
value	field
but it does not work as i guess it checks if value is null where i have a problem with the field itself

964719
wait	hang
when the above code is run sometimes 1 out of 5 it hang and the control gets stuck in the call to waitforsingleobject inside the main function .the code always calls setevent function to ensure that the thread would terminate before calling wait function

964722
display	height
remove the height 14px and display table from #vandaaglijst div.workorderblock span

964723
compact-framework	.net
uninstall all possible associated programs to visual studio sql-server or .net which left .net 2.0 compact-framework and .net 3.5 compact-framework and nothing else .net related installed

964723
versioning	downgrade
i know i could just downgrade to the x86 versioning of sql-server but i really want to make this work with the x64 versioning if nothing else just because it s supposed to work... so that solution doesn t really solve my problems

964724
contains	any
when a content placeholder contains any code blocks it reports that the control collection is empty

964724
contains	any
i want to check whether the contentplaceholder has been populated see also this question but can t if it contains any blocks

964739
any	set
then bind your collection any list not necessarily an observablecollection to the listbox and set the itemtemplate to a datatemplate that constructs the appropriate user-interface and binds to the uri or to the lazy-loading image property

964741
webforms	asp.net
i know how to do it with asp.net webforms but i have no clue with mvc

964796
reflection	runtime
however when i set my solution to release configuration the runtime is still not extracting the xml comments from the embedded javascript files and including them in the generated comments.xml file or the .org reflection file

964814
quirks-mode	doctype
but if you remove the doctype declaration ie8 renders the page in quirks-mode

964824
iprincipal	iidentity
csla uses standard iprincipal iidentity authentication

964827
children	nodes
you could use a repeater control and then cycle through your list and for each nodes that has children nest another repeater

964832
double	int
and when you are writing an excel project inside visual-studio with the automatically generated proxy objects instead of the regular interop project you need to cast r.interior.color to a double and then back to an int

964867
scp	ssh
an easy to setup option would be to run eclipse natively in windows but deploy the code via a samba share on the linux machine which you can mount as another drive or ssh scp if smb is not an option and then run it there via ssh console

964869
virtual-machine	parallels
i find colinux tremendously helpful when developing on windows for linux it s basically a linux system running in parallels to your windows os as a service and can be configured to simply show up on your lan basically like a virtual-machine does

964869
gnome	kde
also colinux can be easily set up to run x11 and windows managers like gnome kde so that you can for example use something like vnc to access your linux desktop

964869
virtualization	vmware
such as vmware in a way which is much more optimal than using any general purpose pc virtualization software

964887
constructor	object
the basic idea is that when an object needs some other other to do it s work say for example a database connection instead of creating that object internally the object is injected into the object usually either as a constructor parameter or by a public property that is set before the object is used

964890
command-line	cmd
i tried regular svn cmd on the command-line first

964902
hide	show
i have a div with runat attributes server .i have an asp.net button control in my page when this button is click i want to hide the div.is there any other option that changing visibility to false.i cant use the visibility to false because when i change visibility i cant access the same in my javascript since it is removed from the browser.i want to show that hided div from my javascript

964927
any	set
before any patches are applied orig_head is set to the tip of the current branch

964927
git-commit	git-diff
it is the commit git-commit builds on top of and git-diff --cached and git-status compare against

964951
shell	bash
cygwin gives you a bash shell with lots of tools including an x11 server

964979
append	input
the tag input should be closed - if don t when using not valid html in append on internet-explorer the div is not put into dom tree so you cannot access it with jquery later

964985
target-platform	platform
compile - advanced options - target-platform is set to x86 compile - platform is disabled and set to active any cpu

964986
background-image	height
to make sure the background-image fills the height of the container set background-repeat repeat-y

964999
reflection	runtime
any time you re using reflection you re resolving the type at runtime

965002
execute	prepare
you can implements your query as a class create a connection and prepare the query in the class constructor and then execute it in a methods

965004
telnet	ftp
namely telnet into a machine and use the dos ftp client to pull some files over

965010
average	min
i remember working with access back in the day and it had a nice gui for making up nice little queries with max min average options and fitlers aplenty

965011
background-image	width
how about removing the leftshadow and rightshadow divs put a repeatable background-image on the content div of width 809px and maybe height 1 depending on what your shadow image looks like

965011
contains	set
also perhaps set overflow hidden on the content div - if i remember rightly thats a kind of hack which will make the contains div stretch in this situation

965028
seam	jsf
i come from a perl scripting background and know very little java much less jsf seam ejb3.0

965030
checkbox	button
you shouldn t use the change event on radio button and checkbox

965030
radio-button	selected
use the click event instead don t worry about accessibility because the click event will also be fired if you activate selected a radio-button with the keyboard

965031
sql-server	oracle
disclaimer i only use devart sql-server data access components but i guess they are similar enough to the oracle data access components that it doesn t matter for the purpose of answering your question

965031
value	field
for string field of the database a twidestringfield component will be created and its value property returns a widestring

965034
height	frame
if you change the height frame programmatically you also have to change the image using setimage forsegmentatindex since the default image looks terrible when stretch

965052
output	cat
cat prints the content of the file input tr takes this output and replaces

965059
having	select
my problem with that is if my hql returns 1000 entitya s with all having their own respective entityb s hibernate will do n+1 queries 1st query would be for entitya returning 1000 results while the n queries would be coming from the entitya#propertyb select lazy loading

965066
input-field	selected
according to the selected item from suggestion list then pop up a dialog with some input-field

965069
shell	bash
for more details see shell parameter expansion in the bash manual

965116
dictionary	arrays
i need an easy way to read dictionary style settings and also a way to store simple arrays into a persistence level

965126
jdbctemplate	jdbc
spring jdbctemplate provides most plumbing you will need to implement a jdbc dao

965153
.net	wcf
what is needed to either support wcf on win2k or at least minimize the effort in supporting remote communication with win2k servers via .net

965153
.net	wcf
a product i m working on has a legacy .net remoting implementation that has been largely replaced by the wcf for new development

965153
.net	wcf
sales has asked for win2k support which leaves dev in somewhat of a pickle as .net 3.0 and therefore presumably wcf is not supported on win2k

965164
hide	show
and if i hide it this way it also doesn t show correctly afterwards

965173
perl	ksh
if i have a ksh script or even a perl script to capture the disk usage how can i let the script come active and wait for the next poll time before taking a snapshot and then sleep for the correct number of seconds until the next poll time

965177
duplicates	contains
i am dealing with large-files that contains many duplicates event logs and would therefore like to string.intern the strings for specific attributes the ones that frequently repeat

965184
variables	boolean
how do i assign a variables with a boolean value true or false if a div contains a specific tag like p in the above example

965215
macros	basic
we have created a sheet with a basic macros enter in name auto-populates the date

965216
formatting	import
maybe try formatting the date column in excel then import

965225
font-size	display
you will either have to make the static textbox bigger adjust the font-size property of the static textbox to a smaller value or the more complicated option create your own slider which will adjust what is display in the textbox

965225
any	set
you can set the positioning properties to whatever you want as well as use any handle for a figure or panels object in place of hparent

965226
paramiko	pexpect
unfortunately - while there are many approaches to solve that problem on unix-like operating systems such as pyexpect pexpect exscript and paramiko i doubt any of them works on windows

965228
32-bit	64bit
does the sequences of bits of various lengths actually means sequences of bits of some pre-defined lengths on the system such as 32-bit 64bit etc

965244
triggers	insert
setup a triggers on the production database so each insert update in the production database fires off an insert into the audit database

965254
put	get
i was impressed with the way that i could then use linq to entities to do creation - ef figures out that it must put some data in one table get the identity key value and use it in the other table

965255
ontouchevent	touch-events
interesting stuff the way i understood views to work in android is that the inner views receive all touch-events and the events are only passed to the wrapper views if the ontouchevent of the inner views return 0 to say they haven t dealt with it that is unless the parent view intercepts the touch-events

965259
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework

965268
communication	messages
c forget bidirectional communication and use a poll architecture to poll the server for new messages - works okay but creates an overly chatty system and makes conversations between client and server challenging

965273
spaces	output
it has a coreaudio user spaces driver that allows you to send any application s sound output to jack os x and support for audio plugins

965278
python	perl
i note that using perl or python would make handling arguments with spaces in them easier - but the question asks about shell

965278
shell	bash
it might also be feasible in bash to use a shell arrays variable - build up the arguments into an arrays and pass the arrays as the arguments to the unison command

965308
authentication	impersonation
update i checked in asp.net even if set identity impersonation true authentication windows and still no user

965311
attributes	properties
the thing i was missing was this attributes in the captions properties designerserializationvisibility designerserializationvisibility.content

965313
imagemagick	libjpeg
basically imagemagick was only slightly slower than libjpeg

965321
triggers	insert
i ve marked up josephstyon s answer because i briefly got things working by adding two insert update statement level triggers on tables a and b then doing his merge procedure using a or b as the master table depending on which trigger ran although first i checked that the target table would be changed by the merge earlying out if not

965326
pagination	filtering
a second page which displays the table using some javascript stuff to keep track of the selected criteria pagination reload content on filtering change and smooth display.

965329
entity-framework	nhibernate
maybe you could have a look at the ms entity-framework but as far as i know right now nhibernate is still the better solution when it comes to features performance abstraction and you have more control over it but then this comes maybe a bit with a cost in development time

965334
any	set
can you not simply use content approval within that document library to mark all pending documents as unapproved and have an automated process or workflow approve any documents with a set start date

965342
multicast	packets
keep in mind though that you run the risk of dropped packets there is also the question as to whether or not all the machines on the network support multicast

965352
hash	md5
first you should probably stick with the md5 hash to fulfill your difficult to reverse requirement

965352
hash	md5
if you are just looking to convert your hash into something you can store in a database transmit over the wire or some other reason the md5 string won t do the convertuuencode function might work for you

965364
any	set
this seems to work fine context menus with the contextmenutemplate style have styled menu items and other context menus are unaffected without having to set a style explicitly on any menuitems

965372
richfaces	icefaces
check out icefaces and richfaces for some good examples

965374
dialog	pop-up
i guess a better question should have been how do you create a timed pop-up in jquery...but anyway when i run my code it appears that my dialog appears for just a split second

965377
file-descriptor	pipe
pipe can generally just be treated as a file-descriptor

965384
textbox	button
add a button that will change not the text of the textbox but the value of the respective property in the instance that is bound to the box

965385
updating	updates
having an application updates itself without requiring the user to restart is a huge pain in the butt you have to kick off a separate process to do the updating which means a separate updatesr application that cannot itself be auto-updatesd and i ve never been able to make it work 100 reliably

965425
perl	php
every programming language i know perl javascript php python asp actionscript commodore basic uses single and double quotes to delimit strings

965445
hide	show
each content class not object has its associated contenttype and contenttype basically holds some attributes that could be set using online form which then can be used in the views to show hide some of the content objects attributes

965454
ubuntu	linux
i m using ganymede on ubuntu linux and i have junit-4.3.1.jar in my build path

965461
contains	elements
the vector can be created on the heap or on the stack as you noted the memory it allocates for its contains elements is always on the heap unless you provide your own allocator which does something else

965464
double-quotes	single-quotes
single-quotes and double-quotes are used in the majority of languages since that is the standard delimiter in most written languages

965489
superclass	subclass
an object that extends a class will have memory allocated for the subclass like normal as well as any methods variables used in the superclass

965489
superclass	subclass
as a rule of thumb you can just think of a subclass object contains all of the memory from it and all superclass

965494
codeigniter	kohana
so despite of codeigniter and kohana itself what else is worth looking at that makes life easy and not harder

965500
hash	md5
if i want to use a key why can i not just pass in a salted hash of my secret key an md5 hash

965506
communication	messages
however i tend to avoid signals for scripted interprocess communication instead using them only for user sent messages like start stop restart refresh

965514
any	set
which would allow you to add any object t where t is an enumerable set of ifoo objects

965527
logout	login
login logout some sought of change grouping action etc

965527
logout	login
in effect doing this for login logout and a few pages effectively caused the two session scopes to stay in sync

965534
browser-cache	caching
is it possible to have the browser-cache the initial startup page index.html along with the other website resources and have the browser use the caching version of the startup page when there is no internet connection present

965556
publishing	release
we re currently publishing our release under .net 3.0

965557
constructor	object
the person object should have a constructor that accepts id ssn and totaldrwhoepisodeswatched

965563
hash	md5
if you wish to pass the md5 hash of your salted key to des you should use some key compression technique

965563
hash	md5
for instance you could take the top 7 bytes somewhat undesirable or perform des encryption on the md5 hash with a known constant key and take all but the last byte as the key for des operation

965612
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m migrating a webforms application written w mvp to leverage the asp.net-mvc framework and wanted to know how i should be testing a simple controller action that returns a partialview

965619
mta	sta
this can be encountered in mstest cleanup code which is mta not sta

965634
contains	any
rob.application.bigsystem.dll should check if the current customer bigcompany has any unique adjustments and if so load the rob.application.bigsystem.customer.bigcompany.dll assembly which may contains overrides of methods or extensions of objects extra fields etc

965636
exception-handling	try-catch
what i m wondering is if there is an issue with output redirection to stdout and the way powershell traps exception-handling - or if it is my try-catch code to begin with

965656
thinking-sphinx	sphinx
i am using the great thinking-sphinx plugin for accessing sphinx search in ruby-on-rails 2.2.3

965656
thinking-sphinx	sphinx
how can i setup thinking-sphinx to use the other column as sphinx s doc id instead of the plain old id column

965663
python	c++
the one for c c++ was quite popular so was the equivalent for python

965751
coalesce	isnull
for the remaining cases you can generally use functions like coalesce or isnull functions to return something that s easier to process

965757
command-pattern	mediator
you might also try having the gui give the mediator a callback object that handles retrieving return values or setting whatever values you need a version of command-pattern

965760
wxpython	pyqt
there are two gui toolkit for python which we know wxpython and pyqt

965764
pbkdf2	salt
at its heart pbkdf2 is combining salt and the password through via a hash function to produce the actual key

965769
subclassing	inherited
projects are just a way to create an assembly full of usable types - they don t in and of themselves inherited anything nor do they allow for subclassing etc

965777
datagrid	textbox
maybe an arrays of textbox or a datagrid

965804
executable-jar	jar
an executable-jar is a simple jar file where the manifest has a special property which defines the main class

965811
double-quotes	single-quotes
quotes come in many versioning - single-quotes double-quotes back quotes

965811
subtraction	addition
quotes are natural the same way + and - are natural for addition and subtraction

965812
datagrid	textbox
you should be able to use a datagrid and have the first column contain a textbox item and have a second column display a name

965831
show	next
the next code show a function which transforms from us and eu currency to a string accepted by bigdecimal string constructor

965837
value	field
if you for example have three spaces in a field it s not always possible to visually distinguish from the empty string but they are different value

965841
contains	elements
offsetleft and offsettop are properties that describe how many pixels obj is offset from it s contains elements

965843
assign	add
when you decide which objects to save you can then add a persistent xml binary sqlite store to the persistent store coordinator assign the objects you want to save to that store using the context s and then save the context

965851
contains	elements
in your case since your arrays is an arrays contains characters each elements has to be an arithmetic constant expression

965864
void	main
here s an example of pulling the name of the main-class from the jar file using a jarfile then loading the class from the jar using a urlclassloader and then invoking static void main using reflection

965913
json	xml
if your settings are complicated and include lists and nested data structures i d use xml or json and create a configuration editor

965922
multiple-files	large-files
the problem was that i had a system that didn t support large-files so this library would either use the largefile support available on some systems or handle being passed multiple-files that it would virtually concat

965927
order	add
in my case the change is much simpler if i just add the column to the end of the table and nothing in the code is relying on the specific column order

965930
upgrade	migrate
if you can upgrade your crm 3.0 machine to 4.0 and make sure that it and your new system are at the same rollup level then you can migrate everything across

965930
export	csv
you can export your data to a csv format to be imported using the provided crm bulk import tool

965936
contains	elements
i have an elements in the source schema of a map that contains a code

965937
arguments	default
in a bash scripting assign an arguments to variables but provide a default if it exists

965937
arguments	default
myvar will contains the first arguments if one was given else default

965939
licensing	lgpl
it is similar to pyqt in programming model but does not have any licensing cost since it is lgpl

965946
postgresql	firebird
postgresql ibm db2 and firebird support is distinct from

965946
sql-server	oracle
oracle and microsoft sql-server don t yet

965951
variables	boolean
another consideration is to set a boolean variables with the result of some set of these conditions that might make it easier to understand

965951
arrays	loops
if your variables are an arrays or collection could you loops through them

965967
.when	ready
so i used as i said the jquery syntax .when the document is ready i registered for the click event of the button the problme is that code never gets execute

965969
conditional	operators
i don t know c# but it seems to include the conditional operators

965987
contains	set
i am not even sure it is possible to set up acls properly on vb without in fact creating a new grouping ga contains people from both ga and gb am i right

965998
configuration	environment
i use an environment variables to point to a url which probably is a file url that has my configuration in it

966004
value	field
for example when referring to a form field s value in javascript you use .value whereas in fbjavascript you need to do .getvalue

966008
having	select
well the answer to why that certain application page was having the problem was becuase the select id was app which incidentally was the app variables for the page so it wasn t fetching the correct pages

966015
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i think instead you should try to run a hybrid project with both and have some handled by webforms and some handled by asp.net-mvc

966024
web-config	app-config
your app-config or web-config file for your client should contains something like this where is the namespace location of your interface

966029
properties-file	jar
is there a way to modify the property values in a properties-file that is stored in a jar file as a resource

966029
properties-file	jar
i have a properties-file stored as a resource in my jar file

966035
button	popup
i ve tried handling the formclosing event but i ended up duplicating some code and the popup occurs twice if i click the cancel button

966077
put	get
i have servlet mapped on say servletpath after that i can put whatever i want and get my servlet responding depending on the rest of a path except when there is 2f in the path

966082
python	php
again it s not php but python

966131
bmp	gif
this works for all files except for image files jpg gif bmp ect.

966137
configuration	environment
switch the configuration for each environment

966164
configuration	environment
as an aside i will say that i have found that configuration an environment to target a network share is fairly complex as many of the assumptions that are made when working with code on the local machine are invalid

966190
constructor	private
the solution is not to do work in your constructor at least not with non- private non- final methods

966205
any	set
in your specific case if there really isn t any logic validation or user-interface specific properties that your vm isn t surfacing and your model doesn t have to be persisted serialization or made backwards compatible with an existing structure or adding the logic to do so in your vm is trivial i would strongly consider combining the m and vm to avoid creating properties whose sole purpose is to get set the underlying model s properties

966208
subtract	add
but i can t write -1 or +1 to subtract add day like in sql

966254
value	field
certainly there are situations where nulls may indicate the need to redesign a table consisting of mostly null entries in most fields is probably not properly normalized a field that contains all null value is probably not needed.

966260
arrays	map
or you could allocate a one-dimensional arrays with rows columns elements and define methods to map row column coordinates to element indices

966261
credentials	account
for example assuming you re on active directory and have administration privileges you could create a user account with the very specific access your app needs and configure your app to authenticate with the network using that user s credentials

966272
dialog	pop-up
things i can immediately think of include pop-up calendar and modal pop-up dialog but there must be more.

966275
javascript	dom
dojo is a client-side framework for managing ui components widgets ajax requests and providing a browser-independent abstraction on top of javascript and the dom

966275
richfaces	icefaces
jsf with icefaces or richfaces come to mind

966278
digits	base
it s just long division like we all learned in grade school except the digits are base 2 32 instead of base 10

966292
rollback	commit
checkpoint is different and independent to commit rollback

966296
solaris	linux
solaris linux

966298
constructor	object
you might want to consider making the methods instance members and passing a session provider into the constructor of this httphelper object

966301
setinterval	settimeout
you should better use setinterval instead of settimeout

966312
hide	show
i use it for pre-loading more content than is actually show - if i have a tabbed page i load the contents of all tabs at once and then show hide the different sections and style the tab menus with css classes using jquery

966318
arrays	loops
with a single arrays of buttons button 5 and replace your big loops with this

966324
lapack	gsl
it draws from lapack blas and gsl gnu scientific library

966324
haskell	fortran
of course you can get such algorithms to work in haskell for example but they won t look much different than if they were written in matlab fortran or c

966328
bitblt	gdi
it s been awhile since i ve used the gdi but i m assuming you re talking about the bitblt function right

966383
revision	updates
create a composite query whereby the client can send a set of revision and the server can respond to that list of revision with any updates revision it may have for them

966386
directory	folder
dir s b a-d lists all files at or below this folder s in bare format b excluding directory a-d

966400
row	col
i want to be able to get at whatever is in a particular row or column via a methods call that takes the an integer row no and an int col number as an argument

966400
row	col
in addition i want to be able to set the value of a column which using the row and col no

966407
hide	show
inside those functions you can show hide your indicator

966423
latitude-longitude	location
newpoint point filename pdate ptime unicode location weather high low latitude-longitude image caption

966423
latitude-longitude	location
newpoint point filename pdate ptime unicode location .encode utf-8 weather high low latitude-longitude image caption

966439
document	element
if it doesn t match then it will continue to traverse up the document parent by parent until an element is found that matches the specified expression

966450
constructor	object
in other languages the advice is to avoid calling any virtual methods from a constructor because the object may not be fully constructed when the method is called

966459
order	add
add a space or other delimiter only if a variables is set in order to avoid ugly unnecessary spaces

966470
for-loop	loops
this however has nothing to do with my answer a foreach loops creates an iterator so it shouldn t access the database 99 more times on the post they used a for-loops to access the first 100 items

966476
decrement	increment
i ve obviously performed some sanity tests on my class making sure only one writer can access at a time making sure releases and claims increment and decrement properly etc.

966479
gethashcode	equals
and override the equals and gethashcode members

966481
static-typing	type-safety
c# on the other hand is preferable by many when writing complex logic because of its type-safety in that you can t bypass static-typing and its conciseness

966517
order	add
the no collection snapshot.. exception-handling is thrown even if i create a new order add new orderlines to the collection and call saveorupdate for the order object

966521
communication	messages
communication with that object could be via events or messages depending on the complexity of the changes

966524
formatting	printing
printingf printing - examine any and all expressions printingf accepts c-style formatting specifiers

966534
shallow-copy	deep-copy
shallow-copy by default can be re-written to do deep-copy

jeditable	jquery
i am not very good at jquery but decided to use jeditable plugin for my site because i thought it looked good and solved the purpose

966539
callback	methods
the callback methods of this plugins just has value and settings

966568
arrays	loops
also if some table table members are added using arrays do i need a separate loops to iterate through those as well or is there a single way to iterate though those members at the same time as the key value pairs

966575
margins	padding
padding and margins are entered using comma-delimited syntax and are of type thickness

966579
children	nodes
add all the children and then add the top nodes nodess at the very end of your processing

966587
password-recovery	reset-password
so how can i easily change my password-recovery control to ask for the user s email address and send the reset-password and username to that address

966601
32-bit	64bit
i m running 64bit version of vista on my notebook with 4g of ram the ram is maxed out at 1.5g on the 32-bit version of java

966601
32-bit	64bit
so if i run out of ram at 1.5g i switch to the 64bit but if i need to develop jdic part i switch back to the 32-bit is this possible with netbeans

966607
duplicates	contains
you also might want to consider changing your approach for certain kinds of files that contains embedded meta-data that might change without changing the underlying data so you can find additional duplicates even if the md5 s don t match

966619
any	set
using system.net.mail.mailmessage you should be able to set any smtp address you want

966623
value	field
if so i d expect that data to show up in the value field that they pass to the callback

966626
contains	set
the easiest way would be to set a background image with css on the img element or the contains element - no javascript needed you will of course need to set dimensions on the img tag

966632
malloc	free
if you do not free memory that you malloc d in a c program under linux when is it released

966638
configuration	environment
the goal is to be able add or remove recipients or change their addresses by editing the web.config file so that i don t have to recompile and can easily maintain different configuration in test and production environment

966662
malloc	free
memory allocated by malloc is free when the process ends

966671
lotusscript	dxl
that sounds doable with dxl and i think you can use both lotusscript and java to accomplish it

966674
malloc	free
malloc ed memory is definitely free when the process ends but not by calling free

966685
32-bit	64bit
netbeans does work with both 64bit and 32-bit jvm

966685
32-bit	64bit
i have a scripting for launching eclipse with installed 32-bit jvm and netbeans for the 64bit or 32-bit jvm

966686
hash	md5
i think the best bet would chose a standard hash either md5 or sha1 to obtain a hash of your string and then to get an integer hash to a and that should convert your hash into a integer hash

966689
portable-executable	coff
coff object modules later became the defacto standard for all microsoft win32 development tools and gained an advantage in being much closer in format to portable-executable files - the native executable format for win32 a coff-format linker has much less work to create a 32-bit exe or dll from a coff file than from an omf format file

966698
any	set
my problem depending on user settings any combination of these columns title capacity and or count may be set to not show

966714
perl	c++
there s application work with c# vb.net c++ java fortran then there s database work with involves sql and then there s maintenance work involving languages like python perl php or even bash scripts and similar

966717
arrays	loops
the script basically loops through the results and returns them as an arrays â no need to know how many columns there are and you can still use prepared statements

966745
ruby	php
assuming you make good use of each language there are limited cases where the performance of php vs python vs ruby vs .net vs whatever will ever be noticed by the user

966748
repository	entity
works like a charm - creating new factory is simple as defining repository type and default entity data

966757
abstract-class	pure-virtual
i have an abstract-class with a couple pure-virtual functions and one of the classes i derive from it does not use one of the pure-virtual functions

966757
abstract-class	pure-virtual
anyways when i try to compile it i get an error apparently a class is still considered abstract if derive from an abstract-class and don t override all pure-virtual functions

966757
abstract-class	pure-virtual
is there anyway to derive a class from an abstract-class and not use one of the abstract-class s pure-virtual functions

966766
value	field
from here you should easily be able to walk the list of maps and pull out all of the info you want the value its class type the field name for the column headers.

966768
derived-class	base-class
if your derived-class doesn t use the base-class pure virtual function then either the derived-class should not be derived from the base or the pvf should not be there

966769
derived-class	base-class
either provide a default implementation in the base-class or a simple implementation in the derived-class as you suggested

966784
expression	evaluation
can be used for c expression evaluation

966788
updating	updates
different locking techniques tend to have different overheads and while a critical-section or mutex may be perfectly fine for something that is rarely accesseed and rarely updates if you re rarely updating it and frequently accessing it you might want to look at a reader writer lock

966791
contains	any
whenever a value is to be omitted the entire row contains it can be omitted so there s no need for any null

966819
itemtemplate	gridview
i am using a templatefield to display my edit update and cancel button in the first column of the gridview within respective itemtemplate and edititemtemplate fields

966820
telnet	ftp
i am trying to do some basic scripting using ruby to log in to a windows machine via telnet and pull some files over using the dos command line ftp

966822
put	get
when you want an item take the value of the counter increment the counter then put the original value through the magic function to get an index

966826
.when	ready
i am thinking there has to be some sort of event i can listen for that will tell me .when its ready for me to run this function i just don t know what event that would be

966827
linux	unix
for linux unix os family i use getpwnam to authenticate users and the most reliable way i know to make sure this works is to start my service as root

966834
click	mouse
in many applications if you click the wheel button and move your mouse left and right you can do that

966858
vb.net	vba
mostly c# followed by xslt xpath t-sql javascript vb.net when it s forced on me power shell vba and html and css if you re counting those

966865
value	field
validates_uniqueness_of works by checking if a record already exists with the same value of the given field within the given scope

966896
minimum	median
the problem of finding the minimum value of reduces to finding the weighted median of a list of with weights see below for definition

966897
vb.net	vb6
vb.net vb6 c++ javascript php c# 65816 asm and a bunch of smaller languages at home for whatever little project i m working on at the time

966907
email	dkim
i have two dedicated servers one of which is configured for sending email out spf dkim other domain whitelisting methods etc

966928
conditional	operators
that s a ternary operators called a conditional operators

966928
conditional	operators
over time your brain will instincitvely selected a conditional operators where appropriate

966928
conditional	operators
but as you re just getting your feet wet you ll find the conditional operators to be a great way to express code more succinctly

966932
contains	set
i m trying to set the images in a treeview in c# from a .ico file contains two icons a 32x32 version and a 16x16 version

966947
put	get
debugging user mode code from kernel mode is most definitely possible but is a bit more complicated - for instance to get a break in the process before it starts you need to put a breakpoint on the kernel s process creation code or on a ntdll s user mode code that first executes

966948
xsd	xml
i have a question regarding adding restriction in my xml schema xsd

966951
difference	factors
i don t know if he appreciated then the individual differences between programmer productivity although in an order-of-magnitude argument he did postulate a factors of seven difference but as we know superior productivity isn t just a matter of writing more code but also writing the right code to do the job

966977
ruby	php
if you are a php developer ruby on rails integration can be of help too if you want to expand your expertise on web apps

966986
shared-objects	.so
use this when building shared-objects .so on those mentioned architectures

967004
export	report
as already mentioned reporting services can already export in these formats you can also specify on the url if you want to render the report in another format instead of as a webpage like this

967004
export	report
you can also get the report to export in these formats if you are running the report of a schedule

967030
32-bit	64bit
it makes a big difference if you re using a 32-bit operating system or a 64bit

967032
jeditable	jquery
seems like jeditable is a wrapper around jquery ajax methods

967032
jeditable	jquery
it should not be too difficult to replace all your jeditable calls with calls that use jquery s native ajax method

967032
jeditable	jquery
you can replace jeditable s callback named callback with success which is the callback s name in jquery s ajax function

967039
double-quotes	single-quotes
note that it doesn t matter if i use single-quotes or double-quotes in haml code i always get the same output

967052
contains	elements
you can use line-height and make sure it is tall as the contains elements

967066
key-value	key
a is not based a key-value pair and provides no by key access - it is just a set of unique values using the hash to check containment very quickly

967114
cos	sin
if you pick a certain magnitude for the initial velocity u speed then you can write the x and y components of u as u cos a and u sin a respectively where u is the initial speed and a the initial angle

967129
mouseover	mouseout
have you thought about using mouseover and mouseout to simulate this

967129
mouseleave	mouseenter
also look into mouseenter and mouseleave

967130
nested-loops	loops
i have taken procedures with many nested-loops and procedure calls and kept the loops was impossible to only use inserts deletes updates but i removed the cursor and have seen less locking blocking and massive performance boosts as well

967137
ruby	php
if gathering requirements for a medium-to-large web-based project at what point should one consider using java-based back-end jsp etc over a scripting language like php python or ruby

967140
local-variables	eval
eval won t help since it does not have access to local-variables of the enclosing scope

967149
mime	rfc
the problem is of course that you ll probably want to read the mime rfc as well.

967153
any	set
as far as i know you can t ask the browser if any input on the screen has focus you have to set up some sort of focus tracking

967173
arrays	loops
after the foreach loops export the arrays of objects

967177
difference	factors
you also have to multiply by the time elapsed...for the sake of this example to keep it simple we ll leave the time-elapsed factors at 1 you calculate the difference in the vectors and multiply by your time difference 1 and discover that the difference is 2 0 0

967181
credentials	security
i have looked through the global variables and see no hint of the credentials but i could just be daft about some basic security features of php apache

967181
credentials	security
i m not used to handling security credentials beyond a simple this is where you put in your password...good now that everybody knows each other for the rest of the session i can get back to outputting useful stuff.

967193
constructor	object
there is an overload for the constructor that accepts the original icon object and a size

967210
configuration	environment
the development environment including the ide but also the source code control the configuration management and defect tracking - i guess what you might call application lifecycle stuff - is more important in my opinion than the language per se

967231
32-bit	64bit
the syntactic sugar keyword applies to 32-bit ints but you can use the actual methods calls on 64bit ints

967257
filtering	sorting
and everything works together so changing a page and then the sorting and adding a filtering works without losing any of the other settings

967268
dictionary	arrays
hold onto all the sounds players in a dictionary or an arrays

967268
dictionary	arrays
you can then easily play each by indexing off the arrays or getting with a key from the dictionary

967268
dictionary	arrays
each sound can have it s own volume or you can iterate the arrays or dictionary to set all volumes to whatever levels you like

967272
vb.net	vb6
vb.net has the vb6 syntax for linking to methods in dlls

967288
protected	public
i ve been looking at serialization but the necessary methods writestarttag element writeendtag element write doctype are protected not public

967288
dom4j	xom
this is related to my question about the best dom4j replacement where xom is a strong contender.

967294
csv	xml
i m building a shareware software that allows users to import various types of files xml csv etc. into a database

967300
hide	show
add an inputpanels to your form hook up the gotfocus and lostfocus events of the textbox and show hide the input panels in the event handler

967300
selected	textbox
normally i would use the designer for this selected the textbox show the property grid switch to the event list and have the environment set up handlers for gotfocus and lostfocus but if the user-interface contains more than a few textbox you may wish to have it more automated

967301
constructor	object
as well as passing objects values by reference there are plenty of other warnings including redefining already defined constructor for class wp_object_cache creating default object from empty value non-static method wp_http_exthttp test should not be called statically etc

967306
derived-class	accessor
i can t just omit the set accessor in a derived-class see code example below

967306
value	field
ultimately i m display these properties in a property grid and i don t want the user to be entering value into a field that is going to do nothing

967306
attributes	properties
maybe i just attributes the properties as read only in specific derived classes

967307
python	ruby
don t know about python ruby on rails

967316
windows-xp	windows
the msdn documentation for setfileinformationbyhandle refers to fileextd.lib on windows server 2003 and windows-xp

967335
linux	unix
i ve been playing with message queues system v but posix should be ok too in linux recently and they seem perfect for my application but after reading the art of unix programming i m not sure if they are really a good choice

967344
spring	grails
i tried the recommendations at grails accessing spring beans in the destory closure of bootstrap code

967356
rabbitmq	activemq
as an alternative to activemq mentioned above there is open-source rabbitmq

967367
webforms	asp.net
are you guys kidding me i know that asp.net webforms was a painful experience but has nobody heard of the classname attribute

967372
jquery-slider	slider
is it possible to use the jquery-slider range slider dual slider to have non-linear non consistent step size values

967373
json	xml
it will produce xml or json depending on what your client has for it s http accepts header

967376
photoshop	layer
this led me to the idea of renderinging the textures and verticies of the overlay to multiple textures with transparency backgrounds that could be overlay in the rendering loop and updates independently similar to layer in photoshop

967377
abstract-class	derived-class
what you are saying by defining your getter and setter in the abstract-class is you must implement this if you want to inherit from me. then you are asking how can i made a derived-class ignore this rule.

967377
abstract-class	derived-class
the answer is that if you have a situation that every derived-class needs a getter put that in the abstract-class and let the derived-class decide if they will implement a setter or not by leaving it out of the abstract-class

967377
abstract-class	derived-class
or alternatively you can create two more classes that derive from the initial abstract-class one that implement the setter and one that does not and then have your derived-class generalize the one of those that makes sense but that is overkill i think

967399
callback	methods
i have already tried to use combobox s callback or to populate a list with the additem methods of the combobox

967412
ref	out
they are pass-by-value as are all parameters that are neither ref nor out but the value is a reference to the object so they are effectively passed by reference

967434
django-haystack	whoosh
does anyone have any experience using django-haystack with the whoosh backend

967442
arrays	loops
assuming you know which primitive types you will be using you can loops through to form a single string using a space or whatever you choose as a delimiter then use the string.split method to split the string back out into a string arrays and finally loops through that arrays and cast its members to reproduce the original arrays

967443
python	perl
i m looking for the python analog to perl s string shellquote shell_quote

967445
user-controls	ascx
is it possible to create a generic pager ascx user-controls which can be used with different grids on different pages to control paging

967446
private-members	private
all private-members of a base class are still private and will not be accessible to the derived class

967463
postgresql	mysql
any input from people having dealt with similar problems is welcome -- i am not a mysql guy trying to batter postgresql into making all the same mistakes i am used to -- just dealing with data i don t have full control over

967467
rijndaelmanaged	aes
essentially if you want to use rijndaelmanaged as aes you need to make sure that

967467
put	get
so i guess my next question is how do i get 128 to work and hopefully this will put an end to this question

967473
perl	tcl
since then i ve used a lot of different programming and scripting languages c c++ php python perl tcl and recently i started thinking of my old turbo pascal days

967477
selected	textbox
the main pitfall is the root namespace of the class library project - you can change it by right-clicking the project node in solution explorer selected properties and changing the value in the root namespace textbox

967483
firefox	opera
i m on a mac and i m experiencing the same result on safari firefox and opera

967488
derived-class	pure-virtual
as many people have already stated it sounds like either the base methods shouldn t be pure-virtual or you should rethink whether your derived-class really isa base

967488
pure-virtual	base-class
however it is possible to provide an implementation for the pure-virtual methods in the base-class

967488
derived-class	base-class
this can act like a default implementation for derived-classes but you still require the derived-class to choose the base-class s implementation explicity

967491
powerpc	arm
it is available for different processors intel x86 amd64 x86_64 powerpc powerpc64 sparc arm

967493
instances	self
when you see self in an instances methods it refers to the instances of the class in which the module is include

967493
instances	self
when you see self outside of an instances methods it refers to the module

967516
hosts-file	hosts
the windows hosts allows you to associate an ip to a hostname that has far greater freedom than a normals internet domain name

967516
hosts-file	hosts
updates as suggested by bill the uri.checkhostsname methods almost does what i want but it doesn t allow for hosts names like -test that windows allows in a hostss-file

967524
binary	hex
i m trying to write a small program that will generate a parity bit for hex and binary values pulled from an ascii character arrays

967524
binary	hex
so i type a and it finds the corresponding values in the binary and hex arrays and then displays them

967526
rollback	commit
this allows the client to perform multiple calls on the server or even several different servers and have them all commit or all rollback

967583
any	set
given the combination of 1 lack of support for a type-class like mechanism on the clr for defining common semantics among a set of otherwise-unrelated types and 2 the fact that primitive-types like int often need to be special-cased for any programming language implementation system.int32 does not define an operator+ methods but most programming languages choose to behave as though such a methods exists it s hard to imagine any generally interoperable operator stuff across all languages on .net today

967584
contains	elements
if the image is one that contains large variations in colour has naturalistic elements and resembles a live environment then jpeg will provide good quality with no visible artifacts

967595
emacs	vim
vim because once you suggest emacs someone will suggest vi

967630
derived-class	inherited
are the implicit explicit conversions not inherited in the derived-class

967637
directory	folder
i have a directory called xmonroe in the vendor plugins folder of my ruby-on-rails app

967638
getter	setter
synth the getter and setter in the .m file

967645
any	set
in any case let s take an example data set

967651
children	nodes
gets the number of nodes from both the left and right children if they exist

967676
display	width
if you re just looking to truncate the value of the float when you re display it you can specify the width of the output using printf .2f mynumber

967679
gnome	kde
b to be hosted in .net applications for automation similar to dcop in kde and how gnome is using corba

967695
return-value	arguments
because you are passing as arguments cbool something etc you are passing back temporary variabless the return-value of cbool ... not the actual variables ballshared etc

967705
put	get
in my opinion powershell as a shell is clearly intended as a replacement for cmd easy to see and windows scripting host windows scripting host didn t get much attention in recent years even though it had similar concepts as .net back in its day one platform multiple languages with activescriptinging but with .net microsoft basically put that to rest and resurrection probably wasn t an option for them

967718
asp.net-mvc	webforms
this works in asp.net-mvc and or webforms

967722
switching	router
as a developer at a small company where i pretty much do all things it dba manipulate router pull call detail records from the switching monitor and graph bandwidth for customers etc... i can tell you that powershell fills a sorely needed gap in windows and the fact that it s built on .net provides a seamless upgrade path when the powershell pipeline is too slow to handle millions of iterations or a more permanent strongly typed implementation is needed

967735
contains	any
notice that you haven t provided any conversion operators that contains the code new derived ... so it is not surprising that you can t make new derived instances this way

967741
return-type	arguments
the first one does match the arguments but then it s return-type is base and that one doesn t match

967749
formatting	printing
windows lets you printing such characters and see the glyphs it has defined for them but your linux is probably interpreting the control characters as formatting control codes which they are instead of printinging corresponding glyphs

967751
memcached	ncache
not free version of ncache not memcached

967755
json	xml
i ve seen people use cdata for the above which is ok and for wrapping things that are not xml - such as json or css - and that s a better reason to use it

967761
any	set
apart from the component which comes as a bit of a surprise to me you could use a tag with the escape parameter set to false to generate any mark-up you want

967766
attributes	properties
you have some level of control over how the objects will be formatted by using simple attributes on your properties and classes

967774
firefox	safari
the method works flawlessly when called through firefox but when i attempt to call it either via ajax or directly from the browser in ie8 or safari it simply will not log in

967776
google-chrome	opera
this is working in ie6+ ff2+ and opera but for some reason there are huge gaps in safari and google-chrome like those two browsers are ignoring it and just applying regular breaks

967776
google-chrome	safari
i tried testing with larger line-heights like 20px or 30px and safari and google-chrome recognize those

967782
instant	aim
i personally have setup filtering for aim aol instant messenger http msn messenger windows-live messenger pop and smtp

967802
tokenize	parsing
in the general case it is often a good idea to separate i o tokenize parsing and action into their own phases

967805
textmate	emacs
i feel like emacs is so much better than textmate

967821
radio-button	textbox
i want to make sure that at least one is checked both can be checked so a radio-button is not ideal and if neither are highlight the row with a red border just like a textbox is with the validation functionality.

967821
textarea	textbox
i have other fields that are getting validated correctly and the css is changing when there is an issue on the textbox and textarea accordingly

967832
hash	md5
use hash and not md5 instead

967837
fadeout	fadein
so would i now be using the css methods to change the color of the background fadein then fadeout to white again

967842
implements	sealed
i then create my sealed class myentityrepository which inherited imyentityrepository and implements all members

967849
pixels	line
finally if you end up having to manually work on pixels make sure you run on the image in line rather than columns and that you start from the beginning of the line to help with the caching

967853
revision	svn
through svn hooks commits to the repository with a ticket number insert a comment on the ticket with a link to a nice visual html representation of the revision number showing inserts deletes and diffs

967859
insertion-sort	bubble-sort
so here is my questions in term of performance and their concept what is the difference among bubble-sort selection sort insertion-sort shell sort and quick sort

967873
bubble-sort	quicksort
rule of thumb quicksort best bubble-sort worst

967889
xsd	xml
if you don t want to do this visual-studio ships with a nice little feature called xsd which allows you to generate class objects from your xml file

967899
hash	md5
put this way given a hash function which md5 is of size 1 bits there are only 2 possible combination s

967899
hash	md5
even at 128 bits md5 2 files sharing the same hash does not mean they are in fact the same file

967903
webforms	asp.net
this current project is a port of an asp.net webforms project and i am trying to maintain functionalty

967908
mergesort	timsort
wikipedia doesn t mention the incredible timsort which is what python uses a clever variant of natural mergesort

967921
modulus	primes
primes 65521 for the modulus

967921
modulus	primes
someone else in this thread makes a somewhat convincing arguments that modulus a primes is better for detecting bit-swapping

967921
modulus	primes
effectiveness of using a primes modulus

967922
base-class	inherited
is it guaranteed to implement an interface or inherited from a base-class

967934
any	set
if the date format is set in the visual report-designer i can see the details of the format in datefieldobject but editing these values doesn t have any affect on the report once displayed

967960
anchor	nav
the anchor within the list-item which is of class home within the nav id which is again inside of class home

967969
packaging	building
just for sanity ease of building and ease of packaging i prefer to keep a whole project in a combined repository

967976
getter	setter
setter getter on stripes action beans are used to allow the actionbean to receive the request parameters url parameters in the case of get requests form parameters in the case of post requests from the browser

967983
contains	elements
your sample html contains no elements that match these conditions so nothing will be selected

968001
for-loop	arrays
reason i ask is because i need to run a for-loop inside the other function where the arrays is passed

968011
subclassing	base-class
this also resolves the fragile base-class issue allowing ivars to be reordered and added without requiring recompiling of subclassing deleting or renaming ivars may still cause link errors

968019
click	mouse
another approach would be to do a mouse move then click then send keys

970439
any	set
one caveat no approach will work indeed your requirement becomes self contradictory if any item is present twice in the list -- which of course is perfectly possible unless you take precautions to avoid it you could easily diagnose it in renumber -- by keeping a set of elements already seen and raising an exception-handling on any duplication -- if that s not too late for you

971393
base-class	subclass
unless there is good reason i d avoid having a subclass constructor with fewer parameters than the base-class .

971411
dependency-injection	singleton
if you re using a dependency-injection framework like spring you could even use it to initialize the singleton from a property file or something

971411
spring	guice
an even better alternative would be to use spring or guice or whatever to push the configuration directly into the usertype

971413
implements	abstract
just because your dervied types will be polymorphism to the abstract base-class doesn t mean that that base-class imposes strict limitations on how you can implements the abstractions defined in that base-class

alter-table tbllogs alter-column date_created default getdate

972300
vxworks	linux
we recently did the opposite conversion - we ported code from a powerpc machine running vxworks to an intel system running linux

972319
target-platform	platform
the first thing to realise is that writing cross platform applications that look and behave native on each target-platform is a hard thing to do

972319
linux	osx
it only supports the basic concepts of files where as windows osx and linux all have addition

972342
fflush	puts
this will work better if you use puts which will append a newline terminator if there is not already one at the end of the line forcing a buffering fflush

972345
order	add
in order to download the report i can manually add the site to internet-explorer s list of trusted sites but i would prefer to check programmatically in .net to see if the site is trusted and add it to the list if it is not

972352
integer	numeric
my guess is you re pulling it as an integer on the source not as a numeric

972361
multiplication	multiplying
any chance you re doing some sort of operation multiplication by a constant integer somewhere multiplying by 5 instead of 5.0

972366
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine for google-chrome 2.x ie8 and opera 9.64 but not on firefox 3.0.9

972369
32-bit	64bit
64bit processes can t access 32-bit processes

972370
logfile	tail
i am using tail -f to follow a logfile as it s updates

972370
show	next
next i pipe the output of that to grep to show only the lines contains a search term org.springframework in this case

972383
daemons	systemd
as mark clarified it s a linux systemd the scripting could easily make itself fully independent a daemons by following this recipe

972408
32-bit	64bit
i don t think you can run a 32-bit app natively on a 64bit machine

972408
windows	wow64
you need to compile your app as 64bit binary or run it under an emulator like wow64 on windows

972409
triggers	insert
it sure would have been nice if the database-design had worked such details into table triggers or else provided a stored procedure api for such operations as insert new records into these tables

972419
value	field
in addition to the other two answers the reason your way is not working is because the value of the href field is usually fully qualified with the url this depends on browser and jquery doesn t abstract it away

972419
value	field
so if you have an href #text_field you may find the actual value of the field is which is why it doesn t match your pattern

972432
google-chrome	firefox
tested in latest version of google-chrome ie and firefox

972438
32-bit	16-bit
assume you have 16-bit integer and 32-bit integer as native types

972438
32-bit	16-bit
that way add can be a short opcode one byte and then you have another byte or maybe just 4 bit telling the vm how to interpret the registers do they hold 16-bit or 32-bit values

972442
profiling	debugging
install zend studio which is an excellent php ide check the features page and makes debugging and profiling very easy

972443
dialog	pop-up
i have a dropdown with some products and i want to give the user the ability to add a new product so when they selected add new it will pop-up a dialog and when they are done it will insert the new product into a table in the database

972456
webforms	asp.net
i m currently developing a site in asp.net webforms

972476
32-bit	64bit
you cannot run a cpu any target application on 64bit windows if you reference a 32-bit com component

972488
contains	elements
both jquery s are actually different objects that contains the same elements

972499
vbscript	jscript
in fact in its early days it was done with with vbscript and jscript and just called dhtml

972515
hide	show
based on the linq results you can hide the datagridview and show some other control like a literal or something that show the message

972552
drools	jbpm
drools flow is at lot more sophisticated and powerful than both jbpm and osworkflow and development is moving at a faster pace than either

972552
mvel	dsl
we are adding simulation and testing for this using an mvel dsl which we believe will be a huge hit

972562
versioning	migrate
if i run two separate migrations say rake db migrate versioning 10 to only create the column and then the second one with rake db migrate to update the attributes it works

972584
document	element
i have a 3rd party webservice that supplies an xml document that i have to update the element value and pass back

972584
document	element
this xml document has a namespace specified for the taskdata element and a different namespace for the requestinfo element

972589
repository	entity
i m not very familiar with repository patterns but what if you delete the old entity from the database and put the new entity in the database with the same id

972591
javascript	dom
jquery is a library intended to make it easy to manipulate dom elements and perform common javascript tasks cross-browser

972592
javascript	dom
the reason the browser is blocking during javascript downloading is that the browser suspects that there will be dom nodes created inside the script

972592
contains	any
a way to hint to the browser that the scripting does not contains any dom generation is with the defer attributes

972596
double	int
primitives such as int double etc struct and strings string are an exception-handling to these but works similar are allocated on the heap so things work a bit different

972602
linux	bsd
if this matters my focus is only on any relation assembly and syntax may have to linux bsd and the c language

972607
directory	folder
instead i made a folder in my user directory instead

972610
jboss	oas
i have a legacy struts 1.2.8 application that i m maintaining and porting from oracle application server oas 10g to jboss 4.2.3

972612
vxworks	linux
i need to port a c c++ codebase that already supports linux mac to vxworks

972616
aggregate	grouping
i want to have the report aggregate all the strings in a data grouping

972626
intel-syntax	gas
there are plenty of free assemblers nasm yasm along with gas that support intel-syntax too so there won t be any problems doing intel-syntax in linux

972643
ruby-on-rails	django
talking about magic i believe ruby-on-rails django and most if not all frameworks are doing some kind of magic

972643
controllers	routes
the way they abstract things wrap up low level services in apis integrate routes and controllers etc are kind of magic for people who know little behind

972652
postgresql	mysql
the application is developped with php and zend framework database should be mysql or postgresql

972671
export	csv
the one from stateofflow provides a nice way of export the metrics information in the form of html pages with graphs and tables and also can export metrics to csv files which you can then feed into whatever other utilities you may be using

972674
revision	updates
whenever a person updates a new file create an entry in each of these tables the one in revision containing a link to the one inserted in documents

972674
revision	updates
when you updates a document insert only in revision with alink to the corresponding document

972679
rollback	commit
furthermore as somebody else mentioned having smaller commit makes it easier to rollback a previous modification if you change your mind later

972700
contains	lookup
if your lookup file list likely contains many files of the same size so you d likely have to do a binary comparison against several files instead consider

972718
children	nodes
is is possible to display a nodes without children as a leaf nodes within the .net 3.5 treeview control

972730
inherited	subclass
i think for such classes designed for inherited and used as build blocks of application based on some framework definition of behavior should be more abstract - leaving some details to subclass even if class itself is not abstract

972730
superclass	subclass
subclass should be different is some way from superclass otherwise it does not make sense to create subclass

972730
superclass	subclass
and you always can abuse this difference and write a program that works for superclass and fails for subclass

972735
children	nodes
what i am looking for is the nodes element itself and all its children

972742
internet-explorer	firefox
for internet-explorer ides similar to what selenium gives in firefox check out watin

972743
document	element
i may be wrong but as i interpreter the xml document the taskdata element has the following namespace declaration

972751
virtualbox	vmware
i m currently using virtualbox and vmware and this does not look good enough for me correct me if i m wrong the hard drives could lock for instance either because two virtualized machines run on them or because all hard drive access is channeled through the same hdd controller

972761
virtual-machine	virtualbox
sun virtualbox is an excellent free virtual-machine which i ve found extremely convenient for development purposes

972800
internet-explorer	firefox
karim79 s solution will do the job in internet-explorer - but to make sure that it works in firefox and other browsers as well you probably want to add an input argument to the click handler that will take the click event and stop the event

972809
configuration	environment
our application keeps a separate directory with configuration files for each deployed environment

972809
configuration	environment
when the build server runs the task to deploy for a specific environment it knows which directory to pull the configuration files from

972816
put	get
to get sub-elements in a xsd complextype you have to put a xsd sequence in it first level along with annotations and attributes wich states that you want well.

972822
maven	sbt
its configuration is significantly cleaner than either maven s or sbt s and its startup time is orders of magnitude less when running under mri

972822
scala	java
it also has auto-magical support for the major scala test frameworks scalatest scalacheck and specs as well as support for joint compilation with java sources and ide meta generation for intellij and eclipse

972848
put	get
i get some results which are not relevant to me but anyway but if i put

972861
stdin	pipe
but if you want your java program to be able to read from stdin when it s redirected from a file or pipe you still have to use system.in

972864
google-chrome	firefox
firefox for example is using cairo internally - google-chrome is making use of the skia engine see here

972870
order	add
you may need to add in order for the webservice to determine which item requires updating

972876
64bit	x86
intel has an implementation of openmp that works with their c++ and fortran compilers for x86 64bit clusters

972890
children	nodes
all children of target nodes equivalent exprs

972905
hide	show
yes but you need additional javascript that will show hide the silverlight app

972910
environment	building
this asp.net-mvc application was part of a larger solution in which i had at one point set another project to building for an x86 environment i m running x64

972910
selected	checkbox
go into the solution build properties right-click solution selected properties and selected build on the menu on the left and put a check in the build checkbox next to the project name in the list

972915
virtual-machine	vmware
they do the same thing although gae provides an environment for your app to run in with strict language restrictions while ec2 provides you a virtual-machine think vmware on which to host your application

972920
cyclomatic-complexity	lines-of-code
in particular you will get good info like cyclomatic-complexity which i find of more value for bad programming practice than number of parameters as well as lines-of-code percentage of comments longest function etc

972925
any	set
do i need to set any special libcurl options

972941
order	join
sql optimiser will work just fine with tons of table join and if you hit an corner case you can specify the join order or style using hints

972946
contains	set
a set is an unordered unique homogenous collection -- you know what objects it contains and what type they are but not in what order and it only contains one of each object

972976
dictionary	arrays
stick that inside your dictionary for a given key along with your final string for another key save it and you ll have a plist with an arrays of one or more strings

972978
internet-explorer	firefox
if you stick to built-in widgets and composites your applications will work similarly on the most recent versions of internet-explorer firefox and safari

972993
cargo	maven
when we deploy to test and prod i would like to use maven cargo plugin and specify the version to deploy to these environments

973000
private-members	private
you don t necessarily want to change its public interface but maybe you want to change its private-members add a cache-variable extract a private method ...

973003
selected	button
in the advanced windows you can selected the field next to the new one and click the chevron next to the new button

973004
32-bit	64bit
i m trying to run a 32-bit application built as x86 on a 64bit machine

973004
32-bit	x86
i built it as x86 because it uses a 32-bit com object

973011
base-class	inherited
really awkward to define a public derived instance of the public base-class which should inherited some of the methods of the private implementation of the public base

973054
treeview	gridview
anyway what i want to do is have a treeview in the first column of a gridview using wpf which can expand and collapse and that will show hide the row it belongs to pretty much something like this the demo is for asp.net i want to be able to do the same in wpf

973055
bison	yacc
flex lex and bison yacc are two good tools to develop such things

973059
logout	login
so if you ever get a cookie going to domain.com and then later go to www.domain.com you can reset your session login logout all day long but ie will ignore the www.domain.com cookies and continue to use the original domain.com one

973071
linked-list	arrays
as you most likely know randomly accessing an element takes a bit more time with a linked-list as opposed to an arrays

973079
document	element
unfortunately by default lxml.etree.xmlparser doesn t preserve whitespace before or after the root element of a document

973083
google-chrome	firefox
you could also just recommend google-chrome or firefox

973085
similarity	distance
i started with a previous application that used a basic levenshtein distance algorithm to compute image similarity but that methods is undesirable for a number of reasons

973090
xcopy	cmd
if you have a mapped drive from your build server to your live server then you can execute an xcopy cmd in final builder to copy the files across

973093
directory	folder
directory path to 123 folder doesn t exist

973113
shell	bash
the problem is that bash performs tilde expansion before shell parameter substitution so after it substitutes path to folder for it doesn t try to expand the so it looks for a directory literally named with a tilde in it which of course doesn t exist

973159
jquery-plugins	jquery
if you are working with jquery the first way to organize your code is to build jquery-plugins

973175
attributes	properties
have you tried using firebug using the dom tab dom subpanel and actually looking through the attributes properties methods on the document and or related elements

973175
javascript	dom
having just checked the yui examples for tabview i see there is no property on the dom elements for the tabs that refer to javascript objects

973201
controller	routes
it goes against the standard view conventions so you ll have to do workarounds in the view the controller even the routes

973213
stream	send
2 something sometime is going to screw up and cut off the stream of stuff to send

973229
directory	folder
my current implementation has a function to find the latest file in a folder that conforms to a file mask cjl .log and uses 2 anonymous classes one to filtering a directory listing and another to sort a list of files based on modifieddt

973235
contains	elements
so if you want your plist to contains entries as arrays of strings and you want just a single string as an elements then you do something like

973266
any	set
jin yong - ie has an issue with polluting the global scope with object references to any dom elements with a name or id attributes set on the initial page load

973277
spaces	output
the first solution has no spaces in the output

973277
placeholder	required
this solution required a placeholder symbols # not occuring in the input

973278
arrays	loops
another possibility is using string.split to convert your string into an arrays of strings and then loops over your arrays of a b and c and prefix your arrays elements with the prefix of your choice

973282
implements	final
in the final analysis the itemssource just has to be an object that implements ienumerable

973290
adplus	dump
you could enable adplus to have it grab a memory dump each time you get the exception-handling

973292
exception-handling	error-handling
one way around this is to keep the error-handling in the methodss but make the methods void and have the methodss throw their exception-handling

973293
asihttprequest	cfnetwork
if you re unwilling or unable to use private apis there s an open source bsd license library called asihttprequest that provides a wrapper around the lower-level cfnetwork apis

973294
arrays	loops
you can split a string using regular expressions and put it back together with a loops over the resulting arrays

973315
exception-handling	try-catch
you can always spare your clients from having to write try-catch blocks by throwing unchecked exception-handling

973341
put	get
i unzip i get some folders i then put these extracted folders in to another folder and zip it back

973352
javascript	dom
jaxer is server-side javascript + the dom

973365
scheme	lisp
it uses scheme lisp dialect a highly iterative language suitable for prototyping apps one line at a time

973372
progress-bar	progress
i m not sure how to bind this dependency property progress to the progress value in the progress-bar within the style

973413
contains	set
java.util -- contains the java collections such as list set map and their implementations date random and other utilitarian classes

973427
pagespeed	yslow
see the yahoo yslow tool and the pagespeed tool for this

973446
authentication	login
a login form needs to decide if where to redirect to how to cryptographically secure an authentication token if and how to cache roles how to or if to deal with dictionary attacks

973447
any	set
is there any other way this could get set

973452
default-value	arguments
it looks like attrs is a hash that gets passed as an arguments with a default-value of an empty hash

973452
iteration	elements
what effect is achieved by calling self.send on the elements of the key value pair during this iteration

973454
json	xml
xml json whatever to then use in a variety of ways

973474
hosts-file	hosts
if the hosts does not have the read only attributes and getfileattributess does not return invalid_file_attributess then you can trust it s return-value

973475
minimum	max
of course management only ever looks at the minimum figure but by the time they start complaining about cost over-runs and missed deliverables you ve already got them locked in and you have been hopefully keeping the fully appraised of any problems you ve encountered and the effect those problems are having pushing the actuals away from min and closer to max

973476
redmine	trac
i would recommend redmine similar with trac in many aspects

973477
jquery	.post
and here is dave s .post about it it is about implementing client-side paging using jquery but essentially it is fetching and showing data on client side using jquery ajax

973482
highlight	cell
specifically i have rollover rollout event handler registered on each table cell to let me highlight the cell under the pointers

973482
highlight	cells
with the larger table the highlight is very jerky changing only about twice per second skipping over many cells

973482
processor	cpu
if i place the mouse cursor over the component and leave it there my cpu is pegged one processor core anyway and stays that way until i move off of the component when it drops to idle

973499
header-files	makefile
what i usually do when i don t want the compiler to compile the world after i touched some common header-files is to have a makefile script to compile only the files i know need recompiling

973500
any	set
instead we can create an attached property that we can then set on any element with a scrollviewer

973500
contains	elements
also we can use our helper methods to get the scrollviewer that is contains within the elements

973523
innodb	myisam
myisam engine whenever we query this table mysql hangs down so now we are trying our hands with innodb engine so that if it slows down but it will not hang up for others

973527
data-members	private
as a matter of fact both the time drop down and its initializers are implemented as private data-members of the datetimecontrol class so you can not change the values directly

973554
having	select
this will select text area having id ending with commentbody

973563
gridview	listview
you can also investigate databound controls eg gridview listview and repeater

973564
base-class	inherited
where basetable can be any python class which you want all your table classes to inherited from such base-class may have some utility or common methods basic crud methods

973571
default	reset
i reset the settings to default

973574
instances	private
you should seriously consider extracting that private functionality into a new class writing tests for the new class and making your old class have a private instances of the new class

973586
arrays	loops
loops as to look up the documentation for the arrays class.

973586
arrays	loops
loops like the one above and i m wondering if there s some other arrays copy function in .net that s implemented as such a nice simple for

973587
selected	textbox
here s another tip you can figure out how to run various windows-applications from the command line by finding them in the windows start menu right-clicking on the icon selected properties and then on the shortcut tab look at the target textbox

973595
value	field
another alternative is to avoid the sql insert and requery or resetting the recordsource and simply add a new record in the existing form set the sequence field to the new value and immediately save the record

973614
streamreader	streamwriter
everytime i use a streamwriter or streamreader i need to close it and that closes the stream so that i cannot use it anymore

973614
compression	streaming
i was hoping to be able to spin up each of the steps as separate threads and have the compression step begin as soon as there is data on the streaming and then as soon as the compression has some compressed data available on the streaming i could start saving it for example

973616
web.py	django
django for me has a terrible api and although we can find some other really cool projects like web.py when i compare that to what i get with php and cakephp i don t get that excited

973616
python	ruby
on the other hand we have ruby which is a scripting language just like python

973616
python	ruby
i don t know how far you can go with desktop development with ruby compared with python

973616
python	ruby
so my question is should i learn python or ruby

973627
entity-framework	data-access
in it they said that linq to sql will be maintained and features added based on user community feedback but that the entity-framework would be the primary focus of future data-access efforts

973635
ruby	php
this is a choice i had to make also moving from php and i chose ruby for its more elegant syntax such as built-in literal regexps and hashes dicts in python

973638
button	slide
i make an app like a slide show with back previous button to change image one by one

973640
streamreader	streamwriter
streamreader streamwriter shouldn t have been designed to close their underlying stream -- that s a horrible misfeature in the bcl

973640
streamreader	writer
but there are some well-established workarounds if you want to use streamreader writer but keep the stream open afterward

973640
buffering	streaming
you have to call flush to make sure that buffering data gets written out to the streaming

973642
facebook-page	facebook
a facebook-page inside the facebook app s iframe

973666
methods	extend
it then calls the include and extend methods on base passing the module instancemethods and classmethods as arguments respectively

973666
methods	extend
i m not familiar with the extend methods but i assume it will do something like that too but for class methodss

973668
xsd	xml
first - you should check this blog entry and this blog entry which walks you through dominic de lorenzo experiences with utilising functionality within the flex sdk that provides the automatic mapping of custom actionscript classes to element definitions within an xml schema xsd

973682
persistence	hibernate
i think that hibernate is a great choice for persistence

973684
methods	extend
in this case it will try to invoke base s include methods to get the module methodss variables and constants from instancemethodss added into base and then will try to invoke base s extend methods to get the instance methodss from classmethodss added to base

973690
opacity	shadow
however what i want to do is have the drop shadow beneath the type become stronger read higher opacity darker when the type is being hovered on

973690
opacity	shadow
basically i need the opacity of the shadow elements 4 individual ones to start at 10 opacity and while the user hovers the type moves down this part is working and simultaneously the shadow becomes stronger increases to 60 opacity

973703
persistence	hibernate
you might add interfaces for your classes use hibernate for the persistence layer replacing your daosqlimplementation by daohibernateimplementation one per time

973705
value	field
i m using the cocoa accessibility api to try and modify the value of a text field axtextfield in another application but i ve run into a problem my code correctly identifies and modifies the contents of the text field in question and the text of the field visibly changes but the changes aren t registered by the program i m trying to control

973705
value	field
and the text field changes to the value specified in amount but the other program doesn t recognize the change - i have to go type the number in myself to get it to pick up the change i can tell the difference because the program responds when a new value is typed in the box

973719
perl	c++
it combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between c++ java python php ruby erlang perl haskell c# cocoa smalltalk and ocaml

973720
directory	folder
if the indexing service is indexing a child folder of the root but not the root directory itself can it cause iis to restart the site s app pool

973721
contains	any
in c# the eventargs for the opening event doesn t contains from what i can tell a property indicating extendedverbs or if any modifier keys are pressed

973729
firebird	oracle
linq-to-sql in an enterprise environment are its database independence you can hook it up to oracle firebird db2 many others which can be crucial and it s ability to present you with an object model that looks quite different from the physical storage model in the database by virtue of the mapping between the conceptual layer and the physical storage layer

973735
ruby	php
remember - wcf is also an interoperable system your other end of the wire could be a php or java or ruby client which will not be able to understand the .net generic list

973740
value	field
for example if there s no line in a_c with the given value for contact_id and deleted then all the field of a_c in the first left join will be null so there can be no correspondence for acc either is it important to emit null null as the first two columns in this case

973747
circular-buffer	queue
for a true queue that only adds and removes from the ends a circular-buffer arrays is an extremely fast implementation

973752
getter	setter
so it s just defining some getter and setter methods for foo and evaluating it at the class level

973755
show	next
the image below has a white bar where i want to show menuitem objects now i want to be able to do a swipe in the white region so that the next menu item is centered

973757
google-chrome	firefox
i have a code which accept a query and uses yahoo websearch to return a suggestion.its working fine in firefox and google-chrome

973761
contains	set
if in your particular context it is easier to work directly in the camera coordinates then you can just give object_points in that system and set both rotation_vector and translation_vector to contains 0s.â

973770
google-chrome	firefox
just tested the code with these things fixed and it is working for me on ie firefox google-chrome

973788
show	next
with subversive this is show very clearly next to the menu

973806
any	set
jquery loves sets and will do anything you ask it to to a set of elements if it makes any sense

973832
response	timeout
this would result in a better experience for the user doesn t have to wait for timeout less resource usage in my system threads won t be busy waiting for no response or timeout from the external system and it would spare the external system

973838
any	set
i ve set the following page properties in web.config without any luck

973870
exception-handling	error-handling
simply catching the exception-handling and returning it is not error-handling

973874
click	mouse
you will need to find out if your .exe program supports command-line parameters to do the things you want to do - otherwise the only other way is to use some third-party tool to record the keystrokes mouse click and replay them later

973879
findstr	cmd
the problems with this approach were great inter-solution dependencies were almost impossible to work out involving a lot of findstr cmd

973879
show	next
that way each dll show up in solutiondir bin as the project is built and is found by the next projects to build

973883
attributes	properties
some of the attributes that are applicable to properties methods can be set using procedure attributes dialog in vb6 make this default properties hide in object browser etc

973902
asp.net-mvc	wcf
wcf service with asp.net-mvc application

973902
asp.net-mvc	wcf
which s the best performance between wcf service and asp.net-mvc controller

973910
.when	ready
you can read the first few chapters now to get a good grip on the basic and then go on with the more advanced chapters .when you feel ready for it

973923
unique	words
it does respect trailing spaces in like comparison but it does not let us store same words with and without trailing spaces in a varchar column if it has a unique index over it

973935
common-lisp	lisp
common-lisp and clojure as well as other lisp provide interactive environment with repl and you do not need tricks like â â

973950
export	csv
install php list export your db of email addresses and import it into php list as a csv

973959
rewrite	rule
oh and if you use a url rewrite rule and all the url s change in the same way you can probably use regex in the rewrite rule to handle all of them in a single step

973961
.net	wcf
we have an windows service written in .net that is hosting wcf service

973991
32-bit	64bit
the .net runtime automatically runs the application as 64bit and it no longer can load the 32-bit com component into its process

973997
exception-handling	try-catch
you may also want to wrap your code in an try-catch block to see if your code is throwing an exception-handling

974012
any	set
on my macs i set up svnserve using launchd to start up only when a request comes in so it doesn t use any resources when there is no repository activity

974016
doskey	alias
with ct being cleartool type doskey ct cleartool on windows to set that alias

974023
benchmarking	profiling
as always if you have concerns benchmarking and profiling a realistic scenario

974035
gethashcode	equals
if you have a reliable equals gethashcode implementation then that might already be done for you

974038
build-server	ncover
this code works fine on our 32-bit workstations and did work ok on the build-server until i recently enabled code coverage analysis with ncover

974038
gallio	ncover
because ncover uses a 32-bit com component the test runner gallio runs as a 32-bit process

974040
object-reference	instances
system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

974058
png	gif
you should be compression all of your html css and javascript files but not your png gif or jpeg files and there are bugs with netscape 4 you may or may not want to account for

974066
json	xml
simple question i am currently embedding the map for the error codes inside the json snippet with the intention of helping the transformation to xml

974072
msbuild	nant
there s msbuild but it s no simpler than nant

974088
getter	setter
properties offer both getter and setter and can have different scope at least in .net 2.0

974090
archive	backup
i can restore this backup on my new linux server without any problems because i have all archive logs generated after level 1 backup

974115
object-reference	instances
system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

974122
msbuild	nant
a good thing is that you can use msbuild for building the application that is what i am using and doing the rest with nant

974144
keyvaluepair	key
they are sometimes appropriate in library classes where the author cannot know how the data will be used but must simply output the same value that was put in the key and value properties of the keyvaluepair class.

974144
getter	setter
and if the filename is just part of the log message you do not need a getter for the property only a setter

974159
ado	jet
if you are using access rather than ace jet standalone you can use a single line of vba ado code

974161
contains	sorted
have you tried making an index on the releasedate column or creating a clustered index on the table contains releasedate sorted by releasedate

974170
selected	cell
i would like to have the cell selected when touched then animated back to the normal color again like the ringtone selection user-interface

974170
selected	cells
i m setting the accessorytype of the cells in cellforrowatindexpath and updating my model when cells are selected in didselectrowatindexpath

974170
selected	cell
the only way i can think of to set the selected cell to checkmark and clear the previous one is to call tableview reloaddata in didselectrowatindexpath

974183
matplotlib	scipy
i have chosen to use python combined with numpy scipy and matplotlib

974183
vtk	itk
when you import itk and vtk in matlab you have to use mex functions to program your c code in

974183
vtk	itk
so it is impossible to run some itk vtk code notice it doesn t work and alter some of the variables used in the mex file created there but they will also die there because of the black box only returning your result for speed testing what does work

974245
ref	out
however i disagree that all static will be better since i will have to use ref and out parameters in methods

974255
sniffing	packets
you may want to checkout packets sniffing tools for example ethereal or tcpdump - they are open source and have command-line interfaces so you may be able to call those from your program and analyse any log files it may produce

974265
versioning	upgrade
if you have a hacked versioning and an upgrade doesn t work try it then you will have to write your own migration scripting

974291
linux	osx
to support both python 2 and 3 on linux windows osx pyaudio module could be used instead

974301
json	xml
i am using a webservice which provides a large result set either in xml or json format

974301
json	xml
also which language should i use to parse the xml json

974303
png	gif
the following ignores existing files folder and files with the extension matching jpg jpeg png gif

974312
json	xml
i suspect json will be a bit more compact than xml although if they re compressing the data you may well find they end up taking the same bandwith as a lot of the bloat of xml is easily compressible

974319
required	checked
at that point you shouldn t need two checked for whether invoke is required because ctrl and panels should be using the same thread

974326
arguments	default
by default the callback needs to have an arguments with

974345
document	element
it has been parsing as html and has been added to the document as a dom element or a number of dom elements

974347
json	xml
note simplexml is the easier to work with xml lib but also parses the whole xml-file at once so in this case there s no benefit over json

974354
debugging	trace
finally be warned that debugging access violations using windbg can be a fairly involed and complex process - if you can get a stack trace another way then you might want to try that first

974366
filtering	grouping
the basic idea is why do you filtering on a date after grouping when you can prevent unwanted records entering the result before grouping takes place

974368
json	xml
its format json or xml

974379
button	popup
the scenario where i am facing problem is there is a save button if we click on it a dialog box popup

974379
textbox	button
i need to enter some text in two textbox and press save cancel button on the same dialog

974383
if-statement	loops
i want to avoid having loads of loops and if-statement so should be able to use linq to do this

974403
ubuntu	debian
and on debian ubuntu to restart syslog

974413
defined	declare
in this case it is simpler to have the event handler declare as anonymous methodss since it uses the instance-variables that is defined in the unit test methods scope

974418
csv	xml
i already tried using for xml path and it worked but the client doesn t like the xml notation they want a csv field

974419
bar-chart	pie-chart
how to create asp.net 2.0 pie-chart and bar-chart

974420
textblock	expander
i ve got an expander with a couple of textblock in the top bar which i m using to give a title and a piece of key information

974428
keyboard	mouse
edit - i can use mouse and keyboard to interact with the program i just cannot manipulate it with windows messages sent from my own code

974438
python	java
i m looking for the equivalent of python decorators lisp macros java annotations yes i know that these are not necessarily equivalent themselves in actionscript

974483
click	mouse
i just realized that is is possible to click ctrl + left mouse button or to press f12 on the variables -keyword too .

974485
ogre	sdl
for a hobby they both have pretty good low-level support for graphics etc and both also have pretty good higher-level libraries for games jmonkey engine sdl sfml ogre and many more

974485
python	c++
sfml has bindings for c++ c d ruby and i think python

974493
constructor	object
assuming you got your classes defined for the objects you mentioned and you have a constructor or properties so you can propery create the object in one line you could have a linq query returning a list of a points

974515
triggers	insert
so far i have only worked out the update triggers but not the insert triggers

974515
triggers	insert
tai_useritemvote insert triggers

974534
sql-server	mysql
if you are working on back-end and dynamic page generation you will need to learn a server-side stack php + mysql or asp.net + sql-server

974543
callback	methods
the first argument is the callback pseudo-type and the second is an arrays of parameters which will be passed to the function methods as individual arguments

974579
bison	yacc
standard nix tools to do so are lex and yacc or their descendants flex and bison but i d like to point you to antlr instead

974579
python	java
one of its nice features is that it provides backends for many different languages c c++ as well as java python ruby c# ... so learning how to work with it will also help you if you want to switch languages at a later point

974582
required	checked
if you have access to the future object representing this task then you could checked isdone and cancel if required

974590
boolean	int
what would those int and long and boolean classes be written in

974590
hashmap	arrays
how would you write an arraylist or hashmap without primitive arrays

974591
treeview	gridview
imo what you re actually looking for is not a gridview with a treeview inside it but rather a treeview with columns

974591
treeview	treelist
here are a some samples of treeview with columns often called treelist or treelistview

974593
archive	backup
when you use your backup to duplicates the database on another server you can only roll forwarding using your archive logs

974606
scala	java
java may going towards 99 oo think of auto-boxing scala

974611
rollback	commit
a transaction is a mechanism that allows you to mark a grouping of operations and execute them in such a way that either they all execute commit or the system state will be as if they have not started to execute at all rollback

974623
bazaar	git
you might want to consider a distribute source code control solution bazaar git mercurial for the scenario you propose where you have two committers working against two codebases

974623
push	pull
you could then have local commits and push and pull the changes to the two destinations as appropriate

974624
c++	lua
you can have class-based oo c++ java c# or you can have prototype-based oo javascript lua

974624
abstract	extends
what bothers me about java is that it doesn t provide the means to abstract ideas efficiently to extends the language where it has problems

974637
boolean	int
that said java does have objects that wrap around the primitives such as int boolean character and such

974647
command-line	cmd
you ll have to use the caspol cmd-line cmd

974658
chown	chmod
and finally crontab or manually runs scripting which sets resource to maintainance mode deletes htdocs and export there new trunk and then chown chmod everything as needed

974671
primitive	int
one reason java can t obviously do away with non-object primitive int etc. is that it does not support native data-members

974671
primitive	int
ultimately i think the justification for primitive is efficiency the static analysis needed to determine that an int object can be treated purely as jvm int value may have been considered too big a problem when the language was designed

974685
hosts-file	hosts
the hosts isn t read only but it is the return-value

974687
command-prompt	cmd
i am trying to compile a java source file on cmd-prompt with the following cmd

974693
managed-code	c++-cli
in c++-cli the following is sample code that links native and managed-code within the same file

974697
revision	svn
since in svn there is a single revision no moo.txt also has to be at revision 1.10

974703
revision	svn
svn and revision numbers

974703
revision	svn
since in svn there is a single revision no moo.txt also has to be at revision 1.10

974708
json	xml
i suppose this happens because your ajax call doesn t actually prevent rendering the page instead of returning an xml or json structure

974708
json	xml
i don t know what options you have in cakephp for returning xml or json as opposed to rendering the page but the source of the problem is definitely on server side and not client side

974711
passthru	exec
i have normally used passthru but i tried exec and system to see if i could return some info

974711
command-line	cmd
i can run imagemagick cmd from the command-line no problem and images get resized fine.

974716
revision	svn
svn uses a repository-wide revision number which is incremented with each commit

974732
revision	svn
in svn revision number as integers 1 2 3 ... not dotted monsters as in cvs 1.1 1.2 .

974732
revision	svn
the big advantage of svn is that the revision number is global to the repository so that you can revert the whole project to a specific revision which is not possible in cvs

974755
order	add
since you know the current item number and how many items there are you could add some logic to get list items in the correct order

974758
contains	elements
because the elements you get is the parent elements of the text one contains the text you need

974782
graphviz	dia
dia graphviz dot pen and paper and my own mind

974782
graphviz	dia
dia and graphviz are also free as in beer

974784
put	get
does your code get called at all does it stop when you put a breakpoint in

974796
value	field
join the table with the primary key to the rest of the tables or on any other field where field value of one table should match field value of other table

974813
python	c++
c++ has perfectly working destructors where one can free resources safely so i would imagine python has something agreed-upon too

974842
selected	cell
i do not find the right expression to selected table rows that must be hidden according to the value ofe the cell on which the user has clicked

974842
selected	cells
when che user clicks on a cell i wish to hide all the cells that have a value different from the selected one

974865
bar-chart	pie-chart
you could write your own generic handler .ashx that generates an image of your bar-chart pie-chart as a bitmap using system.drawing and saves it to the response.outputstream if a you really want to make life hard for yourself or b really need to customise the output in detail

974880
command-line	cmd
when i run ipconfig using the run cmd windows key+r once the program has executed it immediately closes the instance of the cmd-line interface is there any universal parameter i can add to

974934
subtract	add
initialize your tree with an arbitrary number of elements measure the memory size consumed by the process add 1000 new elements measure the memory size again subtract and divide

974937
reflection	runtime
i don t think there is a way to get the total size of the object in runtime apart from raversing internal fields using reflection

974951
python	c++
if you use destructors in c++ they are called either when the block that defines the object finishes like python with or when you use the delete keyword that deallocates an object created with new

974952
integer	digits
i have to read the user s input nine digitss of an isbn into an integer variables and then multiply the last digits by 2 the second last digits by 3 and so on

974952
integer	digits
how can i split the integer into its constituent digits to do this

974972
disposable	dispose
your best bet is to make the contains class disposable store the client in a class-variables to be dispose when the contains class is

974980
contains	elements
and all elements that are contains in that div

974990
value	field
if you were to query the value of the lookup field in issue a you would get something like 1#

975004
authentication	login
authentication login

975030
arrays	loops
you can loops through each pair of the original hash and build up an arrays of hashes

975035
communication	messages
shareable memory can be shared with other processes is charged against the system commit limit and typically contains data shared between dlls in different processes or inter-process communication messages

975059
contains	any
edit of course you would need to enclose any items contains spaces within quotes

975082
archive	backup
yes you can use the unarchived logs - if you applying the archive logs via recover database using backup controlfile just supply the redo log name instead of the suggested archive log name that the recovery process provides when it comes to that point runs out of archive logs

975105
textchanged	textbox
inside of the panel there is a textbox which its autopostback property is ture and when user enters a value in it textchanged event is fired but unfortunately the panel also disapears...

975109
document	element
first if you have txtname and txtname in your document and you use getelementbyid txtname you can get the wrong element in ie

975121
gentoo	linux
on my system x86_64 running gentoo gnu linux i am unable to get at the int a 12 line when i use any optimization greater or equal to -o as the compiler will then apply dead code elimination

975128
subtract	time
each time subtract one letter in every combination and then two letters in every combination possible ect..

975135
configuration	environment
1 use a web deployment project in order to compile and clean the build as well as handing web.configuration section replacement if the configuration changes between environment

975135
msbuild	nant
the web-deployment project ends up creating a msbuild file which can be used in place of nant

975135
msbuild	nant
i have my nant build file call the web-deployment project through msbuild

975135
configuration	environment
with the configuration manager setup for each environment it allows me to manage the web.config section replacements automatically and still have fairly decent control over my copying and archiving of a release

975140
properties-file	jar
i jar ed my properties-file in to test.jar and added it under ear libraries i am using rad7 and it got reflected in my manifest.mf

975143
revision	updates
the revision number will be the revision as of the updates even if somebody has committed new code since then

975153
hide	show
i am using jquery s toggle to show hide table rows

975155
actionscript	mxml
whatever you write in the value of the mxml event not sure it s the right term to use will become the body of the generated handler for the actionscript event

975167
shell	bash
bash shell that calls zip probably linux only

975173
instance-variables	nested-class
since a static nested-class cannot refer directly to instance-variables or methods defined in its enclosing class it can use them only through an object reference it s safe to declare static-methods in a static nested-class

975194
vba	vb6
this knowledgebase article explains how to do it from vba it s exactly the same in vb6

975200
fopen	fread
if your files are big however you might want to use fopen and its friends fseek and fread

975211
16-bit	8bit
rather than have the circuit built from the basic gates and or nand etc i want to allow these gates to be used to make chips which can then be used within other circuits eg you might want to make a 8bit register chip or a 16-bit adder

975248
deep-copy	object
i tried doing a deep-copy shallowcopy of the stderr stdout object but that does nothing it still says the module the message occured in __init__.py

975256
any	set
basically what andrew was trying to say is if you have a class myobject for eg with n properties using the object initializer syntax of c# 3.0 you can set any subset of the n properties as so

975256
any	set
you can set any of the properties fields that way.

975284
windows-xp	windows
i m running windowss-xp with a dual monitor setup taskbar in the first primary windows

975299
revision	svn
caveat assemblyversionlabeller won t start generating svn revision based labels until an actual commit-triggered build occurs.

975299
msbuild	nant
for sake of completness it s just as easy for projects using nant instead of msbuild

975305
authentication	login
i am working on a web application c# vs2008 with entity modelling and will add some login authentication authentication options that can be managed through the site

975306
transitions	coverflow
you could even set up an animation to manipulate the alpha property of the new view if you wanted to do a smooth transition like you see in the ipod app when it transitions to coverflow mode

975308
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.0.10 gecko 2009042316 firefox 3.0.10

975348
hash	md5
it s not that hard - a couple of md5 hash

975357
project-management	scrum
scrum was popularised by software development organisations but is positioning as general management technique rather than a software project-management technique

975359
revision	svn
something like svn export with revision number but i only want the files that i commited on that revision

975382
pointers	stack
for pointers to objects stored on stack or as class member variables

975394
json	xml
and for those readers currently saying that this makes no sense if i am using application xml and application json as media-types

975406
forwarding	port
the problem is that the firewall does not automatically pass the external ip-address through to the internal ip-address via port forwarding

975411
export	report
what i would like to do is have the report automatically export to a pdf when they click view

975415
constructor	object
its a constructor where you know that the src object is a temporary and is going away

975415
copy-constructor	constructor
to distinguish a copy-constructor from a move constructor the language has introduced rvalue references

975423
subtract	add
do some magic to work out whether you should be adding or subtract time to get to midnight then add or subtract the difference between your time and midnight to get the timezone difference and add it to your own timezone

975457
value	field
i ve tried manually changing the field to dbnull null etc prior to the save but it says those value cannot be converted to datetime

975461
google-chrome	firefox
having just completed first wordpress theme uploaded and working fine in firefox testing has revealed that the images in the following page do not display in safari and google-chrome

975461
google-chrome	firefox
the images on the page display in firefox ie and opera just n ot safari or google-chrome

975479
linux	unix
the easiest way to do that was in unix not entirely certain about the fsync in linux but you should be guaranteed that this wil happen eventually unless the system itself goes down

975479
fflush	stdout
i ve done this often in unix and it ensures that the c runtime libraries are fflush to unix fflush and the unix buffering are sync ed to disk fsync useful if stdout is not a terminal device or you re doing it for a different file handle

975480
fflush	stdout
add a call to fflush stdout

975505
mousedown	mouseup
the mousedown mouseup and mouseclick events all return the x and y coordinates of the action

975508
contains	any
does anyone have any suggestions as to how to go about designing a container class in c# that has upwards of thirty variables contains within it

975523
order	add
so i have a datagrid that i need to add custom sorting for and i also need to know the exact order of the sort

975536
hosts-file	hosts
how about utilizing your hosts

975539
firefox	opera
everything works fine in other browsers opera ie 8 firefox safari

975541
any	set
is there any way by which we can find date format as set in the computer where web pages are loading

975545
exception-handling	try-catch
if create throws an exception it is basically the same as returning null but makes programming even more tedious by making you create a try next finally block for each instantiation but you could throw various types of exception-handling which you can t with the null solution which could bubble up so that you could more explicitly handle the deep errors on your user-interface so this i would think is the most robust solution although would produce try-catch code bloat

975558
rewrite	rule
also it is possible to make a more generic rewrite rule but you will need to carefully think about other urls that might be affected

975560
keyboard	mouse
one would be to programatically take over the mouse and keyboard and trough those channels manage the program

975564
firefox	opera
it s working fine in ie6 where as in ie7 firefox opera and in other browsers it s not working

975574
attributes	properties
i ve been looking at using metadatatype following this post which looks like it should allow me to define the properties attributes in another class

975574
attributes	properties
the issue is that the xmlignore attributes are being ignored those properties are being sent through

975578
order	join
the delay in send readthread.join is an effort to delay read in order to allow serial-port interrupt processing a chance to occur but i think i ve misinterpreted the join function

975587
exception-handling	try-catch
it depends - if it fails because something is definitely wrong then an exception-handling makes programming easier - you don t write a try-catch around each call you just let the exception-handling bubble up

975587
exception-handling	try-catch
if you find yourself creating try-catch bloat have a look at why you really need to catch the exception-handling rather than just letting them bubble up

975598
updating	updates
since oracle 8i i haven t tried with the preceeding versioning you can updates a join if the tables are key-preserved i-e if you re updating the child from in a parent-child relationship

975604
persistence	hibernate
we wanted the back-end to be j2ee standard frameworks struts spring hibernate for persistence etc.

975613
uiscrollview	subviews
i am adding a uiscrollview as a subviews to the controllers view

975613
uiscrollview	subviews
i cann t get why the image views are added as subviews to the uiscrollview

975616
put	get
to get around it you put the condition in the join

975627
protected	public
one option may be to make the generated properties non-public private protected or internal - and name it something like timestampstorage etc - then re-expose them in the partials class on the public api

975666
any	set
can you set a cookie only for domain.tld and www.domain.tld so that if you go to any other subdomain bla.doamin.tld for example the cookie won t be set

975699
javascript	dom

976656
contains	elements
the existing mycolor elements would now be able to contains gold if it used this xsd instead of the main one

976667
physics-engine	box2d

976700
methods	extend
you can mark the constructor of key classes or methods in your business and data layers as internal and then use the internalvisibleto attribute to extend that access to the appropriate assemblies

976714
contains	elements
to do this we construct a sequence beginning with 0 contains each elements of s and then 0

976714
partition-problem	np-complete
therefore this problem is at least as hard as the partition-problem since we can solve a example partition program if we can solve the given one and is therefore np-complete

in sql-server 2005 and later the sql-server profiling graphical user-interface displays the duration column in milliseconds by default but when a trace is saved to either a file or a database-table the duration column value is written in microseconds

976770
pointers	stack
also if you have some legacy c++ dll s you can still use them in a c# application while in java is still hard to do especially that in the worst case when your native code api has to use pointers you can use unsafe mode in c# application to pass pointers and allocate fixed memory on stack .

976801
binary-tree	nodes
in about 30-40 lines of code most of it at the bottom of chabstractbinarysearchtree.m i added the ability to iteratively traverse a binary-tree and create a dot representation of it including balancing information coloring nodes red or black etc

976802
versioning	upgrade
our product is halted at java versioning 1.5.0_13 and we would like to upgrade

contains	elements
when i use msbuild sidekick to attempt to make an msbuild file that uses the usingtask elements to reference the resulting dll it complains that the dll does not contains any tasks

976805
attributes	properties
i m guessing the issue is either with an incomplete interface implementation on my part most likely the properties since i m faking them with attributes or a version issue ironpython 2.0 versus 2.1 in the post

976811
attributes	properties
the above error occurred until i removed the name properties value from the attributes

976816
directory	folder
i want to copy the entire contents of a resources folder over to the target directory while maintaining the but it keeps exiting with code 1

976825
base-class	inherited
i want all asp.net page inherited from that base-class instead of system.web.ui.page

976825
base-class	inherited
make sure that the class defined in this code file matches the inherited attributes and that it extends the correct base-class page or user-controls

976871

if you want your dictionary to be sorted then there is a sorteddictionary class for this purpose

976876
delphi	c++
porting the c++ code to delphi probably isn t too difficult

976877
arrays	loops
i don t think that you have a loops that will check if the object is an arrays

976899
svnadmin	dump
the way to typically achieve this is the svnadmin dump command

976899

i d like this app to be self contains and not require any frameworks to be downloaded by the customer before being able to run this app

977002
error-code	hresult
if you break down the hresult value the facility code is facility_control and the error-code is 1004

977004
serialization	marshalling
i haven t worked with it yet but when it comes to marshalling more complex data-structures i would look into boost for the serialization part

977014
display	height
if the child forms extend beyond the screen height a vertical scrollbar is automatically display on the right side of the mdi parent i can use this scrollbar to scroll the child forms into view

977017
configuration	logging
i have a a few base test classes that setup common configuration for spring logging jndi etc using test execution listeners that are then inherited by subclasses

977025

977058
simulink	matlab
i would to display the simulink workspace in a matlab gui windows

977060
mta	sta
i m 90 sure that the com api we are using is based on mta multithreading apartment rather than a sta single-threaded apartment

977060
mta	sta
from what i know about com mta and sta don t mix in the same spaces

977070
triggers	insert
for example you could add a triggers that does that after insert

977077
value	field
the field value consists of

977096
apache-config	.htaccess
on a side note as others have mentioned if you have the ability to modify your apache-config directly you should put the rewrite rules there instead of in the .htaccess file as it is less efficient

977105
.net	wcf
use of wcf and other .net built-in features

977133
contains	any
if there s no option for this reserved string for instance if the contract may contains any type of string characters in any sequence which i find unlikely then you ll probably need to split into 2 text fields

977167
vb.net	vb6
its been tried before not only c++ c# but vb6 vb.net c++ java and any other old new that you can think of

977169
attributes	properties
.prop allows you to set a properties on a dom element while .attr allows you to set an html attributes value

977169
attributes	properties
in 1.6.1+ using .attr checked false does both elem.removeattributes checked and since the change caused a lot of backwards compatibility issues and it can t really tell if you wanted to set the html attributes or the dom properties

977212
contains	elements
you might have to derive bounded but that is probably not an issue since unboxed arrays can contains fixed size elements only

977219
synchronous	.when
the main cause of very slow socket code that i ve seen is .when people try to port non-c# code into c# directly in particular trying to port synchronous c++ socket code

977227
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
my app is driven by a uitabbarcontroller embedded with a uinavigationcontroller for each individual view within each active tab

977228
keyboard	mouse
you can customize the command keys used for an individual application in system preferences keyboard mouse keyboard shortcuts

977246

the way i was able to work around this in a simple page that i was working on was to have a hidden gridview outside of the updatepanel and set it equal to the gridview in the update panel so that they are the same except for the new one being hidden

977260
strncpy	strcpy
that s where strcpy and strncpy are defined at least according to the strcpy 2 manpage

977267
required	checked
if having the functionality is not required in ie6 i d just checked for it and then return from that function

977312

it would be fairly easy to extend the defaultnamingstrategy and override the columnname methods to stripes the first underscore if it is there

977326
textbox	button
how can i click a button in one form and update text in a textbox in another form

977328
callback	methods
i m not familiar with stephen celis s work but if tposchel s suggestion does not work it might be of some value to look at the inputqueue s values versus the outputqueue s audio values in debugging mode this is tricky though since the callback for these methods are realtime threads

977329
click	mouse
i would like to know which mouse button click on that button

977362

977404
python	c++
a lot of people recommend either c++ with sdl or python with pygame

977404
python	c++
i keep hearing that developement on c++ is fairly slow and developement time with python is fairly fast

977408
put	get
how can i get awk to put a blank line into my file every n lines

977410
any	set
however the second i use jquery or any direct javascript to set an image s src to the above url google passes back a error 400

977418
implements	extends
this doesn t look that clever but should work you can encapsulate this by extends .fn and implements function for your purpose

977420
32-bit	64bit
it will work when targetting 32-bit windows because there - so when you pass a 0 int you end up passing a null pointer - but it is not 64bit safe

977443
python	c++
i good c++ programmer can probably crank out the app much faster than an okay python programmer and visa versa

977446
python	java
is it possible to give priorities to python threads as it is in java

977446
python	java
synchronization - in java we use simply keyword synchorinized for a method object...what about python

977453
.when	ready
then .when i am ready to deploy i do either project build project or project build all depending on what i ve changed

977462
emacs	vim
emacs is more powerful than vim it s scripting engine is far more flexible and there are far more scripts modes and the likes built around emacs

977462
emacs	vim
maybe not productive in the same way - i d say vim is quicker for editing files emacs is better at doing everything else again i would personally say things like flymake-mode vcs bindings are such are quicker to use than the vim equivalent

977464
similarity	distance
then similarity is measured by hamming distance instead of cosine similarity like a search-engine would want to use

977478
connection-pooling	pool
the only valid reason i have seen is if you want tomcat to be able to use your connection pool for something like it s basic user authentication calls if you had it setup to do use a jdbc userauth context then you may want tomcat to have connection-pooling

977480
return-value	undefined
dcc warning w1035 return-value of function getrtfdescription might be undefined

977508
chi-squared	cdf
the meta.numerics library defines a large number of commonly used distrubtions normal lognormal exponential chi-squared etc. and has functions for computing the cdf distribution.leftprobability and the inverse cdf distribution.inverseleftprobability of each

observers	destroy
create class-level accessors in your jobscontroller then write an observers on the jobcategory class that makes the appropriate changes to the jobscontroller after save and destroy events

977521
xsd	xml
you ll probably want to add the following xsd to the xml file also

977540
ghostscript	imagemagick
i m calling ghostscript directly for the rasterization instead of using imagemagick because imagemagick delegates to ghostscript for pdf rasterization and i should be able to control the rasterization better by calling gs directly

977545
hide	show
you can pass other parameters to set additional options such as show hide toolbar zoom etc

977564
integer	numeric
count will always return a numeric value 0 or a positive integer so you will always have one row in your result set

977570
order	add
you can programmatically add a column to your datatable that acts as an index of the dt s original row order

977574
aggregate-functions	sum
when adding an aggregate-functions like sum avg min max count to a query you are asking the database to perform a grouping operation on a set of results

977577
frame	width
1 after changing the size of the frame by using the mouse and executing the drawframe methods a rectangle is drawn as intended but the frame expands a little after drawframe methods is executed more than the size it was changed using the mouse.this is because i suppose the width and the height obtained through frame.size include even the border size.so when mycanvas.setsize width height is executed mycanvas expands to size of the frame which include the border size also

977603
while-loop	loops
so your while-loops will loops zero times

977604
python	perl
python probably or perl

977604
python	perl
perl has a very nice lwp library for www in perl python has urllib2

977616
binary-tree	trie
create a binary-tree specifically a trie representing each key in your start set in the following way the root node is the empty word moving down the tree to the left append a 0 and moving down the right append a 1

977621
windows-xp	windows
are there recommended publishers to obtain from for clickonce signing for example someone who might already be in an windows-xp windows vista or windows 7 trusted root authority store

977629
click	mouse
as i said at the beginning nehe s class is generating a rotation matrix based on the mouse click and dragging

977637
rhino-mocks	moq
you may want to consider using a mocking framework such as rhino-mocks or moq which allow you to avoid using strings for your assertions

977638
python	c++
python is very easy to learn compared to c++ so you can be up to speed a lot quicker in doing basic programming tasks

977638
python	c++
c++ has a lot of power but has many ways to shoot yourself in the foot compared to python not saying that can t be done in python

977638
python	c++
python also interfaces very well with existing c c++ code through many numerous ways

977638
python	c++
that way if a new whizbang python module you created is really slow then you can soup it up in c c++ then wrap it up with python through ctypes boost python or swig

977638
pyserial	pygame
it has a great community behind it so if it s not in the standard-library there s a good chance someone out there has solved the problem pygame numpy scipy pyserial pywin etc. for you

977641
derived-class	base-class
the author of the derived-class can chose to use the default implementation provided by the base-class author instead of adding their own specialised implementation

977676
constructor	private
this is a more or less complicated design choice unless your class is a utility class in which case you should have only one private constructor

977691
arrays	loops
i want to loops through this arrays

977718
arrays	loops
just in case you wanted to know how to actually loops through an arrays

977727
google-chrome	firefox
is there a similar api for non ie browsers such as firefox or google-chrome

977734
radio-button	selected
if i set the virtual directory to a local directory selected the appropriate radio-button it has no permissions problems.

977775
dictionary	arrays
if you have an arrays of t you can generate multiple dictionary from this arrays by calling todictionary and feeding in different properties of t

977815
arrays	loops
i then loops through the resulting arrays of lines and process the information

977821
base-class	inherited
generally i would recommend you not to have inheritedance between different viewmodel classes but instead having them inherited directly from a common abstract base-class

977823
ironpython	ironruby
but what about ironpython and ironruby

977823
python	ruby
chris mentioned that f# learned a lot from ruby and python so i would think that f# has a similar relationship to ironruby ironpython and c# has to vb.net

977823
ironpython	ironruby
however a little googling around tells me that ironruby and ironpython are both built on the dlr but f# is not

977823
ironpython	ironruby
how are the relationships between f# ironruby and ironpython to be best understood

977839
ironpython	ironruby
f# and ironpython ironruby are lighting years apart from a language perspective

977839
ironpython	ironruby
ironruby ironpython are dynamically typed interpreter languages

977844
python	perl
perl or python are the obvious choices it depends what suits you best really at the end of the day

977844
python	perl
neither are that difficult but in general if you find that you prefer a flowing linguistic language that is really flexible perl would suit you better where as if you find you prefer a more rigid language with a more mathematical mindset especially in believing there is only one way to do something right then you d probably feel more at home in python

977844
python	perl
in certain areas one is faster than the other python generally excels at complex maths perl can generally process text quicker depends how you do it though

977850
inotifycollectionchanged	icollectionview
internal class listcollectionview icollectionview inotifycollectionchanged inotifypropertychanged ienumerable

977852
contains	elements
doing this was easy all i had to do was to make the searchform a session bean and re-use it when i generate the page that contains the details on the elements

977854
directx	gdi
use something a bit more controllable directx rather than gdi for rendering

977858
blender	maya
papervision will be the most popular lots of demos and tutorials around and this can be complemented with 3d collada models from other 3d tools like blender maya etc

977861
ironpython	ironruby
f# is in it s own category of functional-programming where as ironruby and ironpython are dynamic languages and c# vb oo languages

977864
export	report
the report in crystal look nicer and the exports are more powerful users want good export to word

977866
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
you could either count these timer events or you culd store an in your touchesbegan and then inspect that as your other events occur - touchesmoved that stays inside your rect or the timer

977874
margins	padding
is there anything in the xsl-fo spec that would allow me to specify let s say a default set of attributes margins padding etc. for all tables in the fo output

977875
fclose	fread
try getting the content of the file using fopen fread and fclose

977880
python	ruby
in many ways f# and ruby python are superficially similar

977880
python	ruby
however f# is actually very different from ruby and python since f# is a statically typed language while ruby and python are dynamically typed

977880
python	ruby
for ruby and python using a value at the wrong type will only generate errors at run-time

977880
python	ruby
itâ s certainly true that learning any of these languages well will lead you to think about problems differently than you do in c# or vb.net but your approach will probably vary a lot between f# and python ruby as well

977881
put	get
i can put in code in my build-process to get other files but by then it is too late

977885
python	ruby
i d say f# learned a whole lot more from ocaml than it did from ruby and python combined

977885
python	ruby
the only real comparison is that f# is brings ml to .net in the same way that ironpython ruby bring python ruby to .net

977914
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
so what you would need to to is create a new objectinputstream to match every objectoutputstream

977914
buffering	streaming
there is some internal buffering if that causes a problem you need to slice up the streaming before letting object in|out putstreaming at it

977924
ssas	ssis
i d like to ask your input on what the best practice is for handling null or empty data values when it pertains to data warehousing and ssis ssas

977927
derived-class	base-class
so declaring nonemptylist a friend of list makes the problem go away but it seems really strange to have to declare a derived-class as a friend of a base-class

977944
seam	jsf
i m developing an jsf web app on tomcat planning to use seam in the near future and i want to add compression of our web pages and resources javascript css files

977956
contains	elements
there are 2 elmah lines in the above block of xml that you will need to include and the section in general should contains most if not all of those elements anyway

977957
base-class	inherited
and i am not sure why you end up this class design by converting a java project if you inherited from a base-class your normally don t want to declare another instance of base-class as your member variables

977982
ostream	std
but you have already provided a std ostream operator for the list class so why dont you use it in nonemptylist

977983
getter	setter
how can i configure eclipse to generate getter and setter with some prefix for arguments variables

977998
expression	evaluation
is it possible to get visual-studio to do mathematical expression evaluation reduction

978000
having	select
you can do a simple select and understand the values without having to format the response further

978004
triggers	insert
we re going to try adding triggers to the old database tables to insert update delete records in the new tables of the new database

978013
subclassing	inherited
uiviewcontroller has a tabbaritem property which has an image property inherited from the uibaritem class uitabbaritem subclassing

978014
expression	evaluation
visual-studio by default will not do any mathematical expression evaluation reduction

978029
getter	setter
you can selected the variables s and right click source generate getter and setter

978034
dictionary	map
but it also works like a dictionary in that it uses a dictionary internally to map names keys to the appropriate index and provides an indexer for your key type

978042
debugging	trace
since one thread is managed code have you tried loading the sos debugging extension in windbg to get the managed stack trace

978060
daemons	systemd
note that if this might have a serious impact on any running daemons that assume that some disk spaces is available so it might still need to be done on a systemd with most daemons and such killed

978088
any	set
wildcard mapping is on so asp.net can process the extensionless files but is there any way to set these resources to be gzipped

978105
void	main
the jvm requires your application to have a public static void main string arguments in a public class so you must tell proguard not to change this name

978115
opengl-es	fps
the iphone opengl-es implementation likes 60 fps so set that timer interval to 1.0 60

978132
graphviz	doxygen
since i like to use doxygen for internal documentation anyway and it likes to draw call graphs and other figures with graphviz tool dot i started using dot to document my state machines

978140
hide	show
when the windows is show i haven t found a 100 fool-proof way of detecting when it no longer has focus i want to hide it again when this happens

978167
derived-class	base-class
if your derived-class doesn t have a message map entry for a particular message mfc will check the message map for the base-class

978181
webserver	host
i ve got a small wcf webservice working with the built-in wcf service host and with hosting by the visual-studio 2008 built-in development webserver

978186
button	popup
i m writing an xbap with a complex popup canvas z-index of 99 with a grid on it... that i would like to attach to the button that opens it and follow that button around wherever it goes on the screen

978186
button	popup
for example if the button is in a listbox or an xamdatagrid i would like the popup to follow the button as it scrolls through

978197
getter	setter
once all of that is saved you should be able to automatically generate setter as you have defined above using the generate getter and setter command

978198
arrays	map
by looping through the map arrays and calling the explore method on any non null elements i can construct an arrays of ident items centered in their areas and with sizes relative to their areas

978201
double	int
the int division probably needs to be coerced into a floating point one cast one of the numbers to a double - or use the notation 23.0 to indicate that you want a floating point division

978207
relational-database	schema
this is a coding horror relational-database schema should not be written like this

978207
double	int
in addition you can use a float double or real instead of a int

978210
concurrenthashmap	hashmap
by the way did you know that hashmap has a private class called keyiterator as do concurrenthashmap concurrentskiplistmap enummap identityhashmap treemap and weakhashmap

978210
key-value	key
edit in response to your comment be aware that if you are trying to iterate over all key-value pairs in a map there is a better way than iterating over the key and calling get for each

978217
hide	show
when i reference the web-controls as a component in the form of a .dll the intellisense hide the properties etc fine but when i reference the web-controls via project it show them

978222
average	min
probably there is an example to calculate min max median average from a huge data arrays but i am not capable to find it

978231
base-class	inherited
have you considered creating a new control base-class for your application that inherited from the user-controls object then the your custom user-controlss would be based off of that class instead of the user-controls

978244
macros	basic
this macros is a language independent solution for basic expressions + -

978252
debugging	trace
supports levels of logging ie debugging trace error

978252
configuration	logging
i know i can use the existing java logging solutions but they fail on at least two of the above namely clutter and configuration

978262
scala	java
most of scala s logging libraries have been some wrappers around a java logging framework slf4j log4j etc but as of march 2015 the surviving log libraries are all slf4j

978270
python	ruby
i m a dynamic language guy so any resources for ruby would be great or python

978271
contains	any
to eliminate recursion make a list of coordinates to explore and loop while it contains any items

978279
python	lua
there are also the possibility embed a scripting language such as lua or python which will give you even more power

978279
expression	evaluation
also boost.lambda will be of help here as it allows you to construct and store expression for later evaluation

978295
contains	any
also when i edit .resx files in visual-studio it gives me warnings if my resource keys contains any characters besides alphanumerics and underscores

978309
google-chrome	firefox
and of course it works fine in firefox google-chrome safari etc

978317
ubuntu	linux
i am running ubuntu linux 2.6.28-11-generic #42-ubuntu smp fri apr 17 01 57 59 utc 2009 i686 gnu linux and it seems that the command ulimit -t does not work properly

978324
conditional	operators
in a conditional operators statement in java are both the true and false arguments evaluated

978327
any	set
the best way seems to be to eat any arriving char while a specific flag is set

978340
queue	fifo
using a stack rather than a fifo queue improves locality a bit although it probably isn t going to make a huge difference here

978357
conditional	operators
since you wanted the spec here it is from â 15.25 conditional operators

978357
expression	evaluation
the operand expression not chosen is not evaluated for that particular evaluation of the conditional expression

978364
hide	show
p.s i am aware that once this is done the images are going to be jumping about but i will be doing hide show effects once this has been fixed

978366
json	xml
write an importer from some reasonable data format xml json etc. and import that into your core data context on first run then save the context to a persistent store

978377
filtering	sorting
the other problem i am encountering is that i will need to include sorting and paging parameters current page sort field direction in the filtering

978379
python	lua
you might consider using a scripting language like lua or python and embed it in your c++

978387
native-code	unmanaged
this link include a lot of helpful information including how to get an unmanaged memory block for passing the string to native-code that is presumably also secure a bcl class that uses it and links to a couple examples

978397
aggregate	grouping
flat file source -- aggregate grouping by columns you want unique -- flat file destination

978399
put	get
i put several logging statements in the function to try to determine how far it would get and every statement gets logged including one on the last line of the function

978408
json	xml
for example they could use jquery to call your web service and work with the data in json format an alternative data format that works well in javascript instead of xml

978410
abstract-class	subclassing
value is actually an abstract-class with inheritence.singletable and subclassing like numericalvalue and datevalue etc as well as in the abstract value class a manytoone basetype type

978410
value	field
currently there is one baseentity in the database that matches and i get it many times over with with the correct result for foo which it does contains but that same entity over and over again with many value in the bar field

978412
conditional	operators
btw this is not called a short circuit statement - it s the ternary or most correctly conditional operators

978435
properties-file	war
see this question for reading properties-file outside of the war file

978484
order	add
the unique key order is a good solution and you should add a partition strategy to your table too

978545
constructor	object
i wanted something that needed to be created a runtime not while wiring up object that also had parameters to it s constructor

978548
associations	model
i m working on a ruby-on-rails project in which i ve got a user model which has an associations of clock_periods joined to it having the following partial definition

978557
macros	vba
this tool also highly automates the translation change in macros vba code requirements between office 2003 and 2007 formats

978557
macros	vba
report.xls and is then examining any vba macros code for change requirements

978557
button	popup
the problem is that if the excel file code is dependent upon some external tool like an .ocx file and if that tool doesn t exist on the pc that i m performing this action on excel will popup a message that the object has not been found stopping the entire conversion process thousands of files in a row until someone comes along and manually clicks the appropriate button to close the dialogue box

978557
sendmessage	message
i figured that creating a small watching application in vb6 hey i m old and my skills are too could sit on the same pc and watch for these dialogue boxes and depending on the specific message click the appropriate button via the sendmessage api call

978557
key-value	key
the problem is that i haven t been able to get sendmessage to actually push the button for me i ve tried sending it the return key-value vbkeyreturn or even the space key vbkeyspace but the action never results in the dialogue box closing like it should

978570
triggers	insert
you can insert a break point that will triggers every time you have an exception-handling so basically create a break point for this go to breakpoints and create a new one - nsexception-handling raise

978590
web-services	webserver
consuming the web-services is more efficient because there are a lot more things you can do to scale your web-services and webserver via caching etc.

978590
json	xml
by consuming the middle layer you also have the options to change the returned data format you can decide to use json rather than xml

978600
export	report
is there a way of export and importing subscriptions to sharepoint-hosted reports that were created in sql-server report services

978600
export	report
is there a way automated - either by a custom tool or via sharepoint ssrs apis that i can export out the subscriptions before deleting the associated report and import back the subscriptions after the report has been redeployed

978602
click	mouse
if you re just using the button s click event then the only mouse button that will fire it is the primary mouse button

978616
javascript	dom
ie uses two separate engines to manage the dom and javascript

978616
javascript	dom
when javascript makes a call to create a dom element the javascript engine reaches across to the other to create it

978616
javascript	dom
if you attach javascript to an event on a dom element a link is created back from the dom side to javascript side

978619
hide	show
now you can add a tag to a button or link to hide and show the modal panels

978633
defined	declare
one advantage of this will be that you can then defined and declare your constants with const so that they won t change at run-time - whereas with the initialization functions of course the value have to be modifiable because they are calculated once

978644
directory	folder
for example if there is a sub folder named test it enumerates everything inside test but doesn t finish enumerating the files inside the original directory specified

978647
compact-framework	.net
i m writing a c# .net compact-framework application and would like to embed ads into it small banner on top of every screen

978648
smartgwt	wicket
just as a counterpoint to the poster above who mentioned troubles with wicket the smartclient forums forums.smartclient.com have reports of success integrating smartgwt with a wide variety of other technologies

978648
smartgwt	wicket
this poster s problems sound like 1 a gwt bug causing bad javascript and 2 css naming conflicts between smartgwt and wicket probably neither framework s fault

978656
python	ruby
not quite python or ruby but hey.

978658
put	get
if you put it at the start you ll get an error on reading beyond the beginning of the ram

978659
moss	wss
actually we are using wss not the moss 2007

978668
pointers	stack
for example kernighan and ritchie s book on c contains an example of a calculator implemented using yacc and lex and a stack symbol table function pointers passing basically dynamic binding and contains a large number of patterns for the size of the book

978700
any	set
since you re using a custom or third-party control i don t have any advice on how to set the property on the eventargs

978708
fadein	hide
it looks like hide and fadein are being applied to not the

978729
malloc	free
this is also an improvement over traditional memory-management malloc free or new delete which left it up to the operating system to manage any memory fragmentation

978731
fadein	hide
instead construct your item first and apply the hide fadein before adding it

978741
.when	ready
my current strategy is to fire off an asynchronous call beginexecutenonquery with each recording .when it s ready

978754
oracle	mysql
sql server for example allows you to append a for xml clause to the end of a query but oracle mysql and other db s will require different approaches

978799
javascript	dom
there are lots of examples out there of achieving certain things in javascript dom using jquery

978803
javascript	dom
the easiest way is to just learn how to do dom traversing and manipulation with the plain dom you would probably call this normal javascript

978803
javascript	dom
googling for javascript dom traversing manipulation should present you with plenty of helpful and some less helpful resources

978810
document	element
however since i m removing several element nodes i end up with a lot of extra whitespace in the final serialization document

978820
click	mouse
just thought i d point out that power mixer is capturing scroll wheel events on the whole taskbar while the mouse middle click operates just on the sys tray icon

978824
exception-handling	try-catch
i have read in an article that writing many try-catch exception-handling block in code will add performance overhead

978829
javascript	dom
jeremy keith s book dom scripting is a great intro to working with javascript and the dom

978843
quirks-mode	doctype
use a doctype or you ll throw browsers into quirks-mode

978845
radio-button	selected
the fist radio-button control in each grouping has to have the grouping style selected

978849
build-server	msbuild
i want to have our wix installer that is currently building on a build-server via hudson calling msbuild scripting to incorporate the full .net 3.5 sp1 installer executable

978849
build-server	msbuild
our build-server does not have a copy of visual-studio installed but just builds the project via msbuild

978852
object-reference	instances
but if i set it to a value in the viewmodel selectedindex binding selectedcustomerindex then it says object-reference not set to an instances of an object .

978854
webserver	security
i m not sure what you need the client certificate for but if you re using it for your own custom authentication or authorization you may want to consider using the webserver s security infrastructure instead of implementing your own

978860
graphviz	doxygen
from source code you can use doxygen and graphviz even if you don t already use doxygen to document your code

978860
graphviz	doxygen
with at t graphviz install doxygen will include call and caller graphs for most functions and methods

978860
pointers	stack
even without pre-filling stack and later walking it to look for footprints an interrupt could just sample the current value of stack pointers for each thread and keep a record of its greatest observed extent

978865
put	get
the only approach i ve thought of so far is to put a special row into the table model that always get sorted to the bottom

978867
attributes	properties
in silverlight it gives me the error invalid attributes value binding elementname whichnumber path selecteditem.content for properties text

978873
debugging	exit
for simple debugging put trace statements in the gotfocus lostfocus enter exit and activate deactivate events and see if any of these meet your needs consistently

978875
silverlight	wpf
silverlight doesn t support relative binding binding the attribute of one element to the value of another element s attribute value while wpf has full support for that kind of binding

978882
any	set
as far as treating static seperately you can set up your haproxy configuration to redirect any urls matching a pattern to another backend cluster

978899
required	checked
i then tried checked the required ssl in the iis7 ssl settings and had client certificates radio set to accept

978903
textbox	button
update i ve build a wpf app with no code behind just put in a textbox and a button and built it

978910
stdin	pipe
no it is not possible to pass in the exe via the command-line the closest you could come to would be to pipe it in but you would have to do a setmode on stdin to binary

978931
webforms	asp.net
ultimately this means one of our dev s have to go and modify some asp.net webforms to factor in the new field

978943
revision	svn
browsing the django svn respository i can find these files at revision 7966 but they are removed after this revision

978945
passenger	thin
also with workling you don t have to use starling as the queue it also uses amqp stuff but this is more easily integrated into an environment that uses eventmachine like thin or evented mongrel so if you are using passenger it s a bit more difficult

978975
subtract	add
if it is the end of the month add one day add one month subtract one day.

978977
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch exception-handling blocks are recommended in places where you want to catch potentially but rare failed or abnormal behavior such as reading a file or querying a database

978981
rollback	commit
commit each chunk separately instead of trying to rollback a 15mb file s worth

979001
firefox	safari
i tried loading the equivalent html javascript into both firefox and safari and it was fine

979008
google-chrome	safari
air is more like safari and google-chrome

979008
google-chrome	safari
air uses webkit and it s a bit behind safari and google-chrome in the webkit version

979019
contains	elements
i m trying to generate a dtd and i was wondering how to allow child elements to contains elements that have already been declared in the dtd

979028
oracle	mysql
if choice was between oracle mysql and external web service i would start with just using service

979049
union-all	union
but i think union-all is much more efficient than union

979058
json	xml
although performance aspects really vary a lot between language tool combinations in the end xml and json tend to have similar performance characteristics when using best tools of the platform

979075
order	join
in general i like to express my queries such that if the join are done in order the result set is kept as small as possible for as long as possible

979079
aggregate-functions	sum
you use an aggregate-functions such as avg or sum where no row has that value

979088
json	xml
why not move the application away from xml to a json

979097
contains	elements
the list will typically contains hundreds of thousands of elements

979130
environment	building
downside if you re not familiar with eclipse getting the building environment sorted out can be a real pain

979163
methods	extend
an alternative implementation to triptych s which is essentially the same as prototype s extend methods is

979176
search-engine	web-crawler
assuming that by robot you mean a web spider aka web-crawler the details of how it works are not going to be particularly useful to do search-engine optimization -- it follows links essentially not much more that s relevant to your purpose

979184
foundation	cocoa
i suggest checking out this technical note on developer.apple.com â link jumps to the section on cocoa s foundation framework

979188
iteration	set
yes it maintains an internal order so iteration over a set that isn t changing should always be the same

980259
pascal	basic
the question of use of pascal as a basic language is roughly the same as for c since they are nearly equivalent on a language level

980259
pascal	delphi
turbo pascal was one of the if not the main compilers of the dos era and delphi is still the second most sold ide in the world after visual-studio so i think the dead language and teaching language bits are a bit exaggerated

so this means you need to subclass nsbutton or whatever nstextview subclass you want to use and override resetcursorrects to call addcursorrect cursor for the entire view s bounds

981130
32-bit	64bit
while on many vms the size of a reference is the native pointer size 32-bit for a 32 bit jvm and 64bits for a 64bit jvm this isn t guaranteed - and in particular hotspot either does now or soon will support compressed oops which are 32 bit references in a 64bit jvm

981141
32-bit	64bit
generally on a 32-bit machine it is 32-bit and on a 64bit machine it is 64 bits

981141
32-bit	64bit
that is if you follow the 32-bit or 64bit pointer or more likely handle to the object you would find another pointer to a class instance that describes the type as well as the data fields of the object

firefox	opera
this works great in firefox ie 6 7 8 and opera but for some reason on safari windows and mac versions the add_endrequest ... does not always fire

981198
hide	show
this is a show stopper for me because not only does the processing request... message appear but i also put a transparent div on top of the entire page to prevent multiple click after submitting so the page becomes unusable unless you know how to hack the css to hide the transparent div

981213
arguments	default
per class i can change the run configuration - arguments - working directory to other but it s better if the default can be changed

981215
.net	wcf
in short...you can make a wcf service look almost identical to a .net 2.0 web service fairly easily but with a little work you can do a whole lot more

981422
decrement	increment
so you can t threadsafely increment or decrement a volatile so you can t use a volatile pointers for interation only store load assigment operations

981423
python	c++
this requires extensions to c careful use of new c++ features or in this case a special extension to the python language and vm

981469
http	ssl
in practice you could use http ssl tls to protect your saml message

981469
required	checked
but you would want to use two-way ssl-certificate verification validation meaning your client would need to verify the server s x.509 certificate and the server would need to be configure to perform client authentication which would required it to checked an x.509 certificate that the client presents

981477
logging	trace
some mission critical apps have to trace every step of every transaction. - this is information that i would be logging to the database as part of a transaction

981479

981499
contains	elements
containss text - matches elements which contains the given text

981504
methods	extend
i don t believe you can extend expression but i think you could add in a couple of your extension methods to create expression trees to simplify the generation

981509
variables	boolean
now if i trace through the init before i actually assign the variables checkthis shows as boolean

981535
put	get
this library differs from that built in to groovy however it looked very well written with some thought put into the kinds of things you want to mock and more importantly the error messages you would get when tests should fail

981535
constructor	object
i would say use constructor mocking with care - it could be a smell that you should inject a factory object but for some things it looked to work well

981548
png	gif
you can use every image format for icons that qt supports bmp gif jpg png tiff xpm ...

981551
windows-mobile	symbian
i have access to a bunch of phones but i would prefer symbian s60 or windows-mobile

981562

both java and vb can read and update data in sql-server oracle msmq mqseries and so on

981562

what i mean is you can use an xml document for integration whether it is stored in a database or sent over a rest interface or stored in a filesystems or put get on a queue

981565
document-ready	.when
i d guess that loading in the content after the page has finished loading .when the document-ready event fires for example would be a fairly safe way to do what you re talking about

firefox	safari
i am looking for something that will work in the 3 main browsers ie firefox safari

981650
display	width
i would choose a fixed width font to display the text and then insert a break after a fixed number of chars

981651
any	set
sure we can use the itemscontrol.itemcontainerstyle on an itemscontrol or any derived control to set a style for the contained elements

981658
updating	updates
so you can use a flag to indicate whether another processor is updating the memory contents of some block this to avoid a type of dirty read where part of the record is updates but not all

981659
xsd	xml
could it be something to do with the face that the xml is not valid when validated against the xsd file specified in the xml

981659
xsd	xml
for example the xsd specifies only male or female are valid for the gender element but in the xml it contains na

981659
xsd	xml
perhaps you could remove the reference to the xsd schema from the xml to see if that helps

981681
if-statement	loops
i was wondering if anyone knew of any plugins for visual studio 2008 that would allow me to fold if-statement loops and try catch statements

981704
http	ssl
i have a client program that talks to a webserver through a ssl connection http

981738

right click on the affected cell selected format cells then under category selected date and under type selected the type that looks something like this

981750
trojan	virus
if the man-in-the-middle actually sits on the client computer think of a virus trojan or other malware they can read modify anything going on over that connection

981790
base-class	accessor
you probably don t want to do that so instead you will need either to add public accessor or use the ones which are there already if any or else make them protected members of the base-class of types specified by typedef in the derived class or else have the derived class declare the base-class a friend

981790
base-class	inherited
if you want a public getvalue member function you can add it to the base-class and make the inherited public

981793
http	ssl
auth should be decoupled from uris and post data â there are cookies http auth and ssl client certificates

981796
methods	extend
another way would be to extend a bufferedreader in your own class overriding close methods to indicate if it was closed

981857
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox google-chrome and ie

981906
attributes	properties
if you set the attributes appropriately on the nsattributedstring that you set as the field s value properties it will display as the standard blue-with-underline and handle the cursor tracking for you

982035
hide	show
i can add some data that would make ie rendering the such as make it show a 1 pixels image which would enable the element in the dom but this would hide the fallback markup

982055
base-class	inherited
inherited may be an option to make it more elegant - factors out the shared properties into a base-class

982063
any	set
would you not be better to define a set of possible constants that you could then parsing for in your code and execute dynamically rather than just any bit of c# that you get passed

982064
google-chrome	firefox
paletted pngs with transparency are fine in ie6. most other browsers work correctly though including ie 7.0+ firefox safari google-chrome netscape opera epiphany konqueror.

982068
haxe	mxml
you might want to take a look at haxe a high level language that targets many platforms as avm1 avm2 php c++ ectc. and neko a server vm available as compiler target for haxe as well as haxe remoting you can simply compile your haxe net-code to an swc and stick to as3 mxml for the rest .

982079
firefox	safari
firefox and safari rendered them differently

982092
sortedlist	sorted
if you mean sorted list instead of sortedlist then it s trivial to sort your list via either list.sort or an appropriate orderby

982099
return-value	arguments
in the first case mycallback would be executed first and then its return-value would act as an arguments to get

982111
document	element
if i understand you correct you want to center the element vertically and horizontally based on the windows not the document

982111
document	element
and then positioning the element in the center of the windows not the document but the viewable windows

subtract	add
by using a compiler you can define variables loops add subtract multiply etc

982194

982230
compression	streaming
i have a bunch of data points from existing compression streaming but don t know the best way to analyze them

982230
buffering	streaming
the compressed data streaming doesn t store the uncompressed size so the decompressor has to alloc an initial buffering size and realloc if it overflows

selected	button
i m trying to get rid of the highlight that comes around of the selected button in a togglebuttonbar

982246
administration	account
check with the system administration and the sql administration to make sure the aspnet account has proper authentication to connect to the database if indeed your environment allows this account to connect

982246
authentication	impersonation
okay you are indeed using integratedsecurity so typically with this kind of setup using impersonation you need to make sure you are getting prompted to add your username and password to authentication against

982246
selected	button
we have a similar setup and to do this we have to go to the iis settings for the virtual directory selected the directory security tab and click the edit button under anonymous access and authentication control

982246
configuration	environment
i just found this post which may help you get the proper configuration setup to handle what you need based on your iis environment

982251
infinispan	hazelcast
edit we restart tests to help us decide between hazelcast and infinispan i ll accept an answer soon

982263
getter	setter
the only solution i ve found is to have aimpl hold a bimpl instead of a b and have the getter return bimpl and the setter recieve bimpl

982269
instances	private
are actually class clusters meaning an instances of the class may actually be one of several private classes

982274
sql-server	mysql
mysql express database has run out of room so i m migrating my heavy data from the old image blob columns to the new varbinary filestream columns in sql-server 2008

they re appropriate configuration file for the deployment target included in the install

982400
rollback	commit
i think i can do this via passing a connection around in a threadlocal variables and then having a servlet filtering handling the creation commit rollback of said connection

982406
browser-detection	safari
it has nothing to do with the pagerequestmanager s add_endrequest ... method and everything to do with browser-detection in the asp.net ajax client-side api for safari and webkit based browsers

982418
nsarray	plist
the correct way to save an nsarray by itself to a plist file is as follows

982437
richfaces	icefaces
go check out the component showcases of icefaces and richfaces two jsf ajax cable libraries

982437
richfaces	icefaces
my personal experience with both richfaces mixed better with other jsf libs icefaces has more advanced ajax capabilities like server sided push kinda like comet the basic ajax functionality is easier to set up and use but plays difficult sometimes when you mix it with other jsf libs

982438
background-color	transparency
if the fading in is a hard requirement you may be better off setting the background-color of your div to transparency and absolutely positioning your image element behind the div

982440
linqdatasource	gridview
what is the best way to still show column headings on a gridview that doesn t get any records when using linqdatasource

982446
keyboard	mouse
i was wondering if there was a way to write a program that could bind button on a gamepad to certain mouse keyboard inputs

982446
keyboard	mouse
for example moving an analog stick on the gamepad to move the mouse and clicking certain button on the gamepad pressing keyboard keys or mouse clicks

982451
document	element
this way the img element will stay invisible out of the document tree but background â hopefully cached at least most browsers will do so â will be shown in your div

982457
primitive	boolean
languages like c don t have built-in boolean primitive so some people prefer for

982470
for-loop	loops
to be precise any for-loops without anything between the semicolons will loops forever until terminated by some other means because it has no defined invariant

982486
joystick	mouse
for example in java you can use jinput to read the joystick and then use jawa.awt.robot to move the mouse

982486
joystick	mouse
you may want to use some movement controls such as a quadratic gradient to speedup slowdown the mouse movements the longer the joystick is pushed in one direction for instance

982496
textbox	button
i am using this to add a textbox and a button as a subview of label plabel

982496

982537
fireworks	photoshop
to get the exact look you want your best bet is to jump in flash fireworks photoshop etc and tweak a button skin to your liking

982547
unmanaged	c++-cli
if you have access to c++-cli you can often work around this more cleanly since it is easier to have parts of the code unmanaged working with the raw buffering and the parts that are managed just work with sub sections of it copying only what is absolutely required

982551
value	field
value field

982560
extends	super
if your dog extends animal you can create a constructor that takes an animal and initializer the super parent constructor

982562

request.form __eventtarget might do the trick it contains the id of any control other than a regular button button triggers normal postback that triggerss a postback

982569
versioning	upgrade
if you find a methods that works the developers will likely classify it as a bug in the future and break your code when you upgrade to the next versioning

982605
for-loop	loops
i d recommend using a regular for-loops with a termination flag in the loops invariant

982609
sql-server	ms-access
if you have data in ms-access which you want to move it to sql-server - you could use dts

982611

982658
32-bit	64bit

982658
32-bit	64bit
so in short it doesn t matter if you re running 32-bit or 64bit windows since the .net abstracts that away from the c# vb code

982658
32-bit	64bit
short of the really bad name that microsoft has given it it has nothing to do with 32-bit vs 64bit windows

982679
contains	set
then you can check whether the field contains the value you set

982679

yes theoretically speaking the form returns the special value empty not a zero-length string for an unchecked or nonexistent field

982709

when they view it they should be able to click on any control button textboxes even labels a little popup editor should appear by the control where they can then type in a tooltip helpid etc. for that control

982731
selected	button
so i m using an html select box with a list of countries and a button to open a small windows with more details for the selected item in the html select box

982746
debugging	trace
however instead of that expected output it s writing yo to the visual-studio output where one would see normal trace debugging messages

982747
submitchanges	datacontext
in your updateuser methods you are declaring a new datacontext so the bm_user paramter is not attached to it and that s why the submitchanges methods does nothing

982749

are you providing pear packages for public distribution thru pear pecl

982758
convention	standards
just make sure there is some standards convention enforced

982775
32-bit	16-bit
for these you could use 16-bit or 32-bit fixed point arithmetic but you might even discover that long is supported only rudimentary - and frequently div is very expensive

982790
subclassing	superclass
then i try starting a different selenium session b pointing to a different browser from the superclass subclassing

982796
any	set
collectionofchildren cannot set any of the private-members of child so how is it supposed to inform child that it was added to the collection

982799
build-process	ant
not sure if it s possible that way however i have heard of people using ant inside flex builder to build their projects which means you can run whatever scripts you want at whatever time in the build-process but that takes a little more work to configure

982802
attributes	properties
in the mapping you should be able use the create-type attributes to specify the concrete class that jibx should instantiate for bean properties that have an interface type

982802
constructor	object
jibx will call the no-arg constructor to create the b object

982809
bufferedimage	graphics2d
if you just want to draw on this image you can get a graphics2d context from your bufferedimage

982810
json	xml
i would add jackson json and jaxb xml

982810

the application is put into a war file with the grails prod war command scp d to the server to be deployed on and extracted with jar -xvf path to war

982889
.when	ready
i haven t tested this yet so be ready for an edit but i suspect because you re enabling the timer in the form1_activated event instead of .when the form initially loads

982905
getter	setter
later i realized that there is no need to access private data of the other class hence no need for nested classe if the property getter and setter are designed carefully to avoid infinite indirect recursions

982912
binary-tree	tree
i am somewhat familiar with tree like data structure and traversing a binary-tree using recursion

982919
value	field
i have to update a field with a value which is returned by a join of 3 tables

982928
python	java
please advice me simple java or python or scheme code preferably without- hash multi-threading delaunay traingulation fancy colors etc

982930
postorder	inorder
basically you got preorder inorder postorder and level-order

982930
children	nodes
however the principle remains the same except that instead of a left and a right child on a given nodes you now got 0 to many children

982930
children	nodes
using a stack you will traverse all of the children of your current nodes before going to the grand-children

982930
children	nodes
add all children of the current nodes to the queue or stack

982931
compatibility	deprecated
i know dbcc dbreindex has been deprecated but the application runs against a sql-server 2005 instance and the database is sql-server 2000 compatibility mode

982943
select	union
of course you shouldn t not use select either especially not in union this query would break the first time someone changed a table structure in one but not both of the tables in the union

982959
directory	folder
if the function comes across a folder in the directory then it will call it self

982971
mousedown	mouseup

so no stack pointers adjustment happens inside the loop just assigning 4 to variables

983000
linked-list	tree
after you have gotten good with linked-list try building a tree next and use recursion to walk the tree

983005
having	select
i don t have my xslt 1.0 book in front of me but i think the key here is that you can select node sets and set those equal to your parameter variables rather than having one-node-per-parameter

983013
html-input	textarea
is there a way to set the focus in a specific html-input a textarea control actually without using javascript

983048

i m wondering if there is any special security setting that prevents the hidden fields to post big amounts of data to a tomcat webserver

983127
arrays	loops
loopsing through an arrays to do work on it s members should - no matter how simple the loops is its quicker and easier to understand a code comment than it is to traverse the loops and make sure that it s not doing anything unexpected

983132
xcopy	cmd
the cmd you are looking for is called xcopy

983142
temporary	copy
i guess it should work to copy the original data from the surface into a temporary bitmap before drawing the rectangle and then draw the bitmap back in place

983149
textarea	textbox
the server can t tell the difference between a textarea and textbox

983153
eigen	boost
some c++ matrix math libraries include ublas from boost armadillo eigen it++ and newmat

983172
observers	listeners
the last is more useful if the user-interface never has to retrieve information from the game state but instead has the rendering changes sent via listeners or observers

983178
json	xml
the other option and what i would do is to use json instead of xml

983192
actionscript	mxml
i think this would be fairly easy in actionscript although i m not exactly sure how one would do it in mxml

983204
host	root
so .uk might be the root domain but you probably want to keep the host just before the .co.uk part

983213
selected	checkbox
now for each category i would like to be able to design decide which controls text selected checkbox radio etc. i want to ascribe to a category and i want also to be able to decide what values apply to that control

983224
perl	php
update there are c perl and php libraries that do this

983225
associations	model
permission is the associations model with note_id viewer_id viewer_type editor_id editor_type fields

983239
arrays	map
the short answer the built-in function arrayfun does exactly what your map function does for numeric arrays

983243
duplicates	contains
also a list can neither contains duplicates pairs 12 12 or 12 21 nor can it contains symmetric pairs 11

983243
combinations	permutation
does anyone know of an efficient way to count the total combinations of pairs of items without going through every permutation of choices and asking is this a valid selection

983246
contains	any
this is a very good question and at it s heart begs the question can any user make practical use of or business descisions from a screen contains 100 000 discrete points

983256
python	java
you don t need a hashtable or threads but you will need a priority queue usually implemented as a heap and available in both the java and python standard libraries and a tree which lets you do range queries in o log n the ones in the standard libraries aren t really suitable because you can t get at their internals

983305
interlocked	atomicity
if i use a series of interlocked operations are they considered to be a single atomicity operation

983318
for-loop	arrays
therefore an object literal is not an arrays and you can only access the properties using their explicit name or a for-loop using the in keyword

983320
order	add
if you loop over them with for variables foo in bar you will get them in some order but it may change in future especially if you add or remove other keys

i m not looking for a comparison of two struct that returns bool i am wondering if there is a way to get which field of two struct the same structure but maybe different value are different

983415
hide	show
i would also like to hide duplicates invoice dates so that just the first date for each invoice is show

983430
backgroundworker	winforms
the simplest technique for executing a background task in winforms is to use a backgroundworker

983431
value	field
in any case i would avoid having either null fact foreign keys or dimension field having even a single unknown dimension value will help your users define queries that include a catch-all grouping where the data quality isn t 100 and it never is

983458
contains	any
in other words any http request message is allowed to contains

983469
emacs	vim
free alternatives include emacs and vim ports for os x

983470
factors	primes
we can extend the product by more factors by selected a pair from each list and obtain a product of 2w primes if we have w lists

983500
value	field
you can break on an expression so by turning the field of interest into strings and concatenation them with || you should be able to put together an expression that lets you break on both of their value

983501
implements	extends
option two is extends textarea and implements required functionality there

983521
webforms	asp.net
that s cause asp.net mvc is not based on the website model that many asp.net webforms apps were

983543
extends	super
what is happening is the myejb interface had some methods in it that were being intercepted but that interface was extends another interface and the methods that were defined in the super interface were not being intercepted

983545
attributes	properties
you can add the following attributes to properties to prevent serialization

983555
lazy-loading	dto
from a subjective point of view i would say that entities should be complete by definitions considering lazy-loading and could completely or partially be loaded to dto s to optimized the amount of data sent to clients

983560
directory	folder
maybe i misunderstand the question but if your xml file is set to copy to output directory - copy if newer then you should be able to access it directly in the bin debugging folder

983561
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have a asp.net-mvc pattern in place where i have been developing winforms and webforms against

983563
firefox	opera
in firefox this should even be faster than looping but that s not true for all browsers opera

983566
selected	button
after re-reading your question i would go with two list boxes with button for adding and removing the selected items

983566
selected	checkbox
you can add a checkbox for each leaf node in a treeview and possibly a checkbox at the parent node which when checked selected all child nodes

983599
postgresql	mysql
in case you want to use mysql or postgresql a open source solution that works great with it is sphinx

983607
clique-problem	np-complete
as pointed out we have to prove that solving this problem can solve the clique-problem to show that this is np-complete

983622
javascript	dom
i m thinking of cases where people are generating os-type applications in javascript where the dom is really being pushed around and where exact layout and flawless event-handling is critical

983624
selected	cell
when i selected the cell the background color of the entire cell -- including the background color of the subview -- is changed to blue

983657
output	mode
however even in debugging mode my application will not stop on breakpoints or output to the console when i run it on my device

983661
json	xml
all three classes have the same #index and #show methods and only render in json or xml this is in fact true for all their crud methods they are identical in everything but name

983661
put	get
i can perform post create get index and put update on all three classes and get read used to work as well until i installed the has many polymorphs activerecord plugins and added to environment.rb

983666
msbuild	nant
if you are on the latest versions of vs then the solution files can be built with msbuild which is basically a nant equivalent

983671
postback	ajax
i would like to improve my user experience by making the buttons sort the divs using ajax jquery somehow so that there is no page postback and the user does not lose his her spot on the page

983686
tab-completion	tcsh
how can i hook into the tab-completion feature of tcsh to add additional file support for cvs svn and bitkeeper would all be useful

983688
associations	model
is there any way how i can get my associations generated other than by adding them to the model manually

983706
perl	c++
perl is great for many little tasks that java or c++ are too heavyweight for

983732
treeview	listview
the inner one has a treeview and a listview i would like them to expand and fit the width of the windows which i set by the windows and allow the user to change

983734
haskell	lisp
in that vein i d suggest languages like haskell prolog lisp erlang or self

983764
.when	ready
a process single-threaded that only performs nonblocking i o will be able to read or write from one file-descriptor that is ready for i o .when another is not ready

983765
similarity	distance
then all you need is a similarity matrix of your hamming distance

983770
jndi	jta
on the app-server declare a datasource with a jndi name and use it in your code to retrieve a connection do not make cx.commit cx.rollback or cx.setautocommit stuff it will interfere with jta

983771
python	java
i have been using php professionally for the last 3 years but i lean towards python java and c#

983782
inline-assembly	assembly
if an incremental rewrite in c is a feasible option one possible way to get started would be to turn all obvious functions into c functions whose bodies are -in the beginning- copied pasted from the assembly file so that you end up with c functions with lots of inline-assembly

983787
postback	ajax
using an updatepanel or a jquery ajax postback are the same thing essentially

983787
document-ready	.when
it will notice .when new dom elements are created and match them against your selector even after the document-ready

983805
fopen	fread
if you re using fopen like this you can use fread to read the file contents into a buffering char and pass it to your function that takes a char

983834
google-chrome	safari
how does one style a form input field of type file for safari google-chrome and other webkit-based browsers

983847
exponentiation	exponent
note that exponentiation is the easy part -- the hard part is the discrete log operation of finding the exponent

983853
value	field
as a background i m just trying to add user customizable field site wide field value

983858
input-field	textarea
otherwise all you have is a one-line input-field styled to look like a textarea

983872
tcsh	bash
on line 1673 begins cvs completion code - and this might be portable to csh if you are familiar with the differences between bash tcsh

983876
httpd.conf	.htaccess
the other option would be to use an apache redirect either in httpd.conf or a .htaccess file that redirects all image requests .gif| .jpg| .png|etc etc to your getimage.php script

983886
groovy	java
since you re proficient with java already i highly recommend learning groovy

983921
logfile	tail
it gives you a new logfile view that you can add word-based highlight and essentially tail any file such as the tomcat log

983948
document	element
if is used on a element then some browsers will pre-fetch the contents of the linked document see the mdc link prefetching faq

983968
ubuntu	debian
the script also had no issues running in the lte ubuntu environments after the required debian packages were installed

983981
any	set
are there any scenarios in which we want to set the datasource but not bind to it

983984
any	set
i don t know if this is the simplest but here s an example of using backwards continuations without any call to set

983987
order	add
from there you want add an order by clause to distinguish between rows but you don t want to actually sort the data

984010
protected	public
since the variables b is completely internal to class a and is not declared as public the default is protected the best way to know if b has been deallocated is to release it and set the pointers to nil

984038
contains	set
here is an example of a liquibase change set that contains the schema and the fixtures

984056
stderr	stdout
redirect stderr to stdout

984072
javascript	dom
for example in javascript you may need to dynamically get some piece of data like user info or settings into javascript but the rest of the script classes functions dom manipulations is static across all users

984092
buffering	streaming
flushing a file does not remove it from the disk cache it causes the content of the file streaming s buffering to be written to the file

984107
contains	elements
this is a serious issue because in this particular assignment the lists will contains circa 1.5m elements and thus a mistake like that can screw up memory usage

984118
methods	extend
in your case you directly extend nsobject but deeper inheritance trees create a chain of dealloc calls. in a general sense calling a parent s -dealloc methods first will release resources inherited from the parent

984125
keyboard	mouse
i want to test it using the mouse and using the keyboard

984143
constructor	object
i m working on a c# object copy constructor part of which involves copying the contents of a keyedcollection into a new keyedcollection

984143
required	checked
i m guessing that the problem is that each .add do required a uniqueness checked on the existing data even though i know it s coming from a source that guarantees uniqueness

984146
specifications	srs
begin to fill out software requirements specifications word templates srs

984162
synchronous	.when
if you are assuming relying on the close connection doing the commit it may not be synchronous ie the java may report the connection as closed .when it tells oracle to close the connection which means it may be before the the commit is completed by oracle

984177
ruby-on-rails	django
generally it is a bad idea to run everything especially media files through an app server dynamic parsing unless absolutely necessary same goes for .net ruby-on-rails django etc

984204
archive	backup
i have a directory that need to be archive with a sub directory that has a number of very large-files i do not need to backup

984204
directory	folder
i m beginning to think the only solution is to create a file with a list of files folder to be excluded then use rsync with to copy all the files to a tmp directory and then use tar to archive that directory

984210
value	field
i tried running your demo code code under myfaces 1.2.3 on tomcat and mojarra 2.0.0 beta on glassfish but was unable to reproduce the problem - the save methods printed the value i entered into the field

984212
bullet	physx
disclaimer i ve never used physx my professional experience is restricted to bullet newton and ode

984220
python	perl
use sed -i or perl -i instead of python

984230
checkbox	button
finally i should mention that the gridview is bound by a button on the page but i am not getting updates to the visible property whether i play with the checkbox before or after databinding

984260
while-loop	loops
in your while-loops the set countm etc come after in the text flow the first input but before the rest of the input which means you have to look back into the top of the loops to understand that it does something after the previous round in the loops

984262
linux	unix
if you are using unix or linux there is a file etc services which contains this mapping

984280
python	php
i would normally recommend python as a good next language but here in brisbane there are 10x as many job opportunites if you know php

984290
json	xml
the android already has a json builder parser built-in as does php5 so integration is trivial and a lot easier than using its xml socket counterparts

984302
low-level	hardware
which language provides flexibility simplicity and possibly a low-level interface to the hardware

984315
python	lua
the higher levels could be built with a combination of java or more ideally objective-c and scripting languages like python and ruby or lua

984324
python	c++
its focus is on combining the power and high performance of c and c++ with the programmer productivity of modern languages like ruby and python

984355
windows-xp	windows
i believe this is how windows-xp was built too unsure about windows vista and windows 7

984362
uitableview	uilabel
i m having trouble displaying a multi-line uilabel in a custom uitableview cell

984367
json	xml
if you re using json then you get a json object back not an xml object

984374
pascal	ada
ada is a structured statically typed imperative and object-oriented high-level computer programming language extended from pascal and other languages

984386
tcp-ip	udp
if you need reliable udp as in ordering or verification such that tcp-ip will give you take a look at rudp or reliable udp

984386
udp	tcp
sometimes you do need verification but a mixture of udp and tcp can be held up on the tcp reliability causing a bottleneck

984386
order	add
all rudp does is add a smaller portion of tcp-ip to validate and order certain messages but not all

984397
contains	any
the response text will contains a json string which would need to be converted to an object to be of any use

984399
postgresql	mysql
i recommend you look into foss databases like postgresql and mysql which don t limit you like this

984415
contains	set
lately i ve been getting this error after they browse to it using the folderbrowserdialog to set the location and the contains form is closed

984420
icmp	udp
the machine to which you re sending packets may reply with an icmp udp port unreachable message

984428
contains	set
i have a bunch of similar floated block elements inside a and i ve set overflow auto on the so that its height expands to properly contains all of the elements inside it

984428
any	set
is there any way using css and html only to set only the first floated element to the full height of the div

984428
contains	elements
just to be clear i want to grow the contains elements to the height of the container not the other way around

984428
hide	show
i wanted to leave open the ability to manipulate individual columns in javascript show them and hide them in response to user action with transition effects

984436
put	get
in your situation if your client get requests include application xml in the accept header then it is fine to respond with application xml regardless of any put request made on the requested resources

984442
callback	methods
the controllers methods can of course be called from elsewhere in your class - say from your timer callback

984443
display	height
you should also give your ul display block overflow hidden and height 100 as well

984458
jquery	dojo
also the other common frameworks for this would be prototype scriptaculous dojo mootools jquery

984467
value	field
for an updatepanel-free solution you can have the popup return a value to a text field and make that text field postback onchange

984471
contains	elements
as for what character encoding is contains whether a0 is a non-breaking space or an error that s negotiated by the accept-charset attributes on your elements and the response s well really a get or post request content-type header

984484
onchange	onfocus
i need some help finding a jquery plugins which will allow me to display an image preview from a selected list of images - onfocus onchange

984487
serialization	marshalling
now if you want to save the value of number_of_tr_calls_made you can do so in the same way you would with any other serialization ruby value via the marshalling library

984510
contains	elements
update scripting elements accessed via the dom already have a src property which contains the full url

984520
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
if you need your user-interface and the backgroundworker to communication over a lengthy duration of time i would recommend creating some kind of data transfer object that your user-interface can create drop in a queue and use manualresetevent or autoresetevent threading handles to communication between your user-interface thread and the backgroundworker

984531
python	ruby
high-level in python or ruby

984545
protected	public
in my experience it s best practice to keep the public methods final and call protected abstract-methods from the public methods like so

984553
buffering	streaming
any data that gets written to the streaming is automatically put in a 200 response with chunked encoding whenever you flush be it that you re in buffering mode or not

984554
put	get
i still get the wrong result though whether or not i put a leading in front of the index.php on the rewriterule

984559
button	popup
i want to use windowshouldclose in my nswindowcontroller subclass to popup a sheet asking if the user wants to save changes before closing with save cancel and don t save button

984575
exception-handling	try-catch
here we use the fact that smtplib.smtp server.login and server.sendmail all throw different exception-handling to flatten the tree of try-catch blocks

984575
exception-handling	try-catch
we could also use three sequential try-catch blocks returning false in the exception-handling conditions if there are overlapping exception-handling cases that need to be handled separately

984578
arguments	default
the arguments.merge default .merge arguments nonsense lets the arguments override the default but

984578
arguments	default
keeps any default behaviour for arguments say if or

984591
python	ruby
however any decent operating system should support lots of langauges on top from c all the way to python ruby and javascript

984597
copy-constructor	constructor
i think it is not valid because the constructor isn t always the only point of entry of the class i am talking about copy-constructor and operator .â so suppose you are using your class like this

984601
entity-framework	data-access
using ria services and entity-framework for data-access

984601
populate	row
silverlight 3 does not allow you to add a row to the grid and manually populate data

984603
stderr	stdout
if you truly don t need stdout or stderr from the program being timed this is a fine way to do this and should be as efficient as any other methods

984608
google-chrome	safari
2 is there a way to stop safari and google-chrome from highlighting focused form elements

984618
jar	war
if the jsps are part of a war that is part of an ear that is being deployed as a jar then i m not clear why your jsps are not being recompiled

984627
http	ssl
ssl sets up a private authenticated link to the server and then sends an http request over that link

984627
http	ssl
ssl its self has some unencrypted headers that it uses to establish this connection though these should not be confused with the headers that are part of the http protocol

984633
any	set
edit -- the solution i posted below probably applies to any server nginx apache anything else because this header is set in ruby-on-rails itself

984646
authentication	login
you could automatically generate a new public-key for each client programme and add that to your list of authentication keys for login

984650
linux	unix
you ll need to use a cron job under linux unix or a scheduled task under windows

984654
perl	php
if not you might look at using python perl or ruby or even bash scripts to do the work rather than the php script

984688
scheme	lisp
if you are not tied to the hardware then scheme or some other minimalist dialect of lisp probably fits the bill for doesn t impose what you don t want on your code but again it all depends so heavily on what exactly it is that you don t want

984694
perl	awk
the pattern has a trailing m which is significant for multi-line matches in perl but awk does not use perl-compatible regular expressions

984695
directory	folder
they re stored in the project folder the one that contains the nbproject directory as build.xml which in turn references build-impl.xml

984705
contains	any
if you want to do this in the general case where your list tags can contains any legal html markup then awk is the wrong tool

984705
contains	elements
for example let s assume you can guarantee that each list elements never occupies more than one line is always terminated with on the same line never containss any markup such as a list that containss a list then you can use awk to do this but you need to write a whole awk program that first finds lines that contains list elementss then uses other awk commands to find just the substring you are interested in

984714
s#arp-architecture	nhibernate
i m using s#arp-architecture asp.net-mvc and fluent nhibernate

984714
repository	entity
i could override the saveorupdate methods in my repository by always setting the lastupdate property to the current date and time but that does not seem to be correct because if there s nothing changed in my entity i don t think nhibernate will persist my object back to the db and forcing the setting of this property will always make it persist back

984733
perl	awk
don t really know awk how about perl instead

984733
perl	awk
- perl -n is awk nawk

984733
perl	awk
perl is largely a superset of awk so i never bothered to learn awk

984738
firefox	safari
i am looking for something like a list of controls and those that downlevel firefox and safari for example

984749
entity-framework	ado.net
project contact and projectcontact and there s a many-to-many relationship between project and contact table through the projectcontact table although projectcontact table has some extra columns other than project and contact table keys and that s why i get an extra entity called projectcontact if i use ado.net entity-framework s entity designer generated code

984749
gethashcode	equals
on the other hand projectcontact overrides equals and gethashcode etc

984761
output	mode
this code rigs standard output so it is in o_append mode and then invokes the command given by its arguments rather like nice runs a command after adjusting its nice-level or nohup runs a command after fixing things so it ignores sighup

984771
malloc	free
the second context is what you are talking about when you call malloc free

984774
restart	reload
after starting you can write the pid of the process to a lock file for stopping restart or reload later

984790
instances	self
normally you get an instances of yourself called self as the first arg

984792
nvidia	ati
since he uses an ati card and i use an nvidia one

984837
rewrite	rule
you d setup a rewrite rule for resource and use a 302 redirect to send people over to server two

984843
scala	java
as time passes we ll likely need books with scala patterns which can be very different from java patterns and anti-patterns coding tips advanced algorithms or topic-specific like concurrency or strategic programming

984845
oracle	mysql
what i like about mysql compared to oracle is how other fields not part of group by can be selected without using grouping functions

984867
installation	building
we have a peoplesoft installation and i am building a separate web application that needs to pull data from the peoplesoft database

984876
low-level	hardware
because c has the best combinations of speed low memory use low-level access to the hardware and popularity

984880
selected	button
note to write the code in form design view selected the command button

984880
.when	ready
.when ready to run the report open the report

984880
contains	set
i need to set up a large meta-report contains sub-reports on all of the tables - and using the same drop-down choose a county form i need to have that choice cascade down through all the subreports

984916
data-structures	linked-list
are linked-lists just outdated when compared to new modern data-structures or is there a need for a general generic linked-list

984920
hide	show
how can i hide the mainview when i pressed the button and show only the contents of the childview

984925
doubly-linked-list	linked-list
linked-list in java implemented as doubly-linked-list is o 1 for append and prepend but o n for retrieval

984925
prepend	offset
in my mind a data structure that satisfy the requirement above has 2 growable list inside one for prepend and one for append and also stores an offset to determine where to get the element during retrieval

984942
interpreter	runtime
it is interpreter by the browser and melded into the runtime with any other scripting

984958
perl	ruby
nor would i hire someone with lots of java perl ruby and database skills

984960
python	java
for example if i was looking for a ruby programmer i would favor a talented individual who knew c python and java but not ruby over an ok developer who knew ruby in and out

984962
python	c++
now i am wondering whether it is easier and better to do this project in c# c++ or python

984975
python	c++
if you can get away with python â in other words if you know it will run fine in python i would definitely chose it over c# c++

984975
python	c++
i m sure whatever 3d library you use is built in c or c++ anyway so interfacing with it with a high level language like python shouldn t cause a slowdown

984980
rar	zip
technically all you need is the .cs files but to make it easy on the person receiving this and assuming you are using visual-studio just take the entire visual-studio project directory should include a .sln file one or more .csproj files all the .cs files and any other assets and zip rar it

985021
arrays	loops
like making the loops in arrays of ruby the same as in c#

985035
keyboard	mouse
in a os x game calling this was recommended as the way to get keyboard and mouse events

985041
python	c++
personally i m a c++ and python guy and i would probably go with c++ because this sounds like a relatively intensive project and i do most of my best high level design in c++ great for building fast flexible code base while i tend to use python for things like django where there is less application logic but being able to tune the function look and feel quickly is very important

985041
python	c++
c# and c++ both do this easily but you ll have to be familiar with py2exe if you are planning on deploying a python program without a python interpreter

985049
dreamhost	bluehost
i ve checked with bluehost host monster and dreamhost and none of them support triggers

985050
xsd	xml
but in general if you can download the xml file and create an xsd file based off this there are several xsd generators out there you can then create a dataset object that will read the xml data into a datatable

985053
expression	evaluation
the c# optimizer can t really do too much given the short-circuiting rules for logical expression evaluation

985064
javascript	dom
xml libxml uses the same w3c dom that javascript does

985068
child-process	spawn
the shell spawn a child-process using execute and wait for it to complete then continues with its own executeution

985070
arrays	loops
you can loops through every stylesheet currently loaded and return an arrays of all the defined rules for any selector text you specify from tag names to class names or identifiers

985073
document	editing
or while you are printing out a document in a word processor you can still look at different pages and still do some editing with it

985082
least-squares	regression
i am not a numerical analyst but isn t the qr decomposition which you need to do ordinary least-squares linear regression also o n 3

985083
dialog	pop-up
after the file is created on the server how do i get the download dialog to pop-up so the user can download it

985101
32-bit	64bit
edit after some exploration i found that my f# project is being compiled to 64bit which does not work with the 32-bit xna dlls

985108
element	dynamic
so you could try to allocate a dynamic arrays of say 80 or 90 of maxint div sizeof arrays element - with the most probable result that the allocation of that memory block fails at runtime

985116
platform	anycpu
right click the project unload project then right click again and edit whatever.fsproj poke the xml to have x86 rather than x64 or anycpu as the platform value save and right click project and reload . various f# bugs in beta1 conspire to make the platform solutionconfiguration-experience less than optimal.

985118
expression-blend	designer
the extension works fine at runtime and also in the visual-studio designer but it fails in expression-blend

985119
attributes	properties
the attributes properties is a combination of attributess so you will need to combine the hidden attributes with whatever attributess the item already has got

985151
value	field
i am designing an entity class which has a field named documentyear which might have unsigned-integer value such as 1999 2006 etc

985151
primitive	int
use java.lang.integer instead of the primitive type int

985155
libxml2	lxml
i have install lxml which was built using a standalone version of libxml2

985155
libxml2	lxml
reason for this was that the lxml needed a later version of libxml2 than what was currently install

985155
libxml2	lxml
when i use the lxml module how do i tell it python where to find the correct version of the libxml2 shared library

985162
boolean	int
this flag being false would mean the year is unknown. this means you have to check one primitive boolean to know if you have a value and if you do check another primitive int

985172
primitive	int
you re going to have to either ditch the primitive type or use some arbitrary int value as your invalid year

985173
python	java
some client libraries with c python and java source are listed on the caldav web site

985177
value	field
i have an nstextfield and i need to get the field s value into a variables

985184
attributes	properties
the directoryinfo class exposes an attributes properties which is a flags enumeration on the fileattributes enumeration

985194
stdin	pipe
cpio takes the files to archive on stdin so if you ve already figured out the find command you want to use to selected the files the archive pipe it into cpio to create the tar file

985197
oracle	mysql
you might want to take a look at this page which describes the behavior of mysql oracle sql server and db2

985198
chown	sudo
he locked down sudo so it could only be used with a handful of commands ls chmod chown vi etc but i was able to use vim to get a root shell anyway

985207
double-quotes	single-quotes
1 try using single-quotes in place of double-quotes

985221
selected	textbox
or should i inherit from control in which case i think i d need to all the textbox stuff - selected text copy and paste the caret etc

985233
callback	methods
or supply the object with a methods to callback

985235
haskell	scala
popular in languages like scala and haskell this is like a container that has one or zero elements

985237
authentication	login
i ve seen a few desktop apps get around this by effectively embedding a browser into their program so they can just open the in-app browser windows to let you do the login and authentication

985241
if-statement	loops
move the if-statement out of the loops

985252
put	get
to put it another way pretend that all you get with asp.net is a snazzy server-side programming language and you re writing html in 1998

985258
configuration	installation
to avoid the configuration problems i would install xampp which installs php apache and mysql and configures it all as a working server installation

985260
python	c++
but python is certainly more productive than c++ in a given amount of time you will get more things done in python than in c++ unless you are a much better programmer in c++ than in python

985260
python	c++
also if there is a need to interact with scientific people who are not programmers python will be more readable than c++

985260
python	c++
i don t think it will be the case for imagery python as most high level languages has scalability problems when you need ten of thousand of objects with a lot of interactions - that s one of the few areas where using c++ for a project started from scratch still makes sense imho nowadays

985272
highlight	selected
this has been a bear to research because everyone talks about selected or highlight in other terms

985279
difference	count
of course non of this really makes much of a difference since you would have to be count your arrays and lists millions of times a second to feel a performance hit

985284
sniffing	traffic
sniffing the traffic would reveal the submission url and what variables needed to be passed in order to updates the score

985289
directory	folder
i sometimes use a sub domain ws.alexdrenea.eu service1 and sometimes just use a virtual directory on the main site alexdrenea.eu service1 with the svc being directly in that folder

985299
select	union
i suppose you could do a subquery with several select s combined with union s

985300
contains	any
in the old days almost any piece of serious software contains linked lists or tree

985301
methods	extend
i use to extend our friend arrays with this methods

985317
any	set
update if you re also experiencing this kind of issue note that there is another potential source of output messages which is any breakpoints with when hit set to print a message

985322
communication	messages
just as in the spoken language a good word-smith is the person who is responsible for communication the messages

985341
document	editing
a few minutes later but before user a saves his changes user b opens up the same document and starts editing

document	editing
i am writing a web application that has a user-interface for editing document

985384
value	field
i want to remove the duplicates records which has the same value in empid and empssn field

985389
onchange	onclick
the input has an onchange function and the div has an onclick function

985391
dbd	dbi
it s worth noting that if you re running a versioning of dbd mysql new enough 3.0008 on you can do the following and then everything s decode ed encode ed for you on the way out from in to dbi

985393
jquery	.post
ie the user selects option with value 123 when the form is returned from the .post to the controller the selected option is not re-selected via the jquery reload

985403
gtk	gdk
gtk gtkwidget.h 34 21 gdk gdk.h no such file or directory

985403
gtk	gdk
the gtk atk and gdk directory are all in the current working directory so how do i let cpp search in it

985405
value	field
update a field to a value and if that field already equals that value update it to a different value

985407
boolean	int
2 use a class to wrap the int and pair each int with a boolean that denotes if the value should be bolded or not

985424
servicecontract	datacontract
do you have different namespace for servicecontract datacontract servicebehavior etc

985448
installation	uninstall
if you get desperate i suppose you can run a repair on your excel installation or even uninstall reinstall excel

985474
click	mouse
do a mouse click

985493
launchd	daemons
your problem is not launchd the daemons it is writing it and communication with it from the webserver without needing root privileges

985493
launchd	daemons
a daemons can be as simple as a non interactive application launchd in the background

985495
attributes	properties
the xml attributes decorators define how the xmlserializer treats the properties its finds

985495
attributes	properties
we must pass our type within the xml attributes type properties for example

985525
pthreads	fork
i certainly don t know the details on this because i ve never done it it but the native nt api has a capability to fork a process the pthreads subsystem on windows needs this capability - i m not sure if the pthreads subsystem is even supported anymore

985526
textbox	button
i need to determine the textbox that has keyboard focus on click of a button outside the itemscontrol

985526
textbox	button
when i click the button the keyboard focus shifts to button instead of the textbox

985530
internet-explorer	firefox
this works fine in internet-explorer but it doesn t works well with firefox 3.0.10

985537
perl	php
on the server side php jsp asp.net perl and python would all be just fine for this application

985567
switching	screens
you can create two different vs windows layouts one normal one full screens and then create shortcuts to quickly switching between them as described by sara ford

985578
dsa	rsa
.net scp doesn t use passwords unless you re using the interactive mode it uses rsa or dsa keys

985578
put	get
at the point you use get or put those functions will return a true or false on success or failure

985585
shell	bash
i want the bash shell spawned by gnu screen to source in a file in addition to the .bashrc that it already runs

985585
put	get
i can t put a call to the file in .bashrc because on our site .bashrc files get regenerated automatically on login

985585
shell	bash
the shell bash is necessary so that programs like vim can launch sub-shells correctly

985593
command-line	cmd
if you have the sqlite database use the sqlite3 command-line program and these cmd

985626
controller	routes
what i have now is custom route that routes all old http request to one controller strangler controller and that controller will use curl to make new request transferring that request to old application this old code uses also .htaccess to do some rewrites... and fetching response that i send directly to user browser

985638
webforms	asp.net
in the march preview we are offering a asp domaindatasource control that enables very easy asp.net webforms access to your domain logic

985638
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity data model entity-framework as per building a data-driven expense app with silverlight 3

985647
buffering	streaming
if the receiving computer is processing the buffering bytes the sender will continue to streaming the bytes while the java io read call is being made

985652
required	checked
for instances subtract sqrt epsilon to the value and checked how much the change influences the final computation result and compare it with the required or desired precision

985654
bugzilla	mantis
you can try tracking or mantis because bugzilla is very unfriendly about reporting

985688
textbox	button
is there a way to generate the html from a database ie retreiving the html from a table and then catching the controls like button textbox etc from the code behind

985692
click	mouse
since all javascript in a browser executes on a single thread asynchronous events such as mouse click and timers are only run when there s been an opening in the execution

985694
uiimage	calayer
is there any way to set any color of uiimage or it calayer content as transparent color

985697
filtering	grouping
i v used sharepoint spgridview control in aspx page to display data as i would like it it s as simple as two column grid with no filtering grouping or whatsoever

985699
expression	evaluation
since boolean expression evaluation uses shortcut semantics you can move subexpression that are cheaper to calculate to the front

985699
expression	evaluation
note that due to the guarantee of left-to-right evaluation the optimizer doesn t have much freedom to modify the expression

985701
primitive	int
c# does support pointers but it s limited to pointing to primitive data types that are unmanaged types such as int floats enums and other pointer types plus the rest of the primitive

985717
postgresql	mysql
since bugzilla can be installed on your own server i presume the simplest way is to do that and play with the databases it creates bugzilla supports mysql postgresql and oracle as database servers

985725
environment	building
do you know of any tools preferrably command-line to automatically and losslessly optimize jpegs that i could integrate into our building environment

985742
sequences	unique
even better imo if your sql product supports common table expression ctes easier on the eye than using a subquery plus the same cte can be used multiple times this to create a sequences table of unique integers between 0 and 999 in sql-server 2005 and above

985745
sql-server	mysql
sql-server rand could be optimized by databases other than mysql resulting in the same random number for all rows which makes the result not random

985791
fusioncharts	anychart
none of the flash libraries i found anychart fusioncharts xml swf charts can combine multiple stacked charts

985821
highlight	cell
much to my frustration the cell doesn t highlight and i haven t figured out any way to make it work

985833
gethashcode	equals
alternatively you can override equals and gethashcode - always keep the two in sync to achieve the same thing

985876
stderr	stdout
is there an alternative to tee which captures stdout stderr of the command being executed and exits with the same exit status as the processed command

985885
scp	ssh
depending on where you are sending the file if the other end supports ssh it might be better to use tools like scp or ssh and rsync

985896
bash	zsh
assuming bash or zsh

985896
stderr	stdout
sequences of redirection and duplication of stderr onto stdout is significant

985900
build-server	msbuild
this works fine on developer pcs but when the solution is built on our tfs 2008 build-server under msbuild projectdir is either blank or points to an unrelated folder on the server

985923
code-documentation	stylecop
the way i ve used stylecop is to focus on using as many of the built-in rules as possible and where i really have a fundamental issue with a rule code-documentation for example i just turn it off

985926
rollback	commit
upon end of the request from the filtering s perspective make sure to catch exception-handling upon which you should log and set to rollback only and commit rollback close the transaction accordingly

985928
bison	yacc
while i m sure there are modules to add this sort of behaviour and perl 6 looks like it might be better in this regard you would do well to study lex and yacc or bison instead

985950
selected	button
from the properties dialog box selected the customize tab and then click the change icon button

985955
nested	order
a subquery nested view as you have it returns a dataset that you can then order in your calling query

985991
buildpath	libs
open the buildpath and go to the libs tab

986034
implements	extends
then when you define a visitor extends this abstract-class instead of implements the interface directly

986034
abstract-class	subclassing
when you add a new ishape subclassing then you fix the abstract-class to delegate to its visitdefault methods and every visitor that specified a default behavior gets that behavior for the new ishape

986038
subshell	bash
if you don t want to write a script and you want to run stuff in parallel bash supports the concepts of subshell and these can run in parallel

986038
stderr	stdout
you re not limited to stdout stderr but can assign new streams as required

986050
strtotime	mktime
you can do much more see date and mktime and strtotime

986075
dialog	pop-up
this will show a pop-up and the download dialog is shown

986075
dialog	pop-up
how can i avoid the pop-up and only the download dialog is on the screen

986078
entity	poco
when you use executesingle or executetypedlist you could be doing with a class that didnt have those properties i think the intention is that you are populating a poco and not necessarily an entity or other orm object

986085
children	nodes
denormalized means that every nodes will store the whole set of settings for its level and whenever you update a nodes it takes some time to go down the hierarchy and corect all the children nodess

986085
default	reset
that might be an overkill for your particular system though you can simply have a flag that a particular value was overriden or on the opposite reset to default .

986088
execute	prepare
i ended up needing something like this myself so i looked around and discovered that server-side prepare statements let you build and execute arbitrary sql statements from strings

986120
radio-button	selected
in jquery i want to get the value of the selected radio-button when any of these three are clicked

986124
msbuild	nant
as for reproducing the same build labels later - you already have to do the rebuild by calling msbuild nant by hand simply pass to it ccnetlabel set to appropriate value and you ll get the same assembly versions generated as with the build invoked from cruisecontrol.net msbuild nant

986130
radio-button	selected
when you click on any radio-button i believe it will end up selected so this is going to be called for the selected radio-button

986164
textbox	button
the idea is this when i have just one textbox and one submit button on my form then pressing enter while inside the textbox will just post the textbox es value

986164
textbox	button
when i have two textbox then hitting enter in any of them will also send the button and trigger the click event

986174
selected	cell
i have a customcell in which i have a label.now i want the text on the selected cell s label in the nextview s navigation bar

986180
ncover	fxcop
i am hoping for a tool or utility that i can analyze code at compile time or through reflection like fxcop stylecop or ncover

986182
forwarding	port
you could use some java http client or a tcp port forwardinger and forwarding all request coming to your server to the real tomcat server

986182
forwarding	port
so for example you programmatically create a forwarding to the tomcat server and when the user is allowed to pass through send it the forwarder s port number

986203
emacs	vim
a lot of people in the #python channel of freenode seem to prefer vim emacs nano and similar text editors in favor of ide s

986203
emacs	vim
my personal preffered editor is vim but if you ve mostly done .net development on windows presumably with the usual visual x ide s vim and emacs will probably cause you culture shock and you d be better of using an ide

986203
turbogears	django
turbogears 16 is the framework i know the least about but it seems to be mostly competition for django

986221
build-server	msbuild
we can build the solution without any problem using visual-studio also on the build-server however it fails with the above error when running msbuild

986226
radians	sin
sin radians lat

986226
radians	sin
sin radians . latitude.

986226
radians	cos
cos radians lat

986226
radians	cos
cos radians . latitude.

986226
radians	cos
cos radians lng - . longitude.

986259
updating	updates
the car s record can be updates paint job without affecting the versioning of the wheels no cascade updating

986283
divide-by-zero	infinity
one reason that nan and infinity value make more sense for floating point arithmetic is that operations could result divide-by-zero not only because the divisor is actually zero but because it s too small to be represented by the type

986283
factors	digits
a decimal number is a floating-point value that consists of a sign a numeric value where each digits in the value ranges from 0 to 9 and a scaling factors that indicates the position of a floating decimal point that separates the integral and fractional parts of the numeric value

986297
any	set
since the compile task works without any problem i know that the classpath is set up correctly

986304
exception-handling	try-catch
also you do not have to add extra try-catch block because this should be an exception-handling and be caught by your global error handler

986307
contains	set
well it depends on what os you are using if you use linux you can create simple scripting to do this it basicly should contains a sequence of commands to set this up

986313

987453
postgresql	mysql
is there any reason that you cannot use something like postgresql or mysql

987793
python	ruby
conversely python is much more popular than ruby for doing just about everything else and is beginning to compete with rails with solutions like django as well as the google app engine

987794
python	ruby
python in general is more mature than ruby ruby appeared in the englih-speking worlds only in this century but in terms of libraries one can only say it depends

put	get
why not just manually increment a breaks count tracking variables when you actually perform the addition of a new break instead of having the system go and count it or get rid of the counting in the loop since you re not updating the display anyways during this process and put the counting of page breaks in to its own code segment that runs through the content at the end of the whole formatting process when a final number of page breaks can easily be determined with a single call

before we write any code let s discuss the difference between attributes and properties

987974
attributes	properties
the browser then parsing the markup and creates dom objects of various types that contain properties initialized with the values of the attributes

987974
attributes	properties
on dom objects such as a simple htmlelement you almost always want to be working with its properties not its attributes collection

987974
attributes	properties
the current best practice is to avoid working with attributes unless they are custom or there is no equivalent properties to supplement it

987974
attributes	properties
you can read more about the difference between attributes and properties here or here

987974
javascript	dom
since title is a public property you can set it on any dom element that supports it with plain javascript

987980
webforms	asp.net
i use c# asp.net 2.0 webforms

987990
perl	php
as noted in the php documentation for pack the function is borrowed from perl s pack function

987990
perl	php
php s pack does not implement all the formats but perl s documentation for the function does a better job of providing examples and explaining each format

988011
checkbox	textbox
basically i want to do two way databinding of multiple controls textbox dropdownlist checkbox etc to a single instance of custom class entity ie person

988015
hide	show
if the list of options is not too big you could just rendering all the user-controls statically and use javascript jquery to show hide the appropriate controls based on the value of the dropdown onchange javascript event

988022
webforms	asp.net
my asp.net webforms has a place holder on it and user controls are dynamically added to it

988024
traversal	parent
i thought about adding to the page.php templates and telling the page to find its parent top-level page to determine which family it s in then set the header graphic that way...but i don t want to invest a ton of time and run-time resources traversal up the hierarchy

988026
value	field
i basically just need to receive an event any time the field s value changes

988031
subtract	add
if using strings just create string versions of add subtract and multiply not too hard

988046
spring	grails
setup grails 1.1 acegi spring security plug-in

988046
http	ssl
i hunted through this page about securityconfig to see if there is an option to allow cookies created over ssl to be read over unencrypted http but i found nothing

988048
value	field
properties can easily implement that because the setter is a methods while field by design don t have setter methodss their value is just modified and that can happen from any place in the code

988065
value	field
as indicated in the other answers with the limited information you provided i would suggest you make any value assignments via the field s accessor

988067
comma	words
because you have transposed data you may want to normalize it a bit remove all comma and the sort resulting words by first letter

988074
multiplication	mod
power is just repeated multiplication and mod is related to division

988074
multiplication	mod
we know that multiplication and division are inverses so through that connection i would assume there s a correlation between power and mod

988114
iteration	set
how do i set up these iteration things

988116
contains	set
in that case i usually set up an images source contains the latest psd files

988121
sqrt	exp
much of this time can go into math function-calls such as exp log and sqrt

988126
environment	building
the webservice was building with visual-studio 2008 and works locally just not in this environment

988132
uiresponder	uiview
since uitextview inherits from uiresponder indirectly it actually inherits from uiscrollview which inherits from uiview which then inherits from uiresponder you can call the -becomefirstresponder methods on your text field which will cause it to become the first responder and begin editing

988134
append	input
this prevents an attacker from modifying or append their own nefarious input to user requests or modifying the results produced by the server

988137
webforms	asp.net
asp.net will render some webforms tags different based on the requesting browser

988146
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
i can think of several techniques to make the uitextview become the first-responder but the easiest is probably in your view controllers s viewwillappear or viewdidappear methods

988202
implements	extends
there is an application django-simple-history which implements and extends this approach docs here

988203
rollback	commit
the locks will not be released until a commit or rollback is issued either within the procedure itself or from the application that called the procedure

988212
having	select
as a rule you should probably avoid having one sproc do both an insert and a select the exception is if the select is to get the newly created row s identity

988219
transformation	dimension
2 created transformation to check if a value is null and if so convert to either -1 unknown record in dimension or if it s a measure value convert to 0

988244
python	java
we want to be able to access this web service similar to how you d access an api such as google data etc. where you have client libraries in several languages .net java python etc

988292
hide	show
you can use user.identity.isauthenticated to check if the user is logged in and show hide the login button based on that

988302
user-interface	flicker
and i wonder about the wisdom of hide show i expect this to just make the user-interface flicker

988320
web-services	api
these classes would maintain the state of the program utilizing the api and would take care of all the low level plumbing work interacting with the web-services by exposing a verbose object model that is easy enough for the user of your wrapper to get around in

988320
python	java
java python etc

988320
.net	wcf
i suggest using wcf though as you can use tcp for the .net library and standard web services for the other languages

988337
mips	x86
i need to run an nfsclient on a mips target machine and nfsserver on an x86 machine

988354
getter	setter
if however you want to add content to the fileobject and not mere attributes you will have to do it the normal java-way of using the inputstream and outputstream of the fileobject both have a getter and setter and remember to close the streams accordingly

988355
spaces	output
this can be accomplished by adding a spaces which will show up in the output or by including a percent sign before the single letter like this

988357
put	get
one way would be to put a dummy file in that folder dummy.txt and do an http get of the file

988362
localization	translation
the only catch here is that if you want to assign the localization to a global variables you have to run it async false otherwise you won t have the translation available when you need them

988366
pascal	ada
such as pascal and ada perform much

988366
pascal	ada
ada and pascal

988366
pascal	ada
such as subsets of ada pascal and

988400
instances	private
you want the collection to have an iterator methods that returns an instances of a private iterator class as needed

988407
ssas	olap
i m creating a data mart in sql-server 2008 using ssis for load and ssas for an olap cube

988408
expression	brackets
a postfix expression followed by an expression in square brackets is a subscripted

988409
updating	updates
while updating is o k with k being the branching level because we only updates one layer down

988440
default	reset
i can reset the value of the textbox easily but the sliderextenders will not reset to their default positioning or their actual value.

988444
malloc	free
is there a significant performance hit from using malloc and free such that i should use something static like instead of a dynamic

988444
fclose	fopen
this reduces many thousands of fopen and fclose operations to roughly 24

988445
contains	any
it is wery close to the system architecture and does not contains any extra features that we want to control how they exactly work

988445
linux	unix
the most popular operating system nowadays are written in c windows linux and many other unix clones however this is not the rule

988449
web-config	app-config
in the case of configuration i have a bare bones configuration class that exposes the various properties that i have housed my app-config or web-config

988452
low-level	hardware
c is also a language that teaches a lot about memory-management and is low-level enough to show the barrier between hardware and software

988460
margins	padding
in firefox and ie8 this isn t a problem but in ie6 and ie7 i can t seem to reduce the padding margins on radio button to anything reasonable 0px or 1px

988460
margins	padding
in the include images you can see that the red background is huge on ie6 ie7 even with css padding and margins both set to 0px yet in firefox ie8 it is fine

988462
detect	move
whenever you detect an obvious failure case move i1 and i2 to the next block on appropriate recs of course

988465
where-clause	sql
if it is table-per-hierarchy you can use this approach write a sql where-clause for a criteria query and then use a case statement

988467
show	next
i have a control that inherited from treeview system.windows.controls.treeview from wpf framework and it implements a gridviewcolumncollection to show columns next to the tree

988468
managed-code	c++-cli
there is an easy way to reference managed-code from c++ and that is by making a managed c++ project aka c++-cli choosing from clr section in the c++ project wizard in visual-studio

988480
any	set
you can use fseek pos seek_set to set the file pointer to any positioning in the file or fseek offset seek_cur to do a relative move

988505
malloc	free
worrying about malloc free performance before profiling indicates that it is a bottleneck is premature optimization

988505
fseek	ftell
and yes you can use ftell to get the current positioning in a file then fseek with seek_set to get to that

988506
tcp-ip	tcp
the established means the tcp connection is established ie the handshake has been performed on tcp-ip level

988506
any	set
theoretically the connection could be quite long in established mode without sending any data depending on the timeouts set on tcp level and or sshd configuration

988526
javascript	dom
it allows javascript debugging dom inspection html editing in real-time and a whole lot more

988545
javascript	dom
i have an xml db and i have been able to parse the xml using dom with javascript

988547
continuous-integration	teamcity
at this point i m not willing to change to a non-free continuous-integration package like teamcity

988558
javascript	dom
it is not possible with dom and javascript on web browser so you should use ajax or sth similar to process xml

988571
oracle	mysql
and then i abstract out all my sql queries so that i can build the entire project for mysql oracle mssql or anything else

988576
performselector	delegation
then you can use delegation performselector okbuttonaction

988580
ndepend	ncover
run my unit tests reset a database deploy some code send out some email do some code analysis ndepend and ncover are great

988587
javascript	dom
you cannot write to xml with javascript only load a copy of the xml dom into memory and manipulate that copy

988587
instances	destroy
obviously that is destroy when the javascript instances restarts reloading the page or you re-load from the original file

988587
ruby	php
if the xml is on the server you will need a server-side language such as php asp.net ruby on rails etc

988588
unsigned-integer	int
i was reading the c standard the other day and noticed that unlike signed int overflow which is undefined unsigned-int overflow is well defined

988596
any	set
you can for example set the interpolationmode property to nearestneighbor to keep it from doing any interpolation

988598
rewrite	rule
what you probably want is a single rewrite rule to handle every unknown request that comes in and then pass that to a small scripting that will handle the lookup generate redirects

988598
rewrite	rule
you could even skip the rewrite rule completely and use the apache errordocument directive to pass unknown urls into the scripting

988606
version-control	git
we have our silverlight project with mssql database in git version-control

988611
multiplying	exponent
floating point multiplication consists of re-adding the hidden 1 to both mantissas multiplying the two mantissa subtract the offset from the two exponent and then adding th two exponent together

988625
icollection	ienumerable
the key point of that article is to bind the collectionviewsource to an ilist implementation rather than a weaker icollection or ienumerable interface

988649
32-bit	64bit
we are running windows-xp pro service pack 3 both 32-bit and 64bit

988650
sorted	lookup
since the type1s are sorted too you can do each lookup with a linear or binary-search starting from the result of the previous search

988650
sorted	lookup
or just to work with what you ve got by writing a lookup that ignores the type1 entries when searching through the type2s which are already sorted as required

988659
defined	declare
the issue then though is that is says the function that i declare within the click is not defined

988668
.when	ready
then .when i am ready to check in i do a diff between the last versioning of my database and the current one i am working on

988694
profiling	debugging
as client-side libraries become more and more robust and more responsibility is placed client-side in general this type of debugging and profiling will only become more useful

988703
button	popup
an update button checks for certain constraints and if met a modal popup is shown

988703
button	popup
the button the javascript is meant for is located in a panel displayed by this modal popup

988706
order	add
if you add a timestamp field to an attached table re-attach the table in order to inform microsoft access of the new field.

988712
any	set
as you can understand cookies should be set before any output is send to the browser

988718
continuous-integration	teamcity
we use continuous-integration via teamcity

988732
iteration	set
when you set up the getrowclass function properly the grid takes care of calling it for you automatically when it needs to and it should just work. there should be no need for your iteration code as written which just adds extra overhead

988735
oracle	mysql
but possible if your data-source is mysql oracle etc.

988737
derived-class	base-class
currently i am including an xmlinclude of a derived-class in the base-class like so

988758
postgresql	mysql
afaik ms access is a database and you can connect to it through odbc etc but it is not a database server in the way sqlserver mysql postgresql or oracle are database servers

988768
silverlight	wpf
it s geared specifically towards this including using mvvm for wpf silverlight in large scale applications and how to handle business logic concerns etc

988771
getter	setter
define getter and setter to interface with your struct and maintain a modified flag

988794
windows-xp	windows
i m trying to create a test module for one of our usb devices and i m using windows-xp with the windows 2003 ddk

988816
dictionary	arrays
i think a dictionary or an arrays of dictionaries makes sense here

988831
put	get
then your lques action can just get what lques records you need and do a options_for_select and it should just put what comes back from the server as

988851
safari	opera
ps opera safari

988866
selected	cells
excel actually selected the cells as your code is running making the code run slower as you ve noticed

988866
selected	cells
dim a range for tracking dim rngcurrentcell as range and use that instead of the selected the cells

988871
lookup	any
do not forget static data lookup lists etc so you do not need to copy any data between environments

988871
versioning	upgrade
store alter scriptinging 1 big scripting or directory of scriptinging named liked 001_alterxxx.sql so that running them in natural sort order will upgrade from versioning a to b

988871
versioning	upgrade
tested with daily build from scratch and compare the results to the incremental upgrade from versioning a to b using alter

988878
any	set
if it is set to 2 any exception-handling will cause it

988890
web-inspector	inspector
anothter thing where web-inspector can t compete just yet is when it comes to inspector dom-elements and changing styles on the fly

988898
server-side-includes	include
this is a very dated solution most web hosts will support server-side-includes or you could use php to include your files

988907
communication	messages
even if you d use existent helper classes you d have to implements your own messages parsing including error-handling etc. and thus lose transport transparency would require more effort to switching to other protocols formats unless you implements a communication infrastructure similar to wcf s

988921
constructor	private
you could add a parameter to your constructor that is a textbox and save the reference in the class as a private variables and call that in each method

988964
json.net	wcf
as for handling the json angle check out json.net if you don t want to use the baked-in wcf scripting stuff

988991
inherited	subclass
if your subclass does not follow the liskov substituion principle it shouldn t be a subclass an inherited relationship is not appropriate and you should choose some other design

988991
superclass	subclass
you can always invoke the superclass methods implementations with from within your subclass

988993
web-deployment	web
with visual-studio publish cruisecontrol.net msbuild aspnet_compiler.exe and web-deployment projects out there how would one know which tool to use to ultimately get a .net 2.0 web application into a testing production environment

988993
put	get
now i m reading about how important it is to put some good thought into 2.0 deployment and the the more i read the more i get confused

989014
user-controls	ascx
however one thing i forgot to mention here is that all this code sits inside the user-controls ascx file and ispostback property applies to the page not the control which is useless in my case

989015
administration	account
he only knew one username and password and that user account had no administration rights

989015
administration	account
but it was enough information for him to crack that security within an hour read the information about the administration account and then use that information to just do whatever he liked

989036
mouseleave	mouseenter
i m using the mouseenter mouseleave event to fadein fadeout respectively

989036
hide	show
however my problem is since it s a calendar there will be many days and when i m moving my mouse across the whole week the fadein fadeout or show hide will all happen in sequence until all events are completed.

989088
webforms	asp.net
one thing i did not mention to you is that i am using the default webforms view engine with asp.net mvc

989091
python	java
java python c++ apis

989093
any	set
vertical splitting into multiple windows and using vertical resize 80 possibly with to allow breaks on any character on one of them sort of works even though it s a bit hackish but breaks when using set number as the line numbers take up a variables number of columns depending on the file length and these are part of the 80

989129
shell	bash
i want to create a popup windows using wxpython that acts like a bash shell

989129
shell	bash
shell but that looks like it creates a python shell and i want one to run bash commands instead

989131
buildpath	libs
each set of jar files is set up as a eclipse project named appropriately after the jar set added to the buildpath source jars and javadoc jars correctly set on each jar in the buildpath and each project then includes those libs projects needed for that project

989146
asp.net-mvc	webforms
note i am working with webforms and cannot use asp.net-mvc to solve this problem

989156
splitter	panels
so you ll either need to put the image somewhere else a panels docked to the left separated by a splitter from the mdi client area or not put the image on child forms

989158
administration	host
of course if a malicious administration were to hijack the phrase-less key and use it he or she could also access the user account on the db host and could then do any operations the os authentication db user could

989185
value	field
it might be possible if the variables is a field of a class by passing a fieldinfo instead of the actual value or when the variables is passed byref

989188
treeview	listview
this should do it - i set it up so that the treeview and the listview shared the main view 50 50

989208
facebook-apps	facebook
many of the tutorials talk about facebook-apps and how you have to go to facebook and create an app from there and set all of these settings for page redirects and such

989209
configuration	installation
over the course of a project that 30 seconds is insignificant but it means i have a project that can be checked out of source control and just works without requiring any custom eclipse configuration or maven installation or user-specific setup

989209
jar	war
how did that jar file end up in my war file

989216
command-prompt	cmd
look into the sqlmetal utility found by opening up a visual-studio cmd-prompt and typing the cmd in

989221
contains	any
according to my copy of professional vb 2005 wrox in vb.net an mdi parent can contains any control that a regular form can contains

989228
order	add
in order for me to read version 0 xml file to construct version 1 class a i will have to add the following methods in version 1 class a

989229
keyboard	mouse
in bc we install keyboard and mouse hooks setwindowshookex with wh_keyboard or wh_mouse and hide it on key up and mouse button events

989250
environment	building
in the deployment environment there will be jars created and the maven building can pull the latest jars from the repository

989252
appdata	temp
c users me appdata local temp temporary

989252
appdata	temp
c users me appdata local temp temporary

989276
syntax-error	syntax
syntax-error invalid syntax

989295
contains	set
one possible difference is the initial working directory if you drag a file onto the executable the initial working directory is set to the directory contains the executable whereas if you double click the file the initial working directory is set to some default value independent of where the file or executable is located

989296
http	ssl
ssl settings in conjunction with http

989319
windows-live	hotmail
i am planning to build a site with openid authentication most of my target users will register in the site using microsoft account hotmail live windows-live

989338
constructor	object
i d like to modify the getfeatures function to only return the features added by constructor of object type i instantiated

989340
callback	methods
i m calling off asynchronously to a web service amazon web-services from a silverlight app and my callback methods is never actually triggers after i start the asynchronous call

989340
any	set
i ve set up another web service proxy in a console app and i m able to make a synchronous call and get a response using the same arguments without any issues

989346
foundation	cocoa
are the techniques demonstrated in cflocalserver still state-of-the-art or is there a way to implement unix domain sockets in objective-c with cocoa foundation

989357
double-quotes	single-quotes
although you ll either have to escape a lot of double-quotes or not be able to use single-quotes

989360
default-value	arguments
he is setting a default-value for disks so if you instantiate the class without an arguments disks will be set to 1

989366
directory	folder
to coolapp â s and the othersâ directory is because of the hassle of trying to merge the updates from each copy back to the main copy in the h folder

989366
visualsvn	collabnet
oh and i currently have subversion set up with my apache server as well as visualsvn svnserve and collabnet svn server install

989380
json	csv
you could also use csv comma separated values json javascript object notation and there are even cross platform binary formats like hessian

989383
realloc	malloc
i am writing a small library for a larger project which supplies malloc realloc free wrapper-functions as well as a function which can tell you whether or not its parameter of type corresponds to live not yet freed memory allocated and managed by the library s wrapper-functions

989384
keyboard	mouse
if i open the dropdown and selected an option with my mouse or keyboard and hit enter the dropdown box closes and the itemindex property is changed before the keypress event handler is fired

989403
licensing	gpl
it s actually a c library but if the gpl licensing terms work for you try

989410
attributes	properties
if it s a short list of predetermined values like yes no maybe so then properties attributes might do the trick

989410
attributes	properties
we decorated our entity classes and properties with attributes that contained some predetermined pointers to the lookup value methods and their relationships

989411
togglebutton	expander
looking at the expander through mole or looking at it s controltemplate generated by blend we can see that the header part that is responding to space enter click etc is really a togglebutton

989411
togglebutton	expander
now the bad news because the header s togglebutton has a diffrent layout for the expander s expanded properties up down left right it s already has styles assigned to it through the expander s controltemplate

989411
togglebutton	expander
that precludes us from doing something simple like creating a default togglebutton style in the expander s resources

989411
togglebutton	expander
if you have access to the code behind or don t mind adding a codebehind to the resource dictionary that the expander is in then you can access the togglebutton and set the tabindex in the expander.loaded event like this

989425
callback	methods
can you confirm that you are running this in a callback when the call to the webservice is guaranteed done and not some timed methods using settimeout

989439
keyboard	mouse
i m using synergy to control both a desktop and a laptop with a single set of mouse keyboard

989451
forwarding	port
if you have ssh access to the machine you should be able to use ssh port forwarding to accomplish this

989451
forwarding	port
i m assuming you re using windows based on the c# tag so you can use putty as explained here using port forwarding with putty

989451
forwarding	port
just follow those instructions to forwarding the desired port on localhost to the server that serves the wsdl

989462
value	field
initially start the field value at 0

989462
value	field
every time a vote comes in increment the appropriate field value

989469
derived-class	base-class
if you want to keep your current hierarchy properties just create an instance of the base-class and subtract the features in the base-class from the features in the derived-class

989490
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you could just add both the uinavigationcontroller and a uitabbarcontroller to the app delegate

989500
instance-variables	ivar
considering the question when to use direct assignment to an instance-variables as in the case of windows ivar and when to use a setter methods as in the case of controllers ivar it is mostly a question of style but you better be consistent

989522
contains	any
the piece objects would contains the name of the piece graphics they were attached to in a string but wouldn t have any graphics information in them

989537
polymorphism	override
in your base class create a virtual methods that returns features in your decenent classes override the property polymorphism allows your variables as type basicmodel as long as they were constructed as the descendant type to return the correct list

989542
switching	router
in this case i would want router engine to switching to text-editor and bubble same command there to

989552
keydown	keyup
you should try to trap tab earlier in the keyup event or maybe even earlier in the keydown

989554
windows-vista	windows
the hosts file is in c windows system32 drivers etc in windows-vista xp

989557
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch is the java construct for catching such exception-handling and dealing with them -- look it up in your favorite java docs

989563
implements	final
here is the final solution with his suggestion implements

989579
hosts-file	hosts
if everything after the domain matches if your remote url is otherwise the same as the localhost one you can edit your localhost entry in your hosts

989579
hosts-file	hosts
in system32 drivers etc copy the hosts onto your desktop

989579
hosts-file	hosts
then copy the hosts back into the etc directory

989579
ip-address	hostname
if that single ip-address is shared between multiple web sites which is usually the case you ll get a bad hostname error from iis as it attempts to look up localhost and can t find which web site to direct the request to

989579
rewrite	rule
next you need to create a redirect rule it s not actually a redirect more of a rewrite of the url

989580
integer	zero
the program logic is essentially if argument zero is not help parsing it as an integer hellip

python	java
well the truth is that c++ is faster than java is faster than pretty much everything else actually but sometimes c++ code can be poorly written and java may prevent beginners to make some mistakes resulting in many of the claims that java is as fast as c++ there are even claims that python psyco are as fast as c++ and faster than java

989640

989749
serialization	marshalling
then you can use a map to cache your marshalling unparsed serialization xml strings and eliminate this hotspot

989798
xsd	xml
can i use xsd complexcontent with the delphi xml binding wizard

989844
contains	any
i have no issues getting service names and states with the system.serviceprocess namespace but i can t find any classes contains to get descriptions which is why i resorted to reading from registry

989848
arrays	map
that is if i just want a lot of data and don t care about its order i m better off using an std set a balanced tree if i want o log n lookup or a std unordered_map a hash map if i want o 1 expected lookup or a std vector a contiguous arrays for better locality of reference or a std deque a double-ended queue if i need to insert in the front and back

javascript	dom
running the rhino javascript interpreter which isn t too difficult won t be enough if the function relies on various browser objects like the document object model dom or xmlhttprequest

989884
arrays	loops

990096
continuous-integration	jenkins
i have not tried integrating with cruisecontrol or hudson jenkins but in implementing continuous-integration via other means i ve encountered these issues

990100
shell	bash
to explain the concept of virtual memory a server with only 512 mb ram might easily have its ram used up but the operating system s kernel will need to have some sort of reserve so there will always be memory available for allocation if for example in your case a new user logging in needing to start a shell like bash

990102
affinity	cpu
so since the gil limits us to basically executing a python program on one cpu my thought is why not accept this and simply use taskset on linux to set the affinity of the program to a certain core cpu on the system especially in a situation with multiple python apps running on a multi-core system

990114
physics-engine	chipmunk
you can use chipmunk physics-engine which has a very good physics + collisions

990319
jquery	.post
the alternative i considering is using the django template system to render my pages with some jquery ui plugins and the method suggested in this .post to retriving html data without deal with json objects because i think that dealing with it is a nightmare because in my structure when the data changes also the interface could be drammatically change

990342
virtual-machine	vmware
when doing all this in an automated test environment you ll probably have more luck doing this against a virtual-machine either vmware or microsoft virtual pc hyper-v and then you can automate rolling back the tfs instance to a known clean state each time you repeat your testing

990349
firefox	safari
safari and firefox work fine

990352
linux	unix
on unix variants in which gnu conventions are followed linux it should respond to --help and --version

990435
versioning	upgrade
it might not sound like much of a problem for a single developer but if you try to upgrade nunit one project at a time you ll see how much nicer it is to be able to checkout the trunk of your project and know that you ve got the right versioning of nunit along with it rather than then having to uninstaller nunit and reinstall the right versioning

990474
entity-framework	nhibernate
entity-framework subsonic nhibernate etc etc...

if you need more enterprise power you should look at nhibernate ado.net entity-framework or other bigger more capable players which are just too complex and ill suited for a small simple scenario

990591
short	zero
in short even if you didn t have anything better to do you shouldn t waste your time wrapping slf4j because the added value of your wrapper is guaranteed to be near zero

990617
directory	folder
is the directory the logged-on user s mapped home folder or below that

990617
command-prompt	cmd
right-click the executable then choose run as administrator or start the application from an elevated command-prompt the fastest way to get one is by pressing start enter cmd followed by ctrl+shift+return

990624
activerecord	datamapper
apart from the key there are numerous storage facilities you might use like yaml or you can actually build a complete activerecord datamapper etc

990650
filesystems	fileinfo
the fileinfo makes an access to the filesystems and i would assume only the admin user has access to that directory

990758
contains	any
however i m not convinced that this solution doesn t contains any caveats i haven t thought of sorry for the triple negation especially because reassigning the magical __class__ just doesn t feel right

990762
jquery	dojo
first i recommend you to use a javascript framework such as jquery mootools prototype dojo or whatever

990771
any	set
while std set does not support any sequence properties or reverse container

990772
constructor	object
now while i am debugging the businessdatacontroller i can see that the type usersdal is being propagated a new usersdal object is getting created in businessdatacontrollerbase constructor but as soon as the code is coming out of the constructor in businessdatacontrollerbase the da member variables shows as null and hence the dologin process da.getuser is giving an error object not instantiated

990780
innodb	myisam
i heard myisam is faster but others say innodb can be fast also but it takes abit more to optimize it

990790

990826
realloc	malloc
with one exception-handling it is not true for local variables or for data allocated with malloc or realloc

990826
pointers	stack
the one exception-handling is that when automatic reference counting arc is enabled stack pointers to objective-c objects are implicitly initialized to nil

990830
innodb	myisam
innodb is slower for read only databases because it has features acid compliant row level locking that myisam leaves out

990835
persistent-connection	tcp-ip
in a regular hosted environment on one of those cheap webhosters like dreamhost with around 1000 articles in joomla a couple of users and a few hundreds visitors a day would a sqlite database with a persistent-connection sqlite_popen perform noticeable faster than the mysql equivalent with the tcp-ip overhead etc.

990842
environment	building
but we do have different environment so we let the building-script change app name updates location server uri etc pre-building and the building it with target publishing

990857
triggers	insert
does this mean that the triggers is not called for each row that is inserted into the table but once after the insert query is finished ie

990857
triggers	insert
which mean the insert table in the triggers has not one but n number of rows

990862

only a process with the effective user id equal to the user id of the file or with write access to the file or with appropriate privileges may use futimens or utimensat with a null pointers as the times argument or with both tv_nsec field set to the special value utime_now

990896
priority-queue	heap
a binary heap based one is fine like the vector based std priority-queue

990899

what i want to be able to do is to know beforehand how long the encrypted string will be for a given input so that i can limit the length of the input accordingly in relation to the storage space available for its encrypted form if that makes sense

990960
implements	extends
instead of extends something like a mouseinputadapter which can be annoying since java is also single-inheritance or implements a lot of pointless empty methods you can adopt a protocols and implement only the optional methods you care about

990961
contextmenu	icons
to react to user interacting with your icons you add event handler or set the contextmenu to your notification icons

990962
asp.net-mvc	webforms

arrays	loops
you wouldn t leak memory in this code and releasing the arrays yourself will cause a crash when the arrays is autoreleased at the end of the run loops

990977
webforms	asp.net
if you don t have the time or will to learn to use the asp.net mvc framework correctly stick with asp.net webforms

990981
webforms	asp.net
as scott ewers said if your goal is to learn then using asp.net mvc will expand your breadth of knowledge in the asp.net space since you already know webforms

990985
odt	odf
there is for example a odt to txt conversion scripting that converts odf to txt with markdown formatting

990985

991078
command-prompt	command-line
the command-line is the same that is invoked by visual-studio because i copy the command from the output windows and then paste the command to the vs2008 command-prompt

primitive-types	type-safety
in imperitive oo languages there is the anti-pattern primitive obsession where the prolific use of primitive-types reduces the type-safety of a program and introduces accidentally interchangeability of same-typed values otherwise intended for different purposes

991477
qtableview	qwidget
i need my table to have the same api as a normals qtableview so i want to subclassing it rather than subclassinging qwidget and adding a qlineedit and qtableview to it

991482
svg	vml
i found that any other solution svg vml flash image tags was simply too slow and hard to operate

991484

digits	base
in python and some other languages if you start a number with a 0 the number is interpreter as being in octal base 8 where only 0-7 are valid digits

991991
activerecord	datamapper
i think you can use mysql and use the berkeleydb storage engine and use activerecord or datamapper as usual

991996
constructor	object
it looks like your messageinteceptor class is getting disposed before you are getting your second message because the only reference to the object is going away once you leave the constructor or your event handler

991996
constructor	object
rather than creating a new object each time you receive a message just create one in your constructor and set it to you member variables

992000
modifiers	final
although it is superfluous in other contexts a methods without a modifiers is package-private so i find it can be confusing especially in interfaces with a lot of static final fields to imply public in some contexts and package-private in others when it may not be immediately obvious that you are looking at an interface if you drill to the methods from your ide and don t see the top of the declaration

992003
.when	ready
.when you are ready to talk to the client simply break off the current versioning and hand it to the client

i can then turn the full screens capability off and on using the following code in my activity class usually called from a menu option the m_contentview variables is the view from findviewbyid using the id that you used when calling setcontentview in your on create

992060
hide	show
well if you are trying to dynamically show and hide it during the lifetime of the activity i am not sure if you can do that with the official windows title due to the note that has been mentioned about windows features needing to be set before setcontentview is called link

992060
hide	show
one thing that you could do is implement your own title bar and dynamically show and hide that.

992060
hide	show
my other thought is if you just want to hide everything to show a progress-bar why not use the progressdialog

992063
logging	trace

positioning	sidebar
i have problem positioning left sidebar variating height div on ie6

992161
parentheses	operators
when i am programming i always use parentheses when i am unsure about operators precedence

992161
addition	division
in my example above if you only did 2 + 5 + 3 3 the program would do division operations before addition - so it would evaulate to 2 + 5 + 3 3 or 2 + 5 + 1 7

992173
python	ruby
berkeleydb is the database equivalent of a ruby hashtable or a python dictionary except that you can store multiple values for a single key

992241
children	nodes
cannot modify the logical children for this nodes at this time because a tree walk is in progress pointing to the chart1.datacontext alldates line

992261
perl	php
with a rewritemap you can create a php or perl script take advantage of your existing code base and perform all the rewriting rules from a localized place in your code which easily sits in version control

992261
httpd.conf	.htaccess
i believe you need access to the httpd.conf or vhost configuration file though rewritemaps or some related directive cannot be put in .htaccess files

992297
versioning	upgrade
when subversioning changes the working copy versioning in a release such as 1.5.x - 1.6.x any 1.5.x working copy is silently upgrade to the 1.6.x format as soon as it is touch by a 1.6.x client

992335

992341
solaris	linux
port to linux solaris

992367

992445
constructor	object
when the b object gets pushed onto the vector a copy is made but not by the you have - the compiler generated copy constructor is used

992455
nsresponder	nstextview
remember that nsoutlineview has a fairly long object tree - it inherited from nstableview which inherited from nscontrol which inherited from nstextview which inherited from nsresponder which inherited from nsobject and there are various helper methods that exist in each of these classes which can often help you achieve what you want

992455
subclass	nsobject
the easiest way to create the shell of your subclass would be to selected then choosing objective-c class as you would with any other class which will create a new class with header and implementation files that inherits from nsobject

992455
subclass	nsobject
since you are creating a subclass you can change the default implementation of any methods up the object tree - that is you can override methodss declared in nsoutlineview nstableview nscontrol nsview nsresponder and nsobject although you should rarely override methodss declared in nsobject

992498
streamreader	streamwriter
using httpwebrequest streamreader to read into a string and saving using streamwriter works fine with ascii but non-ascii characters get mangled because the systems thinks it has to worry about encodings encode to unicode or from or whatever

silverlight	wpf
depends on the project but i ve got the following for a silverlight + wpf project in my .gitignore

992540

availability of the tools perl and python aren t installed on windows by default powershell only since windows 7 so deployment might be hindered.

992653
value	field
if you see a setfoo string foo definition in javadoc or hover you would be reasonable to expect that the field foo is set to the value of the parameter foo

992653
required	checked
other names may required you to double checked - would setname string person just set the name to person or would additional action be taken lookup the name in a table of persons etc

992653
getter	setter
in eclipse you can create the getter and setter for a field with ctrl-1 when the cursor is located on the field in question

992663

992717
constructor	object
if i put parentheses around the argument to the someclass constructor or constructs the boost function object outside the argument list it compiles fine

992737
command-line	cmd
rm -rf with asterisk probably can fail if there are too many files or directories inside somepath because of limited cmd-line length - this can be fixed with for-loop or find cmd

992884
administration	account
denying all other users the right to close the process thus only the special administration account can close it.

992915

992955
scala	java
follow the instructions that have been written for java and write equivalent scala code

any	set
is there any way i can avoid the second replication and have the issynced boolean column set during the replication

992998
authentication	login
i need to enable users to login and interact with the site via gadgets using the same authetnication authentication schema i use on the site

993000
debian	linux
rmi seems to have some issues with associating to the wrong network interface i particularly had this issue when running on debian based linux distributions

993017
delphi	c++
researching on delphi lead me to c++ builder

993017
delphi	c++
is c++ builder better than delphi

993017
delphi	c++
can any one give me a comparison between c++ mfc delphi and c++ builder

993033
pascal	delphi
delphi also called object pascal is another programming language

993034

ultraedit for windows has built-in ssh telnet terminal

993037
manifest.mf	ant
howto create manifest.mf classpath from ant or better using manifestclasspath

993039
value	field
as none of the objects used are field of the class apart from fullmap is it ok just to call this or might one thread change the value of bitmap for example while the methods is executing

993039
queue	fifo
heinx and a fifo queue of hard

993047
vertex-shader	shader
the light s positioning and the vertex positioning are passed in world spaces to the vertex-shader which then transforms them to eye spaces compute the light s direction and pass this to the fragment shader

993053
textbox	button
thatâ s all very funny but actually google only needs a textbox and a submit button

993053
checkbox	textbox
i canâ t think of a way to build a form that requires a lot of data entry without a clutter of textbox dropdownlists checkbox etc

993055
difference	factors
the performance difference probably will not even approach a factors of 1.5 and such logic is seldom used millions of times on extremely large strings

993058
.net	wcf
since wcf inherently can be interoperable with non-.net platforms using exceptions which is a strict .net construct is a bad idea

993059
aggregate-functions	sum
one of the nice things relational databases support are the aggregate-functions like count sum avg etc

993061
toolstrip	winforms
i can see that it visibly changes the design of the toolstrip and i find that setting it to system on windows-xp makes it fit much better with the winforms style

993062
double	int
you ll note two extra complexities here first it s actually a function type not just a simple alias and second that it s parameterized plotdatagen is a type constructor that i apply to another type to create a new type such as plotdatagen int double

993069
iteration	elements
the iteration order may be -- then the iterator will still miss the elements 5

993069
iteration	elements
this will allow the iteration over the new elements in addition to the original elements

993069
queue	fifo
as the queue is a fifo fifo data structure this order is typical

993069
linked-list	queue
the following is an example using a linked-list which is a queue in order to go through all the elements along with additional elements added during the dequeing

993070
value	field
often business users want more field on one screen so they can define the value in one shot instead of having to go to different screens

993084
children	nodes
that is the nodes that has the top-level namespaces as its children

993105
click	mouse
you can embed javascript to watch mouse motions and time keypresses and mouse click

993106
aggregate	grouping
right to use gae storage properly you need to selectively de-normalize some aspects of your model keeping redundant data which in a db in normal form you d recompute on the fly such as aggregate overall and grouping by ones

993124
erlang	ocaml
this question also appears to apply ml f# ocaml erlang oz lava and all ssa intermediate languages

993128
base-class	inherited
the compiler may mark part of an object as destroyed by clearing the virtual function table pointers so that it can correctly implement destructors of classes with diamond inherited multiple-inherited of classes that have a common virtual base-class if the program crashes during the destruction of the object you ll see the partially destroyed object in the dump

993131
assign	add
with my function i get an xml file parsing it and add grouping box with image and a textbox for every post node in the xml file and for each grouping box i assign name and toolstrip menu which has a dinamicly added 1 item the thing i want to do is this - when click this item lets say the item has name jeff so

993139
any	set
does anyone have any idea what this thing wants from the html help 2.x feature set

993149
templating	mako
if you mean a templating engine i ve had some success using mako with cherrypy

993153
hide	show
if you re worried about cluttering the gui you can have an advanced search view or a toggle to show hide the filtering

993176
base-class	inherited
as to the 50 different grid views you mentioned in a comment above why not write a base-class for the pages that will be rendering these views to inherited that handles all of your fake data generation

993180
getter	setter
after a deep analysis and compare i have see that the il contents is exacly the same but all the classes and methods property getter and setter etc

993180
binary	hex
so if i compare the two assemblies with and hex editor comparer i see a completely different binary body

993193
expression	evaluation
where c1 and so on return lt eq or gt c1 returning eq causes the expression to continue evaluation c2

993204
haskell	python
i don t think i would have been nearly as effective with linq without having been exposed to haskell and using generators and list comprehensions in python

993205
export	csv
then export the result as csv file

993208
delphi	c++
it s possible to call c c++ c# dll from delphi

993209
put	get
your best bet is to use something like firefox firebug to get access to the css source copy and modify the css to do what you need it to do then put it in your local site and maintain it there from then on

993217
perl	php
so far i have managed to get this working 100 with a perl scripted client but it doesn t work 100 with a php one

993217
perl	php
as i said this works fine with a perl written client both locally and remotely but doesn t work 100 with php what i mean by 100 is the fact that the server will recive the command but is unable to send it back or the server is able to recive the command but the client isnt able to read the reply

993219
lookup	any
take the 3d point and convert it to a 2d point which can be used as an arrays lookup to find the radius this is the bit i cannot work out the maths for or find any references to through google

993220
boolean	int
my version set all strings as the name of the field setname would be called with name then set all int as 1 boolean to true etc

993220
any	set
it provided a good start for test data and any fields that required specific values could be set explicitly as part of the test

993230
teamcity	msbuild
afaik teamcity doesn t use msbuild utility to build solution

993236
build-process	build-system
integrating c++builder projects into a build-process should be a lot easier with c++builder 2007 or 2009 as both use msbuild as build-system

993238
numeric	digits
numbers numeric digits

993238
numeric	digits
numeric digits

993238
click	mouse
for entering or editing an enum value using the mouse i guess that popping a little context menu on a mouse click is the thing to do

993238
keyboard	mouse
would you also pop that same menu on focus when the focus changes as a result of the keyboard the tab key instead of a result of the mouse a click

993238
keyboard	mouse
incidentally the css-based popup menus that i ve seen respond to the mouse but not to the keyboard to the up and down arrow keys

993241
32-bit	16-bit
this is because the size of uielements is not stored as floats as it is in wpf but in 32-bit quantities of which 16-bit form the integer of size and 16-bit form the floating part of it

993263
jax-rs	cxf
cxf is an apache project and as jax-rs is a standard you should have no problems moving away from it if you have any difficulties

993281
long-integer	integer
plain or long-integer division yields an integer of the same type

993282
json	xml
i m building classes that interface with the twitter api and i m wondering whether php s built-in xml or json parser is faster

993284
integer	zero
it returns zero because 1 and 2 are integers integer division causes numbers to round down

993312
bazaar	git
now that repositories for git and mercurial have been mentioned launchpad s the equivalent for bazaar

993319
basic	vba
vba means visual basic for applications and it is used for macros on office documents

993319
worksheet	excel
it doesn t have access to vb.net features so it s more like a modified version of vb6 with add-ons to be able to work on the document like worksheet in vba for excel

993321
json	xml
since json is only a description of nested string sequences without the need to offer a dom interface attributes parsing and other subtle stuff my guess is that a json parser is way faster that an xml parser

993322
basic	vba
vba stands for visual basic for applications and its a visual basic implementation intended to be used in the office suite

993327
basic	vba
vba stands for visual basic for applications and so is the small for applications scripting brother of vb

993327
basic	vba
microsoft visual basic for applications vba is an embeddable programming environment designed to enable developers to build custom solutions using the full power of microsoft visual basic

993331
json	xml
but once you considering to create and ajax calls and later process of result you should consider using json since you benefit from javascript automatic representation of json result as an objects as well it supports cross domain request with callback functions whereas for xml you will proxy

993348
vb.net	vba
do you want compare vba with vb-classic vb6.. or vb.net

993348
basic	vba
vba visual basic for applications is a vb-classic-based script language embedded in microsoft office applications

993348
vb.net	vba
vba has nothing to do with vb.net they just have a similar syntax

993354
fadeout	fadein
i searched here and found a similar problem with fadein and fadeout .

993354
fadeout	fadein
and is it the same fix for pulsate as with fadein and fadeout etc..

993354
fadeout	fadein
i must admit i don t seem to get the issue with fadein and fadeout

993357
reflection	runtime
ok i need to know at runtime what i can do with external libraries - reflection is your choice

993375
subclassing	inherited
i also wanted to pass along a tidbit i learned that can bite you down the road +initialize is inherited by subclassing and is also called for each subclassing that doesn t implements an +initialize of their own

993385
local-variables	class-members
sometimes there is a name ambiguity where it can be used to disambiguate class-members and local-variables

993392
versioning	upgrade
my current wix setup upgrade from the original rtm versioning correctly

993396
microsoft.build	msbuild
my book inside the microsoft.build engine using msbuild and team foundation build

993398
json	xml
on the following code where i ve already curl ed the data to a file data. xml json

993402
integer	zero
note a throw-expression which is an integral constant expression of integer type that evaluates to zero

993420
required	checked
the aspect of c which is most problematic are the pointerss the c language required pointers arithmitic and those are not checked

993429
microsoft.build	msbuild
my book inside the microsoft.build engine using msbuild and team foundation build

993434
python	perl
i am looking for a scripting or higher level programming language or modules for python or similar languages for effortlessly analyzing and manipulating binary data in files core dumps much like perl allows manipulating text files very smoothly

993434
binary	hex
things i want to do include presenting arbitrary chunks of the data in various forms binary decimal hex convert data from one endianess to another etc

993439
benchmarking	profiling
have you profiled with a good systems profiling like the free windows performance toolkit to see what is going on in your benchmarking

993439
benchmarking	profiling
these kind of benchmarking can be a lot of fun to write and profiling don t let a few false starts get in the way of digging in and looking for speedups

993461
javascript	dom
replacing with accessible unobtrusive dom javascript

993492
perl	ruby
all 3 perl python and ruby can do it

993495
arrays	loops
however neither is quite as rich as you require for example to present the same data as bytes or halfwords you need to copy it between two arrays the numpy third-party add-on is much more powerful for interpreting the same area of memory in several different ways and for example to display some bytes in hex there s nothing much bundled beyond a simple loops or list comprehension such as

993512
binary	hex
things i want to do include presenting arbitrary chunks of the data in various forms binary decimal hex convert data from one endianess to another etc

993520
gridviewcolumn	itemtemplate
you can set it for itemtemplate listbox celltemplate gridviewcolumn headertemplate etc

993537
design-time	designer
powerfull visual designer you can build almost all of your application s interface at design-time

993537
delphi	c++
oh and to conclude delphi can make everything c++ c# c etc can

993540
margins	padding
any ideas i tried setting all sorts of css padding 0px margins 0px etc .

993590
malloc	free
i know i should release memory - the golden each malloc free or each new delete rules exist now in my world but i m using them to rather simple objects

993592
value	field
i do not want to use any type of session state to maintain the form and i dont want to write the search value in hidden field in the results form

993592
value	field
i suppose that this could just be managed manually to ensure that there are unique names whenever rendering partial views into other views perhaps even going so far as to prefix value with the partial view name but that reminds me of the ugliness that is inamingcontainer in webforms - plus makes for cumbersome field names in your model

993638
methods	extend
and extension methods are very nice that way since they let you extend stuff like that

993649
mouseover	mouseout
jquery doesn t add a hover tag-it merely provides handler for javascript s hover event iirc it s actually an abstraction of mouseover mouseout

993651
json	xml
format can be xml json rss or atom

993664
value	field
while every modern database engine provides cascade update functionality if the value in the pk field changes all the tables where that field is a foreign key are automatically updated this imposes a certain amount of overhead and can be problematic

993695
value	field
if you absolutely need to have the search parameters include you could consider having the second form post via javascript pick up the search field value dynamically and add them to the second form as hidden fields prior to posting the second form

993730
base-class	inherited
another option is to put the enum in a common base-class that both inherited from this may not make sense in this case but it is another option

993749
nunit	moq
here is the excerpt from the test nunit moq that is giving me problems

993768
daemons	systemd
if you want to do something like this i would advise you write a systemd daemons that applications can use as a copy store and access through systemd ipc such as dbus

993771
directory	folder
these structured namespaces correspond to the folder directory structures in which the source code and the projects are contained

993778
updating	updates
take a look here for ideas updates that javascript methods with targetid parameter for updating specified div form and post additional data if needed here like this

993795
buffering	streaming
stashing the new streaming buffering can be done as follows

993814
basichttpbinding	duplex
contract requires duplex but binding basichttpbinding dosn t support it

993817
superclass	subclass
i m not sure about it here but if initwithstyle allready calls init in the superclass when you override init in the subclass and call the super you might have a loop on your hands

993823
for-loop	arrays
for example if you had a vector of pointers to stl strings or c-style character arrays put that into a stringcontainer use a better name and have the stringcontainer hold a vector and in the stringcontainer destructor run a for-loop to delete each string in the vector

993823
protected	public
you can make the vector inside the stringcontainer a public member and mess around with it directly but it s even better design to make it private or protected and add some member-functions to manage the string vector

993833
freebsd	linux
pulseaudio has been tested on linux solaris freebsd netbsd windows 2000 and windows xp

993855
getter	setter
if i have for example an authors table i ll be creating an author class which is mapped to the table with getter and setter etc

993855
getter	setter
- represents a single row with getter and setter

993888
arrays	loops
you can loops over all veriables in the _prequest arrays

993893
forwarding	port
another udp advantage and firewall trick is that for most firewalls if an internal client sends a udp packet the firewall opens a udp port on the outside that can accept and forwarding outside packets back to the source

993893
udp	tcp
one problem with it is that all the traffic is udp which makes the connections unreliable so you need to implement your own version of tcp over it if you need reliability

993925
arguments	undefined
a simple way to see the difference between strict and non-strict constructor arguments is how they behave when they are undefined

993925
arguments	undefined
since the non-strict arguments isn t evaluated by second passing in undefined doesn t cause a problem

993925
arguments	undefined
but the strict arguments can t be undefined even if we don t use the value

993930
any	set
in any case since you have two backgrounds working why not just set their priorities in their registers to swap their z order

993930
any	set
background are only drawn in a particular order by default you can set their priority to have the system draw them in any order you like

993939
traveling-salesman	np-complete
this is equivalent to the traveling-salesman problem and is therefore np-complete since if you could solve this problem efficiently you could solve tsp simply by replacing each cost with its reciprocal

993953
jeditable	jquery
i think to get the initial functionality using jquery you can look at the jeditable plugin

993963
callback	methods
in short it mentions that you can call the callback yourself by using the send methods with the callback as its parameter

993975
background-color	transparency
in its viewdidload message body set the background-color to clearcolor so that spaces on the view not covered by controllers are transparency

993975
contains	set
the uiimageview contains a photoshoped image which has rounded corners and the background is set to transparent

993977
updating	updates
it isn t like the temporary updating the master url in the web i have to updates the list item

993978
callback	methods
you will have to implement a few callback methods to handle fine grained control of the request and you can opt to invoke it synchronously to mimic stringwithcontentsofurl but it will give you what you want

993992
wamp	php
example c wamp bin php php5.2.9-2

994010
32-bit	64bit
maybe you don t care that much for just a million cells but you definitely would for a billion cells -- neither approach would fit in a 32-bit architecture but with 64bit builds numpy would get away with 4 gb or so python alone would need at least about 12 gb lots of pointers which double in size -- a much costlier piece of hardware

994010
difference	count
the difference is mostly due to indirectness -- a python list is an arrays of pointers to python objects at least 4 bytes per pointer plus 16 bytes for even the smallest python object 4 for type pointer 4 for reference count 4 for value -- and the memory allocators rounds up to 16

994015
document	element
without this jquery will be forced to look at every single element in the document to see if it has the class you specified as opposed to only looking for elements with the native getelementsbytagname and then looking to see if they have the class specified

994041
arrays	loops
how can i store the results in an associative arrays so i can loops it later and get to all the data returned by the sql string

994046
membership	guid
i ve been considering using new guid at creation time but this would require a call to the database to retrieve the user s password before i could sign the user in via the membership provider

994054
spline	smooth
it s similar to spline smooth but i don t know the order of the data

994057
firefox	opera
update this code works and is tested in opera 9.51 firefox 3.0 and ie7

994075
execute	declare
items declare outside of targets static items are evaluated before any target begins to execute

this works in ie7 8 ff3 and google-chrome safari

994100
libcurl	curb
according to the curb documentation curb is ruby-language bindings for the libcurl

994108
revision	updates
so yes individually you can updates your files to an older revision and then commit them to the branch

994154
strstr	strchr
yes and other functions have the same const-laundering issue for instance strchr strstr all that lot

994159
asp.net-mvc	webforms
there s a more step-by-step description of adding asp.net-mvc to a webforms application at these links

994159
webforms	asp.net
mixing asp.net webforms and asp.net mvc

994171
versioning	staging
by the way if you have an msdn license you can run any versioning of server 2008 in a testing or staging capacity under that license

994173
value	field
having defined a view with the name field supplied and trying the linkfilename my calls to rename a file are respectively returning a failure or ignoring the new value

994180
any	set
i am trying to load views for a set of modules for a user who has selected any number of available modules

994182
oracle-xe	oracle
i m running oracle-xe 10.2.0.1.0 on a oracle enterprise linux 5 box with 512mb of ram

994225
web-applications	enterprise
ok i am sure you dont need the enterprise editions as you are only running 3 web-applications and maybe some backend db crud operations

994245
protected	public
where you might forget to public after the protected methods

994252
expression	evaluation
this is not too unlike how substitution works in mathematics -- the result of an expression is used to continue evaluation an expression

994260
ruby	php
web applications benefit from rapid iteration and friendly interfaces both of which are better achieved with languages like php python and ruby

994272
postorder	inorder
you would do a parallels tree traversal - choose your order pre-order postorder inorder

994273
command-prompt	command-line
how to change and update the title of the command-prompt windows from the java command-line application

994286
cloudfiles	amazon-s3
if serving media files is a very big part of your service consider amazon-s3 or rackspace cloudfiles

994297
unsigned-integer	int
i assume you mean size_t -- this is a way of indicating an unsigned-int an int that can only be positive never negative -- it makes sense for containers sizes since you can t have an arrays with a size of -7

994300
void	main
public static void main string argv

994301
32-bit	64bit
for example it might be defined as a 32-bit integer or a 64bit integer or something else altogether that s capable of storing unsigned values of a great length

994302
constructor	private
write a copy constructor and assignment operator if they make sense or make them private and don t implement them

994308
s#arp-architecture	nhibernate
i am trying to build the following association in nhibernate the base entity class contains an id property it and the attributes are from s#arp-architecture

994309
32-bit	64bit
assuming the size_type uses 32-bit on 32-bit machines and 64 bits on 64bit machines the same source code likely would work better if you ve used size_type where needed

994316
children	tree
the two children are more generic and represent binary tree

994316
binary-tree	nodes
the children can either be empty or a single nodes or a fully-grown binary-tree

994325
selected	button
i checkout the whole source tree and right-clicked dragged the folders under projecta folder and selected move versioned files here into the src folder that marked the folders in project for deletion but the new files in src still had the green tick next to them and not the blue plus button

994328
protected	public
in this class all methods are public except bar_protected and bar_private which are declared protected and private at the end

994332
.when	ready
- queue in python a queue.queue instances for work requests reading or changing the shared structure including both ones that request a response they ll pass their own queue on which the response is placed .when ready and ones that don t

994333
selected	button
you must selected the folder and files you wish to move and after doing so right click on the selectedion and drag it with the right button to the new location

994335
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the reason that i want to use asp.net-mvc instead of webforms is that eventually we re going to scrap the excel files and create the views programmatically but i have to display these files now since we don t have time to create that functionality in this phase

994344
data-structures	linked-list
in fact a linked-list is actually fairly simple to implement this way as compared to some other collection data-structures

994348
ruby	php
unless you are in a java .net shop or there is a specific reason why you would use java .net i would suggest one of the platforms that is more optimized for web development python django or ruby rails php codeigniter cake

994348
ruby	php
you ll find python ruby php so much easier to learn deploy program etc

994348
ruby	php
all have been used to produce major web sites youtube on python twitter on ruby facebook on php

994357
integer	short
size_t is not included in the list of fundamental integer types so i have always assumed that size_t is a type alias for one of the fundamental types char short int int and long int

994383
asp.net-mvc	webforms
my suggestion would be to use webforms for pages that need the custom control and asp.net-mvc for everything else

994383
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in order to mix webforms in asp.net-mvc in the same application you ll need an ignoreroute call so asp.net-mvc doesn t try to process .aspx files and you need to make sure everything needed for webforms gets added to the web.config

994384
highlight	tooltip
i am trying to do a pure css based context highlight with tooltip - i ve pretty much got most of it together apart from the tooltip lol

994384
highlight	selected
currently in safari as well it seems that the selected yellow border from the browser appears around the entire highlight .

994392
integer	modulus
there is also a biginteger.modpow power modulus methods which raises the integer value to the specified power and returning result modulus -- commonly used in cryptography

994412
methods	extend
this allows streams such as cryptostream and gzipstream to wrap any other stream instance and effectively override its read write methods without deriving from the class you want to extend

994412
compression	streaming
use a streaming when encoding doesn t matter such as when compression or encyrpting and use a streamingreader when working with text data

994416
scala	java
i m trying to use a java class library from scala code

994429
ubuntu	linux
which is a surprise because on ubuntu linux uno is supported just fine in python just by

994437
decrement	increment
e.g. if you define it to increment in one file and the decrement in another file without specifying internal linkage by putting the function into the unnamed namespace both will end up sharing the same function which will effectively be chosen at random at compile time with g++ it depends on the order the object files are given on the command-line

994472
instances	private
all of the d20ability instances hold a private state which is called modifier that is shared throughout the system

994484
javascript	dom
itay moav s javascript suggestion i believe is the way to go use javascript to modify the dom at the browser end

994487
put	get
in .net scp at which point do i need dsc or rsa keys i.e when do i use the get or put functions

994494
pixels	line
you want to find the pixels width of a block of text if it was all one line

994494
default	reset
you will get variation if you don t use a reset style because the default fonts are different

994494
display	width
also if you set display none then the width will be 0

994496
arrays	map
now you have an arrays map of months index by month with values set to the number of days in the month

there will be no need for try-catch blocks in that methods if the exception-handling s are thrown up to the methodss that called it

994521
hide	show
this expression should be set for the hide show field of the footer

994527

my custom code receives a string value as a parameter which contains the field s value as returned by the getformattedvalue methods

994535
export	csv
the easiest way to export to excel is to output csv

994557
spring	seam
if you re committed to spring and don t want to introduce seam then i don t think that granite ds will give you much beyond blaze ds

994557
client-server	security
all client-server interactions are done exclusively by method calls on services exposed by the server and thus respect transaction boundaries and security defined by the remote services

994560
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
if i lightly tap while sliding the object touchesbegan fires and i call touchesmoved as before but this time touch in touchesmoved is nil

994569

any ideas on how i can go about getting this to work through xaml without having to set the itemssource via codebehind

994571
versioning	upgrade
now i will create new setup with product versioning 1.0.0925.2 and under the major upgrade s common tab i will disable the prompt because

994571
versioning	upgrade
now after some days there will be change and again another setup will be created with the versioning 1.0.0925.3 in that the prompt for the upgrade will be disabled

994571
versioning	upgrade
if i enable this then any setup is ran every time it will be asking for upgrade either it is on lower versioning over higher versioning or higher versioning over lower versioning

994582
numeric	digits
blockid numeric first 6 digits used for cadastral map no and last 2 digits for the block no

994586
value	field
since your query has only one selected field you don t have to specify the datavaluefield and datatextfield value

994606
updating	updates
and later on while updating the items in a cart what would be the appropriate logic to updates only the changed field say quantity of a particular product

994621
textbox	button
for example my xaml is consisting of textbox radio button combo s list boxes etc

994627
forwarding	port
i have written a scripting to do some port 25 forwarding based on a recepie that i found on the web here is the code that matters

994661
persistence	hibernate
by the way grails have its data persistence build on top of hibernate

994671
perl	ruby
it is possible in all the scripting languages perl python ruby

994687

check this link it contains a great set of documentation on using ado.net data services in silverlight

994690
spacing	layout
i m trying to fill a mx tile component with actionscript but the layout has some strange spacing when i don t specify the width of a component i add to it

994723
bash	zsh
here is a function i wrote which will work in zsh bash or ksh

994723
shell	bash
to activate it from the shell prompt type the following command or add it to your startup script - for bash it would be .bashrc

994732
python	perl
if not perl something else like python is also ok

994733
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome will let you do this

994736
conditional	operators
i d need to see a real-world example but i think i d usually split this into one statement using the null coalescing operators and then another using the conditional operators

994736
conditional	operators
i like the null coalescing operators in general but i think combining it with the conditional operators just makes it a little bit to obscure

994759
contains	set
package contains a set of portlet api

994784
document	element
once you aquired what you need you could drop the div element which you would never have added to the current document

994792
affinity	cpu
affinity is not determined by the cpu state and can therefore not be modified by assembly alone

994802
javascript	dom
by dom parser do you mean javascript

994822
scp	ssh
if all you want is to check if the remote system is listening on the ssh scp port you can try pinging

994838
external	embed
i found that the best way of implementing this is define some external class for all lookups that i use in grid and embed them in the templates as a static resource

994849
command-line	cmd
this function executes the specified cmd and dumps any resulting text to the output stream either the http output in a webserver situation or the console if you are running php as a cmd-line tool

994849
stream	send
however it then proceeds to immediately send the raw output from this program to the output stream with which php is currently working either http in a webserver scenario or the shell in a command-line versioning of php

994859
required	checked
if you need finer control you can use customized pre-commit hooks to force team members to place required information while checked in

994864
authentication	login
one possible approach you could take is to have a checkbox in your login for remember this logon or something similar and then using cookies to preserve your authentication state

994864
authentication	login
the cookie in turn can save the login information that will be used for authentication via the google gadget api

994871
subclassing	base-class
because the code change is so small instead of reimplementing our adapter interfaces and abstract base-class i subclassing the sql 2005 adapter from sql 2000 and just override the appropriate methods and properties

994873
m2eclipse	maven
if you re using some sort of maven integration like m2eclipse the launch configurations usually have a offline check box

994886
base-class	inherited
if you want to avoid this it would be good to move most of the functionality into an abstract base-class and have both inherited directly from that

994913
mstest	nunit
i would migrate all my unit tests from nunit to mstest

994931
contains	set
check this link it contains a great set of documentation on using ado.net data services in silverlight

994951
textbox	button
the problem is i want to keep keyboard focus within the textbox in itemscontrol at all times and don t want the keyboard focus to shift to the usercontrol button even if they are pressed

994951
textbox	button
currently the keyboardfocus shift from the textbox to the usercontrol button when the button is pressed

994981
python	perl
i m sure this would be simpler than the perl python solutions and it would be much more reliable because the header would be being parsed by the c compilers parser

995007
look-and-feel	substance
i ve created a swing application which uses the substance look-and-feel thanks again kirill

995008
selected	listbox
i need to design a datatemplate listbox style so it will look like a stack jumbled of photos the top one being the item in focus selected see diagram below

995056
selected	textbox
like when i click on a textbox of class calendarselectdate it will popup a calendar and i can choose the date value and the selected value will appear on the textbox

995066
.net	wcf
a wcf component can be hosted in any kind of environment in .net 3.0 such as a console application windows application or iis

995066
web-services	webserver
wcf services are known as services as opposed to web-services because you can host services without a webserver

995066
.net	wcf
wcf can be hosted by any windows process that is able to host the .net framework 3.0

995072
textbox	button
to try it out type something in the textbox and hit the go button

995087
revision	updates
with win cvs that s as simple as selected the file and using the updates command s merge options to merge the changes from an older revision back into your latest version

995107
attributes	properties
seems to work extended properties are respected so you should be able to write a behaviour that detects dataset and swaps to a custom serialization - like this attributes | behaviour | serialization - but probably simpler

995129
solaris	linux
must run on linux solaris

995141
pagespeed	yslow
have a look at yslow and google pagespeed for more tips

995174
arguments	default
the first arguments to searchpath as you have found can be used to specify the directory you want it to search instead of the default order

995184
submitchanges	datacontext
yet when i try to make a new one i get an exception-handling in the submitchanges methods in the datacontext specified cast is not valid

995193
minimum	max
note if your webpage uses html5 you can use the built in and use the min and max properties to control the minimum and maximum value

995199
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that if you open several tabs and navigate to the same url in a browser like firefox or google-chrome the browser makes the requests sequentially it waits for one to finish before making the next

995204
communication	messages
they are each programmed with their own behaviors and communication by passing messages to one another which they again respond to with their own internally defined behavior

995223
sql-server	oracle
we need to target sql-server 2005 and oracle but obviously i can add conditional code if they require different approaches

995229
sql-server	oracle
i m not an sql expert and even then have spent more time on sql-server than oracle

995244
click	mouse
also it enables you to handle mouse click and double click messages

995245
sql-server	oracle
if you re using sql-server then ddl statements are transactional so wrap in a transaction i don t think this applies to oracle though

995259
getter	setter
what s the point of having getter and setter

995275
selected	textbox
that selected the parent of the textbox which is your then finds the element with class hint inside it thus eliminating the need for an id and a more complex way to get the contained hint div

995293
put	get
the only way i can think is to make a hidden element that has variables width set by css put text in its innerhtml and get the width of that element

995305
required	checked
another reason is that single-inheritance makes casting trivial emitting no assembler instructions other than checked for the compatibility of the types where required

995315
temperature	adc
a function that reads a diode voltage drop read by an adc which is a way to evaluate temperature in very broad strokes

995374
google-chrome	firefox
it works under firefox 3 ie 7 safari opera and google-chrome

995384
long-integer	zero
the function expects a pointer to a long-integer there it asks for an arrays of long-integers but you re passing a long value of zero result of the c_long call which is implicitly cast to a null pointer

995397
32-bit	64bit
is the bitness 32-bit vs 64bit compatibilty the reason for this

995403
sql-server-express	sql-server
but when i installed the service in the clients server it failed because the sql-server express service name was different sql-server-express

995408
constructor	object
object created - constructor called if one exists

995415
order	add
note in order to add webgetattribute you have to reference system.servicemodel.web namespace which is found in a separate assembly

995417
contains	elements
i am assuming that the elements that you are selected from the table all implement some idataelement interface that contains the gettype methods

995423
contains	elements
one elements contains text and the other shows line numbers for the text

995440
updating	updates
i was having the same problem i found that if you are adding a new item into the database then you need to call save and if you are updating an item then you need to call updates

995447
lookup	any
i don t see any recursion here at all but you need to store the value settimeout returns you and if you need to pair this with multiple potential events you need to store it against a key-value you can lookup - something like an element id perhaps

995453
select	union
union is used to select distinct values from two tables

995453
select	union
where as union all is used to select all values including

995455
temperature	adc
the higher layer should know nothing about how the temperature is read it doesn t matter if you use tmp75 or an adc

995457
32-bit	64bit
this leads to some parts of your app being 32-bit and using 64bit dlls

995469

995514
http	ssl
i am doing a http post and i m getting an exception of ssl exception not trusted server certificate

995518
callback	methods
if the data is valid and expected use the clientscriptmanager.registerforeventvalidation methods in order to register the postback or callback data for validation

995520
python	c++
one can argue that abstract is a language-agnostic concept even though python doesn t need it. virtual and pure virtual are implementation details for c++

995520
implements	abstract
if you did this your concrete subclasses would then need to implements __new__ which is a pain in the neck so we rarely take active steps to prevent creating instances of something that s supposed to be abstract

995521
boolean	int
it seems to me that all primitive-types int boolean etc. are non-optional and all other parameters are marked as optional

995532
hosts-file	hosts
although the searched fqdn appears in etc hosts

995541
contains	set
right now when the list contains a reasonable amount of items a vertical scrollbar appears which is correct and i can scroll through the drop down which is set to a height of 180px in the css as seen above

995543
ip-address	hostname
take a look at this hostname not translated into an ip-address using winsock

995553
callback	methods
specially the callback reference and the complete methods

995575
contains	any
as interfaces can t contains any code you will have to add the onmouseclicked methods or whatever in all your implementing classes separately to call the event in the class

995582
webserver	security
that is is it the security of the application you are concerned about or the security of the underlying webserver apache

995587
json	xml
xml is good for this too - it s slightly more verbose than json but easy to read and good for messaging and other xml-based systems too

995587
directory	folder
we can have a metadata folder which contains our json files hidden from the os at the root of each directory which describe that directory s contents

995587
directory	folder
if we look at the .folderdata folder inside the code directory

995588
message	alert
alert popup windows with message and redirect the user to another page

995590
value	field
and i want to exposed those field as properties which get and recieve enum type value for working strongly typed

995629
webforms	asp.net
nopcommerce is the next most mature and active asp.net webforms alternative

995636
version-control	git
going by the number of questions on this site for these three distributed version-control systems it seems like git either

995636
bazaar	git
the recent historical popularity of subversion is clearly reflected by the number of questions indicating at least a small tipping of the scales towards git over the mercurial or bazaar

995636
bazaar	git
obviously only two-data points aren t enough to show a trend but it looks like git and subversion are largely entrenched mercurial has seen a lot of growth and bazaar has remained relatively quiet

995640
nsstring	nsurl
if you just need to post or get something use nsurl in combination with nsdata nsstring or something to retrieve the information contains in it

995657
postgresql	mysql
it gets the ips from a database mysql or postgresql

995659
mousedown	mouseup
there are modifiers with the mousedown and mouseup event like

995807
identity-column	database-table
i need to copy data into an mssqlserver 2005 database-table which has an identity-column

995808
ip-address	hostname
i always thought there is a 1 to 1 mapping between hostname and ip but i m finding that in some cases i get back several ip-address es for the same host

995809
configuration	upgrade
if the upgrade must be performed on a live system where you can neither control transactions or afford to miss them consider using the oracle dbms_redefinition package which automatically creates a temporary configuration of temp tables and triggers to capture in-flight transactions while redefining the table in the background

995820
http	ssl
tried fiddler but when using transport level security http the error changes to could not establish trust relationship for the ssl tls secure channel

995821
python	ruby
how has been big integers been implemented in python and ruby like languages .

995822
versioning	upgrade
if it does your only option may be to upgrade ie7 to a newer versioning or re-open the issue

995858
digits	zero
the matches zero or more times when really you want at least one digits

995873
ip-address	hostname
for pcs you will usually get more than one ip-address if you query by hostname because nowadays you typically have at least two wifi and ethernet adapters with their individual mostly single ip-address

995905
pointers	stack
an interrupt address code segment + offset pointers which is called while the whole register context including return address is pushed on current stack current esp or

995928
show	next
when the combo box selection is changed you can save the current state in your model request the panels name of the current selection prepare your next panels for display and then have your cardlayout show it

995931
entity-framework	nhibernate
you can use something like entity-framework linq2sql subsonic nhibernate etc

995936
performancepoint	moss
you don t need performancepoint to access ssrs from sharepoint just a link on the moss site to the report be it in moss or in native mode

995943
linux	unix
start stop scripts on unix linux

995964
input-field	selected
the renderer outputs a basic html input-field at runtime however i cannot selected text in the input

edit to clarify the value of form field gets posted back to the server when the form is submitted

995991
viewwillappear	viewdidload
start an nsthread to get the data in viewdidload or viewwillappear

996017
cursor	row
basically without cursor it steps through the parent tablerow by row and inserts the new partent row and all the child rows for that parent row keeping the new id s in sync

996020
profiling	debugging
i personally do development testing on jailbroken devices i find that it is nice for profiling debugging with all the unix tools available as well as testing out code for checking for tampered plist files

996023
derived-class	base-class
if your actual object is of type base-class then you can t cast it to a derived-class type.

996029
oracle	mysql
all of the major ones have some type of console available -ssms in sql server toad in oracle mysql query browser administrator for mysql etc. and they all have query execution plans where you can see how the query will actually run

996043
contains	any
coming to the party late but another alternative would be to merge the two branches so at any point a commit contains the state of the testing code and production code assuming they can co-exist without conflicts in which case it comes down to how hard that merge would be whether it would be worth attempting this

996052
haskell	ocaml
i would just use ocaml but haskell s syntax is so much better than ocaml s and haskell is pure and has cool features such as type classes

996065
duplicates	contains
if you come across duplicates they are simply ignored as a set can only contains every element once

996081
temporary	copy
then create another temporary table with a copy of table2 update the copy using the old key new key table you created earlier then use insert into selected from or whatever the appropriate command is for your database to copy the revised temporary table into its permanent location

996093
getter	setter
i want eclipse to automatically generate javadoc comments for my getter and setter methods based on the previously defined comments for the fields

996093
getter	setter
so i have to do redundant work by describing the fields and describing the getter setter again

996103
expression	evaluation
are there any production-ready libraries for streaming xpath expression evaluation against provided xml-document

996103
expression	evaluation
my investigations show that most of existing solutions load entire dom-tree into memory before evaluation xpath expression

996107
duplicates	sorted
this is done by splitting the file into smaller files sorting the smaller chunks in memory and then merging the files in sorted order where the merge ignores duplicates

996129
py2exe	exe
however i wish to compile the project using py2exe which seems to work correctly until you install the exe as a service and try and run it

996135
primitive	int
using int class for int primitive works but can someone explain why int is not accepted

996136
credentials	security
next i used hernan de lahitte s excellent wrapper for the creduipromptforcredentials api function to prompt the user for their credentials if a security exception is thrown and store it in their profile

996137
perl	ruby
our scripts are written in perl with a little bit of shell script but i don t see why you couldn t write your monitoring scripts in ruby as well

996142
dictionary	arrays
if you re using tcl 8.5 or later you might want to look at using a dictionary instead of an arrays

996150
primitive	int
since int and other primitive aren t objects they can t be used

996152
selectedindex	selecteditem
one option would be to change the binding from selectedindex to selecteditem

996154
reference-type	generics
in this particular case the problem is that you cannot use primitives as generics type parameters see jls â 4.5.1 type arguments may be either reference-type or wildcards.

996158
gnome	kde
is there any way to change the font-size of terminal windows gnome or kde from inside a shell scripting

996159
primitive	int
that s because int is a primitive it is a known issue

996174
duplicates	elements
when adding a web reference in visual-studio 2005 i ve noticed that every elements within the wdsl is duplicates

996174
contains	elements
for elements itemone the interface it generates contains both itemone and itemonefield

996179
value	field
you should never use get set functions for the same reasonâ they re just overly complicated ways to make a field public though access functions that return full-blown objects rather than a basic-type value are reasonable in situations where the returned object s class is a key abstraction in the design

996179
getter	setter
why getter and setter methods are evil

996179
getter	setter
java are getter and setter evil

996179
getter	setter
is it really that wrong not using setter and getter

996192
primitive-types	generics
the reason that int does not work is that you cannot use primitive-types as generics parameters in java

996199
key-value	key
the approach is to insert a row from table1 returing the new primary key generated probably by a sequence in oracle and then insert the dependent records from table2 changing their foreign key-value to the value returned by the first insert

996213
getter	setter
getter and setter methods are put in place to control access to a class-members

996213
value	field
by making all field publicly visible...anybody could write whatever value they wanted to them thereby completely invalidating the entire object

996213
getter	setter
getter and setter methods that just look a little prettier

996213
getter	setter
getter and setter can be useful for variables that you specifically want to encapsulate but you don t have to use them for all variables

996218
getter	setter
getter and setter can be useful for variables that you specifically want to encapsulate but you don t have to use them for all variables

996218
getter	setter
the trouble programmers have and allen holub was right in pointing it out is that they sometimes use getter setter for all variables

996224
getter	setter
getter and setter are used as little more than a mask to make a private variables public

996227
return-type	arguments
he makes a big fuss about the return-type of properties being a bad thing because it can break your calling code - but exactly the same argument would apply to methods arguments

996258
contains	elements
if at any time the two elements being compared are different the arrays contains different elements

996264
swing	awt
i ve written the ui layer in terms of awt abstract windows toolkit or swing which are both abstraction layers

996286
any	set
or any other environment variables which gets set when the user logs in

996308
webserver	nginx
you can of course use other webserver such as iis or nginx

996320
csc	vbc
you could use vbc or csc from the .net they re shipped as part of the framework not sure about the new 3.5 client stuff

996350
temporary	copy
you could of course just copy the table to a temporary table empty the original and copy in the rows just ignoring those that fail but i expect that won t give you the results that you really want

996351
arguments	default
when you call this at the top level it will take only a balls and boxes arguments the others are there as default so that the recursive call can pass different things

996364
webrick	apache
it works fine when started with ruby script server webrick -e production however i m having trouble getting it working in apache with passenger

996375
getter	setter
holub is pushing the point that getter and setter are an evil default antipattern a bad habit that we slip into when designing a system

996375
getter	setter
getter and setter are usually a cop-out when the programmer is just to lazy-evaluation to do the analysis required to determine exactly what each class is and is-not and so we go down the path of it can do anything

996375
getter	setter
getter and setter are evil

996375
getter	setter
getter and setter are an easy trap to fall into

996375
getter	setter
yes beans basically require getter and setter but to me a bean is a special case

996375
getter	setter
getter and setter have their

996376
contains	any
i have a string which could contains multiple delimiters right next to each other for example ||| although it could be any number of adjacent delimiters

996387
asp.net-mvc	webforms
since i m new to asp.net-mvc i ve been trying to figure out how to handle situations done in webforms

996412
32-bit	64bit
watch out for cases where one version declares a variables of a type that is 32-bit but on recompile in vs2008 might be 64bit under some compile targets long

996431
key-value	key
associative arrayss are sets of key-value pairs where each key is unique and is used to locate a corresponding value in the arrays

996445
show	next
a purely visual graphic mockup of each type of page - this is the next thing programmers like to see as in show me how you want it to look and i ll make it happen

996449
arrays	loops
a hash lookup is very fast and sometimes if you have o n 2 loops you may reduce them to o n by organizing them into an arrays keyed by primary key first and then processing them

996449
memcached	apc
query caching almost always translates to memcached sometimes to apc shared memory

996466
contains	set
if your arrays only contains unique elements i would create two hashsets from them and then subtract one from the other to see if the result is the empty set

996495
hash	md5
assume i have two strings or byte arrays a and b which both have the same hash with hash i mean things like md5 or sha1

996495
hash	md5
i tested it with md5 and in all my tests append something to the end made the hash the same but append at the beginning did not

996505
put	get
efficient amortized o 1 get put delete

996513
ruby	php
most languages have a built in json parser php ruby python etc and if not there are libraries available to handle it for you

996525
python	php
and compare draw on for your php implementation even if you don t know much python

996544
environment	building
i don t get worked up about solution files because they don t influence our building environment so i end up making my own to have the exact scope i want and the specific per-solution items like test metadata that i want

996548
postgresql	mysql
perhaps even a free one like postgresql or mysql

996554
actionscript	mxml
the reasonong behind this is that mxml is actually translated into actionscript and then compiled

996556
decrement	increment
you can detect leaks within your own class structures by adding memory counters in your new and delete calls to increment decrement the memory counters and print out a report at your application close

996559
decrement	increment
one way to check your overloading is correct instantiate a counter object per class increment this in the new and decrement it in the delete of the class

996559
decrement	increment
now you would expect your log lines to be coinciding with the increment and decrement points

996560
global-variables	call
for easy browsing you can add a temporary global-variables instance_id and print this and increment on every constructor destructor call

996569
virtual-memory	paging
memory-management virtual-memory paging and all the rest

996575
malloc	free
one lab that i did enjoy and found useful however was writing our own malloc free routines

996576
queue	fifo
if efficiency is being asked for in the question then a non-recursive solution is best and done using a fifo list a queue in c# parlance - i m not a c programmer

996588
authentication	login
if i don t want to use the asp login controls or implement a membership provider how can i tell asp that the loginregister.aspx page has authentication the request if i want to implement my own login system

996593
handler	service
add result event handler for http service

996595
scala	java
the same article mentions that scala had generics long before java really did so even if java did support this there s no guarantee that scala would - they were somewhat restricted when they first designed the feature.

996605
contains	set
or overflow auto so it doesn t collapse which containsers do when they only contains floated elements unless overflow is set

996647
contains	elements
this is an age old problem of interactive elements inside interactive elements but i want a scatterviewitem to contains other surface interactive elements such as a surfacebutton or surfacecheckbox

996652
webforms	asp.net
is there any asp.net framework to build multistep aka wizard webforms that require validation may be dynamic validation based on data submitted accessibility ecc

996656
getter	setter
as corletk points out there is wisdom in thinking long and hard about the highest level of abstraction and not just programming thoughtlessly with getter setter that just let you do an end-run around encapsulation

996670
code-completion	autocomplete
that said to your original question about code-completion i personally turn off autocomplete in favor of on-demand completion

996675
bufferedimage	java-2d
the glyphs itself are rendering in java-2d to bufferedimage s and packed into textures pages along with the glyph measurements

996700
value	field
to get the value out of a form field the .val methods needs to be used

996704
margins	padding
by default and among others have margins and padding associated with them

996708
value	field
i have several value in a field we ll call field1

996716
.when	ready
then .when you have files that are finished and ready for the next build you merge those file changes only into the clean branch

996721
postdata	request
for post request param will return the parameters from the postdata but any parameters specified via a query string in the url itself are still available from the url_param methods

996721
postdata	request
in that case cgi just discards the postdata but you can arrange to have query string parameters that identify what kind of request it was to provide a good error message.

996723
value	field
if you are trying to get the value of the field then use the val methods

996741
internet-explorer	firefox
currently this only works in firefox not on internet-explorer

996756
margins	padding
margins aren t something that surround a single element like padding

996756
margins	padding
if the parent element doesn t have margins or padding like the div elements in your code the margins of the child elements h2 and p determine the distance between the parent elements rather than the child elements

996756
margins	padding
if you just set some padding on your div elements it looks like you should have that anyway the margins won t collapse outside them

996761
linux	osx
it s not hard to create apps that work across gnustep and cocoa meaning potentially on osx win linux bsd...

996772
callback	methods
the each methods will pass the current key the current value and a boolean indicating if there are more elements as arguments to the callback

996778
apache-fop	itext
the only libraries i know of that read the kerning info somwhat correctly are itext and apache-fop from apache

996789
getter	setter
getter and setter make sense when they reflect some sort of coherent idea

996789
getter	setter
it probably makes sense to have getter and it likely makes sense to have setter

996789
getter	setter
there are some advantages of getter and setter over public variables

996789
getter	setter
so i d say to use private variables almost exclusively getter and setter where they have a real meaning in object behavior and not otherwise

996789
getter	setter
just because getter and setter are frequently overused doesn t mean they re useless

996791
versioning	upgrade
one was recently upgrade to use the 1.0 versioning and one is stuck on an earlier preview versioning

996797
persistent	transient
if i just pass the exception-handling back up the stack or don t do this rollback then i will hit an error when i do try to save the other data null or transient object passed to persistent as the bookinglines are already persistented

996803
protected	public
use public private or protected instead

996807
google-chrome	firefox
of course firefox has huge market share and the up and coming google-chrome etc crowd

996807
enterprise	legacy
the problem is - if you application is broadly audience - such as a news site - most enterprise legacy applications still run on ie6 and require it - inferring that the corporate enterprise it crowd will still run ie6

996848
bitwise-and	xor
edit-1 okay looping thru each byte in the arrays and performing bitwise-and not and xor in each respective situation gets the right results

996848
for-loop	arrays
the next problem i am running into is that i cannot perform the for-loop easily after converting the byte arrays into uint32 or long

996856
order-of-evaluation	operators
note that precedence does not define an overall order-of-evaluation - it just defines how the operands of an expression with several operators will be combined

996873
hash	md5
using a hash function like md5 is probably overkill for random error detection

996927
having	select
treat this the same way you would the option of having a flash-only web site or a javascript-rich web site or any type of site that would make life easier for a select grouping of users and be annoying or downright unusable for the rest

996941
any	set
if you truly want to manually invoke the stored proc and get back a set of results without any orm or standardized storage mechanism doing it for you this would be your best bet

996961
configuration	environment
the manual workaround according to what is suggested on the pages above is adding the line below to configuration environment production.rb

996990
backslash	regex
question marks don t mean anything in regex in the spot they appear in the expression so they don t have to be escaped with a backslash

996996
instance-variables	accessor
i know i could just create a button instance-variables and iterate through all the accessor and add them that way but that seems a bit kludgy and doesn t really follow the ruby way of doing things

996998
perl	ruby
briefly on open source languages prominent in web development python ruby or perl all have helpful communities btw perl doesn t have to be written obscurely at all it s just that good perl programers like to use the shorthand

997007
wordpress	blogs
i have two wordpress blogs running on the same server so they both have access to the same file system

997007
directory	folder
is it possible to have both of these blog share a common theme directory so that i only need to modify one templates folder

997012
digits	zero
however this initialization process seems a bit odd - it s using the hex digits starting from the left with no zero padding to round to a multiple of 8 hex digits so the number 0x123456789 would be split into 0x12345678 and 0x9 rather than the more customary 0x00000001 and 0x23456789

997014
default	reset
however you can include a versioning number in the application rms data and when you load the application you can detect if it was from a previous versioning and decide to update it or reset to the new default

997030
decimal	octal
0 means use the usual rules no prefix is decimal 0 prefix is octal and 0x is hexa -- just like eval

997037
asp.net-mvc	wcf
for our current project we are going to use asp.net-mvc so will restful wcf be any helpful from that point of view

997042
contains	any
pushing to a submodule does not in any way affect the version of code used by the project contains the submodule so i m not sure what you d want a hook to do anyway

997046
hosts-file	hosts
internally it s calling ws2_32.dll getnameinfo which states name resolution can be by the domain name systemd dns a local hosts or by other naming mechanisms - so i m assuming it s those other naming mechanisms that s causing it to be so slow but does anyone know what those mechanisms are

997048
ruby-on-rails	django
two frameworks that i would suggest for couchdb are ruby on ruby-on-rails and django

997048
ruby-on-rails	django
both of these aren t at the web framework level but they require a minimal amount of work to set up and are pretty easy to get going in ruby-on-rails and django

997048
ruby-on-rails	django
the django approach still requires some packages to be installed so if you just can t do that for some reason the ruby-on-rails approach is the way to go

997093
silverlight	wpf
if you have plans on using your data code in a silverlight wpf or any other format then i d suggest sticking with wcf

997094
.net	wcf
i have a wcf application running on .net 3.5 sp1 hosted in iis7 on a windows server 2008 64-bit

997096
email-validation	validation
it s useful to note that most regex email-validation techniques will validation most e-mail addresses but they will most likely allow some carefully crafted invalid addresses or worst

997105
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to make this work in firefox ie and google-chrome

997108
hash	md5
the hash functions being discussed here are typically cryptography sha1 md5

997108
append	input
are you saying that you located two inputs which had the same md5 hash and then append something to the end or beginning of the input and found that adding at the end resulted in the same md5 as that for the original input

997124
javadoc	doxygen
i think what you want is for doxygen to produce html output that is more similar to javadoc which has both pros and cons

997124
javadoc	doxygen
i haven t delved into doxygen modules so i don t have any experience with whether that might segment things similar to how javadoc does with packages

997135
updating	updates
lastly iâ m updating the user-interface via the updates methods on the updatespanel

997135
filtering	sorting
this all works fine with sorting and filtering on the gridview but when iâ m paging it the grid pages like it should but the paging template always stays on the first page show 1 as active

997138
button	popup
you need to either move your modalpopupextender and code within the updatepanel or assign a update trigger that is attached to your ok button within your modal popup

997145
spaces	output
only use crc if computation resources are very tight some embed environments or you need to store transport many output values and spaces bandwidth is tight as crcs are usually 32-bit where an md5 output is 128-bit sha1 160 bit and other sha variants up to 512 bit

997147
coverity	klocwork
assuming you can t use dynamic memory checkers like the open-source valgrind tool on linux static analysis tools like the commercial product coverity prevent and klocwork insight may be of use

997152
any	set
to bind a collection to a listview or any itemscontrol for that matter you need to set its itemssource property

997168
python	php
however if the option is there python could be a better choice given all the frameworks that are now available but again from a hosting viewpoint php is easy to find unless you are hosting from your own server

997177
perl	php
its a personal decision the plusses you stated for php would push me toward php over perl

997197
perl	php
there are a lot of perl purists but i know far too many people who scoff at perl s syntax as much as they do php s

997197
perl	php
php is a doman-specific language perl is not

997197
perl	ruby
perl doesn t really have much in the way of doing such a thing natively so it is almost always easier to work with a framework or web programming library with perl much the same as it is with other common cgi langauges like python and ruby

997197
perl	php
for that reason if you re looking to get into web programming i would probably forego perl altogether than start with one of those other two languages if you choose to not start with php

997199
contains	elements
an open source refactoring plugins it currently contains a single refactoring plus the related gui elements it might be a good example for you

997204
integrated-security	connection-string
remove integrated-security true from your connection-string and optional add persist security info true

997204
credentials	account
when true the current windows account credentials are used for authentication

997221
perl	php
this may upset perl programmers but i would learn php

997221
perl	php
once you are a few months into php you can then try out perl and most of its semantics will be familiar minus the api and modules

997221
perl	php
the php api uses a lot of functions that would be familiar to c programmers and you get to grips with passing by reference along with some core oo features in php 5 you will learn oo programming in perl too however and the syntax really isn t much different

997221
perl	php
my disclaimer - i learnt it the opposite way around - perl then php

997221
perl	php
perl was version 5.x and php 3.x to 4.x

997228
value	field
it s challenging to do it efficiently because you end up querying using an expression rather than field value directly and such queries don t use indexes well

997237
hosts-file	hosts
if you re not able to or comfortable with using an alpha versioning you might look into a static ip dhcp reservation ddns or a hosts entry which may only move the problem so you can get some consistency

997238
itextsharp	pdfbox
since i m a .net guy i ve taken a look at both pdfbox and itextsharp

997251
required	checked
many packages nowadays support pkg-config or something similar which allows you to checked for existence of libraries and also can supply you the compiler and linker-flags required

997272
order	add
plus go away from your code for 2 months and come back...figuring out in what order to add params to your arrays in which situations will become a massive headache

997277
ruby	php
this isn t necessarily that bad of an idea since php lacks the keyword arguments feature found in many other modern programming languages python ruby etc.

997279
directory	folder
to make this more general and allow copying folder not in the root directory i would do something like this

997288
arguments	default
furthermore perl only uses the default variables when you don t supply any arguments for what to print

997289
value	field
you can also read all form field of the pdf documents including their names and value into xml fdf form data format and xfdf files.

997294
background-image	background-color
this has a background-color and a background-image

997309
hash	md5
the algorithm message digest 5 or md5 it is a one-way cryptography hash function

997309
hash	md5
md5 performs many binary operations on the message binary data for example of an iso image to compute a 128-bit hash

997309
hash	md5
it is useful to check the integrity of a downloaded package such as ubuntu because generating the md5 hash will be identical if the package is exactly the same as the authentication source

997310
required	checked
you ll have to write code inside the called function to checked for the presence and the type of required parameters

997311
properties-file	web.xml
for example can a web.xml file pick up values from a per deployment properties-file

997312
perl	php
why either perl or php

997312
perl	php
why not python or ruby both of which have excellent web frameworks available and are much easier to learn than perl but much better-designed than php

997316
associations	model
i d probably opt for a cat and dog model and then use a has_and_belongs_to_many associations

997319
document-ready	.when
document-ready .when page is ready meaning fully rendering

997327
catalyst	poe
i would suggest looking at perltidy mason catalyst template-toolkit2 moose dbi and poe as relevant keywords to start searching once you learn the basic of the language

997333
.net	wcf
you should use wcf for all new web services development with .net

997333
.net	wcf
wcf is baked in to .net

997342
radio-button	checkbox
...when in fact the radio-button and checkbox get wrapped with a span tag and the css class gets applied there

997347
selected	button
the latest version of swfupload does work and it does so by transparently overlaying the swf on top of your selected files button

997361
quicksort	mergesort
in my experience in school is that quicksort and mergesort are the other two basic sorting algorithms introduced with or shortly after bubble sort

997362
dexterity	z3c.form
nobody can say what you must use archetypes formlib z3c.form or dexterity

997368
zipfile	archive
i want to specify a location inside an archive jar or zipfile

997372
updating	updates
you may also add an autoincremented last_update field to the column to make sure you re updating a column not been updates since your page has loaded

997381
temporary	copy
you need to copy currentspaceposition into a local temporary variables prior to where-clause and then use that within the where criteria

997383
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
however if you want to modify the methods dispatch for a single instances i think your only option is a conditional statement within your viewdidappear methods or to consider a redesign that does not require separate methodss on first and subsequent appearances from your description separating your code into viewdidload and viewwillappear functions seems to make sense

997384
processor	cpu
instead it reads that location and a bunch of nearby locations into a processor cache that lives on the cpu and can be accessed much more quickly than main memory

997408
selected	button
you will need to capture the event which fires when a button is selected

997408
selected	button
when you get the event for a specific button being selected you can set the other button which it is exclusive to to be disabled

997421
instrumentation	trace
memory leaks can be tricky to track down even in instrumentation and you ll often find that it looks like foundation classes such as nsdictionary are leaking like a sieve but i have always been able to trace it back to an abnormality in my code

997423
selected	button
there you can selected the message form and button to the message form

997427
python	java
by the way you will probably find c++ to be the fastest then java then python

997434
conditional	operators
this looks to me like a classic case of needing operators i always want ensure that a tuples satisfying these conditional exists and give me the key.

997442
viewwillappear	viewdidload
it s almost certainly over-clever and should probably be separated into viewdidload and viewwillappear rather than two versioning of viewwillappear

997473
mbunit	nunit
but i think nunit mbunit and xunit.net all support transactional tests out of the box or with a contrib project

997474
constructor	object
to get that i will need to instantiate a datetime object with the date string as the constructor

997509
asp.net-mvc	webforms
is it easy or even possible to use the reportviewer in asp.net-mvc as you can with webforms

997511
perl	php
i use both perl and php actively

997511
perl	php
typically i use php for web development and perl for heavyweight scripting tasks

997511
perl	php
i used php for at least a couple years off and on before i started using perl with 5.x

997511
perl	php
after having used both languages for a while i find the syntax and usability of the core perl language to be slightly better than php

997511
perl	php
on the flip side looking at the legacy system with perl and mason i have to say that i prefer reading another programmers convulated php over perl with mason

997542
perl	php
php is what you d get if you outsourced the development of a well-thought-out language like perl to people who spend half their time answering amex faqs and half their time programming

997545
.net	wcf
the client is on the .net compact framework which does not support wcf so i need to make sure the wcf keeps supporting asp style webservices

997547
selected	button
i ve got a checklist box full of 10 items and i d like to perform an action on the selected items when you click the report button

997547
selected	button
is there any examples of how to upon clicking a button get the a list of items selected

997549
google-chrome	firefox
ive got a problem with ie which is fine in firefox google-chrome etc.

997549
google-chrome	firefox
- as i say absolutely fine with firefox and google-chrome

997561
value	field
each object has a value field that can be referred just by writing the class name

997576
.net	wcf
the .net compact framework does support a subset of wcf

997585
textbox	button
what about changing the focus back to the textbox in the button click event

997602
put	get
update if i switch around the lib paths and put platformsdk lib before the vc lib switch i get this error

997608
arrays	loops
then loops through both arrays and compare each element

997610
web-services	webserver
how hard is adding a basic web-services interface to an existing java server application without having to turn it into a .war or embedding a small webserver like jetty

997613
python	c++
this is why any computations that require such tight looping are usually written in c c++ and wrapped for use by languages like python

997633
postback	ajax
i m using this same code from other ajax postback in my page without a problem

997650
delegatecommand	mvvm
i will replace the events with commands using the delegatecommand eliminate the views references on the view-model and i think that s all because the examples that i saw of mvvm is much like mvp

997658
web-services	api
check out the restlet api which provides a painless way to implement restful web-services that can run inside a web container or standalone

997661
data-structures	tree
take a look at the more general article on tree data-structures if you want more on this

997686
display	height
it can be done using display table with 100 height but then naturally ie doesn t support that either

997694
contains	lookup
now before being able to call getcreatedexceptions upon any methods down the stack we just need to actually lookup into the codebase and resolve all methodsreference instances to methodsdefinition instances actually contains the byte code with some caching to avoid scanning existing branches

997694
lookup	any
that s the most time-consuming part of the code since codebase object does not implement any methods lookup on top of cecil but that should be doable

997695
panning	pan
have a sl control on a page that loads a passed in url or aspx like the browser control for winforms - the reason i would like this is the ability to have a page visible and use zooming panning to view various parts of the page - this may sound stupid but it would allow users to view modify elements w o having to open a sep windows iframe etc to view it and the zoom pan would be bad ass

997707
python	java
i think generally python is a bit faster than ruby but not really near java c c++ c#

997710
javascript	dom
if you are using yui or jquery they have javascript event listening functions that will run code when the dom is done loading

997724
python	java
many languages java and thus most jvm-based language implementations c# and thus most .net-based language implementatons objective c python 3 ... support unicode strings by preference or even nearly exclusively you have to go out of your way to work with strings of bytes rather than of unicode characters

997736
internationalization	translation
another thing is even if the standard right now is that the app will only be released in english you are also blocking the possibility of internationalization with ascii adding to the work that needs to be done when the company policy decides that translation are a good thing

997751
data-structures	tree
the comparative benefits of tree over other data-structures depend on the type of data you are storing and the types of operations you are planning on doing over the data

delphi	c++
i m still not entirely familiar with how delphi manages components and projects - most of my experience is in c++ - so this may be part of my problem.

997795
delphi	basic
delphi has long supported a few basic numeric types and i was wondering how they are related to each other

997795
integer	numeric
this leads me into thinking the base signed numeric types are smallint integer and int64

997795
compatibility	platform
lastly how should i define int and uint especially with regard to c++ compatibility and a future switch to other platform possibly also 64bit

997804
.net	wcf
if you can use .net 2 or above consider wcf

997811
pipe	tail
this is less than ideal obviously because of the increase in disk io due to these temp files -- what i really would like is an enhanced tail -f that would terminate the pipe cleanly after a certain number of seconds

997815
pipe	tail
edit actually this kills tail doesn t cause it to exit gracefully so we lose the entire pipe

997827
margins	padding
typically one would either set margins 20px on the inner or padding 20px on the outer depending on the exact effect you re looking for

997836
any	set
set the outer div s positioninging context to relative and then you can move any inner content around w positioning absolute

997861
constructor	object
only then can the constructor run and give the object a value

997865
assign	add
but i don t know how to assign a widgetviewmodel as a datacontext of a whole widget - i can t add datacontext attributes to user-controls because widgetviewmodel is defined later in the code

997878
environment	building
have any of you found a good solution for handing off building to the non-programmers so that they could successfully install and configure it in a qa staging and production environment

997878
configuration	environment
if we set up the qa staging and production environments so they appear identical to our software virtual servers and lans etc qa should be able to transition ready software with no configuration changes directly to the staging environment and staging to production

997883
value	field
in which some field can have default value or otherwise be optional

997885
arrays	map
however i get the error must evaluate to a collection map arrays or null

997908
value	field
if you ve really got to do something like this something i would do would be to create a cck textfield field with unlimited value perhaps called field_value and go into the display to hide it from view

997912
variables	boolean
you are creating a value whose type is a string and when creating assigning a value without quotes you are creating a variables whose type is boolean

997915
value	field
better would be to have a table for each axial value you want to have on the graph and then either join to it or even just put the data field there and update that record when if values arrive

997920
execute	declare
inversion-of-control di frameworks are components that abstract this concept of linking and allow you to write code that declare links between components and then have the ability to execute these links

997931
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch blocks that handle any thrown exception-handling should remove the appropiate exception-handling from the list unless a rethrow instruction is detected

997962
jtextfield	jlabel
however you could use a jtextfield and just change the foreground background colors to make it appear as a jlabel

997990
32-bit	16-bit
for 16-bit they were 16 byte large and for 32-bit they are 32-bit large

997990
32-bit	64bit
for 64 bit the windows 64bit platform llp64 defines them as 32-bit

997994
arrays	loops
after p number of passes the p last items will be in the correct order so you don t need to process them. the actual code posted will always examine every pair in the arrays so it will always run the inner loops n 2 times

997999
contains	any
note that asp.net 4 will still reject any url paths that contains characters in the ascii character range of 0x00-0x1f since those are considered invalid url characters rfc 2396 considers these characters invalid and on windows servers running iis6 or higher the http.sys protocol device driver automatically rejects urls with these characters as well

998015
dictionary	arrays
leopard also introduced nspointerarrays nshashmap and nshashtable an arrays dictionary set with additional options like using weak references that make them a rather convenient to use in a garbage collected environment

998015
nscopying	nscoding
these structures adopt nscoding and nscopying plus nsfastenumeration on 10.5+ so they work seamlessly with native objective-c code

998016
capitalization	capitalize
as for capitalization capitalize the first letter

998016
pascal	delphi
cardinal and longword didn t exist in delphi s and turbo pascal s 16-bit days

998016
32-bit	64bit
the longint and longword types will become 64bit types because they have always been the same size as the pointer type which was 32-bit even in 16-bit times

998025
sinatra	ramaze
the three i like are sinatra ramaze or _why s 4k camping get the one with the bugs fixed

998033
hardware	monitor
there is no way to ensure 100 uptime -- reliability is a combinations of having redundancy in hardware and services monitor 24x7 staff to fix problems etc

998036
export	csv
right now i can export to csv and then import that file into another table but that s time consuming for repetitive work

998067
attributes	properties
it sounds like your additional 2 properties are link attributes and should therefore be represented in a class that models the managerid and the 2 addtional fields

998072
stream	send
i attempted to write an istream adaptor class which forwarding the input functions on to a wrapped input stream cin and also send what was read to the log file

998073
contains	elements
list 1 may contains elements not in list 2 and visa versa

998082
subtract	time
this example subtract 5 ms from the next time but you could make it a full second if you need it

998082
any	set
the big advantage of this is that it is a set based solution and will be much faster than any iterative approach

998092
selected	button
well you want to delete the selected item and you put a button in every row for that job

998095
sql-server	oracle
to clarify my goal i am looking to port an orm implementation in c# to sql-server - unfortunately the implementation relies on oracle dc to avoid computing insert update delete orders amongst rows

998100
delphi	c++
although not a comparison with c++ mfc they highlight a lot of delphi qualities

998101
contains	any
based on my experience with this kind of thing the contains page cannot directly call functions from or make any sort of javascript contact with the iframe page

998101
google-chrome	firefox
this may appear a bit convoluted but it can be adapted in a number of directions and should work in at least ie firefox google-chrome and probably safari and opera.

998113
double	int
the value property is an object so i can be set to string int double etc

998113
value	field
what i want to do is throw an error if the an attempt is made to set the field.value to a value that is too long for the field and implement inotifypropertychanged

998113
value	field
my problem is the value property is a member of the generic field class and i do not know how to get the name of the property inside that class

998114
cursor	row
you could just walk a cursor keep variables for the last value time returned and if the current one is more than a second ahead loop one second at a time using the previous value and the new time until you get the the current row s time

998143
quadtree	r-tree
the simplest sturcture is the grid index then the different search tree kd-tree quadtree with r-tree as the most frequently used a generalized b-tree for more dimensions

998144
getter	setter
if you had a macros language you could write a function like open a popup that allows me to type in some text then generates the getter and setter including its javadoc based on templates

998149
type-safety	generics
however you should also probably consider using generics if you want to have some type-safety in your field data redefine your field class as field where you store t _value instead of an object

998174
type-safety	generics
i added generics to the class instead of using object to add type-safety

998180
linux	unix
this works on both unix linux and windows machines

998231
procedure	records
with millions of records in each table and a dynamic set of search parameters i am having some trouble optimizing the procedure

998233
substitution	replace
perl s substitution operator by default a uses the first match b only replace one match and c returns true if a replacement was made and false if it wasn t

998248
g++	gcc
i m developing an embedded application using gcc g++ compiled for arm-eabi

998248
fclose	fopen
this wouldn t be so bad except that it s also bringing in lots of stdio stuff like printf fopen fclose and other file functions

998269
base-class	subclass
works fine and with different value for a maxhp and cat maxhp -- in this case the subclass is not inheriting the static from the base-class since so to speak it s hiding it with its own homonymous one

998283
order	add
in order to run it you must either use full path or add this directory to your systems search path via the control panels

998286
keyboard	mouse
the parent page has a couple of event listeners for mouse and keyboard events as shown below i m using the prototype library

998315
hide	show
i made it hide and show again the #results and it makes ie rendering it and realise its height again

998334
pointers	stack
probably you want to allocate them on the heap so that you can refer a pointers to them that will not be invalid once stack frame is left

998365
nested	order
i understand that i can use projection to achieve what i wanted but i thought there might be an easy way to do it since in t-sql world it s perfectly possible with a few nested queries or joins and order bys

998366
windows-xp	windows
how to do this so that it ll work on any windows vista windows-xp and windows 2000 machine

998370
python	java
the answer is that python is inherently much slower than c++ or even java

998386
protected	public
however if the variables have to be protected or public use an explicit access methods or rely on the local scope rule i just demonstrated

998396
display	width
if however you want to have your table just expand to a certain width i would go for percent values instead of fixed tables mainly because of the fact that your users will have different display sizes and resolution and therefore the according browser windows with may vary

998396
firefox	safari
the attribute works perfectly on firefox safari etc

998396
any	set
this is just an example that specifies a minimum width of 70px otherwise it doesn t set any width

998413
postgresql	mysql
while he doesn t have examples for derby directly i suspect you could probably adapt them to your problem particularly the postgresql or mysql one it seems somewhat platform agnostic

998433
return-value	arguments
the stub factory mkfun converts any pointers to a c function that gets an integer value as its only arguments and does not have a return-value into a corresponding haskell function

998449
defined	declare
how can i declare and defined a function so that it is only accessible from a single function

998451
localization	translation
staticity is a life-time and technically memory localization property it tells if the variables will be global in the scope of a class when in a class or a translation unit when used with a global variables defined in a cpp

998500
executable-jar	jar
what you probably want to do is to create an executable-jar file which you can do in eclipse by selected file- export- runnable jar file

998500
executable	jar
note however that the resulting jar file is not a real windows binary executable - it still needs a jre installed on the target computer

998513
user-interface	look-and-feel
it is recommended that form controls remain faithful to the look-and-feel of the system s global user-interface

998516
reserved-words	keyword
view is not a keyword or reserved-words in any way

998520
children	nodes
when the nodes has no more children dump the path

998520
arrays	loops
just loops till the arrays is empty

998523
subtract	time
manually subtract the user s utc offset hours from dates created using date being based on the current date time

998529
google-chrome	firefox
the problem never happens for other browsers such as firefox google-chrome opera

998544
font-size	display
i find myself fiddling alot with height padding font-size and display properties to get them to look how i want and even them it s never perfect in every browser

998548
binary-search	radix-sort
if you are dealing with a 500gb file then you might want to use a faster lookup methods than binary-search - namely a radix-sort which is essentially a variant of hashing

998551
xcode	wwdc
my only option at this point seems to be downgrading to xcode 3.1 though i ve seen 3.2 work perfectly with iphone 3.0 at wwdc

998552
functional-programming	imperative-programming
i ve often heard that functional-programming solves a lot of problems that are difficult in procedural imperative-programming

998553
static-assert	assert
boost provides a fine static-assert facility in c++ that even provides half-decent errors when assert fail

998571
unsigned	integer
i am trying to write a c++ templates function that will throw a runtime exception-handling on integer overflow in casts between different integral types with different widths and possible signed unsigned mismatch

998571
boost	stl
edit for various reasons stl isn t available so i can t use std numeric_limits and anything from boost is right out

998577
cobertura	emma
cobertura emma for code coverage

998587
rewrite	rule
i used a rewrite rule for all files that look like a directory to do this initially but it messed up some diretory redirects i created so in the short-term i d rather just do it for a specific file

998619
google-chrome	safari
yes this is how safari and any browser based on webkit google-chrome behave

998635
digits	base
in many organization oss or other the first digits of a versioning corresponds to a complete new generation of product usually tied to a major reorganization of the code base or even a complete rewrite

998637
contains	any
if for example your original dictionary contains any custom data types the description output would appear something like

998644
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
my main view controller is a uitabbarcontroller with 4 uinavigationcontroller as the tab bar items

998646
perl	php
any nix or bsd including current mac os has perl installed by default - you can t say this about php

998646
perl	php
it exists in 3 languages perl php and python

998648
base-class	inherited
i have multiple objects that inherited from a base-class and am trying to decide how the user should edit them

998648
hide	show
i was thinking i could have one web page for each one or i could have a single web page and show hide the fields for the subclass

998655
google-chrome	firefox
if i copy a 32bit image from photoshop or ie firefox google-chrome and run the above code the output loses its alpha channel instead it is saved against a black background

998656
scala	java
scala has a design goal of being as easily callable from java as possible and java has no concept of overloading a class name based on type parameter arity

998670
duplicates	elements
it will resolve conflicts with duplicates elements

998671
boolean	int
a magic 8ball is something most people can relate to and it s an introduction to basic strings floats int io cli boolean and rng s using only the simplest tools

998701
declarative	imperative
you have less control over the algorithms used since it s more declarative than imperative

998702
debian	linux
the server i ve been trying is just django s built in server using manage.py python manage.py 0.0.0.0 8000 since i need to access it externally on linux debian

998710
constructor	object
constructor to create an object with supplied fields so that i can make fields final and hence immutable

998716
deployment	install
the trick it turns out was to use the new deployment tools foundation from ms to wrap my managed functions into an unmanaged dll eschewing the install class completely

998718
callback	methods
specifically ensure that any code dependent upon the async code is executed after it has been completed via a callback methods or something similar

998728
installation	building
i think you re certainly better with service contract since it serves as a warranty on your software and if you re trying to building a reputation it s in your interest to have a bug-free installation too

998736
constructor	object
if the object is immutable there s no need for a copy constructor

998743
python	c++
unless the swigged c++ code is specifically set up to release the gil global interpreter lock before long delays and re-acquire it before getting back to python multi-threading might not prove very useful in practice

998756
vbscript	jscript
custom actions even without tools like installshield can be .exe vbscript jscript or dll based

998757
textbox	button
in ie8 the textbox portion of the control seems to be disabled and only allows a file to be specified by finding it with the browse button

998787
rewrite	rule
your view rewrite rule has a conditional that s not being met so it s never even being tested against

998789
recording	playing
one idea i m playing with is to add a column in the user table that says if it has any contact_info recording or not

998789
updating	updates
also i was wondering if upon inserting any record into contact_info the dbms has to verify that the record exists it would already be accessing that record for the sake of verification and so updating it when i updates a contact_info record should not be that costly performance-wise

998808
perl	ruby
does anyone know of a good .net library that allows me to parse source code files but not only .net source code files like java perl ruby etc

998809
postorder	inorder
if you want to get to the bottom of the tree first then you do an inorder or perhaps postorder search

998813
required	checked
is there something that will let me provide a base url suffixes and xml document schema or better yet samples from which cardinality and such can be inferred and out pops the wsdl 2.0 that you aren t gonna need but that the management will required so that marketing boxes can be checked off

998815
binary-tree	nodes
from wikipedia to traverse a non-empty binary-tree in inorder perform the following operations recursively at each nodes

998832
json	xml
big idea the big idea behind this is that the user would be able to specify any arbitrary non-recursive json structure and then also be able to edit the structure with a gui-based interaction this would be similar to the xml editor grid view in xml spy

998847
ip-address	hostname
the protocol portion is optional but if provided a hostname or ip-address should also be provided both of which have fewer allowed characters than the rest of the uri

998853
versioning	upgrade
one thing that may be different is that this app was created back when asp.net-mvc beta was the latest versioning and was upgrade to the rc and then rtm as they were released

998865
folder	dir
it has scripting presentations etc in it.s i should probably create a bin subdir in the mesh folder and put that bin dir in my path

998881
build-process	scons
i m investigating using scons for our build-process as we develop c++ for multiple platforms

998902
put	get
of the http methods like post get put delete etc

998911
margins	padding
without margins and padding the list items are no longer indented

998911
default	reset
if you re looking for a way to reset the default styling on html you re better off using something like eric meyer s reset css

998911
margins	padding
otherwise just zero out the margins and padding of each individual element that s bothering you

998911
margins	padding
i always zero out the padding and margins of body and h1 as soon as i start on a page.

998914
highlight	selected
then highlight it and selected scripting insert statement don t remember the exact wording

998921
json	xml
you can use the rpc or requestbuilder to handle server calls using rpc or json or xml

998923
execution	exit
use a call to exit to end page execution after the file stream is finished

998948
base	zero
the base operators of a regular expression are union concatenation and kleene star zero or more copies of

998963
bitwise-xor	xor
bitwise-xor xor

998981
.net	wcf
however if you re going to use web services for this purpose in .net you should use wcf if at all possible

998988
decimal	hex
would be the same as 10 hex is 16 decimal and would refer to the dle data link escape character

998999
json	xml
under the hood it s just a restful http-based api that returns json-formatted data rather than xml so if your server-side code can open an http connection and parse the json response no browser-side code is required

999010
put	get
when i put inner on a different domain i get the problematic behavior

999018
put	get
the primary problem with sending byte s over web-services is that they get put in the soap body which is gets encoded as a base 64 string

999028
value	field
it s not possible to have a ref or out value as a field in a class

999028
ref	out
consequently if you were allowed to declare a parameter as ref or out there would be no way to keep the complete snapshot of the function at the time we had left off

999044
value	field
requesting the value and field in the excel files to match the business requirements and the format to be the same for every third party that sends them is what i want to do but the request is falling on deaf ears

999066
implements	abstract
the function in question belongs to an abstract parent class program and is declared abstract static because it should be implements in its child classes such as tvprogram

999077
ftps	ftp
this actually only works for http http ftp and ftps connections

999085
click	mouse
whats the equivelent for a mouse click event

999093
abstract-methods	static-methods
when extending the class you may create a static-methods of the same name but you are not in fact implementing a static abstract-methods

999093
methods	extend
if you extend that class and create a static methods of the same signature you are not actually overriding the superclass s static methods

999097
.when	ready
if you need that to run .when the document is ready wrap it in and it will run at the appropriate time

999103
mouseover	mouseup
it works for click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout keydown keypress and keyup

999111
installation	environment
you may want to consider a standard environment variables that describes the root of your ultra-portable installation of vim and set the runtime path using that environment variables

999113
version-control	git
going by the number of questions on this site for these three distributed version-control systems it seems like git either

999113
bazaar	git
you should be aware however that open source projects borrow ideas from one another or have similar features developed independently one example would be finding bugs by bisecting searching history for commit that introduced the bug which was as far as i know developed first in git and then implemented as plugin in bazaar and first extension and currently core functionality in mercurial

999113
version-control	git
still there is this persistent meme that git has worse documentation than say subversion with its version-control with subversion also known as svnbook and mercurial the definitive guide also known as hg-book .

999113
python	java
git is scriptable and is based on data model allowing independent reimplementations see jgit git written in java while mercurial has python bindings for writing extensions and is based largely on api allowing change of underlying repository format revlog - revlog-ng .

999113
gnome	xfce
we have kde and we have gnome and xfce and other windows managers and desktop envirionments

999113
emacs	vim
we have emacs and vim and other programmer s editors

999113
ubuntu	debian
we have rpm-based fedora core mandriva suse and deb-based debian ubuntu and tgz-based slackware and source-based gentoo distributions

999113
bazaar	git
and we have git mercurial and bazaar

999118
unpivot	pivot
i m not a microsoft user so i ll give you a link to using pivot and unpivot and leave the rest to you

999123
textbox	button
if the user clicks the next button i need to load the textbox with the relevant data

999124
json	xml
liquid xml - json schema editor graphical json schema editor and validator

999124
json	xml
xml validatorbuddy - json and xml editor supports json syntax-checking syntax-coloring auto-completion json pointer evaluation and json schema validation

999128
credentials	security
i do not know enough about code security risks you have in your environment but i would have thought that storing the credentials object in client memory only would be safe enough for most situations

999147
required	checked
i d then call that methods whenever a permission checked is required and take some action based on the outcome

999149
any	set
i realize now that this probably has to do with the total ordering and mapping of the set of natural numbers to any countable sets

999154
redland	jena
i m the creator of redland which include native triple stores in c plus i ve used some of the java systems like jena and sesame

999154
schema	rdbms
if your problem and schema is more dynamic - graphy - you may benefit from the triple store approach where it s easier to hop across the data than it is typically in a rdbms world aka joins

999163
synchronous	.when
in vb .net .when you call raiseevent x is the function that handles the event x processed asynchronous or synchronous

999171
constructor	object
xna s xml serializer the contenttypewriter class which you extend to create custom content writers requires that the object have a constructor with no arguments to default to

999171
constructor	object
drawablegamecomponent however requires a game object in its constructor and will not let you set the game after the object is initialized

999174
gnome	kde
there are ways to do this for both kde and gnome

999192
push	pull
the program simply pull some information from the database and do some calculation then push some data back to the database

999197
malloc	free
have you considered writing your own functions to malloc and free texture memory

999203
display	width
part of this may be keeping track of the display height and width of the rows and columns so that the display system can iterate over the range until the desired width and height of cells has been collected

999207
constructor	object
5 generics you can specify new to be able to instantiate your generic objects but that object needs to have a default constructor

999215
player	movie
make sure you also test your movie in a browser or in the standalone player

999272
textwrangler	bbedit
open the eula file up with bbedit or the free textwrangler and see what encoding it uses

999280
digits	base
has a finite number of digits if you re working in base pi

999287
exception-handling	try-catch
the service is instantiated in a try-catch block and no exception-handling is being throw but the output windows displays

999295
file-descriptor	dev-null
it only works because when file-descriptor 2 is closed and dev-null is opened it gets file-descriptor 2

999296
updating	updates
updating a managed object context from a fetched results controllers does updates the controllers s result object set

999297
wicket	spring
eg a different framework wicket vs struts vs spring vs pure ejb j2ee architecture number of distributed tiers one box setup or 3 tier setup

999301
dictionary	arrays
it sounds to me like you simply want a dictionary of arrays

999340
abstract-class	pure-virtual
if we define a abstract-class which has a pure-virtual destructor why do we have to give a definition of a destructor in the abstract-class

999347
myeclipse	maven
i had a couple of issues getting maven to work with myeclipse

999347
m2eclipse	maven
first even when i enabled all m2eclipse features checkbox i still couldn t check out a project as a maven project from subversion

999351
any	set
looking at the error messages that you are seeing it seems to me that your terminal encoding is probably set to koi8-r in which case you don t need to perform any decoding on the input data

999354
ruby	php
i bet this will get closed soon but to answer the question only developers whose only skill was creating very simple websites will lose their jobs because of php python drupal ruby etc

999376
getter	setter
in your class1.m file the getter and setter methods for today are never created

999388
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it feels like a webforms hack for asp.net-mvc

999402
abstract-class	pure-virtual
if your abstract-class has only the virtual destructor declared and no other pure-virtual methods making the destructor pure will prevent somebody from being able to instantiate the abstract-class

999405
google-chrome	firefox
the way i see it open source will absolutely flourish for applications that us normal users use every day be it operating system linux browser firefox google-chrome etc etc

999414
firefox	opera
here is a working solution for ie7+ firefox opera that achieves exactly what you are looking for

999427
csv	xml
where code is what you would expose to the public whether it be a url service csv xml etc

999428
progress-bar	progress
this isn t a root cause answer or solution but if michael is right and there s nothing you can really do about it then you might just want to consider visually informing the user that your application is active with a progress-bar or nifty progress circle

999434
python	ruby
there are some things at ruby linguistics and some links therefrom though it doesn t seem anywhere close to what nltk is for python yet

999450
pixels	line
for example if i m writing an algorithm to compute the pixels in a line between two points i d leave a comment saying it is an implementation of bresenham s algorithm

999450
queue	fifo
for example if i was implementing a queue admittedly you d use a framework for a queue i d say something like fifo data structure with o 1 insert remove and size

999459
interpreter	runtime
its an interpreter language code not compile to machine code until runtime that s just the nature of it

999468
networkx	igraph
we tried networkx and igraph

999479
lgpl	gpl
the free software foundation has consistently claimed that software linked to a library covered by gpl is a derived work and thus needs to be covered by gpl itself indeed that s the main difference of the lgpl license

999482
jruby	mri
i m trying to understand the practical impact of different threading models between mri ruby 1.8 and jruby

999482
jruby	mri
and also are there any practical examples of code in mri ruby 1.8 that will have worse performance characteristics on jruby due to different threading models

999486
silverlight	wpf
i take it you re using regular wpf not silverlight

999491
jruby	mri
i do not know of any place where mri ruby 1.8 code runs slower on jruby

999497
jruby	mri
so the only real performance difference is the fact that your mri yarv ruby applications won t be able to utilize all of your processor cores but your jruby applications will happily do so

999506
arrays	loops
to save it all to one file loops over the _post form arrays which will have number_of_forms items forms and create the csv

999513
populate	row
the history table will be populate by triggers and each row will be a denormalized representation of the row that changed

999533
compatibility	platform
for backward compatibility sake i would also like to have the platform able to import ms-word seamlessly

999559
activation	account
send a confirmation email to the address provided with an activation key that the user has to use to activate their account to verify that the email is valid

999573
shell	bash
i searched but there doesn t seem to be any exiting bash shell for wxpython

999578
put	get
so the best advice i can give is put in the plan the need for working prototypes at the earliest possible stage so that you can get those numbers and plan for those numbers to change over time so get prototypes or working versions at every checkpoint to retest all along the project timeline

999581
driver	kernel
as far as debugging goes unfortuantely the vs debugger won t work for kernel mode driver debugging

999605
aggregate-functions	aggregation
typically this is aggregation a set of other members from the same dimension and you see something like the following using the aggregate-functions

999640
backslash	regex
the next two sequences and are backslash escaped because the backslash by itself would be an escape sequence for something else and the forward slash would confuse the parser into thinking that it had reached the end of the regex exactly similar to escaping quotes in strings

999670
machinist	rspec
all i do in my rspec tests for my controller is create a user with machinist and then assign that user to be the current_user

999670
machinist	rspec
you obviously would probably need to adapt this to work in test unit and without machinist if you don t use it as i use rspec but i m sure the principle is the same

999678
println	output
println is a methods of java.io.printstream class that lets you output some text into the stream and as opposed to print methods gets you to the new line after the text

999682
dictionary	arrays
pdf supports arbitrarily nested arrays dictionary and references so just about any data can be represented

999691
any	set
if you look at the generated code for any of the visual designers controls implement a name property that is set by the designer

999701
mac-address	packets
you will receive a packets back mapping the ip-address requested to the mac-address which owns that ip-address

999701
mac-address	ethernet
are assign the ethernet mac-address

999717
primitive	int
depending on the cpu type some primitive data types int and operations increment might not need mutex protection if they resolve down to an atomic instruction in machine language

999717
any	set
for example a thread safe container may allow items to be inserted or removed using a specific set of public methods which ensure that any code which uses it is thread-safe

999743
ip-address	hostname
instead of fetching it for each ip-address in the network i want to fetch all the dns entries ip-address - hostname mapping from the dns server in one go

999744
push	pull
but after some initial research in the web i found out some disappointing facts which are applicable to our application - using git for large systems like ours is painful checkout clone merge push pull and commands are complicated geeky would be more appropriate for a developer base which is dvcs ignorant and mostly windows users

999744
cvs	git
there is no fixed mindset for git but if i have to go for a centralized approach in really worst case then what should be the way cvs svn apart

999747
javascript	dom
lastly if you cannot change the markup and don t want to modify the dom at runtime you can always see what javascript engine specific features are available

999758
function-call	eval
user can modify your page on client side with tool like firebug and add any eval function-call he wants but this can t break site security in any way

999782
account	api
you can use the google account api

999818
environment	building
you have to integrate that with your building environment

999818
revision	svn
but you could also use a svn revision number etc

999823
processor	cpu
you submit commands to the opengl subsystem and then they are executed on the gpu so not by definition a parallel thread b c the graphics processor doesn t necessarily have the concept of threads in the same way as the cpu

999834
directory	folder
when i am i am giving the folder of 2nd website in settings of 1st website i am actually giving the root folder and not path of any virutal directory

999840
versioning	upgrade
basically if you want to support upgrade change the major.minor.build versioning number

999845
oracle	mysql
if anyone knows a way to do this that works on oracle sql server and mysql i d be interested

999862
gzip	zip
you may use zip gzip when time for compression decompression is the most important issue

999870
svnadmin	dump
many different backup strategies can be adopted based on your requirements svnadmin hotcopy or dump svnsync post-commit hooks to help ease your single point of failure concern

999883
alpha	rgba
i was able to set up the necessary buffering for rendering but fundamentally i get a textures in rgb or rgba format with the mask encoded in lightness rgb information not alpha

999903
any	set
you can t merely assume that any possibly infinite set of turing machines necessarily represents a distinct problem

999917
protected	public
------ private ------- ------- protected ------------ ------- public -----

999920
instances	private
that way you are working with the all system public ruby-on-rails app + private pay system but only push the public part to github and you can push the all system private + public to another private repository on a backup machine for instances

999938
host	dns
they need to be configured as virtual hosts in apache - see - that means it will be difficult to automate that especially in hosting environement - unless your host gives you some api to do just that easy and more feasible scenario would be to have a distinctive ip assigned to your website then you can catch all with your apache - it s probably possible to configure using your hosting control panel or works out of the box - and then just point dns servers to your ip

999945
ubuntu	linux
i m considering doing some linux kernel and device driver development under a vmware vm for testing ubuntu 9.04 as a guest under vmware server 2.0 while doing the compiles on the ubuntu 8.04 host

999951
google-chrome	safari
also this doesn t happen on other browsers like google-chrome and safari

999951
packet-capture	tcp
a tcp packet-capture shows that the transaction is complete

999974
interpolation	splines
when i now use a splines beziersplines in degrafa for interpolation the interpolation at this point does not work as expected at this point my function has a kink

999974
interpolation	splines
now when interpolation with a splines it draws some kind of loop around this point

999974
derivative	spline
i think this happens because the spline needs the derivative of the functions which is not unique at this point

999987
return-type	arguments
now my problem is that every function specifies the same arguments and return-type
