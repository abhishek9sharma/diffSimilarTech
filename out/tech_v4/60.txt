any	set
for those of you who don t know why apparently the amount of memory reserved for the index of any enum is automatically set to an integer in c#

600083
32-bit	64bit
thus even though you declare it as an sbyte it might get coerced into a 32-bit or 64bit integer by the time it actually goes into memory anyway os x is particularly picky about memory alignment

600290
json	xml
a easy solution would be to add a small script to the server which scans for all files and returns their names and their size to the swf as json or xml or whatever

600292
exception-handling	try-catch
if this doesn t help to avoid deadlocks completely or you don t have the time to implement and test the real fix now of course you could simply place a try-catch around your save commit persist or whatever call check catched exception-handling if they indicate that the failed transaction is a deadlock victim and then simply recall save commit persist after a few seconds sleeping

600324
authentication	login
and of course any such good request encryption should be in-part based on the session-id aka login authentication token usually

when n is small a simple arrays or single linked-list with key + value as payload is very efficient

600402
linked-list	tree
benchmark your hash tables balanced tree and simple arrays linked-list and see at which values of n they each start to be better

600416
subtraction	modulo
since most hash functions used for hash tables are of k c_1 c_2 the difference to an arrays lookup in a rather sparse and or optimal hash table consists of one indirection two multiplications a subtraction and a division an efficient modulo implementation using the cpus capabilites might reduce that by a subtraction and a multiplication and the arrays lookup

600428
buffering	streaming
i want to implement the following have a character buffering and the code i am trying to port puts this character buffering in a streaming and then does a get like this

600428
buffering	streaming
edit is the above code optimal wherein for getval you copy the entire buffering to a streaming and then do a get on the streaming

edit just to clarify the question and what i am after i want to know what you can do with generics reference-type and cannot do with generics values types.

600571
reference-type	generics
as for what you can do with the generics types - they really just follow the normal rules for value types and reference-type

600580
internet-explorer	firefox
as always when a page is rendered differntly in internet-explorer and firefox firefox renders the page correctly

in some browsers in firefox google-chrome and apparently ie8 you can use the data url scheme to embed an image file in html

600822
javascript	dom
in javascript this kind of chaining multicasting of a sort requires that dom level 2 functionality is used the javascript bible was useful for identifying this it should be no surprise that mozilla and ie have a different way of achieving the same thing and so in order to add a js handler and preserve the event handling in codebehind the line in my example above that says

600830
oracle	mysql
having come from oracle database world things i took for granted werenâ t working the same with mysql

600830
oracle	mysql
and my reading on mysql tuning makes me conclude that mysql is behind oracle in terms of optimizing queries

600830
unsigned-integer	int
both these can be stored as a 4 byte int and if space is really tight can be combined into unix time seconds since the epoch 1 1 1970 as an unsigned-int which will be good till around 2106 as

xsd	xml
xml has xsd s to validate the format before you attempt to read it

600883
integer	modulus
hash the key which is an integer with a simple modulus stored with each instance of a hashtable

600885
methods	extend
also unless you are doing something fancy in changeview that can t be done using the methodss in a uiviewcontroller object then you should just use it instead if it is neccesary to implement your own view switching methods then you can extend uiviewcontroller instead of implemtning part of the view controlelr in your view

600895
dataadapter	datarow
you will also want to look at dataadapter especially dbdataadapter.fill datatable especially datatable.load and datarow and dbdatareader

601089
windows-xp	windows
is there a windows dll call or even better an environment variable that would give that information for windows-xp and windows vista

601089
windows-xp	windows
i see that wikipedia states that the 64-bit version of windows-xp and windows vista have a unique environment variable programw6432 so i m guessing that d be empty on 32-bit windows

601089
64bit	x86
in 64bit editions of windows-xp 2003 vista there are also programfiles x86 which defaults to c program files x86 and programw6432 which defaults to c program files

601089
32-bit	64bit
the programfiles itself depends on whether the process requesting the environment variables is itself 32-bit or 64bit this is caused by windows-on-windows 64bit redirection

601094
sql-server	ms-access
i have a fairly large ms-access 2007 database application i need to migrate to sql-server

601224
required	checked
my logic for this approach without turning this into a when to throw exception-handling-handling discussion is simply that the business-objects are responsible for checked business rule constraints and throwing an exception-handling that can bubble up and be caught as required

601224
exception-handling	try-catch
however this approach requires me to wrap any exception-handling thrown in a try-catch something i was trying to avoid by using a global handler to start with

601233

sadly on a live system where debugging is set to false the yellow screen of death is quite unhelpful even with stack trace enabled it does not show the line where the error happened which seems obvious since there should be no debugging information

601811
expression	brackets
there are many errors trailing use missing in s operator unbalanced brackets in if expression

601826
user-controls	itemtemplate
so the problem in this scenario having specified an itemtemplate as well as a controltemplate is that i only get one instance for the user-controls where i want to have an instance for each item that is bound to

601829
local-variables	stackframe
this cleans up local-variables in each stackframe

601833
build-process	ant
maven has strong points but nothing that can t be done by an ant build-process

601833
subproject	ivy
dependency-management ant has the ivy subproject which can interact with maven repositories

601839
python	java
i was running a java python c and scheme versions of different sorting algorithms and logging how long they took whilst limiting execution time to 30 seconds

601844
freebsd	linux
i use python on my mac mostly for development of server side applications which later will run on freebsd linux boxes

601844
macports	fink
for that i have used fink python for a few years and ever since macports python

601845
temporary	copy
instead of selected the data directly first copy it into a temporary table

601878
contains	set
you can set up an arrays contains the column numbers that you need to process

601878
arrays	loops
your loops can then loops over the arrays values

601878
arrays	loops
in the loops over all the columns check the boolean arrays

601880
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
are there any data binding frameworks bcl or otherwise that allow binding between any two clr properties that implements inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged

601887
subtract	time
server send its current time to client upon connection and client subtract the server time from its time to compute the timegap

601887
.net	wcf
it s probably irrelevant but the technology behind this is a .net wcf client using an httpbinding with some polling

601905
macros	vba
their old method was to input everything into an excel sheet without validation of any kind and then to use a vba macros

601905
keyboard	mouse
in fact those users were so used with inputting repetitive data that they used only the keyboard not the mouse

601927
arguments	default
string#each_line separates lines by the optional arguments sep_string which default to which itself default to n simply

601929
put	get
i have put breakpoints in all my functions and i can t see anywhere where it can get corrupted

601930
hide	show
the popup is programatically show on itemcommand of gridview and also hide programatically

601935
for-loop	arrays
should i be using a for-loop arrays too

601973
cxxtest	cppunit
we intend to use a testing framework like cppunit oder cxxtest

601978
interpreter	runtime
during runtime the il is interpreter into machine code which is specific to the architecture you re on and then it s executed

601990
any	set
b those daemons put your wired network into monitor mode basically what this does is tell your network card that you want everything that is being sent to you to be handled by the os so it turns off filtering that is done on the network card if it supports it which would normally discard things that were not destined for itself its mac address and then it does it all in software using the standard filtering hooks provided by the os it can listen to any incoming packets and grab those off the wire that are destined to the fake mac address that vmware has set

601996
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
my impression is that wxhaskell allows you to spend a little more time in the higher-level bindings but i ve not done much gtk2hs and in any event you definitely find yourself working on the thin end of the wrapper for both libraries - and i think the overall programming complexity is similar in both cases

601996
linux	osx
gtk2hs is of course native on linux and has a pretty good native theme on windows good enough to satisfy all but pedants... but has gtk look and feel on osx and depends on having x11 installed

601996
gtk2hs	gtk
once this is stable gtk2hs should be able to easily benefit from the same partially native look and feel gtk osx screenshot

601996
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
wxhaskell is probably a little easier to build if you are not on linux gtk2hs is likely easier if you are linux hosted but both are pretty complex to build to be honest as there are a significant number of dependencies in both cases

601996
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
i would admit that with only a small amount of extra work the same could be done with gtk2hs so this is probably the weakest argument in favour of wxhaskell

602001
mta	sta
info descriptions and workings of ole threading models - com sta mta

602004
xml-serialization	xml
a third option would be to use xml-serialization and deserialize the xml into a list of objects

602010
intermediate-language	cil
your source code is compiled into a byte code know as the common intermediate-language cil

602013
shared-objects	.so
it takes a while to build everything but the advantage is that whatever you build yourself will be built against the same libraries .so you won t have to futz around with statically linked shared-objects etc

602023
authentication	login
user authentication was established by aquiring the user s windows login and using a sql-server database to host the access rights

602023
authentication	login
- user authentication to work in the same way no using passwords just windows login

602035
double-quotes	single-quotes
single-quotes encode a single character data type char while double-quotes encode a string of multiple characters

602044
observers	listeners
in the listener extension pattern the host plugins acts as the subject of the observation and extender pluginss act as the observers or listeners

602044
implements	extends
each extender plugins then extends the listeners extension-point by supplying a specific listener that implements the ilistener interface or by supplying a sequences of such listeners

602048
transfer-encoding	chunked
the 102 and 0 in the middle of the xml are artifacts of the transfer-encoding chunked they are not part of the content you send

602049
authentication	login
so if you moved to the cloud then each of your customers would just have to configure a login page within their network - all you would have to do is trust that page to issue authentication tokens to you and parsing them according to your rules

602065
versioning	upgrade
the browser used by my company is ie versioning 6 to be upgrade to 7 soon

602082
children	tree
hierarchical structure easy definition of a document tree with automatic links to siblings parents and children

602084
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
on windows you can go either for the free visual-studio express editions or for sharpdevelop

602084
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
sharpdevelop naturally focuses more on integration with other free tools like nunit and wix but for editing refactoring and debugging i would say that visual-studio express is still better feature wise

602097
python	ruby
the general idea in python ruby and some other languages us called duck typing

602099
compression	streaming
have you tried compression the streaming gzipoutputstreaming

602106
contains	set
when the jit compiles a methods which has generic arguments either explicitly or implicitly through the contains class it may set up different code paths machine code instructions for each type used

602106
reference-type	generics
also by emitting the constrained opcode before method calls many invocations on non reference-type need not box the value to call the method this optimization is used in non generics cases as well

602106
reflection	runtime
if an attempt is made at runtime to create an instance of a generic type via reflection then the type parameters will be validated by the runtime to ensure they pass any constraints

602111
ruby	php
nikow i can only answer for myself most of my python and php or ruby all dynamic scripting languages work is done just for me - but i always release it on my personal site if anyone else finds it useful but i never go through any documentation or qa process because as long as it works for me i m happy

602112
ostream	std
my own class deriving from std ostream with some generic templates stream operator

602129
onmousedown	onmousemove
you would also need to handle the selection manually by onmousedown onmousemove onmouseup.

602132
value	field
they look like fields but they can have enhanced logic behind the getting and setting of the value in the backing field

602136
typedef	struct
typedef struct

602143
ostream	std
your templates memmber won t be visible inside the library since it isn t a virtual member of the base std ostream

602149
children	nodes
when you use default serialization each nodes will be serialization with all it s children

602183
document	element
note that in a html document the id attributes must be unique so if you have more than one element needing a specific style you should use a class name

602199
python	java
you define how you want your data to be structured once then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages â java c++ or python

602209
deployment	install
this error will come when a reference is specified in web.config and deployment folder site does not contain these dlls install in the system or bin folder does not contain them if they are private assemblies

602209
contains	any
if your web.config containss any assemblies like this and deployed server doesnot contains these assembiles in bin or gac then this error will occur

602217
python	java
this is because python is not backed up by the corporate world like java or .net

602217
python	java
also most python developers are from c++ c java .net etc

602222
spaces	output
in the output queue and decrease the available spaces counter in the tcp buffer model by the size of the message and so on - then i make the

602228
spaces	output
if you just want to double spaces the output of a command or something you can pipe it through sed to double spaces

602242
silverlight	wpf
this is purely based on my experience using prism for wpf not silverlight

602273
json	xml
the completion status can always be return as the http status text but if more information is needed from the server you can always return it in json or xml the simplest being json

602279
stringbuilder	stringwriter
what is the difference between stringwriter and stringbuilder and when should i use one or the other

602286
stringbuilder	stringwriter
a stringwriter is used to write text to a file memory and a stringbuilder is used to append strings together in a memory-efficient manner

602295
windows-xp	windows
the server running the app is running windows server 2003 my box which creates the connection is windows-xp

602303
nsmutablestring	nsstring
if you want to modify a string you have to use nsmutablestring instead of nsstring

602320
command-prompt	cmd
edit this will put newlines between cmd you enter on the command-prompt but won t affect the output of applications

602326
constructor	object
because i m getting the xml posted from another application so i need to manually created child object and assigned its value manually from within the constructor

602338
panels	grid
1 do you think the search panels should be visible on top of my result grid

602338
scrollable	panels
the best solution is to have all the criteria on a scrollable panels with the button outside the panels

602338
value	field
a form of all fields with a place to enter criterion value for each field

602338
value	field
the problem with this is field with set values can scroll out of view and users may have forgotten theyâ ve set a value

602338
selected	button
you can also provide a summary string of the selected criteria near the search button which the user can check

602338
value	field
the user selected from a list of field those to be used in the criteria then sets the value for the criteria in consolidated location

602338
value	field
ideally the list of fields are always available and one click selected the field puts it in the consolidated location and places the cursor in the value control something like shown in only for search rather than find

602342
xml-serialization	ixmlserializable
to customise xml-serialization i believe you need to use ixmlserializable rather than iserializable

602353
selected	cell
you can specify the range by typing into a cell and then selected your cell range with the mouse cursor

602354
double-quotes	single-quotes
so to answer your question use double-quotes or single-quotes you can think of the following as meaning the same thing

602384
attributes	properties
for example i want to remove or change below properties attributes or add a new one

602386
arrays	loops
then you need to loops through that arrays and based on the first line of each loops vehicle american car etc you will know how many subsequent elements of the arrays belong to the same

602396
javascript	dom
surprisingly the javascript code to read this isn t that complicated simply dom manipulations

602412
jquery	dojo
i ll do this with the very basic ajax machinery tested on ff but ie should be ok either not using a framework like prototype or jquery or dojo as you didn t specify your knowledge about them

602412
hide	show
the principle is to show hide the depending on the xmlhttprequest object s readystate

602414
order	add
as you can see on that page or may already know in order to add a record you must do the following vb.net

602420
subclass	nsobject
but i want to write the methods in an nsobject s subclass how can i initialize it

602425
panels	grid
1 do you think the search panels should be visible all the time ie displayed on top of my result grid or available in a separate form which would let me use more place for all the controls

602425
panels	grid
then put action button such as search clear reset just below the search grid aligning to the center i ll refer to this area as button grid .then put the search result panels below the button grid as more horizontal area is available for display so that maximum columns can be displayed at once

602426
revision	svn
you can change the svn date property of each revision after the commit to match the modified time

602444
imperative-programming	declarative
what do the terms functional declarative and imperative-programming mean

602484
fadeout	fadein
and you fadeout with jquery lunch why not bring back a blank nothing with fadein

602488
wamp	php
wamp mamp lamp apache mysql php on windows macos linux

602488
virtualbox	vmware
lamp on virtualbox vmware

602488
sftp	ftp
ide editor on host access to the vm with samba ftp sftp eventually mapping with tools like webdrive

602494
execution	exit
when aborting the execution of a thread i m always doubting between a graceful exit with an event handler like this

602495
selected	listbox
i have a treeview where on selected a node the attributes and values has to be displayed in listbox

602505
google-chrome	firefox
web developer toolbar for firefox visual-studio jit debugger for ie and google-chrome s resource inspector

602544
where-clause	sql
is there a way that i can create query against a data source could be sql oracle or access that has a where-clause that points to an arraylist or list

602573
slidedown	slideup
you can still use the slidedown slideup which is really useful

602576
http	ssl
having a web application protected with ssl requires the webserver to be reachable on a new port 443 https instead of 80 http

602581
scp	ssh
you should be able to setup an ssh server listening for scp connections separately

602584
put	get
for these kinds of problems it can be helpful to put a breakpoint right where the file is going to get loaded and see what the value is when that happens.

602587
32-bit	64bit
so what can be done to bring that 32-bit program and the 64bit driver together

602587
32-bit	64bit
i m sure you can print out a document under vista64 from within a 32-bit app and windows will somehow wrap this around to a 64bit printer driver

602590
getter	setter
i have an as class with setter and getter functions

602594
python	c++
it s a library to write python modules with c++

602606
any	set
the choice on using ssl us made on a per connection level usually determined by the ip port being used will be set up between client and server before any application code involved

602606
http	ssl
to use ssl with asp.net takes nothing special it just works once the iis web site is configured to support ssl or to require it when connections to port 80 for http are redirected to the ssl port

602634
cvs	git
scm integration svn cvs git mercurial bazaar and darcs

602640
declarative	imperative
there are two opposite types imperative and declarative

602641
32-bit	64bit
in this case the pcie driver needs to be 64bit so that it can act as a go-between for windows and the hardware but i would think that a 32-bit application could then access the device without any troubles at all

602641
windows	wow64
what s meant by that incompatibility you read about is that 32 and 64-bit assemblies can t be part of the same application - an application has to target either one or the other though 32-bit application will generally run fine on windows x64 using wow64 which just acts as a translator

602694
continuous-integration	teamcity
continuous-integration teamcity

602703
python	php
similarly to how php became such a huge success and with so many libraries with abysmal code quality even if granted the average python code quality is better then for php - the average php user similarly to the average python user has not much programming experience or skills and very little incentive to improve themselves in this regard - they set out to achieve something and maybe they thought it is worthy enough to be shared with the community in the form of a library but most often once the job is done they have no interest to better the code or better themselves in programming skills i mean

602713
exception-handling	try-catch
personally i think it is overkill to have a try-catch in this routine as you should have the caller handling the exception-handling

602758
python	java
the thing is i m a java python programmer and i really want to learn c++ so i ve been studying c++ for a while but haven t tested anything of what i ve learned beyond small exercises

602765
any	set
i am wondering if there are any heuristics for when to set for references

602766
any	set
you use composition when you have a class that has a set of another objects in any quantity

602777
environment	building
setting it to true ensures it will appear in the output of your building so makes it easier to deploy to the target environment

602787
postfix	dovecot
it may run on unix and it will be used for email searching dovecot postfix and maildir

602802
windows-server	windows
however the only chance i have found to get this little application is to download a 1.29 gb iso of the windows sdk for windows-server 2008 and .net

602804
postgresql	mysql
the advantage with sphinx is easier integration with mysql and postgresql however lucene is more feature-rich

602817
.when	ready
.when the design is ready or it needs to be mailed to somebody i take pictures of it with a digital camera so that i can produce a series of pictures showing how to perform some tasks on the user-interface which serves as documentation of how the application is meant to work

602819
revision	updates
the goal is that on an updates the rev flag will always be what the revision is

602819
revision	updates
this will ensure that whenever you do an update the rev xxx flag will be updates with the current revision

602822
updating	updates
the schemaupdates object provides database schema updating by apparently generating and executing a series of sql updates statements as well as constraint statements when it s void execute bool scripting bool doupdates

602832
constructor	object
you need to pass the constructor for graphicsdevicemanager a valid microsoft.xna.framework.game object instead of the current class using this

602833
children	nodes
in my implementation i m thinking that the editors will decide--either hide the nodes and display it as comment hidden along with the visible children hide the comment and it s children or nuke the whole tree

602853
32-bit	64bit
the only way to communicate between 32-bit and 64bit dlls is to write a com server that manages the communication read wrap either the applications calls or the 64bit driver responses in between

602853
32-bit	64bit
another bout of sleepless nights ensued before i came to know of the solution build the proxy stub dll for both 32-bit and 64bit

602853
32-bit	64bit
the 32-bit side deals with the 32-bit side in your case the application and the 64bit with the 64bit side the driver

602861
base-class	inherited
why do all brake implementations have to inherited from the same base-class

602876
keyboard	mouse
to clarify when the search is initiated meaning i have pressed enter on the keyboard or the search button with the mouse i want focus to shift to the first line in the datagridview

602879
sftp	ftp
so you will setup samba which makes often problems with the login from xp or setup ssl sftp ftp

602879
forwarding	port
also you must learn how to use networking with the vm nat bridging port forwarding

602879
freebsd	debian
a vm eventually running later headless no gui more like a remote server with ubuntu debian freebsd and only running the needed servers apache mysql ftp ssh...

602904
host	dns
make sure that cookies are limited to only the correct virtual host and that the virtual hosts are set up so they cannot respond on anything but their proper names see also dns rebinding attacks

602906
sql-server	oracle
i don t know about sql-server but oracle doesn t even index null values

602910
order	add
when i add the dll to my website i have to add the connectionstring into my web.config in order for my dll to function properly this is by design

602913
hide	show
by default all of the value are are show in the list so you need to hide certain columns by setting their widths to 0

602914
calayer	uiview
i do this so that i can share the same core animation calayer layout code between my iphone application and a mac client the iphone inverts the normal quartz coordinate system for calayers to match that of the uiview

602918
jquery	.post
it uses jquery to do an ajax .post to my logout page

602926
cassini	iis
in iis you need to restart it by opening the command prompt and typing iisreset then hit enter however if your using the build in visual-studio webserver cassini then this wont solve your problem

602937
directory	folder
i have run the exe file of cygwin and in the installation directory i have got all necessary files i think bin folder lib cygwin.bat etc

602937
contains	any
i think that the hello-world program shouldn t contains any syntax errors i have just copied it

602937
g++	gcc
i have installed g++ and now when i type g++ -v i get reading specs from d cygnus cygwin-b20 h-i586-cygwin32 bin.. lib gcc-lib i586-cygwin32 egcs-2.91.57 specs gcc version egcs-2.91.57 19980901 egcs-1.1 release

602937
g++	gcc
i don t understand why i get gcc above and not g++

602946
sql-server	oracle
sql-server does a good job about this construct but oracle might need some hinting to get it right at least it did 5 years ago

602951
shell	bash
if you invoke the compiler from a cygwin bash shell all the paths should be set for you

602974
bash	zsh
this works in zsh i ve checked version 4.3 and in bash 4.2 or newer

602990
database-design	denormalization
one example i ve had to work with repeatedly lately is when the decision has been made to go to a fully denormalization database-design rather than an rdbms

603004
scala	java
as an alternative to java s own shared-memory approach to concurrency you could also look into actor-based concurrency using scala on top of java which provides an easier model for concurrent programming

603009
web-config	app-config
is it is possible to do something like the following in the app-config or web-config files

603010
python	c++
these use multiple languages c c++ fortran python awk and a couple more

603017
defined	declare
i don t think you can declare and use variables to defined appsettings keys within a configuration file

603022
concurrenthashmap	hashmap
try using a concurrenthashmap instead of a plain hashmap

603025
32-bit	64bit
hopefully your 64bit dlls offer a 32-bit api or windows offers a standard driver interface if it s a common i o device like a display or network card

603037
database-design	denormalization
i assume you mean fully denormalization database-design rather than a normalized third or fourth normal form model because a relational model is managed by an rdbms regardless of how normalized it is

603040
textbox	button
there s a seperate button on the form beside each textbox that submits the form to a handler function that needs to find the value of the item selected and save it to the db

603042
shell	bash
make sure it s on the path or you re running the bash shell cmd prompt

603049
export	csv
csv perhaps which is easy to export to from excel

603057
having	select
then it s just a case of having your website project and web setup project in the same solution then right-click on the web application folder in the web setup project select add project output.

603062
configuration	environment
at build time massage the application configuration to the particular specifics of the target deployment environment

603065
xml-binding	xstream
maybe you could use an xml-binding framework like xstream digester or jaxb for that

603067
perl	awk
i like the answers you gave me for the perl and awk

603067
perl	ruby
i m one of those weird programmers that doesn t know perl so i took the ruby route

603070
braces	macros
use a macros to intialize each row - this will hide the braces within the macros call

603088
database-design	denormalization
denormalization database-design rather

603116
postback	ajax
step 2 and 3 are repeated for every partial ie ajax + updatepanel postback

603118
populate	row
if the algorithm to populate rows is easy to codify you could #define a macros to populate each row by index number

603138
delphi	c++
i know someone who managed to load the frames correctly on c++ using the getdibits function but translating the code to delphi didn t work

603150
g++	gcc
if you only installed c compiler you would have command gcc but not command g++

603151
defined	declare
a functional language declare a set of mathematical logical functions which defined how input is translation to output

603163
perl	php
is it worth using perl or other specific text processing language for such tasks or is there really no difference with using php

603165
sql-server	oracle
i have always used toad by quest to do my development and administration work in oracle and ms sql-server

603170
put	get
i m manually testing a restful api that makes full use of get post put delete methods

603177
derived-class	base-class
in c# i have base-class product and derived-class widget

603177
derived-class	base-class
is there some syntax in c# similar to base that allows me to call a static methods from a base-class from a static methods of a derived-class

603179
web-config	app-config
in your app-config web-config file you can have this

603180
value	field
in response to a drop down box changing value i am clearing a number of field resetting a number of drop down boxes to the first option and setting them all to disabled in the user-interface

603180
value	field
if i interrogate the value with a jquery selector the value of this field is an empty string

603180
any	set
so picture a form being submitted or any case where these values are bound or set on the server side and outputted to the browser pre-populated as opposed to being output to the browser with default or empty values

603180
value	field
if i load the page as default empty textbox enter some text and then triggers the javascript function to clear these field the value i typed never makes it to the server

603193
datagridview	databound
i have windows form application and a label which is databound based on a selection from a datagridview

603194
oracle	mysql
for oracle and mysql it appears you can use oracle s free sql developer which being java also runs on mac os x and linux

603194
postgresql	mysql
for postgresql there is phppgadmin for an online solution and the equivalent for mysql

603197
put	get
my recommendation would be to put a suggestion in and then promote it to get others to weigh in on it

comet	chat
i was thinking of implementing real time chat using a php backend but i ran across this comment on a site discussing comet

603215
default	reset
your global collection could do things like iterate over each set of preferences and reset it to default but your preferences themselves would still be locally defined and maintained so that it doesn t spider out into other parts of the code

603215
default	reset
the only problem i can see is that if you allow the preference object to register itself when instantiated you run the risk of trying to reset to default with some of the preferences not instantiated yet

603215
initializer	getter
i suppose this could be fixed by having the main preferences class initializer all the others then any piece of code could retrieve it s local preferences object from the central one though a static getter

603222
concat	where
depends where the guid appears in the xml but i would imagine concat would do the trick

603230
http	ssl
i have implemented the whole website on ssl http the site is working fine on internet-explorer browser but the site displays the below information on mozilla konqueror browser but only on a particular page

603232
value	field
if field are the same for 2 different instances of anonymous objects gethashcode will return the same value for both instances

603280
selected	textbox
this object will let you get set modify the selected region of a textbox

603287
contains	set
has multiple tables on screen one contains a set of search results and one each for a header and footer

603290
internet-explorer	firefox
when you click the button in firefox it goes to the correct url specified by the asp hyperlink but if you click the button in internet-explorer it stays on the same page

603291
keyboard	mouse
there is other event handler that you can use to intercept keyboard input but they have some limitations the winproc will allow you to check any message directed to the control including delete backspace copy and paste etc mouse clicks etc

603295
sql-server	mysql
i think sql-server express could do that load and mysql could too

603297
postgresql	mysql
for database i think you can get mysql or postgresql as they are both free and will lower your costs

603303
ignore	rcs
even though i have an rcs in place i still often move what i think are unused scripting to a hidden location say .mausoleum and then have the rcs ignore that location

603318
textbox	button
my usercontrol contains a textbox a button and a monthcalendar

603322
internet-explorer	firefox
firefox vs internet-explorer

603322
internet-explorer	firefox
i suspect your having discrepencies between firefox and internet-explorer because of the way the events are bubbled propogated between the browsers

603346
python	java
i d like to use the bean scripting framework to make some of my java classes be available to users at my company who wish to write scripts + who may be familiar with javascript or python via jython or ruby via jruby

603370
versioning	upgrade
did you upgrade from a previous versioning

603381
uninstaller	msiexec
that s what the bootstrapper checks to know whether to launch msiexec with reinstall all reinstallmode vamus or not so if it was uninstaller but the registry key didn t get removed setup would try to do an upgrade and fail silently

603384
command-line	cmd
first i created an intercepting filtering to intercept all web requests i also created a version which would work with command-line cmd

603390
function-call	inline
however if the function-call cannot be inline for whatever reason the function is to be instantiated as usual

603400
function-call	inline
the inline specifier indicates to the implementation that inline substitution of the function body at the point of call is to be preferred to the usual function-call mechanism

603400
arguments	default
note a string literal appearing in a default arguments expression is not in the body of an inline function merely because the expression is used in a function call from that inline function

603408
conditional	operators
if your version of python supports it use the conditional operators

603423
function-call	inline
afaik there is no standard definition of how and when a c++ compiler will inline a function-call

603428
kerberos	ldap
but if your python is running under unix you need two things to talk to active directory kerberos and ldap

603441
version-control	git
i use git to version-control this website

603444
antivirus	mcafee
we have shadowprotect installed on the server along with mcafee antivirus

603454
member-functions	inline
this is not about virtual function in particular but about inline and member-functions generally

603454
member-functions	inline
for member-functions if you define your function in the class it is implicitly inline

603489
arrays	loops
i may push things onto the end of an arrays or add items to a hash in a loops

603542
directory	folder
delete the entire activemq_home directory and reinstall it in a different folder

603544
contains	elements
each elements contains a bag of event s

603544
contains	elements
the problem with this is that each elements contains a elements

603546
arrays	loops
get this value in an arrays and loops over to see if you have can see the items

603573
firefox	opera
this works in firefox 3 ie7 and somewhat in opera 9.6

603578
oracle	mysql
we re developing an app on mysql but it may eventually need to deploy to mssql or oracle

603578
oracle	mysql
in mysql they are auto increment columns but iirc in oracle you need to use sequences.

603588
javascript	dom
in javascript this comes up all the time when navigating the dom

603592
multiplication	division
you can use some simple multiplication and division

603596
derived-class	base-class
i would like the methods retrieve in the base-class to return the type that the derived-class supplies in it s definition

603608
datagrid	textbox
if that s out of the way i would consider using a datagrid instead of a textbox

603620
assign	add
to assign the permissions to a user you will first have to get the permission objects using and then you can add it to the user with user.user_permissions.add permission as you mentioned

603630
beautifulsoup	lxml
okay first in regards to parsing the html if you follow the recommendation of zweiterlinde and s.lott at least use the version of beautifulsoup included with lxml

603630
elementtree	lxml
secondly .find and .findall come from lxml trying to be compatible with elementtree and those two methods are described in xpath support in elementtree

603634
business-logic-layer	data-layer
business logic in the data-layer was common in client-server apps as there really was no business-logic-layer per se unless you could really seriously prevent anyone from connecting to the database outside the application

603640
attributes	properties
how would i make use of the tags properties of a node so that i can get the attributes of an xml node

603646
identity-column	sql-server
instead set up your id as an identity-column and let sql-server create your id s automatically

603661
abstract-class	base-class
if you have several classes where you want them to inherit from a base-class for common functionality should you implement the base-class using a class or an abstract-class

603673
abstract-class	base-class
i would say if you are not planning on calling the base-class by itself the then you should define it as an abstract-class

603688
abstract-class	base-class
if the base-class ought not to be instantiated then make it an abstract-class - if the base-class needs to be instantiated then don t make it abstract

603699
triggers	insert
i am trying to do an audit history by adding triggers to my tables and insert rows intto my audit table

603705
directory	folder
if not then start looking at the iis configuration and make sure that web site directory is the same folder as you are dumping the web service files

603709
sendmessage	message
but you could use sendmessage if the target has a windows + message loop

603726
datagrid	textbox
load your data in a editable datagrid instead of a textbox that should make things much more simple and also you can pick which columns are editable and which are not

603738
baud-rate	parity
you set the baud-rate to 9600 but what about data bits parity stop bits

603745
associations	model
what methods for each model become available are auto generated after i make this associations

603747
abstract-class	subclassing
i like to think of abstract-class as interfaces which have some members pre-defined since they are common to all subclassing

603766
value	field
this does the job but ideally i want the separate file value to be append to the stringbuilder in order of int fileid which is a field of the file class

603772
stream	send
if you send an infinite stream of the right bit with a 50 error rate you ll get half 1s and half 0s whether the right bit is 1 or 0

603774
sql-server	mysql
emulate mysql limit clause in microsoft sql-server 2000

603783
arraylist	treeset
you have to either put all the values into a treeset with a comparator that uses the fileid or put them into an arraylist and sort them with collections.sort again with a comparator that compares the way you want

603783
any	set
the treeset methods doesn t work if there are any duplicates and it may be overkill since you re not going to be adding things to or removing things from the set

603789
apache	vhosts
despite my mean ness check out apache s vhosts documentation looks like the answer is not

603793
triggers	insert
where the triggers runs on insert and you are adding created time last updated time and modification type fields

603793
user-permissions	account
the other thing that it allows me to do is give the user context since i don t give the actual user-permissions to the database and run all queries using a service account

603806
constructor	private
some like private fields next to property accessors some like fields together above the constructor

603816
unix	bsd
or you can read up on bsd unix which is a little closer

603816
linux	bsd
for the most part the differences between linux and bsd don t amount to much

603819
windows-mobile	symbian
you need a native application symbian windows-mobile to do so

603831
contains	any
i have a wxpython flexgridsizer bound to a panels that contains other flexgridsizers i d like to display some cell borders on the main flexgridsizer so each section looks encapsulated but i can t find any documentation to do it

603851
javascript	dom
that being said if you can t get it to work - as dirkgently said - you can store the information in the html dom using a javascript ajax call and then fetch it from the flash object using an externalinterface call

603863
base-class	inherited
for example later on i may need the state and methods provided by the base-class but cannot inherited and do not need to implement the interface

603870
htmlcollection	nodelist
that browser s equivalent of nodelist is htmlcollection but trying to prototype the latter simply doesn t succeed

603893
updating	updates
instead of updating the user-interface when selectedindexchanged is fired on the listview start a timer with a short duration say the default 100ms and do the user-interface updates in the timer.tick handler

603894
children	nodes
i figure it would help with cases where you need to update a nodes and its children like when you want to hide a comment and its replies

603896
put	get
simply put i am looking to get onto a project small opensource so that i can gain valuable information and learn from others in the community before i go crazy here i have reached a proverbial ceiling where i am

603898
shutdown	restart
if it didn t complete before the shutdown it tends not to complete after a restart

603935
getter	setter
it uses getter and setter to access its protected members

603947
postdata	request
you could set the postdata of an ajax request using only javascript

603966
revision	updates
assuming i ve not goofed below and this works as well as it did in my 5 minutes of testing please be careful to revisit this override if you updates your python version to a revision number ie 2.5.x to 2.5.y or 2.5 to 2.6 etc

603973
any	set
we have set the include directory in the solution as we did for the evc 4.0 project but we are seeing the errors below any time we try to use list push_back or vector insert commands with our own classes below is the error with our class trianglebufferelement

603973
double	int
these commands do seem to work with native types like int double etc

603973
copy-constructor	constructor
we have ensured all classes have the proper constructor copy-constructor assignment operators and comparison operators and all appear to be correct

603983
javascript	dom
you want to read about the javascript dom

603984
touch	drag
on the iphone if you touch and hold your finger on an icon it starts vibrating then you can drag them around while the other icons move aside and rearrange dynamically

604008
selected	button
in the file s context menu select open with... and use the set as default button with your prefered editor selected in your case probably the csharp editor

604022
deep-copy	object
deep-copy of a member will not take place when the object is copied or assigned to from the same type

604047
revision	svn
but with this in your build you could do a svn info and get the revision number as ant properties at your disposal

604054
chipmunk	box2d
ideally you d be using a library such as box2d or chipmunk for that anyway making c# speed a non-issue there as well

604055
order	join
notice that i reversed the order on the seqno part to better indicated which is the left side of the join

604056
contains	elements
that is remove_if returns an iterator new_last such that the range contains no elements for which pred is true

604059
haskell	ada
have you considered haskell d or ada

604081
windows-server	windows
slow needs windows-server 2008 is a proper hypervisor ie it sits underneath windows including server 2008

604123
calloc	malloc
objects that are allocated by malloc or another function of that family like calloc have allocated storage duration

604129
pointers	stack
also a pointers to an object on stack will also cease to be valid when the scope exits so i guess in your precise case you seems to be doing a linked-list you will need to use malloc

604143
selectedindex	selecteditem
when this happens the combobx sees it as a complete reset of the selection and clears the selecteditem selectedindex

604143
selectedindex	selecteditem
note the last case - the reset...when you load a new itemsource you end up here and any selecteditem selectedindex gets blown away

604153
pointers	stack
so if you return a pointers to something allocated on stack that pointers will be invalid

604153
malloc	free
if you allocate something on the heap using malloc that memory is good for as long as you want to use it - until you call free at which point it is released

604161
margins	padding
i have an h1 with a defined font-size and line-height and zero padding and margins

604186
value	field
how the heck to i bind the selected value my name dropdownlist to the name field in my person record

604209
linked-list	heap
the generational garbage collector will compact scattered heap items together over time so the linked-list won t get too bad

604212
revision	svn
i think the best approach to ensuring that there is a file in your web application that has the svn revision number is to not have a file you commit but rather to extract it as part of your build script

604219
getter	setter
in java the getter and setter are in essence properties

604231
checkbox	button
if you have an existing pdf that you want to populate and that pdf just has text fields no checkbox or radio button then cam pdf may be able to help you

604231
embedded-fonts	fonts
furthermore if you have embedded-fontss then you need to ensure that all of the characters you plan to insert are represented in the embedded fonts

604240
decimal	hex
i have a string that can be a hex number prefixed with 0x or a decimal number without a special prefix except for possibly a minus sign

604252
postdata	request
the other request we perform is a post to postdata to the server and we are getting the same issue randomly as well

604259
linked-list	nodes
a linked-list will carry more memory overhead for the nodes but is better if you are inserting many elements into the middle

604269
panels	grid
from your top most panels you can do this my grid is called contentgrid

604298
display	width
but because it is a variables width font it is display like this

604314
margins	padding
edit someone else suggested css and i believe that using the height and width directives from css will give you the same result as using the same attributes of the tag but doesn t limit you strictly to images and a will play nicer with any margins or padding directives you might use

604327
contains	set
set overflow hidden on the contains div

604338
macports	fink
if you get python from macports or fink you will not be able to run wxpython unless you run it through x11

604342
.when	ready
what you need to do is either setup the movieclip with the embedded function to broadcast an event .when ready and to listen to it from the main or something like setinterval which only probably needs one tick

604345
attributes	properties
i don t think that this is possible as annotation attributes properties values must be available at compile time

604353
python	java
what i have ended up doing is implementing in java by a simple port of the python code

604353
python	c++
you may be better coding this sort of thing in c or c++ if you have to use python

604364
buffering	capture
to answer your question i would use output buffering to capture the output of your scripting and then use one of the many tools available for turning html to pdf

604366
widget	button
you could also go for simple opengl rendered menus and button either using nvidia widget or anttweakbar

604367
triggers	insert
then create an update triggers on your data table and insert new rows into your audit table from the deleted pseudo table

604367
implements	abstract
there is also this more general purpose solution that proposes to use sql clr to abstract away implements a unique audit table and triggers for each data table you wish to audit

604380
triggers	insert
i would use triggers only to very simple updates one insert update delete statement and even then make sure that deadlocks cannot occur

604381
packets	ping
have you run a ping to your server to see if you get dropped packets that correspond to the same times as your failed requests

604396
getter	setter
this makes it so that you can specify getter and setter for properties as necessary but makes it so that you don t have to define boilerplate functions for every property just the ones where you want to do some sort of processing on it before returning the value

604410
keyboard	mouse
such as loading a large amount of data this would cause the keyboard and mouse to lockup

604410
keyboard	mouse
i m looking for a lightweight solution that would allow this to be done without tying down the keyboard and mouse

604430
where-clause	sql
a simple sql view + a where-clause a stored procedure with parameters sometimes

604430
where-clause	sql
while making this point i imagined a way of retrieving table view data without writing sql and without writing the where-clause

604446
document	element
if your xslt processor supports exslt the exsl document element will allow you to create multiple output files from a single input file

604454
where-clause	sql
but you don t want to use daos customers above is such so you would have to write the sql statement and specify the where-clause

604456
having	select
we do this having pretend features that a user can select via a checkbox then a complicated set of conditionals to install various components depending on their office version and the state of the checkbox

604463
specifications	w3c
i m building a wcf service based on a w3c specifications which defines a restful web service endpoint that accepts application x-www-form-urlencoded postdata

604467
objectoutputstream	ioexception
you should also consider that the objectoutputstream constructor can throw an ioexception so may want to cover this case in your tests

604470
double	int
functions with only simple arguments int double worked fine but i could not determine how to marshal the arrays

604476
variables	boolean
if this is contained in a function maybe you could return a boolean or set an object level variables

604477
put	get
the low-tech way to get around this is simply to set the property licenseaccepted to 1 and put some useful readme type information into the license box

604484
directory	folder
edit -- i did as suggested and added the output folder to the linker s additional directory

604496
any	set
now you can set the style for the button like you would in any wpf control

604499
getdate	dateadd
the key thing is using the proper syntax for a jet database and that means that the first arguments for dateadd is a string value d and that you can t use a sql-server function getdate but must instead use jet s function for the same purpose date

604503
derived-class	base-class
this requires that code expecting a base-class should be able to use a derived-class without knowing it

604503
derived-class	base-class
on the other hand if you were to make the class that automatically deals with the invalid input w o throwing a base-class and make the class that throws a descendant this would be bad because code expecting the base-class could not use the derived-class as if it were the base-class

604514
javadoc	jdk1.5
matcher.useanchoringbounds was added in jdk1.5 so if you are using 1.4 i m not sure that it would help you even if it did work notice the since 1.5 in the javadoc

604528
installation	uninstall
a couple of final things that an installer tool should provide are ways to apply upgrades to an existing installation and a way to uninstall the program undoing all those installation tasks deleting files restoring backups unregistering com servers etc.

604529
dependency-injection	inject
and because it is an instance of the class you could also use dependency-injection to inject the querystrings class in every place you are using it

604531
constructor	private
maybe set some defaults in the controller s constructor and then have a separate private method ie

604539
maskedtextbox	numericupdown
from what i ve seen in vc# s control toolbox winforms .netf 3.5 i m looking for a mix of maskedtextbox numericupdown and datetimepicker

604551
children	tree
you want to find the process id for the process you want to kill then walk the tree of its children and their children and so on... note their pids and then kill all the processes nice and quickly

604559
keyboard	mouse
you might also want to consider windows keyboard and mouse hooks

604598
sql-server	oracle
in sql-server i have been using the symbol however that doesn t seem to work in oracle

604615
defined	declare
with any one of them you defined an interface then declare that a given type conforms to that interface or defined an adaptor that turns your type into something that does conform to that interface

604616
required	checked
if you required that itemid1 itemid2 in the rating table you only have to checked the rating table once

604704
ifconfig	linux
since android is based on linux you could try using ifconfig or a library function to determine which interfaces are available and which does what

604721
python	perl
also python doesn t have something like perl s magic autoincrement where if you ++ a variable whose value is a it becomes b -- or if it s z it becomes aa

604721
python	perl
translating from perl to python is supposed to have the opposite effect right

604724
any	set
any time you work with a pointer it s important to make sure it s set to a value before you dereference it

604747
python	perl
well sorry to say but you can t just do a direct translation from perl to python including bit-for-bit perlisms and expect the outcome to be prettier

604762
project-management	project
project-management would be management of a project typically using some process and resulting in a product or a new version of a product

604776
vbscript	jscript
you could have an exe which exposed methods and properties in a form usable by both other processes including vbscript and jscript

604779
installation	environment
but anyway it is probably related to your php installation if you are saying it works under your windows environment

604788
.net	wcf
the .net correspondence is .net remoting for .net 2.0 and wcf for 3.0+

604791
postback	ajax
use form postback that get replaced with ajax functionality from javascript that runs when the page is loaded for example

604793
temporary	copy
if some of the javascript is being hosted by a different server eg if you are including something like jquery from the jquery site instead of hosting a copy of it yourself then maybe one of these sites is down temporary

604806
google-chrome	firefox
i need this to work across all browsers ie6-8 firefox google-chrome opera safari

604811
ruby	php
routing is a popular feature of a number of mvc frameworks such as asp.net mvc ruby on rails and a number of python and php frameworks

604812
objectoutputstream	fileoutputstream
mock objects you could use a factory methods to create an overridden objectoutputstream or fileoutputstream

604812
spring	seam
dependency injection in order to get your mock object in the right place you could use a framework such as spring or seam to inject the appropriate object into the class that s doing the work

604826
hosts-file	hosts
can try to fflush your dns cache you can edit your hosts to temporary point at the right location

604852
aquamacs	emacs
it uses aquamacs for emacs

604852
aquamacs	emacs
aquamacs is a specially for mac os x enhanced gnu emacs

604856
capitalize	tolower
then we aggregate them with a methods that capitalize the first chars and tolower s the rest of the string

604860
google-chrome	firefox
if i use a loop to execute it i found something more interesting i got four true in ie and safari and true false true false in firefox google-chrome

604866
hosts-file	hosts
uses a hosts to temporary force your computer to use the new ip-address

604868
sql-server	sqlcommand
one uses the sqlcommand class to execute commands either stored procedures or sql on sql-server using ado.net

604873
constructor	object
however do not let a constructor leave the object in a state that will cause problems later specifically

604890
32-bit	64bit
i ve tried two things build it to run in 32-bit mode and build it to run in 64bit mode

604890
32-bit	64bit
i don t know if that means i think i m 32-bit but these are 64bit dlls or what and i m very confused

604890
platform	anycpu
so for some reason no matter what i set as the platform x86 x64 or anycpu i can t load it reflectively on an x64 machine

604891
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works fine in firefox google-chrome safari ie8 - but not ie8 in ie7 compatability mode

604901
order	add
often it will recommend you add a covering index with many columns in order to speed up a single query you ve asked to be analysed but this may have adverse effects on your database overall when you look at all queries against that table

604902
postgresql	mysql
or maybe i want to use mysql for forum posts but postgresql for geo-clustering more realistic for me heh

604964
actionscript	mxml
mxml code needs to be compiled down to actionscript before flash player can do anything with it

604964
interpreter	runtime
mxml is not interpreter by flash player at runtime

604974
constructor	object
i know that a private parameterless constructor works but what about an object with no parameterless constructors

604980
arrays	loops
i d transform the arrays of markers to a key value pair and then loops that objects properties

604988
scheme	lisp
is there a way to construct a self-referential data structure say a graph with cycles in lisp or scheme

605012
contains	any
i know you can do .containss with a list but i need to check if the title containss any of the items not if the items contains part of the title

605018
any	set
on windowss at least if you have a windowsing api that you can hook the hwnd from you can set up ogl to use pretty much any windows you want

605067
python	java
can anyone out there elaborate on this i have used use c python java sql if that helps.

605086
internet-explorer	firefox
in terms of checking your sites rendering in different engines i find the ie tab firefox plugin very useful for quickly checking my layout in internet-explorer 7

605092
shell	bash
for bash which is one shell but probably the most common in the linux world the equivalent is

constructor	object
i just ran a little test using a wcf service that returns an basic object that does not have a default constructor

605098
constructor	object
how does wcf deserialization instantiate object without calling a constructor

605102
command-pattern	visitor-pattern
this way objects apply actions on themselves instead of having the application apply actions on objects this would map actions and state to a visitor-pattern instead of a command-pattern

605124
cosine	sine
and a number of discussions about whether decimal is really fixed-point or actually floating point updates responders have confirmed that it s definitely floating point but i haven t seen a solid c# library for things like calculating cosine and sine

605124
cosine	sine
my needs are simple -- i need the basic operators plus cosine sine arctan2 pi.

605124
32-bit	64bit
this is presently only between a 32-bit os and a 64bit os all the 32-bit machines seem to stay in sync without issue which is what makes me think this is a floating point issue

605124
radians	cos
i was aware from this as a possible issue from the outset and so have limited my use of non-integer positioning math as much as possible but for smooth diagonal movement at varying speeds i m calculating the angle between points in radians then getting the x and y components of movement with sin and cos

605124
put	get
if i can get this working i plan to open-source the math functions i put together so that there will be a resource for other c# programmers out there

605124
cosine	sine
updates i could definitely make a cosine sine lookup table work for my purposes but i don t think that would work for arctan2 since i d need to generate a table with about 64 000x64 000 entries yikes

605130
forwarding	port
now if all i have to do is listen on port 80 443 accept requests with a small post payload sanitize them and forwarding them along to other clients .

605140
reflection	runtime
c# and java programs can be aware of their own classes because both .net and java runtime provide reflection which in general lets a program have information about its own structure in both .net and java this structure happens to be in terms of classes

605140
reflection	runtime
there s no way you can afford reflection without relying upon a runtime environment because a program cannot be self-aware by itself #42

605144
contains	set
mmtk contains a large set of high performance garbage collectors

605162
background-color	width

605172
subclassing	base-class
say your base-class is account which is subclassing to guestaccount and loginaccount

605179
click	mouse
this is really annoying because tabs stop working altogether and to set a focus using mouse the user has to click twice

605185
transparency	frame
it won t matter if you use core-animation directly or animate the center property it is choppy because the graphics hardware has to composite the transparency image with the background on every frame of the animation

605190
sniffing	packets

debian	linux
in my experience properly configured it can be helpful even for large installations like debian linux 2gb download though for debian case there are specialized tools like apt-cache

605260
inherited	subclass
off the top of my head you could subclass qcombobox and override hideevent qhideevent inherited from qwidget

605260
keyboard	mouse
i looked at the qt source code and it looks like when the keyboard and mouse events are captured that as soon as qt has decided to emit the activated int index signal hidepopup has been called

605281
fwrite	fclose
fopen ... w fwrite fclose - extremely slow

605285
internet-explorer	firefox
my guess is that it s caching but it doesn t seem to be browser caching as they have tried both internet-explorer and firefox

605302
qt-designer	pyqt
if you re referring to writing .ui files the qt-designer that comes with pyqt is sufficient for layout of widgets and pyuic4 will convert them to python code for you pyuic4 comes with pyqt

605306
selected	listbox
when the user of the application selected a family from the first listbox the listbox item expands slightly to show the fields for a pledge so that it s easy to add the pledge details to the second listbox

605308
httpd.conf	.htaccess
does every server have the equivalent to block xml files and if they do can they be altered on a folder level like the .htaccess can and not just a httpd.conf file

605315
compression	streaming
my previous attempt at this simply calculated out starting from any index in the uncompressed streaming which of the compression techniques above will provide the best compression and then compresses however many bytes that methods will compress to the arrays of compressed bytes before repeating from the new uncompressed index

605373
user-input	output
this means that stuff printed to the standard output of the scripting has to be made available on the gui and the user-input has to be taken from the gui and written to the standard input of the scripting

605373
webserver	host
edit #1 the scripts to be executed are not located on the same host as the webserver

605374

605397
selected	listbox
now when i click on the item in the first listbox on the left side the foreground changes to white and then changes back to black if another item is selected

605397
selected	listbox
now how do i make the expander control foreground color behave similar to when a listbox item is selected selection is changed

605402
ref	out
one cool thing you could improve on the other poster s helper methods is to make the out parameter a reference parameter instead change out to ref

605422

dependency walker is a free utility that scans any 32-bit or 64bit windows module exe dll ocx sys etc. and builds a hierarchical tree diagram of all dependent modules

605434
hash	md5
it is riddled with regular expressions and it relies on md5 hash to escape certain characters

605443

basically you see if the previous value of the field you are grouping on is different from the current value

605455
bazaar	git
distributed version control systems such as mercurial bazaar or git are better suited for such tasks

605462

605513
browser-cache	caching
because these urls can be caching logged on proxies weblogs browser-cache bookmarks email etc

605514
selected	cell
so basically i am wondering if there is a way of hiding some of the items from the combo box drop down list so that when a certain cell is selected they can t choose an item that isn t allowed

605525
scrollbar	z-order
on another project i wrote code to fake it using a hidden combo and the free msflexgrid in the grid s _click event move and size the combo to fit the cell taking account of scrollbar if necessary set the z-order bring to front make visible and setfocus

605544
double	int
the range of double is way greater than the range of 32 or 64 bit int which is why std floor returns a double

605544
double	int
casting to int should be fine so long as it s within the appropriate range - but be aware that a double can t represent all 64 bit int exactly so you may also end up with errors when you go beyond the point at which the accuracy of double is such that the difference between two consecutive double is greater than 1

605547
double	int
another reason is that the range of double is far greater than that of int

605547
double	int
it may not be possible to round all double to int

605555
debugging	trace
log trace - debugging execution tracing

605565

no - so long as you change it at the right time when you make a change which affects serialization removing a field it shouldn t matter what value you use

605833
arrays	map
i m sure you can probably tell exactly what s going on here but just in case i create an arrays of glatlng objects this can be of any length within bounds haha and then iterate over it adding markers to the map for each glatlng defined in the arrays

605878
lookup	any
there is a lot of additional complexity in the above for example in some queries you may see bookmark lookup where sql uses an index to find the row and then perform a lookup to get any associated data but that should be a good starting step

605884
arbitrary-precision	fixed-point
as well as scale integers there are a few arbitrary-precision numeric libraries which usually include a bigrational type and fixed-point is just a fixed power of ten denominator

605892

i d say you might get faster perf if you put everything in one regex but put the most likely option first followed by the second most likely etc

606346
derived-class	base-class
if you declare a methods virtual in your base-class you can override it in your derived-class

but if i use content-disposition like so on mac the user-permissions are denied everyone grouping is unchecked

606936
srp	ocp
some heuristics for deciding how to split the code into classes are the srp and ocp

606947
lookup	any
compiled triggerss would do a lookup and see if that table had any flex triggerss to run and then compile and run the flex triggers

606982
export	csv
i haven t tried this myself but you could export the wdb to csv

607018
any	set
in that scenario you could set up your client so that the admin has to enter a special code at startup and have that code be kept in memory and passed along with any request

607034
implements	extends
i guess the best way would be to implements a special field class that extends filefield with custom validation of the uploaded file

607039
value	field
a trick i ve done in the past is that if your datavalue field is going to be a numeric field such as an id you can assign a range validator object to it and check that the value itself is greater than 0

607069
updating	updates
this way no matter how i decide to updates transactions in the future i ll know that i m updating the sum of the transactions correctly

607070
webforms	asp.net
update 1 here is a similar scenario but for controls - how to use dependency injection with asp.net webforms

607083
wmv	flv
you might want to take a look at the innertube project on the coding4fun site as it downloads flv files and converts them to wmv

607106
plugins	add-on
i would think this is somewhat similar to plugins behavior but 2 is actually critical to the working of the application not just an add-on

607117
incredibuild	nmake
incredibuild claims to be able to run nmake builds on multiple cores multiple machines

607145
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
any code using sortedlist t or sorteddictionary t is using a binary-search-tree

607149
forwarding	port
you should be able to use port forwarding from your router to your laptop

607165

my question is this with a web application after performing a login authentication for a protected resource how can i run some sort of function in this case i want to run a function to initialize some user-dependent session-scope variables before the web-app redirects to the protected resource

607176
spaces	output
i ve been experimenting with various bits of java code trying to come up with something that will encode a string contains quotes spaces and exotic unicode characters and produce output that s identical to javascript s encodeuricomponent function

607177
.net	wcf
in order to communicate between the web garden processes you ll have to use something like .net remoting or the new wcf as casperone pointed out

607207
reflection	runtime
devise a way to store jar class info in your configuration so that you can load types via reflection at runtime

607218
controller	routes
it would be nice if it could render links to all possible get actions on a controller directly from the routes file

607225
margins	padding
you ll have to use float left right on #mainpagesearch input before you can apply padding margins

607226
contains	any
for clustered indexes it s easy enough to see if the table contains any lob columns but for a non-clustered index i need to specifically know if there is any lob columns covered by that specific index

607240
instrumentation	profiling
you can instrumentation just the dll so you profiling only where you want

607243
google-chrome	firefox
update tested and work with firefox opera and google-chrome but not ie since ie don t support focus but ie supports the background image so if the text is light gray is should not be a problem

607251
optgroup	selected
looking through the code on www.codeplex.com aspnet it doesn t appear that neither the selectedlist nor the dropdownlist extension method supports the use of optgroup in a selected

607251
methods	extend
looks like you ll need to write your own extension methods and extend selectedlistitem to contain the grouping or generate the selected manually in markup

607256
administration	account
c a is hidden administration share are you sure the current user account has the correct permissions

607256
windows-vista	windows
administrive shares are disabled by default in windows-vista and windows 7 unless you join a domain

607283
interpolation	splines
linear cubic catmull-rom or hermite splines interpolation

607294
contains	elements
sorry can t be done with showgridlines - you need to style the elements contains

607323
boost	stl
in addition this works without needing the stl or boost

607328
firefox	safari
this worked in ie firefox and safari on a pc

607332
profiling	debugging
release and debugging often have much different performance profiling

607347
32-bit	64bit
there s a great article on wikipedia about the difference and benefits of 64bit intel amd cpus over their 32-bit versions

607349
binary	hex
the sha1 hash that php generates is a 40 character 40 byte hexademical representation of the 20-byte binary data since each binary value needs to be represented by 2 hex characters

607374
variables	boolean
so the mutex applies to this boolean variables called newdata

607385
stderr	stdout
in addition pre-defined console streams such as stdin stdout and stderr will be set up

607393
silverlight	wpf
this is not possible it is possible in wpf with but silverlight is more limited

607411
memory-management	memory-leaks
in addition to the exc_bad_access errors you re receiving improper memory-management also causes memory-leaks which on a small device like the iphone can lead to random crashes

607445
entity-framework	ado.net
where can i find an ado.net entity-framework error list

607466
windows-xp	windows
have you noticed substantial differences in website rendering on ie 6 or ie 7 when run on windows-xp versus when run on windows vista

607473
base-class	inherited
well you could create a base-class and then create classes which inherited from it

607475
contains	any
the file is the swap file which serves as a lock file and contains the undo redo history as well as any other internal info vim needs

607494
order	add
the way you are using cast by example is messy and very brittle - i really don t recommend it if you add a property or name them in a different order it ll break

607495
declarative	imperative
sql is a declarative language rather than the imperative languages you are most used to

607496
boost-variant	boost-any
boost-variant is similar to dirkgently s suggestion of boost-any but supports the visitor pattern meaning it s easier to add type-specific code later

607551
value	field
that can be solved by object-specific undo for example in a form with many fields or cells in a grid like in excel right-clicking the field would show a list of previous value in that field

607554
constructor	object
this writes it out to the resx as a blob using an instancedescriptor for the object type s default constructor this loses any property values you might also want to include

607554
constructor	object
in order to retain the information inside these persisted object you will need to create a typeconverter that specifies a different constructor in the instancedescriptor one that actually takes some state to describe the properties such as your blobs property

607557
sendmessage	message
if both programs have message loops that are being processed and you are sending an integer you could use a call to sendmessage through the p invoke layer as well but that s only because you are sending data that is equal to or smaller than what sendmessage will allow

607560
contains	any
1 - user registers using email as username a site name which then forms part of any url which they will have access to and a password of at least 6 characters which must contains letters and numbers i know this could be stronger

607560
hash	md5
i then take the users password concatenate the salt to it and store an md5 hash of this salted password in the same database row

607560
hash	md5
3 - when a user then logs in i take the password she s entered and concatenate the salt to it create an md5 hash of that and compare it to what i have stored in the database - if they match the user has entered the right password and their username is written to the session

607597
32-bit	64bit
this allows a process on a 64bit cpu to work with a larger set of data constrained by physical memory than a process on a 32-bit cpu could

607597
32-bit	64bit
a 64bit integer makes arithmetic or logical operations using 64bit types such as c s long long faster than one implemented as two 32-bit operations

607597
32-bit	64bit
floating point arithmetic is unlikely to be significantly affected as fpu s on most modern 32-bit cpu s natively support 64bit double floating point types

607609
stderr	stdout
here s how you would redirect stdout and stderr to a log file

607609
stderr	stdout
the redirect stdout to a file and and the redirects stderr to stdout so any error messages will be logged as well

607611
listitem	selected
a dropdownlist control is rendered as a selected element in the hhtml code and the listitem controls are rendered as option elements

607612
salt	md5
if valid update the user table salt and password with a new salt you have the password from the user so you can md5 it and the salt again

607627
lgpl	gpl
these days it s also licensed with lgpl in addition to gpl and commercial so you can use it for practically any purpose

607636
keyboard	mouse
it can take the form of keyboard clicks mouse clicks auditory signals or any modality capable of carrying information

607648
linux	unix
is there any convention of how are sources manipulated on linux unix systems

607652
void	main
first of all main should return an int not void

607654
selected	button
usually this is accomplished by installing one product so one entry in add remove programs that you can modify selected the product click the modify button

607655
put	get
if they get your code too then the royal screwing happens but lets put up as many barriers as we can

607655
authentication	login
use that as authentication if that isn t valid dump them to the login

607665
virtualization	virtualbox
don t know the exact details for an ati setup but you should be able to use xinerama to create a single large virtual desktop and then just run virtualbox though honestly i prefer kvm which runs on modern cpus which provide native virtualization support full-screen on one of those monitors

607670
command-line	cmd
is there a windows cmd-line cmd that i can use to get the full path to current working directory

607742
rewrite	rule
the more comprehensive answer the rewritecond and rewriterule directives are from the apache module mod_rewrite and provide a rule based url rewrite mechanism

607746
couchdb	mnesia
i m using mnesia with erlang but this question applies to any key-value db like couchdb etc

607756
firefox	safari
i am developing a reusable asp.net server control that needs to work in ie 6+ firefox 2+ and safari both quirks and standards mode

607756
attributes	properties
the control will expose two user definable properties height and width both of these attributes can be defined as either a percentage or as a pixel value

607763
administration	account
the machine is running vista business 32-bit uac is disabled with a single administration account and automatic updates are turned off

607763
administration	credentials
the user has full administration credentials no compatibility mode was needed on the initial test which at the time was done on this very machine i am having the problem on

607794
perl	ruby
no pre-built tool is going to help you there but a good scripting language say python ruby or even perl will help a lot

607803
backslash	regex
the backslash escapes the parenthesis since otherwise it counts as a regex command

607840
assign	add
in the orchestration add a message assign shape

607840
assign	add
add the following code to the message assign shape

607874
value	field
the cost of creating the cloned original value object would be minimal unless you ve got a very large number of field or unless some contains large data objects large text blocks images etc.

607874
value	field
if you don t want to maintain a full clone consider just saving old value for the field that change

607879
python	c++
c++ python bash

607885
communication	messages
the whole point of twitter is that you can leverage the huge amount of shared real world context to pack meaningful communication in a very short messages

607934
subclassing	superclass
i have an abstract superclass and various subclassing

607947
folder	dir
add the jar to your project - create a dir in your project optional maybe call it lib and import the jar into it using file- import or if your os supports drag it as an icon into the folder on windowss i open an explorer windows and drag it from there into the folder in eclipse

607967
put	get
put the data someplace statically accessible and have the subclasses get it from there

607972
subclassing	superclass
if you have a fixed set of subclassing then you can put the data in the superclass

607972
subclassing	superclass
you might get subclassing let the superclass know of their existence from the static initializer or use an agent

607972
subclassing	superclass
generally superclass should not be aware of their subclassing

607972
subclassing	superclass
however you might want to think or better refactor your superclass into a supertype and some other class responsible for your subclassing

607975
put	get
if no match then i get the record from the database and put it in the arrays

607976
windows	ms-dos
it works very fine except for one issue whenever i compile my projects the output display is eclipse s console view but when i run or debug any projects the output windows is the old and not-so-good ms-dos command windows

607978
abstract-class	subclassing
the other option is to put a registry map in the abstract-class - if you need to mandate it the abstract constructor takes the static value or just stores the subclassing if calculations are needed

607984
swing	awt
the swing awt components palette has a whole bunch of stuff that the javafx script code clips palette does not it has button checkbox combobox comboboxitem label radiobutton slider textfield and togglebutton

607985
duplicates	elements
i can always wrap that logic into a chainedadd methods that returns a duplicates dictionary with the new elements added but it just seems like i am missing some way of creating a viewdatadictionary that would do this for me and that is a bit more overhead than i was hoping for

608016
constructor	object
the inner viewdatadictionary gets its collection initialized then this populates the real viewdatadictionary using the constructor overload which takes viewdatadictionary instead of object

608031
value	field
my problem is that after the initial field creation if i go back to the list settings page and click on my newly added field the form shows my custom properties with some value that i m not providing it

608031
value	field
for example if my custom property s display name is my custom prop then the value in its textbox will be my custom prop field value

608034
javascript	dom
is it needed some sort request for the dom to re-interpret the javascript after the append or

608048
sql-server	mysql
you have your data access sql-server mysql flat xml files etc. all of this should be abstracted away nothing else in your application should care or know how you are getting your data only that it dose if anything else knows how you are getting your data you have a layer violation

608048
initializer	setter
biz layer implements a data-access interface like the idal we talked about before you can initializer this with a factory an inversion-of-control containers or all else failing a concrete type but add a setter property so this can be changed for testing

608078
contains	elements
therefore in the href attributes of the above literal result elements the second avt attributes-value-template contains just a placeholder for this xpath expression

608097
linked-list	arrays
i want to create something similar to a double linked-list but with arrays that works with lower upper bounds

608098
qdatetime	qstring
for example a qdate qdatetime qstring and others raise an error

608102
constructor	object
the textboxes never display the values i am assigning to the object properties in the constructor

608113
javascript	dom
you can use the eval function mentioned to run dynamically loaded javascript that modifies the document using dom objects

608120
authentication	login
can i authentication them to the reporting site even though the login occured at a sub-domain

608122
any	set
to make matters worse ajax requests from the browser do not include any of the cookies you have set for the website

608125
required	checked
checked for a referrer header and required it to be from your site

608133
internet-explorer	firefox
to be clear the question is how can i make the above piece of code function the same in internet-explorer as it does in firefox

608136
any	set
is there any way to set the orientation of a movie that is opened in a webview

608147
stream	send
set the content type of the page to the type that matches the image for example image jpeg read the image file and send directly to the response stream

608153
for-loop	loops
use a foreach loops instead of a for-loops - it solved my problem

608162
viewdidappear	viewdidload
i tried setting up a now loading view in the tab s viewcontroller s viewdidload methods then i do the work in viewdidappear setting a flag to not do the work again on next time through viewdidappear

608172
contains	elements
according to the css specification the inline-block elements should be a contains block so it can have display block elementss within it and those should not affect the rest of the layout

608187
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
you set up the now loading in viewwillappear but you never see it since by the time viewdidappear completes it s done with the heavy work

608233
export	report
step 3 hide the export controls on your report viewer

608238
compatibility	deprecated
name attributess are deprecated in xhtml 1.0 - you can use an id attributes in the same way though see fragment identifiers in the html compatibility guidelines of the xhtml spec

608253
xlsx	xls
spreadsheetgear for .net can read and write both excel 97-2003 xls workbooks and excel 2007 open xml xlsx workbooks and will convert between the two formats

608286
udp	tcp
how does one set the tos flags dscp flags in ruby on a udp tcp stream

608324
tstringlist	tlist
one way would be to create a tstringlist and have each item s object point to another tlist or tstringlist which would contains all of your value

608330
boost	stl
it will work on any stl collection vectors boost arrays etc

608334
moss	wss
there are 2 flavors of sharepoint wss and moss

608334
moss	wss
i also need to better understand the relationship between moss and wss with respect to search

608339
configuration	logging
that is rather a pain point for us as we have many deployments which does not share logging configuration and it is rather messy to do this in j.u.l

608347
contains	any
so the thing to do is to find a string starting with an opening quote followed by a string which does not contains a closing quote or any r n characters and is followed by a series of one or more r n characters capture everything but the terminal r n characters and replace the whole match with the captured portion

608357
firefox	safari
i ve tested in firefox 3 and safari 4.

608383
any	set
if you set any cookies when sending the pdf over to the user go ahead and store something inside the controllers s session object does acrobat send back the cookies alongside the submitted form data

608401
margins	padding
you can stop it happening by removing the margins from â pâ elements and using padding instead

608427
derived-class	base-class
what you can do is have both templates derive from a common base-class always use the base-class in your code and then decide which derived-class to use at runtime

608428
value	field
bear in mind that the need to hold onto those value implies their storage on the heap somewhere probably an arrays field of a class instance

608450
directory	folder
to scan the directory of a folder which is used for zip uploads

608450
directory	folder
i want to be able to find all the folders inside my folder so i can delete them and their contents leaving only the files in the directory

608480
video-player	flv
this is used for various things including sending flv s from outside the webroot to an embedded flash video-player

608490
jdk6	jvm
these are likely to be widely adopted in the future as more support for dynamic languages on top of the jdk6 scripting arrives in the jvm

608491
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu debian you can use the following

608496
entity-framework	data-access
the ado.net entity-framework is designed to enable developers to create data-access applications by programming against a conceptual application model instead of programming directly against a relational storage schema

608512
attributes	properties
for example is just a xaml representation of the system.windows.controls.button class and the attributes allowed on the tag are the public properties of the button class

608524
xsd	xml
jaxb is great if you have to code to some external xml spec defined as an xml schema xsd

608532
onkeydown	onkeyup
onkeypress onkeydown onkeyup methods in javascript

608533
shell	tcsh
the only thing i could think to try is to change the shell settings plesk has a dropdown list of bash csh tcsh and so on next to the allow ssh using option

608535
textbox	button
whenever user presses over tab button i want to check from database if there is a name like my first textbox s.text

608538
attributes	properties
class names are elements in xaml and properties on the class are attributess or attributes elements using dot notation

608538
any	set
there are however a specific set of elements that are specific to xaml in itself and are not related to any particular .net assembly those are usually in the x namespace more info here xaml namespace x

608540
filtering	grouping
sometimes it makes sense for a single type to have a lot of methods - such as system.linq.enumerable but partial classes can help in such cases if you can break the type up into logical grouping in the case of enumerable grouping by aggregation set operations filtering etc would seem natural

608544
contains	any
you should not really call an onload function within any other function that is called after body load because no matter how careful you are you cannot depend on the fact that the loading time frame is long enough to contains both events you should append to window.onload before the body tag is called or finished to make sure the event is caught

608556
filtering	grouping
however if you assign temp out to a send port grouping the message is sent to all the ports in the grouping irregardless of the filtering set on each port

608561
value	field
so if for example you had a property that returned a struct modifying the value of a field on that struct would be worthless because the getter would return a copy of the struct rather than a reference to the struct

608571
vb.net	vb6
the software was written in vb6 and ported to vb.net we want to update it to use .net functionality but i am not sure where to start with my research

608571
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
we are currently using sqlconnection sqldataadapter sqldatareader to connect to the database

608579
umask	chmod
the containers folder has chmod 775 and the umask is set to 022

608588
any	set
if i need an object i ask a service for it and internally that service is going to fetch that object from a data source repository or the like or in the case of a new object it will likely utilize some kind of factory to get me a new object with any necessary pre-filled properties already set to default values rules run etc.

608592
32-bit	64bit
included in the box are 2 cds for installing visual-studio 3 cds for msdn library 1 dvd for installing microsoft sql-server 2005 developer edition 32-bit 64bit a product key for visual-studio pro a product key for sql-server developer edition 2005 a poster pack containing some awesome posters to start fires with and a manual

608602
duplicates	contains
some records with duplicates ids contains different datecreated values

608602
duplicates	contains
some records with duplicates ids contains the same datecreated values

608603
configuration	environment
it allows you to have per environment configuration

608615
sigaction	signals
if you want to intercept writes to a range of addresses you can use mprotect to mark the memory in question as non-writeable and install a signals handler using sigaction to catch the resulting sigsegv do your logging or whatever and mark the page as writeable again

608624
constructor	object
and you can setup the library to inject a object into the constructor when it s created

608624
dependency-injection	inject
so di or dependency-injection means to inject any object another might require

608634
instances	destroy
any attempts to consistently destroy and recreate this instances results in a memory leak similar to the one that exists if you try to do the same thing to instancess of the uiimagepickercontroller class

608634
switching	screens
the info screens has a back button to switching the views back

608634
instances	destroy
any advice on how to cleanly create and destroy instances of the uiviewcontroller class such that memory does not leak

608640
checkbox	button
namely you can tab between fields you can select lots of checkbox and you have a click a button to actually submit your data

608648
height	frame
maybe you should move the function to the inner frame as well so that when you grab height value you reference the body directly rather than frame object.

608663
cvs	git
subversion git and cvs clients

608667
value	field
i am querying a database field that returns a money value i am assigning this to a string but it is adding extra 00 on the end

608669
defined	declare
the more common case is when you have a class function interface to declare defined

608686
implements	extends
probably the class that you are extends or potentially interface you are implements implements java.io.serializable

608691
configuration	environment
with that it is relatively easily possible to switch the logging based on environment the application is deployed to a developer may want to use simplelog or java.util.logging on his machine because of ease of maintenance while on a sit system log4j with a common configuration for all apps may be deployed etc.

608700
contains	any
in order to gain access to the current request s controllers if any from any model add the following to environment.rb or much preferably to a new plugins create vendor pluginss controllers_from_model init.rb contains the code below

608728
double	int
int int + double is essentially

608728
double	int
int double + double

608728
double	int
the int + double forces the result to an int while the other one requires casting

608741
traversal	parent
traversal arbitrary depth parent child links can be very inefficient when using just a parent_id

608745
web-services	security
according to the documentation there are two ways of adding security policies to web-services

608750
data-members	instances
instances of which appear in c++ code and can almost be used just like primitive variables data-members

608750
primitive	int
where int would be the wrapped class for the int primitive type etc...

608761
command-line	cmd
you would just need to send your cmd to the mysql command-line client

608772
linguistics	nlp
a good starting point for the different fields of nlp is usually the according chapter in the oxford handbook of computational linguistics

608793
google-chrome	firefox
that ll work in ie6 firefox google-chrome and safari

608811
double	int
double + int returns double so

608811
double	int
double double + int is legitimate see jls 5.1.2 widening primitive conversion

608811
double	int
int double + int is narrowing primitive conversion and requires explicit cast

608816
export	report
first of all schooner is absolutely correct that all the other report tools have a poor scenario when export to excel

608816
export	report
instead of creating just another export to excel where we look at paginated report output and try to fit it into a spreadsheet somehow we generate the excel output based on two things a templates and the actual data in the report

608832
keyboard	mouse
the transfer cable isn t explicitly an hid like a mouse or keyboard but it conforms to the hid spec

608838
document	editing
once your done editing the xml and any other items you tell gaia to scaffold for every section you accounted for in the xml a fla is created a document class with hooks to either a timeline based transition or a tweenlite max implementation depending on your choice before scaffolding

608839
gethashcode	equals
okay so if i override equals i need to override gethashcode and vice versa

608848
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
you ll need to dig abit into qmainwindow code to see exactly how to do this and probably to inherited from qdockwidget which is something you usually are not supposed to do

608871
json	xml
the whole point of json was to remove the overhead caused by xml

value	field
in summary - use the cakeschema schema shell the fixtures shell from debuggable.com and uuid value for your id s and it should give you a portable structure creation tool a portable data insertion tool and a portable id field format

608884
ruby	php
ruby on rails python on django numerous frameworks plus java or even cake w php ick would work for the development work

608886
.when	ready
now the error that your talking about im guessing is that you merely set the above to removeeventlistener .when you were ready which will not work

608893
daemons	systemd
systemd administration commands and daemons

608897
silverlight	wpf
xaml is an example of data stored in xml same as xhtml etc used in wcf wpf silverlight etc

608897
xsd	xml
xml schemas xsd define valid xml

608897

i currently have my program ignoring sigint and printing a new line when the signals comes but how can i prevent the c from being printed

608923
value	field
each column represents a field in the pojo each row represents an user each cell will have a value of read write etc

608924
gethashcode	equals
if i override equals and gethashcode how do i decide which fields to compare

608931
gethashcode	equals
if you as the class designer consider two instances of that class to be equals if they share the same myid then you only need to test myid in your overriden equalss and gethashcode methods

608933
required	checked
you only need to checked for the fields that are required to match if all that needs to match is the id then go with that

608936
gethashcode	equals
a question if i override equals and gethashcode how do i decide which fields i compare

608951
python	ruby
i m trying to come up with an elegant way of creating a list from a function that yields values in both python and ruby

608962
put	get
but i can t get this to work if i put it between the tags .

609005
sniffing	traffic
you could try sniffing its traffic with a tool like wireshark

609006
show	next
once user filled them out and click on next button hid this and show the other which will ask for other information like address and so on

609027
swing	gwt
it works well in swing and just as well in gwt

609033
methods	extend
with a query constructed by composition you can extend it with ease to add new ways to query without having to add new methods to your repository

609033
nhibernate	llblgenpro
i haven t actually done this in nhibernate yet but we did this with llblgenpro and it worked out really well

609044
search-engine	seo
this symptom with the hosted site is that i can t turn on any seo settings in joomla not even the first setting search-engine friendly urls

609058
sqldatasource	detailsview
i dont know how to setup sqldatasource and detailsview to accomplish this

609059
python	ruby
you ll probably do a lot better if you stop trying to write python idioms using ruby syntax

609063
value	field
i am trying to populate an html.dropdownlist with a selectlist which is populate with a string value a location address and text a location description field from a database call

609079
textbox	button
in that page you put all the textbox that you need and a button for registration

609105
children	nodes
the parsing will ping your callback for each nodes and pass in a data structure containing all kinds of juicy bits like plaintext any attributes children nodess etc

609114
user-input	output
feed in user-input to the external program and see if you get the right output

609129
python	lua
two of the best scripting examples in aaa games that come to mind are world of warcraft uses lua and eve online uses python

609140
findstr	cmd
findstr cmd to search it in the .m file that you are building the dependency for and outputs that to a temp.txt file this is because i couldn t figure out a way to get a 1 or 0 or isempty return on the output of the cmd

609147
constructor	object
there is a concept call move constructor that would allow you to transfer the ownership of a resource held by a stack-based object to a new object

609151
buffering	streaming
the handler would accept input from the query-string form as normal locate the object to streaming and streaming the data using a moderately sized local buffering in a loop

609156
memcached	apc
for this in php you need apc which comes pretty much as standard with php these days and will be standard as of php 6 --all you have to do is enable it in the config--or memcached particularly if you ve got some sort of clustered solution

609164
digital-signature	signing
in brief after signing your data you call a third party web service to provide an official timestamp and their own digital-signature linking that timestamp to your signature value thus providing evidence that the original signature and thus the original data was created on or before that date

609168
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie firefox but in google-chrome it seems that it can t find the background image and makes the background nothing

609169
curly-braces	parentheses
that trick works because c syntax doesn t allow curly-braces inside parentheses

609180
division	modulo
the modulo operators returns the remainder after division so

609181
gnupg	gpgme
you may want to leverage pgp by using gpgme gnupg made easy a library designed to make access to gnupg easier for applications

609201
order	add
for instance i might could add an effect insert to the a in order to match perfectly with the b and avoid having to add another a

609202
build-server	teamcity
a build-server like cruise control hudson or teamcity is going to automatically ensure that every commit is a good commit that compiles and can run successfully assuming you have tests in place

609250
checkbox	textarea
the form can also contain a varying number of input fields such as text fields radio buttons checkbox dropdowns select tags and textarea

609255
firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox and safari but bombs in ie

609260
mbunit	nunit
the steps taken in this nunit example apply to an mbunit implementation

609268
google-apps	gmail
just think of the google-apps like gmail mobile and maps for mobile

609269
constructor	object
building on konrad s suggestion of using policy types if your algorithms require parameters at construction time you can handle this cleanly by requiring that any policy class has a nested type called params and then provide a constructor inside that takes an argument of this type and passes it to the contained policy object

609269
default-value	default
this way by using a default-value for the constructor as above we enable convenient default-construction of a whenever policy params has a default constructor when the policy doesn t require any parameters

609269
constructor	object
no safety is lost if policy params lacks a default constructor indicating that some parameters are required any attempt to default-construct a object will fail at compile time

609279
calloc	free
in the second calloc and free are used instead of _alloca

609279
calloc	free
the weird thing is that i use the calloc free technique in almost every other gmp wrapping function i have and they all work

609313
gtk	swt
if you create a composite with the style swt.embedded style then under swt gtk composite.embeddedhandle will be an x windows id you can use for parenting an xembed child

609313
gtk	swt
the difficulty here is that swt talks to gtk which talks to gdk which then talks to x

609333
resource-files	resx
so for a full recommendation i d say use resource-files resx to start for button labels etc and a cms for the meaty content

609375
webforms	asp.net
edit i forgot to mention that these considerations are orthogonal to the asp.net framework choice mvc or webforms

609393
hash	tie
tie with g dbm family for fast scalability persisent hash

609436
stdin	pipe
what i d like to do is hand my communicators an inputstream and outputstream or reader and writer that could be from a serial-port file stdin stdout pipe from a test function whatever

609438
protected	public
since jsdt is a reimplementation of the jdt interfaces it may just be reusing jdt s private protected public model best it can without an actual way to mark fields methods for access-control

609445
command-line	cmd
the password and up cmd i pass from the cmd-line but there is a security threat there if someone has access to the history

609468
linked-list	nodes
if you want a linked-list - call new to create each new nodes and then add it to the list

609499
repository	entity
use the double dispatch technique where the entity has methods to save to an arbitrary repository

609519
configuration	environment
app.config for the hosting environment in this case the managed windows service contains the configuration for all your modules

609528
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere voice

609562
cosine	cos
so the number of miles per degree has to be multiplied by the cosine of the latitude so approx cos 47 degrees or .68

609566
data-uri	data-url
you could try but that doesn t provide a mechanism through which you can suggest a name and also ie has a very small cap on the maximum length of a data-url which could be a problem

609580
versionone	rally
i also used versionone a few years ago but i think rally is better

609581
contains	set
if they are set the variables whose name is contains in x to the value y

609593
arrays	map
you can map the resulting arrays to an arrays of numbers

609593
contains	any
if the possibility exists that the string doesn t contains any number use

609610
implements	extends
to support it natively you probably have to extends webhttpbinding or make your own binding and implements custom encoder

609632
versioning	upgrade
the dialog that pops up has a section for a minimum required versioning for this application which lets you enforce that a user upgrade to a specific versioning

609632
versioning	upgrade
they ll also be forced to upgrade if they re running a versioning older than the minimum

609653
primitive	int
with the enums they defined values are limited to a small set of primitive integral types byte sbyte short ushort int uint long ulong

609657
increment	reset
if you have a int not null auto increment primary key that you never reset then yes ids will not be reused

609661
32-bit	64bit
if the origin of the error was the mismatch between the integral type s size and the pointer size then this will work on most 32-bit platforms where both int and are 32-bit but fail on most 64bit platforms where int is 32-bit and is 64 bits

609663
contains	set
the best example is the selection key of nsarraycontrollers which contains the set of selected objects

609668
implements	extends
often times and interface and an abstract-class are used together to achieve different results utilizing inherited and polymorphism extends implements

609671
selected	textbox
the question is when the user clicks on the row of the result it will be automatically back into home.aspx and the selected name is placed in the textbox

609694
triggers	insert
so check in your triggers for 1 in insert

609698
google-chrome	opera
the results are very different for different browsers with google-chrome getting all the points for speed and opera a good second - but that s not the question here

609706
handler	service
a more helpful way would be to display a notification jquery about a missing file but the file download is not done in ajax so this would involve a two step process - a client side onclick handler calls a web service methods to check if the file exists if not then i cancel the click return false and display a friendly message to the user

609738
specifications	w3c
innerhtml is not a part of the w3c dom specifications

609738
attributes	properties
for example when text is entered into a text input ie will change the value attributes of the input s innerhtml properties but gecko browsers do not

609738
javascript	dom
for those wishing to adhere to standards here is one set of javascript functions offering to serialize or parse xml so as to set element contents defined as string s via the dom or getting element contents obtained from the dom as a string

609755
any	set
the thing is that when the response is retrieved readystate set to 4 and div1 is displayed the photo has not been completely loaded yet so actually the user can see the process of the picture slowly appearing as he would in any other â œnormalâ case

609774
diagram	erd
dezign from datanamic erd tool can read in access databases and make a diagram out of it

609785
any	set
a good wiki that can use any of the popular version-control systems and be set up in a distributed fashion is ikiwiki

609785
gnome	kde
some projects that strive to be alternatives to visio are kivio kde and dia gtk gnome

609833
value	field
i have a text field which is bound with integer variablesiables so when user enters number into this field binding mechanism automatically converts text into integer and sets this value into variables

609833
value	field
problem is since user types text into text field that binding mechanism is converting only values and if user types some letters into it binding would not activate because there is no legal value inside text field

609833
value	field
so if user would left this field empty or something that is not number binding will have to triggers null value propagation

609853
order	add
in order to get an arrays of arguments you would normally add an to the argument as declared otherwise args would have to be input as an arrays whcih would rather defeat the object

609872
bazaar	git
i m relatively new to git but i want to give it a try vs svn and bazaar

609892
linked-list	nodes
for starters i would suggest you rename your linked-list struct to nodes and add a new linked list struct that holds the head and maybe current tail pointers

609944
matplotlib	reportlab
i have come across google charts api reportlab pychart matplotlib and chartdirector

609955
base-class	inherited
i have a class that inherited from a base-class which again inherited from another base-class and overrides a function

609972
syntax-error	syntax
i get an error syntax-error invalid syntax

609976
arrays	loops
in the while loops the programmer was doing filter arrays a lot

609979
design-time	design-view
wpf applications on the other hand have comparatively pathetic design-time support with the design-view all-too ready to chicken out at the first encounter of an error often requiring a project build after the fix before the designer is willing to kick in again

609995
contains	set
i had a quite similar case with a table which had no primary key set - so joining to this table contains 5 row s or so took about 10minutes yes - the other table was quite big

610013
show	next
i have a loginwindows with username and password to access in the software after that the user authentication i want show in the next windows the mainwindows of the software the name of the user authentication in a textblock ...i show a code-snippets of my loginwindows

610016
workitem	fogbugz
fogbugz - that could be put into tfs workitem

610020
operators	keyword
the correct operators to be used are the keyword or and and which in your example the correct way to express this would be

610060
packaging	building
does anyone know where i can find some best practices guide for building and packaging c applications on aix

610063
http	ssl
if you set up your server to use ssl then you can have encrypted transmission via ajax using http

610080
hash	md5
i would prefer to use something like an md5 hash but if i m wasting my time then i won t bother

610087
any	set
do you have any controls with autopostback set to true

610090
pbkdf2	scrypt
therefore you should use something like bcrypt scrypt pbkdf2 with a large number of iterations

610102
installation	building
weâ ve been able to successfully integrate the production of the clickonce install into our automated building using the mage command-line tools and we can then successfully run the actual installation on a client machine

610104
versioning	upgrade
it also isn t guaranteed to return the same hash value on different versioning of the .net meaning that an upgrade could potentially produce a different hash for the same string rendering your passwords unusable to you

610104
hash	md5
it is recommended that you use a salted hash or even md5 at a push

610120
capitalization	capitalize
real names have special capitalization rules the van der in johannes diderik van der waals is never capitalize farrah fawcett-majors has the m and cathal ã heochaidh uses the non-ascii ã and h which modify eochaidh to mean grandson of eochaidh

610125
postgresql	mysql
mysql ms sql express or postgresql sql

610147
strncmp	strcmp
you may consider using strncmp as a safer alternative to strcmp

610149
substring	strstr
try strstr if that is the case it finds substring

610159
ubuntu	debian
if am not wrong ubuntu s postgresql packages are derived from debian

610159
ubuntu	debian
if that s the case debian and all it s derivatives like ubuntu will depict the same behaviour

610167
installation	building
in the target properties building modify the installation directory of myibpluginframework to loader_path .. frameworks

610169
any	set
anyone got any ideas where i can set my property value so it s picked up in the order i m trying to achieve

610174
linux	bsd
welcome to the 31 and more flavors of operating systems revolving around the linux kernel or the efforts focused on the bsd kernel

610188
detect	move
how can i detect whether the block or cursor div move over each other

610195
rich-internet-application	ria
into rich-internet-application ria

610197
entity-framework	ado.net
is there a way to achieve this in linq 2 entities ado.net entity-framework

610204
locale	french
that said if you need to handle say french names on a system running an english locale you ll need a more robust implementation

610223
output	mode
the failing class is in an dll from which its output path in debugging mode is set to the executable s plugins folder

610223
folder	dir
the problem then is that the plugins uses the dependencies from in the pluginss folder while the executable uses the dependencies from the root folder which are basically the same file in a different dir so while running the clr sees them as 2 different dll s and that really confuses the clr

610230
.when	ready
the main problem is that you have to have a mechanism which is notified .when the fetch is completed by the o r mapper so the caller is notified that data is ready

610230
.when	ready
using asynchronous methods is of no use here as the caller would otherwise have to be notified .when the data is ready which required a push from the webservice to the client which required the client to stay connect to the webservice as long as the fetch takes anyway

610231
droppable	draggable
if you also include jquery user-interface and make your main div a draggable and all other divs droppable all you need is hook up on the droppable s over event to get notified when the main div is dragged over the other one

610238
strncpy	strcpy
while i admit that it s usually better to use strncpy in order to avoid buffering overflows the following an implementation of the strdup function for those not lucky enough to have it safely uses strcpy and should never overflow

610238
strncpy	strcpy
is guaranteed to have enough spaces to store and using strcpy saves us from having to store the strlen result in another function to use later as the unnecessary in this case length parameter to strncpy

610238
strncpy	memcpy
yet some people write this function with strncpy or even memcpy which both require a length parameter

610238
strcpy	memcpy
if you have a good reason not to use strcpy in this situation please give it - i d like to know why it might be better to use strncpy or memcpy in situations like this

610238
strcpy	memcpy
basically i just want to know why some people use memcpy when others use strcpy and still others use plain strncpy

610260
strcpy	memcpy
i d tend to use memcpy if i have already calculated the length although strcpy is usually optimised to work on machine words it feels that you should provide the library with as much information as you can so it can use the most optimal copying mechanism

610260
strcpy	memcpy
but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively

610270
python	java
i m a programmer working with different languages formats java python xml html objective-c etc.

610277
strncpy	strcpy
but yeah strcpy is as good as strncpy in any situation where you are allocating memory for the destination buffering and have already used strlen to find the length

610288
strncpy	strcpy
the reason why people use strncpy not strcpy is because strings are not always null terminate and it s very easy to overflow the buffering the spaces you have allocated for the string with strcpy and overwrite some unrelated bit of memory

610288
strncpy	strcpy
with strcpy this can happen with strncpy this will never happen

610301
innodb	myisam
if you have the storage to spare what you can do is put the main canonical version of the data in an innodb table and then create a separate myisam table that contains a copy of the freetext content purely for use as searchbait

610315
revision	svn
cat a file as it has been committed within a specific revision similar to svn

610316
strncpy	strcpy
strncpy is not by origin a bounded strcpy and the committee has preferred to recognize existing practice rather than alter the function to better suit it to such use

610317
attributes	properties
i had to read the attributes s nodevalue properties dynamically since it wasn t exposed in the interface

610378
connection-pooling	pool
see in this link best practices for using ado.net in it you will find a link to sql-server connection-pooling ado.net - make sure you really are using a connection pool correctly

610385
fault-tolerance	reliability
one of the main principles of software reliability is fault-tolerance

610397
fflush	gets
be sure any pending output gets fflush from the output buffering

610404
strcpy	memcpy
frankly if you are doing much string handling in c you should not ask yourself whether you should use strcpy or strncpy or memcpy

610440
strcat	strlen
i used stdio calls strlen strstr strcpy and strcat to do the string manipulation rather than win32 calls so your only dependancy is the c run time

610466
spreadsheet	apache-poi
the spreadsheet i am trying to read isn t empty it has been created using ms excel 2003 and biffviewer include with the apache-poi package has no problem parsing it

610470
directory	folder
and like any other django project i have got apps inside the project root directory and some special folder like extensions a.k.a custom django command extensions

610489
margins	padding
you may also need to play with the margins and padding to get them centered like margins-left 50

610489
text-align	width
padding-left - 1 2 width of element and text-align center

610494
strncpy	strcpy
once you get to real string ops like modifying the middle of a string it s almost as easy to pass the wrong length into strncpy and especially strcat as it is to call strcpy with a too-small destination

610494
strncpy	strcpy
of course you might still ask whether to use strncpy or strcpy in implements that abstraction strncpy is safer there provided you fully grok what it does

610505
updating	updates
i am updating the sql-server 2005 database using batch updates as shown below

610510
simplemodal	jquery
jquery is your friend for this try simplemodal

610516
ruby-on-rails	django
a dispatcher that maps urls to methods like cherrypy django cerise ruby-on-rails etc...

610530
png	gif
gif or png

610537
methods	extend
if you are going to use resx and not use server controls as you are in asp.net-mvc why not extend the asp.net-mvc helper methods so you can create localised labels and text

610542
png	gif
png is a newer format and often better than either jpeg of gif - especially for screenshots

610552
action-filter	controller
in order to have the action-filter called automatically you are going to need to run the controller action invoker

610557
png	gif
gif is not really a very good format and png can replace it completely in compression and quality for most applications but sometimes there are compatibility issues not sure if these have been ironed out in all the current webbrowsers

610563
png	gif
png is good in both regards but that discussion tends to get a little religious because there are license fees to pay if you develop a programm that reads writes gif or jpeg while png is free

610565
png	gif
png can do all that gif can except animation and even that is coming in apng and should almost always be smaller

610565
png	gif
if png isn t smaller than gif then your software may be saving it poorly - look for png optimisation progams like pngout and pngnq

610566
perl	c++
string manipulation is slow in c++ but quick in languages like php perl etc

610573
png	gif
historically gif was here first then jpg then png

610573
png	gif
jpg and png work well for most applications but the files will be larger than gif for very simple graphics

610577
alpha-transparency	alpha
the 24-bit png supports alpha transpancy so if you want to use true color alpha-transparency that s your only option really

610585
png	gif
jpeg can have a higher compression ratio than png gif but is lossy as the cartoon above demonstrates

610597
png	gif
despite myths to the contrary png outperforms gif in most aspects

610597
png	gif
png is capable of every image mode of gif apart from animation and when using the same image mode png will have better compression due to its superior deflate algorithm compared to lzw

610597
png	gif
png is also capable of additional modes that gif cannot do such as 24 bit color and alpha transparency but this is where you need to be careful if you forget to convert to palette mode your png image may be saved in 24 bit color which will take more spaces

610597
alpha-transparency	alpha
true color with alpha channel 24 bit color + 8 bit alpha-transparency

610597
png	gif
if you find png files are larger than the equivalent gif files then you re saving the png in 24 bit color and the gif in palette mode because a gif is always in palette mode

610611
windows-server	windows
in principle you can automate the encoder and instruct it to use your camera as a source and push it out to a specified udp port or publishing point for the latter you ll need windows-server 2003 2008 with windows media services installed

610649
boolean	int
since we re dealing with boolean is true and is also true you may wonder why this didn t either work anyway true being treated as an int quantity should still mean true true is a true value or throw an exception-handling eg

610675
linked-list	arrays
low-level coding decisions such as choosing a linked-list over an arrays can be left in code documentation unless it s a significant low-level decision

610678
python	java
well since i am coding in python so i have the liberty to write functions inside functions unlike c c++ or java

610679
value	field
what i have to do is just simply increment the value in the field by 1 in the db each time an activity happens

610716
put	get
the problem is that it seems when the updates are performed they don t go to mongrel with the put action instead i just get the cached page no action in the database no flash message no nothing....

610739
data-structures	hashmap
i m extensively using hashmap data-structures in my program

610744
qstackedwidget	qdockwidget
maybe you could use something like a qstackedwidget in the dock widget and use drag and drop events to create new qdockwidgets or move the contents of a qdockwidget into a new qstackedwidget

610749
hp-quality-center	user-stories
is there a way to import our current sharepoint requirements and user-stories to hp-quality-center

610754

png is also capable of additional modes that gif cannot do such as 24 bit color and alpha transparency but this is where you may run into problems on the web

610769
alpha-transparency	alpha
true color with alpha channel 24 bit color + 8 bit alpha-transparency

610769
png	gif
if you find png files are larger than the equivalent gif files then you re saving the png in 24 bit color and the gif in palette mode because a gif is always in palette mode

610769
png	gif
if you find that your png files with transparency aren t working properly in ie6 while your gif files are then you are using 24 bit color + alpha transparency in png and palette mode with a transparent color with gif

610784
shared-libraries	dynamic-linking
then it contains a copy of the .dynamic section and other stuff useful for dynamic-linking i believe this is the place that contains the needed shared-libraries among other stuff

610823
space	input
obviously #myform gets the element with id myform but what was less obvious to me at first was that the space character is needed between #myform and input as it is the descendant operator

610823
selected	button
input matches all input textarea selected and button elements

610823
selected	checkbox
the weird and helpful thing is that all input element types have value attributes even selected and checkbox etc

610829
value	field
i m guessing this has to do with the workflow being fired asynchronously from the commit operation that sets the field value

610840
python	ruby
yield means different things ruby and python

610840
python	ruby
in ruby you have to specify a callback block if i remember correctly whereas generators in python can be passed around and yield to whoever holds them

610863
arrays	loops
not to mention avoiding the loops - a b c multiplies the arrays almost like matlab syntax with compiled speed

610871
entity-framework	ado.net
isn t there any way to get two ado.net entity-framework models to use the same connection both having their own current database

610872

610899
powerpc	arm
qnx 6.4.x on x86 powerpc arm v6 sh4

610907
attributes	properties
the disadvantage here is that attributes errors in the properties __get__ code are also caught

610911
any	set
i do not set display in any of these .

610911
any	set
starting x11.app from the dock will get you two icons setting it to auto-launch is also a no-no and if you have set display in any of your configuration files you get a disaster

610947
search-engine	seo
it s also good for seo so that search-engine like google and yahoo

610961
constructor	object
using craig s answer as a starting point--i didn t even know you could combine both a constructor call and an object initializer--i stumbled on this snippet from palermo that leads to a combination that works

611013
order	join
your fact table should include this primary key as a foreign key in order to make join easier

611055
solaris	linux
on solaris or linux the

611060
connection-pooling	pool
i don t know your platform but look into connection-pooling - there must be a library or utility available either in the base system or as an add-on or supplied with the database drivers that will provide the means to pool several active connections to the database which are ready and raring to be used when you obtain one from the pool

611075
vmware	esx
i am just having a look at using powershell along with vi-toolkit to produce reports and charts showing vmware esx performance and resource usage

i have an application that is built to work on windows linux and solaris that uses the perl tk gui

611112
drawstring	draw
i currently have a printingwebservice that i call from an ajax page with all the information that is needed to construct a highly customized pdf printout using pdfsharp and the pdfsharp s gdi+ mode which takes drawstring and other commands that work basically just like gdi+ only they are draw to the pdf

611116
triggers	insert
add an identity-column to the table that the application can not change you can then use that new column to join the insert to the deleted tables within the triggers

611122
isinstance	abc
so hasattr is useless but isinstance together with abc s provides a clean solution

611123
memset	memcmp
the problem is memset sizeof struct and setting structures members one by one produce different byte-to-byte result and therefore memcmp returns not equal result

611123
memset	memcmp
in my real code i m working with arrays of structures via generic pointers to execute memset memcmp and i m usually don t know exact type i have only sizeof struct value

611128
environment	building
and just as bad it was equally as difficult for anyone to deploy a building to more than one environment

611128
environment	building
management would say ok you now have this building working in our regression testing environment

611128
environment	building
the qa guy managing the building and deploys could keep a whiteboard of which environment had which build deployed to it and which grouping was using that environment

611136
xunit.net	ncover
also msbuild is intended for building something so i guess that ncover xunit.net and fxcop should not be part of it or should they

611147
text-editor	editor
i ve implemented the yui editor and would like to apply a css to change the look of the text the user is working on inside the rich text-editor

611150

611154
portrait	screens
i find that working on documentation or reading long web pages is easier on the portrait screens

611158
document	editing
anyway i found portrait mode not really better when coding and only with my old 17 widescreen in portrait mode was viewing editing document better

611158
portrait	screens
so no portrait mode is not better unless you have four of them to make up a really large screens there was a photo of such a setup on a microsoft blog but i don t remember where

611167
sql-server	oracle
without any knowledge of sql-server i ll do it in oracle

611169
portrait	screens
a widescreens in portrait is very nice for writing code code width has never really been an issue and being able to see more line of code on the screens is always nice

611175
subclassing	base-class
for instances in the project i m working on i have an excel processor base-class and many subclassing implements that base-class

611178
any	set
visual-studio or any decent debugger should allow you to print a trace of the value every time it s set just by putting a tracepoint before and after all the calls that set the value

611188
msbuild	nant
for example my protobuf-net build file handles versioning svn compilation msbuild + nant for mono testing nunit packaging zip etc

611189
versioning	migrate
i would like to run db migrate versioning 0 and then db migrate inside of my own rake task

611213
communication	messages
the ability to have multiple bindings for the same service call means the messages doesn t have to serialization into xml and back if you simply want to communication inside a web farm

611215
versioning	migrate
running rake db migrate versioning 0 seems to force the compiler to check syntax in the lib tasks files

611218
hide	show
if you scroll down you can see that this function returns an object with show and hide methods

611241
buildpath	libs
i have no experience using eclipse with php but for java you can add external class folder in the libs tab of the buildpath dialog

611244

611332
python	ruby
the entire python and ruby cultures are available although there are some hiccups with installing some python libraries

611332
text-editor	editor
i didn t like most of the code editor i tried and started with smultron which isn t much more than a very competent text-editor with syntax-highlighting

611332
macvim	vim
i also bit the bullet and started using vim macvim specifically which is actually a fun thing to learn because there always seems to be another command that does exactly what you want

611345
contains	any
if the connection string contains any invalid setting it throws this exception-handling

611357
export	csv
normally i would export the excel file to a csv file then launch some magic perl scripting to do the cleaning and then reimport the excel file

611368
buffering	streaming
read does not necessarily read the entire buffering particularly if it is at the end of the streaming

611371
integer	zero
could you leave it as an integer and format it for humans in your sql for example to pad with zero to 4 chars wide

611374
getter	setter
you could use standard javabean setter getter to encapsulate your field

rather than do it the way everyone else does windows explorer firefox google-chrome internet-explorer opera certmgr etc they specifically only allow verisign

611484
calayer	uiview
i did a similar thing in order to invert the coordinate system the other way on the iphone so that a calayer hosted in a uiview would obey the mac s quartz coordinate system using the following code

611491
directory	folder
when my page loads onload i call a methods createstuff that create a number of linkbutton representing folder in a current directory which are wired to an event that changes the current directory to the one that is associated with the linkbutton

611491
directory	folder
therefore i also call createstuff in onloadcomplete resulting in the linkbutton being updated and reflecting the folder in the new current directory

611491
directory	folder
the result is that while the text-property of the linkbutton reflect the folder in the new directory clicking the linkbutton doesn t fire the event

611493
firefox	opera
right ofirefox the bat if viewed with firefox opera safari etc. when you click submit w o entering any values you get some nice error messages in the form the intended efirefoxect

perl	awk
supposedly larry wall wrote perl because he found something that was impossible to do with sed and awk

611533
perl	awk
henry spencer who did some amazing things with awk claimed that after demoing some awk stuff to larry wall larry said he wouldn t have bothered with perl if he d known. â paul tomblin

611542
strcpy	memcpy
memcpy can be faster than strcpy and strncpy because it does not have to compare each copy-paste byte with 0 and because it already knows the length of the copy-paste object

611559
catalyst	poe
you could also look at the tutorials of some of the big framework type modules catalyst or poe for example they have some pretty nifty things you can do with little code

611566

this article dealing with legacy 32-bit components in 64bit windows help you

611710
couchdb	mnesia
i m not sure about mnesia and i m only just getting started with couchdb but my understanding is that in couchdb since you generate your own custom indexes views you can straightforwardly build an index on those sub-items

611713
google-chrome	firefox
build in a more-compliant and developer-friendly browser like firefox first test thoroughly in ie and safari google-chrome webkit and opera periodically

611713

display	height
you may have to add some extra styles to suppress quirks in ie like specifying a height for elements that should manage to figure out their height by themselves adding display inline

611889
margins	padding
use padding rather than margin where either works as ie has problems to collapse margins correctly

611891

611981
perl	ksh
i ve scripted up a simple ksh that calls a perl program to find and replace in files

611993
llvm	gcc
also you may use a llvm backend to gcc to compile to lowlevel bytecodes which can then be interpreted in java

611997
order	add
add some random bits if you really want to make it harder to crack provided that you have the additional bits available assuming original order numbers go only up to 6 digits but you re allowed 8-9 in the obfuscated order number then you can use 2-3 digits for randomness before performing bit-mapping

612004
arrays	loops
first loops through the nodelist and store all entries in an arrays - then loops through the arrays

612035

google-chrome	firefox
this code will work fine in webkit google-chrome but not in firefox

612156
instances	private
i d refactor your main methods into a private construtor and put in a new main which launches it as a new instances

612242
synchronous	.when
.when switching to synchronous mode and ending the request immediately the problem goes away

612242
synchronous	.when
although i can t be sure it seems like these settings work good and fine if the requests are synchronous but .when async i can t seem to get beyond exactly 5000 requests before the server starts telling me to go away

612245
value	field
the getfieldvalue methods of an spfield accepts a string and it is up to the logic of that field class to read that string and convert it into a meaningful value object

612245
value	field
item fieldname returns a generic object that represents the field value

612253
processor	cpu
since downloading web pages is network bound rather than cpu bound using more threads than my number of processor cores is very benificial since most of the time in each thread is spent waiting for the network to catch up

612302
fopen	fread
starting with php v5.3 you can use ini_set to restrict the open_basedir to a specific folder so that files outside of that folder cannot possibly be read with fopen include fread etc

612347
contains	set
you don t want to put in an invalid userid but since the whole column doesn t contains userids you can t just set up an fk relationship

vbscript	perl
inline wsc javascript vbscript from perl on windows

612358
webforms	asp.net

612396
struct	unions
msvc allows anonymous struct inside of unions see the definition of d3dmatrix in but this is a non-standard c++ extension which you should avoid using if you can

32-bit	64bit
my experience with floating point variables has always involved 4-byte multiples like singles 32-bit doubles 64bit and long doubles which i ve seen refered to as either 96-bit or 128-bit

612533
hide	show
on each row of the form are links that when click launch a scripting to show new links allowing the user to add view or hide comments

612542
where-clause	sql
what would really neat is if i could break apart entire pieces of sql code like parts of the where-clause and reuse those in other queries but i doubt this is possible

612546
triggers	insert
the way i would approach this would be to manually observe the cost property of each invoicelineitem object by implementing the to-many kvc accessors for the lineitems property on the invoice class doing an addobserver removeobserver call in the insert remove methods respectively and then triggers the totalcost change manually using willchangevalueforkey didchangevalueforkey

612565
global-variables	call
what we have done is used user defined functions udf to gather what you might call global-variables

612605
triggers	insert
if you must handle multiple-row insert updates and there s no alternate key that s guaranteed not to change the only way i can see to do this is to use an instead of triggers

612605
triggers	insert
for example in the triggers you could break the original insert update command into one command per row grabbing each old id before you insert update

612620
perl	tcl
i ran the tcl autoexpect and it created a script file i then wrote couple lines of perl code that parses the lines with send and expect tags and then uses the perl expect module to run them along with some other actions

612639
multiplication	division
thus the floating-point unit of the cpu can be used to implements multiplication and division for integers

612714
factors	digits
337.36080000000004 is just as correct as 337.3608 since you only have 5 significant digits in the factors and only 3 in the test input

612747
version-control	git
that s the fundamental insight in the git approach to merging while every other version-control system is trying to get smarter git is happily self-described as the stupid content manager and it s better for it

612754

jquery	.post
i don t know if this is related or not but i was using jquery recently using the .ajax method to submit .post data from a text field to a php script

612824
gzip	zip
that being said short pdf files should be pretty impervious to most compression methods - images should be compressed during rendering and jpeg zip in this case - but if you have a lot of text gzip can help

p combination that match the regular expression lines contains info followed by any combination of digits spaces and commas between square brackets at the end of the line allowing for trailing spaces and cr

612937
expression	brackets
if any such line matches only keep what s between the square brackets 1 corresponding to what s between ... in the regular expression before printing p

612937
expression	brackets
it will first test whether each line matches the same regular expression passed in the previous example to sed except that unlike sed awk does not require a in fron the round brackets delimiting areas or interest

612939
openerp	tryton
if this doesn t work i think you ll have to step outside of django and try to incorporate something like openerp or tryton an openerp fork into your django app

612969
display	width
for example how would i display the order of attributes height and width first so that it looks the most tidy

612969

another issue is that there are multiple ways to implement an interface with grid and stack panels

612974
.when	ready
c risk acceptance be ready to deal with risks .when they occur a low probability or low impact of the risk compared to the cost of management might not be worth doing anything about them if you re the sole developer and there is a probability of being hit by an asteroid it just might be worth simply accepting the risk

612976
double	int
it basically maps some description to int double string iserialiazable etc types

612987
linux	unix

613016
any	set
is there any generally accepted way to get multiple keys from an insertion of a set an insert resulting from a selected query

613018
global-variables	call
each time you call random and you are calling it twice within a single function it reads the value of this global-variables performs a calculation that is not so fast

613018
solaris	freebsd
however this function is a glibc extension it is most likely not supported by other platforms neither part of the c standards nor of the posix standards afaik - this function does not exist on mac os x for example it may neither exist in solaris or freebsd

613024
contains	any
edit sorry didn t make it clear that this is just an example the table could contains any number of parent rows and any number of child rows

613062
any	set
you can set a cookie any time before sending output to the browser

613065
repository	entity
now i don t want to consider this number an entity and create a repository for it - that s overkill

613084

613183
value	field
i have a dictionary of value read from two fields in a database a string field and a numeric field

613186
put	get
in other words if your api action changes the server state rest advises us to use post put delete but not get

613201
any	set
any tokenize implementation would still have to do string matching on the full set of characters anyway so you may as well do it all in one shot

613208
put	get
get rid of and put a flag to indicate partial match

613213
configuration	environment
that s what ruby-on-rails initializer does when loading files in configuration environment because it needs to evaluate them within the ruby-on-rails initializer.run block

613218
tuples	sorted
sorted_x will be a list of tuples sorted by the second element in each tuple

613227
temporary	copy
there is no temporary copy of the data and no need to rebuild indexes

613229

key-value	key
sorted value key for key-value in mydict.items

613230
key-value	key
sorted value key for key-value in mydict.items

613248
binaries	install
you could always use cygwin and install the subversion package during install which would make it accessible in command-prompt with some path changes but i understand if this doesn t fit your criteria of just binaries

613248
cygwin	gnu
to answer the question why install all of cygwin if you just need subversion i find that originally being a linux app that i d be more comfortable using subversion in a nix environment such as cygwin and could consequently leverage gnu utils such as find grep bash etc to perform file based operations which subversion primarily deals with

613254
getter	setter
if you want to custimize it you can get great use of getter and setter though this is often used for more complex situations but may be interesting

613272
selected	checkbox
disable all application add-ins may impair functionality selected this checkbox if you don t trust any add-ins

613282
constructor	private
guiinst s constructor is #defined to private when swig runs to prevent lua constructing instances of it so that won t work for me

613282
decrement	increment
i suspect what really needs to happen is that guiregionvertical add guibutton should increment the ref count of the guibutton and then guiregionvertical s destructor should decrement the refcounts of all of its contents though i m not sure how this should be done with swig

613282
constructor	object
that would remove the need for the private constructor the gui object factory and the nasty externs

613283

also make sure the database and server has been configure in the hosts c windows system32 drivers etc hosts and or with the informix database connection tool inetd32.exe located in the start menu somewhere.

613410
filtering	sorting
each view would need its own cursor sorting sequence filtering etc

613428
getter	setter
i m aware that refresh fails to use the correct property getter and setter on the entity to raise the change notification events but perhaps there is another way to accomplish the same thing

613435
python	perl
it s just that python syntax has been stricter stabler and more well-defined than historical perl

613437
constructor	object
for object it also synthesizes a wrapped constructor

613437
constructor	object
so the direct solution is to just let the lua interpreter call swig s constructor to create the new object

613437
constructor	object
as for dealing with object that shouldn t be constructed by accident in user code as the clarified question indicates my first impulse would be to let swig generate the constructor function keep a private reference if needed later and remove it from the table

613439
python	perl
perl language philosophy is different from python philosophy

613447
triggers	insert
now when they insert a record in tables the triggers is called but it keeps inserting many many records on table_history

613495
put	get
on the key do key 4 or binary or on to pick which map to do a put get remove

613495
concurrenthashmap	hashmap
you could do an almost lru by extending concurrenthashmap and having a linked hashmap like structure in each of the regions inside of it

613495
concurrenthashmap	hashmap
it would be slower for normal access just as concurrenthashmap is slower than hashmap where there is no concurrency

613499
python	java

spaces	output
thus 1 preserves the shape of the input variables whereas 2 creates a potentially very long single line of output with words separated by single spaces where a word is a sequence of non-whitespace characters

613581
sorted	lookup
how about a simple json coded dictionary or list with the zip codes in sorted order and do a lookup on the dictionary

613588
data-structures	trie
if it was just matching strings then you should look at trie data-structures and algorithms

613603
user-interface	look-and-feel
when running the new nimbus look-and-feel these fields are opaque despite setting setopaque false and my user-interface is broken

613603
jtextfield	jlabel
note i need a jtextfield rather than a jlabel because i need the thread-safe settext and wrapping capability

613603
look-and-feel	nimbus
note my fallback positioning is to continue using the system look-and-feel but nimbus does look substantially better

613613
transfer-encoding	chunked
keep in mind that if the xml file is sent with the http transfer-encoding chunked header http does not tell you how big the file will be

613650
project-management	scrum
i m not an expert by any means but it seems to me that the sure way to fail at scrum is to think of it as a project-management solution instead of an entire organizational change

613651
put	get
if you don t put them in different files it s easy to get merge conflicts that take a while to fix when checked into version ctl

613666

parentheses	braces
better whitelist every possible meta-characters in html javascript and css angle brackets parentheses braces semi-colons double quote single quote etc

613743
arrays	loops
seeing as this is a multidimensional arrays you re going to have to loops through calling new as you go and again not to forget delete

613774
settings.settings	app-config
why do settings.settings files dump all their value into the app-config

613854

notification-area	tray
close the form and add a notify icon in the task bar notification-area aka systemd tray

613877
graph-traversal	shortest-path

asp.net inbuilt webforms view engine

613917
firefox	opera
i do it with firefox opera but i prefer firefox because of firebug

613924
xsd	xml
i need validate an xml using xsd in .net

613954
methods	extend
edit i am not looking for advice on when to use either model what i am looking for is why people extend from runtimeexception because they don t like extending from exception and or why they catch an exception and then rethrow a runtimeexception rather than add throws to their methods

613969
cursor	row
how about doing the update one row at a time using a cursor or clr loop

613971
flying-saucer	itext

614019
credentials	account
that person has presented to the bank employee some credentials that verify who she is and that she actually owns some account x

614025
traffic	packets
i think you should try to reproduce the problem and than use a packets monitor to see the network traffic and look at the difference between the failure situation and the success situation

614050
global-variables	call
in your sample code the call to the built in subroutine open is using a bare word as the file handle which is the equivalent of a global-variables

614055
zooming	touch
it currently supports setting the center location and zooming panning using the touch interface

614063
findcontrol	asp.net
i started digging into the asp.net code with reflector and found out how the implementation for a checkboxs findcontrol method where the one in system.web.ui.webcontrols.checkboxlist

614071
implements	abstract
your abstract type can always inherited simple bcl types which are implements by your concrete types

614083
base-class	inherited
for instance you can inherited from only one base-class but yet implement multiple interfaces

614083
derived-class	base-class
in order to override a methods or property in a derived-class you will have to declare the member as virtual in the base-class

614088
any	set
i d like to use gvim on my windows pc or any editor that can be set up to do this to

614096
required	checked
its not possible to clean the code manually required checked each member and if found no references delete it.

614097
ruby-on-rails	django
frameworks like django or ruby on ruby-on-rails grew out of real world needs

614097
cakephp	symfony

614109
string.format	stringbuilder
why stringbuilder is better than string.format

614109
string.format	stringbuilder
please check this is string.format as efficient as stringbuilder to see why.

614119
exception-handling	error-handling
we have a code base that uses checked exception-handling quite often with proper error-handling and some other that doesn t

614119
exception-handling	error-handling
all runtime exception-handling i propagate up until they are cached and handled with some generic error-handling code

614126
google-chrome	firefox
to my surprise the push method often showed to be faster especially in firefox and sometimes in google-chrome

614131
methods	extend

614148
protected	public
use a public methods and chain it to a protected virtual methods with the core shared implementation

614184
ftp	scp
tags option tells vim where to look for tags file though i m not sure whether vim allows ftp or scp paths in this option

614190
order	add
in order to use ctags remotely i would create the tags file remotely and copy it to the local machine and add scp remote.host.com project to each file name in the tags files

614197
latex	tex
do you know of sites that show that relatively advanced use of tex latex in terms of useful recipes and

614197
latex	tex
do you know any books that offer their tex latex source to inspect and learn and that are worth doing so.

614237
64bit	x86
everybody seems to know it but i just found out yesterday when i used this code in a new poject if you are compiling this with vs on a 64bit windows you have to set the target-platform to x86 or the code won t run

614242
duplicates	lookup
however i realise that if i could calculate a hash of the image i could lookup the cache to see if it already exists and use that it would help more for duplicates objects of course

614249
oracle	mysql
although you ve tagged this with oracle i figured this would be useful for anyone using mysql use the spatial extensions to store location data

614255
arrays	map
otherwise the value is placed into the arrays s own storage if the data is sufficiently compact then the engine will use the flat arrays storage in which case insertion and retrieval is just a standard arrays indexing operation otherwise the engine will convert the arrays to sparse storage and put get use a map to get from propertyname to value location

614255
put	get
the specifics of how the additional storage and how put get are dispatched differs from engine to engine -- but this is the clearest i can really describe the design implementation

614274
latex	tex
these are just the first ones that come to mind that happen to also be able tex and or latex

614279
getter	setter
i heard that .length property of arrays in javascript engines in fact uses invisible setter and getter to achieve functionality of ecma-s standard that says whenever the length property is changed every property whose name is an arrays index whose value is not smaller than the new length is automatically deleted

614279
getter	setter
i understand that setter is needed in this case but what with getter

614298
latex	tex
i learned a lot not only about latex but also of course about tex

614299
getter	setter
getter and setter can be defined in as of javascript 1.6 i think but it s not widely adopted and i haven t seen much use of it

614299
getter	setter
getter and setter can are called by the engine depending on direction of assignment

614330
required	checked
checked exception-handling-handling on the other hand required every level of code between the thrower and the catcher to declare they know about all forms of exception-handling that can go through them

614333
standard-library	boost
for instance if one of my file uses a library i wrote qt boost and the standard-library i will order the includes as follow

614335
arrays	map
in ruby what is the most expressive way to map an arrays in such a way that certain elements are modified and the others left untouched

614339
json	xml
or add a script resource to your module xml for a library such as one javascript json library here and use that in jsni

614340
attributes	properties
after trying various methods of manipulating the parameterbindings properties without success i thought of how i could get the dynamic value in there using the location attributes

614340
put	get
to get to the parameter values from within the accompanying xsl file i put param elements in the root element

614359
google-chrome	safari
right panel goes down in google-chrome and stayed normal in all other browsers including safari 4

614382
csv	xml
it supports various input csv flat files dbunit and output format csv flat files dbunit xml excel scripts

614386
getter	setter
a property is either implements as a field or as setter getter methods

614386
value	field
if it s a field then it s just a value when setting the value nothing more happens than that the value changes

614386
getter	setter
if you have a setter methods in order to perform something more whenever the value is set you also have a getter methods to match even if the getter methods doesn t do anything more than just return the value

614389
order	add
usually i would add a time-stamp in the get variables in order to trick the clients cache

614403
methods	extend
for convenience i also extend proxy on my concrete iterator classes and provide support for the for-each loops in as3 by overriding the nextnameindex and nextvalue methods

614468
python	c++
translate your xml rules into python code with the equivalent flow of control that invokes your c++ objects when it is executed

614483
value	field
because a sha-1 value is always 160 bit long the varchar would just waste an additional byte for the length of the fixed-length field

614488
decimal-point	digits
i have tried a couple of things and they worked but before last digits after the decimal-point it does not allows to delete after the number has been completely entered

614490
16-bit	8bit
which is 160 8 20 chars if you use 8bit chars or 160 16 10 if you use 16-bit chars

614495

configuration	logging
it might be a good idea to place the configuration file somewhere where an admin can modify it without rebuilding your web app so they can turn on detailed logging without waking you up in the middle of the night

614752
base-class	inherited
i think the fact that you lack any virtual methods in the base-class is an indicator that inherited is a waste of time

614870
triggers	insert
within triggers in sql-server you have access to two tables deleted and insert

614891

614903
static-classes	activator
and no activator cannot be used to create static-classes

614908
textchanged	textbox
this is potentially something that could be overlooked but do you actually have an event coded for the textbox s textchanged event

614954
protected	public
also microsoft isn t very explict in showing access-modifiers public protected etc

614955

do note that using the xpath abbreviation should be avoided as much as possible as it usually causes the whole xml document to be scanned on each evaluation of the xpath expression

614962
click	mouse
i can obtain the positioning of the mouse click using pagex and pagey but

614964
selected	button
you can provide some command button to selected multiple regions â œall 48 contiguous us states all of south america allowing users to de-selected some regions afterward

614968
.net	wcf
one thing to add is that wcf is the current way to do web services on the .net platform

615093
coalesce	isnull
other way to handle null concat issue in case you don t know if value is null or not - isnull or coalesce

615099
sql-server	mysql
for sql-server you would use brackets to specify an identifier however from your error message it seems as you are using mysql which uses backticks instead of brackets

615099
value	field
if for example rank is a numeric field there should be no apostrophes around the number 1 in the value

615100
python	c++
i have heard python is a popular and powerful language not so complicated as c++

615100
python	java
but many people mentioned it was hard for them to get back to c++ java from python because they started thinking in it get used to absence of memory management etc

615114
margins	padding
play around with the padding and margins

615114
google-chrome	opera
tested in opera 9 ff3 ie6 google-chrome

615121
python	c++
i think you ll find python amusing and sufficiently different from c++ or c# so that the languages will not get mixed in your head.

615122
configuration	logging
usually i do not place any logging configuration into the application rather leaving that to the appserver admins to configure logging server-wide

615122
configuration	logging
for tomcat used for development purposes i d just look for its logging log4j configuration and add app-specific specific there

615128
python	c++
given the similarities between c# and c++ you ll learn a different way of thinking from python

615129
python	c++
besides your experience with c++ or at least c will come in handy for writing high-performance parts of your applications using python c api which lets raw c and c++ code intermingle nicely with the pure pythontuff

615148
python	java
well i ve learnt python after c c++ java and c#

615150
haskell	ocaml
it is up to what exactly is the kind of applications you want to program for example for websites that need access to databases i would go for ruby and ruby on rails framework for financial applications or applications that need a lot of parallel processing i would go for a funcional programming language like haskell ocaml or the new f# these last 3 wil make you a better programer even if you don t programm a lot in them by the way c# has been lately in the latest versions adding more and more funcional programming features

615152
python	c++
many would argue that you would benefit from learning python before c++

615155
python	perl
or you could take a language like python or perl and use it to complement your core language

615155
python	perl
if you want something less microsoft then python perl or bash scripting would be a good idea - not just to learn how to code in the new but also how to do things differently from the usual code an app way

615163
python	c++
python is complementary to c++ and easy to integrate with c++

615179
if-statement	for-loop
each for-loop if-statement etc is then not seen as a branch in the calling method

615185
digital-signature	signing
it would appear that applying a transform to a signed msi doesn t break the digital-signature but i m curious whether the msts also need signing

615189
content-disposition	content-type
you want the content-type set appropriately as well as the content-disposition header thus

615201
binary	hex
either way it s a much better idea to actually convert the hex code to a binary string before hashing it

615202
children	nodes
the methods is called on the root nodes after that children may have two parents so it isn t as simple as calling the parent property on each nodes and traversing back up

615215
python	perl
or you could whip something up in python perl or whatever you prefer

615218
perl	ruby
from a utility perspective it is good to learn one of the more dynamic languages like python or ruby or perl too

615218
python	c++
if you want to manipulate text for example c++ is a lot harder to use than python

615223
windows-vista	windows
in windows-vista windows 2008 server and later all services run in session 0 and all applications that you start run in session 0

615223
communication	messages
if you don t have access to the source of the program you want to send messages to you could get around this by making an application that communication with your service and acts as a proxy to relay the message to the application in its same session

615228
downgrade	upgrade
i recommend to downgrade to visual-studio 2005 or upgrade to visual-studio 2008

615230
revision	svn
if it s in svn then why not use the svn revision number

615230
revision	svn
if you look at the bottom right of this web page you ll see the stack overflow version number which is the svn revision number

615235
python	perl
you could use a command line tool like sed a scripting language like python perl or any number of other solutions to do this

615239
contains	lookup
alternatively you could build a lookup table contains the ordered pair and the distances between the months

615248
python	c++
i don t feel python inhibited my ability to learn or use c++

615248
python	java
i am glad though that i learned pointers in pascal before encountering reference types in java python and c# because i feel it gave me a good basis to understand the idea of the differences between value types and reference types

615248
python	c++
i think for me the most important of those languages are python haskell and c++

615257
value	field
i was about to write my own timepattern class but it would have to contains a lot of logic like checking if the field value were inside legal bounds hour between 0 and 23 etc that i felt would be inside classes like calendar anyway

615257
methods	extend
extend a gregorian calendar class to contain a matchwith methods

615268
listboxitem	selected
i wanted to change the foreground color when i selected a listboxitem and i did it using this bit of code

615271
cos	sin
switching to lookup tables for sin cos acos

615273
revision	svn
of course you can just use the svn revision number --- like many others have suggested

615277
revision	svn
build can be a svn revision i find that works best

615298
perl	php
if you happen to have access to a perl compatible regex pcre engine for example php s preg_replace or even perl if you must

615306
python	perl
if you are not careful you can wind up like perl and then only python can parse python a future i wouldn t want to see

615306
python	perl
in no way do intend to impugn python capabilities when i say that it can t futz with compile time behavior like perl can

615335
webserver	upload
to truly see what s going on you should probably check your webserver logs check the browser upload limit if you re using firefox and try seeing if generates any useful error numbers

615359
cos	sin
if your goal is to rank compare distance then approximations sin and cos table lookup could drastically reduce your amount of computations required implements quick reject .

615359
cos	sin
using lookup tables with 1000 samples sin and cos sampled every the lookup uncertainty is at most 0.006284

615359
cos	sin
so if evaluating using sin and cos lookup tables for two coordinate-set pairs distance yields a certain ranking one distance appears greater than the other based on the approximation and the difference s modulo is greater than the threshold above then the approximation is valid

615377
dataview	datarow
i know this may sound crazy but i swear that on two separate ocassions via intellisense i ve seen an overload for the dataview constructor that took in a datatable and either predicate or func i don t remember what t was either datarow or datarowview

615386
cos	sin
1 acos sin a sin b + cos a cos b cos a-b

615386
cos	sin
but 2 cos a-b sin a sin b + cos a cos b

615386
cos	sin
which is rewritten as 3 sin a sin b cos a-b - cos a cos b

615399
cosine	sine
is the the sine cosine function-calls or the arcsine call

615399
cosine	sine
if your sine cosine calls are slow you could use the following theorem to prevent so many calls

615400
hosts-file	hosts
could it be as simple as an addition to your hosts

615408
malloc	free
this code just uses malloc free internally much as most default implementations

615408
required	checked
in conclusion although a sloppy implementation of operators delete may required explicit null checked in the client code this is non-standard behaviour and should only be tolerated in legacy support if at all

615424
cakephp	django
definetely shared hosting is not the best choice to run heavy frameworks such as django or cakephp

615440
punctuation	words
but some punctuation characters will be marked as a words boundary so this won t give what you want

615455
put	get
i believe the way to get around this is to put the flag -fno-inline-functions in other c flags for dev only

615467
invokerequired	begininvoke
i use helper function to switching threads using invokerequired then begininvoke with a delegate

615483
.when	ready
as and .when packets will arrive the kernel interrupt context will signals that the read context which is sleeping in the queue is once again ready to run

615492
touchesmoved	drawrect
i tried calling drawrect from touchesmoved directly but found that the drawing context which i retrieve using uigraphicsgetcurrentcontext is invalid for many of the calls so painting the screens myself for every touchesmoved doesn t work

615506
javascript	dom
after submission page navigates to another page so i think javascript won t affect any dom elements after that

615524
touchesmoved	drawrect
to refresh your screens on demand try calling from your touchesmoved methods which will setup the proper contexts for a call to drawrect

615535
json	xml
in addition to this they provide lots of additional classes for doing things like parsing and working with json and xml and communicating with a server via asynchronous http

615538
host	dns
dns 1983 and dependent advances like email host resolution via mx records instead of bang-paths

615544
sqrt	cos
i use a different algorithm for calculating distance between 2 lati longi positioning it could be lighter than yours since it only does 1 cos call and 1 sqrt call

615546
constructor	object
have you considered serializing your object to some intermediate format and then creating a constructor that can accept an object in that format and re-create the object based on that

615569
udp	tcp
here the protocol could tcp or udp or any transport layer protocol

615592
synchronous	.when
windows a calls synchronous ajax proc1 .when button is click to open windows b

615595
webforms	asp.net
i have used regular asp.net webforms for completely dynamic interfaces no need for reflection for any of it

615606
default	reset
also look into possibly using a reset style sheet to get the default margins s font sizes etc to match

615615
ghostscript	inkscape
this could be adobe reader 6 7 8 9 adobe acrobat 6 7 8 9 foxit okular ghostscript sumatrapdf inkscape etc

615656
associations	model
so if you use a helper you can bind and unbind model associations on the fly -- which will allow you to grab data from your temporarily associated model

615687
linked-list	nodes
you could get better performance if you wrote your own linked-list implementation where each nodes essentially is an lrucachenodes along with a next and back reference

615705
sql-function	coalesce
coalesce is a standard sql-function that returns its first non-null arguments

615708
arguments	default
default behaviour is that only one instance of the software can run and this can be overridden by specifying a different user-dir as arguments when starting the application

615735
ironpython	ironruby
you could use the .net jscript compiler or interface with ironpython ironruby or ironscheme named alphabetically not preference

615740
variables	boolean
there is no practical difference provided you use bool variables as boolean

615740
primitive	boolean
which is why you can evaluate any primitive type or expression as a boolean test including pointers

615740
variables	boolean
note that there is a difference if you assign obtuse values to a so-called bool variables and test for specific values so always use them as boolean and only assign them from their #define values

615746
entity-framework	data-access
with linq2sql entity-framework in the market does it make sense to use enterprise library data-access application block to design data-access layer dal

615748
look-and-feel	nimbus
the setopaque methods works as expected when using any look-and-feel other than nimbus

615748
look-and-feel	nimbus
apparently the nimbus look-and-feel changes the behaviour we have come to expect with setopaque for many components

615749
javascript	dom
in my project all of the ui components that are rendered in dom html are stored managed as javascript objects of type component

615750
autotools	scons
use some sort of well-known build system for your software gnu s autotools or something like scons or waf and document the build optional dependencies and so forth pretty well

615750
ubuntu	debian
that way when a debian ubuntu red hat suse whatever packager comes along they ll be able to create the package for you

615750
installation	packaging
if you are looking at packaging a closed-source proprietary application for multiple systems you d probably do best to package up a .tar.gz file and document the installation process for it

615757
ethernet	packets
this is the simplest example it just adds a fixed amount of delay to all packets going out of the local ethernet

615760
order	add
while you are tweaking the index view why not add an order property too

615765
reflection	runtime
what about compiling those at runtime from your program and then using reflection on the compiled library

615783
sql-server	mysql
i cannot help you with mysql or db 2 but in case anyone gets to this answer with a need for ms sql-server i can recommend the data generator from red gate

615787

615813
margins	padding
when i remove the padding and margins from the

615817
attributes	properties
you could either override them if they can be overriden and apply the browsable attributes specifying false or create a new version of the properties and apply the same attributes this second approach doesn t always appear to work so ymmv

615830
virtualbox	vmware
at least it is with virtualbox and iirc vmware works in the same way

615835
put	get
when they click save the editor provides the ability to get the content editor.content and put it into a string

615866
visualsvn	collabnet
i will try visualsvn and collabnet

615875
attributes	properties
and now i want to change the value of the attributes type in any element named properties

615912
constructor	object
i solved the issue which is caused of selectlist object because it does not provide the default constructor so we cant have in out viewmodel

615920
put	get
you can then just put your uiviewcontroller subclass test5viewcontroller in your mainwindow.xib nib file to get it automatically loaded and you re in business

615922
postgresql	mysql
postgresql mysql and sqlite all support this syntax

615922
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
only postgresql has a case-sensitive like operators and a postgresql-specific per the manual ilike operators for case-insensitive searches

615952
hash	md5
one way hash two way encryption md5 + salt

615968
associations	model
to me this seems like a good clean way of model the relationship but causes problems immediately thanks to the circular associations i can t enforce the relationship in the db because of the circular foreign keys and linq to sql blows up due to the cyclic associations

615985
contains	set
this will take into account all the various padding and borders and such set up by the frame and the contains elements

615997
http-post	post
then you must set the maximum value for post parameters because uploaded files are recieved via http-post method

616012

however i don t really want to hand-write all the getter and setter for this

616014
scripting	shebang
on unix the scripting file has shebang #

616015

ok here s what i ve come up with for a fixed-point struct based on the link in my original question but also including some fixes to how it was handling division and multiplication and added logic for modules comparisons shifts etc

616015
sqrt	sin
what i was looking for were ways to calculate sqrt atan2 sin and cos in c# using a structure like this

616029
any	set
you can set codepage 65001 and response.charset utf-8 to produce utf-8 pages but your internal string type is still encoded in the system codepage and any data grabbed from form submissions or the database will be read into that encoding

616046
authentication	login
is there a standard way to reuse session data or some other method to not require users to login to the next application when moving from application to application if they ve already authentication

616078
itemtemplate	itemscontrol
apply your datatemplate to the itemtemplate property of the itemscontrol

616083
environment	restart
if i shut access down and restart i can then start with data from another environment which will then work however the rest of the data will then reflect those dsn settings

616125
attributes	properties
unspecified attributes properties should not be set using a setter methods .

616136
python	c++
for parsing the line of text it seems the format of your data is quite simplistic check out a similar question that i asked a while ago c++ string parsing python style

616181
value	field
should not null field have default value

616185
msbuild	nant
nant like the xml syntax task library better than msbuild

616193
value	field
the only time i ever use default value is when i have a bit field and i just want it to default to false

616210
updatepanel	gridview
the asynchronous postback is initiated from a asp.net gridview commandfield column and the asp.net updatepanel update method is called in the gridview onrowcommand

616216
any	set
what this gets you is that you can set up any type of things you want to happen with the builds

616226
doxygen	latex
besides the usual html doxygen can produce latex rtf postscript hyperlinked pdf compressed html and unix man pages

616230
any	set
a build is unstable if a unit test fails or it can be marked unstable through any number of criteria that you set

616230
hash	md5
a hudson can do whatever you want with it that includes id ing it via the md5 hash uploading it copying it archiving it etc

616232
value	field
try not to define and persist artificial values like no value selected for a drop-down field or a no manager for an employee s manager

616236
value	field
yes assuming that you never intend a valid row to have a null value in that field

616236
value	field
that ensures that any insert statements must provide a value for that field

616252
build-process	nant
identify all the steps of your build create nant scripts for each task and build your nant scripts one by one until you ve wholly automated your entire build-process

616254
environment	building
we will have separate building environment for each stage

616268
telnet	ssh
if you block icmp or want to do something with ssh or telnet then you should look at nagios as brian lindauer answered

616272
environment	building
a build-server even without automated unit tests still provides a controlled environment for building release

616274
hashmap	arrays
initialize a hashmap associative arrays

616280
integer	zero
you are using integer division so 9 100 is zero so

616286
double	int
you need to do the calculation as floating point by casting the variables to double or using a double constant then allow truncation to give you just the int portion

616291
double	int
if the values you ll be working with are less clean use double literals instead of int literals

616294
.when	ready
a working build .when properly implements means that you are ready to deploy at any time

616298
revision	svn
when we are ready to deloy to stage or qa as you call it we do an svn export to that environment often of head but we always keep track of the specific revision

616298
.when	ready
finally .when we are ready for production we export the right revision from the repository into the production-environment

616299
.when	ready
we develop on trunk and .when we are ready to release we make a qa branch

616332
click	mouse
your best bet would probably be embedding the ie web browser control in your app and then simulating key strokes and mouse click to arrive at your balance page

616334
spaces	output
this has all the benefits of saving an object to the hard drive with an implementation that is object-agnostic meaning you don t have to write much code for any object you want to serialization and output in binary thus saving spaces if that is a concern

616338
perl	tcl
taglist.vim source code browser supports c c++ java perl python tcl sql php etc

616343
any	set
this code provides the simplest stupidest regex in the set basically matching anything in the list of positive examples and nothing else including any of the negative examples

616361
internationalization	translation
the django internationalization features allow you to generate text translation files and provides a number of features for pulling text out of the system into files

616363
contains	any
a user may create a target for any location dynamically through jscript which then adds a tablerow under the location 3 selected that contains available classifications to the target and a target value

616367
convention	standards
i have a standards naming convention for all classes and inc files which makes it easier to programaticaly determine what class name is currently being requested

616368
json	xml
my opion along with the authors is to create a actionfilter and decorate your views in the controller needing xml or even json views

616379
host	dns
a failed dns lookup for a host www.example.com should be enough to invalidate all urls for that host

616410
localization	translation
i m working on internationalizing an iphone application and i m using ibtool to extract the string from my xib files so they can be translation by a localization house like so

616410
interface-builder	ibtool
ideally i d like to be able to add some kind of annotations in interface-builder to say either this is localizable or this is not localizable and have ibtool only output the localizable strings when i run it

616444
selected	textbox
for #2 the easiest solution i can think of is to set a textbox to be equal to the selected text value from your listview

616470
value	field
if all the field are mandatory give the attributes class a single constructor that requires the value to be passed

616471
perl	php
also download curl and a scripting language that can run curl command-line tasks or a scripting language like php or perl that has access to curl libraries directly

616500
notification-area	tray
when the icon show up in the notification-area systemd tray it is using the 32x32 format and windows is rendering it down to a 16x16 icon which looks horrible

616505
constructor	object
now wherever you are creating your producer consumer object pass in the queue so they have somewhere to put their object you could use a setter for this instead but i prefer to do this kind of thing in a constructor

616534
attributes	properties
and if some part of your code depends on the value of absxdisplay which is a public attributes and for some reason after you set the properties to false it is no longer but empty or notset then this test will fail and you will be notified immediately

616539
32-bit	16-bit
just like the move from 16-bit to 32-bit windows-applications where processes were given their own address space

616554
attributes	properties
the elegant solution to a problem i am having is to use attributes to associate a class and its properties with another s

616558
shell	tcsh
use set to set what tcsh calls shell variables and use setenv to set environment variables

616564
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
there are two class called manualresetevent and autoresetevent

616568
webforms	asp.net
also i under the hood asp.net webforms and mvc do a bunch of reflection so how slow can it really be

616569
reflection	runtime
that means you don t have to use reflection more than once at runtime

616571
constructor	object
you can see that it is testing that the constructor is producing a valid object usually not necessary with a full test fixture in place construction is usually well exercised and it is also testing the only public method in the class

616575
attributes	properties
at this very moment i m also working on a solution where i use custom attributess to decorate some classes and yes i ll have to use reflection in order to know whether a class properties whatever has been decorated by my custom attributes

616605
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
you donâ t have to write data-access logic thus you donâ t have to create sqlcommand sqlconnection etc and you also donâ t have to create sqldatareader or dataset

616614
value	field
not null fields need to have defaults if they are appropriate especially if you are adding a new field to the table or changing the field from allowing nulls to not allowing nulls and you need to give a value to all existing records

616619
contains	any
only the contains any logic it seem to be visually oriented logic always the hardest to test

616629
hide	show
waitscreen is just a grid with a z-index of 99 that i hide and show

616630
groovy	java
if you re not completely tied to compiling solutions like beanshell groovy and the other scripting languages are easily embedded in-fact java has built-in support for plugging in a scripting language so your code doesn t even know what language the script is written in

616630
groovy	java
beanshell should run any 100 java code iirc and i believe groovy can run most java code--possibly all

616638
arrays	map
if you don t need the old arrays i prefer map

616645
output	mode
in interactive mode i want all output to go to the screen as well as to a log file including output from any system calls

616645
output	mode
in daemon mode all output goes to the log

616645
output	mode
i can t find a way to tee all output to a log in interactive mode without modifying each and every system call

616647
moss	wss
i looked at using pattern #4 from blog post application development on moss 2007 and wss v3

616677
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms

616677
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms code behind

616680
factory-pattern	singleton
i think you are thinking of the singleton pattern not the factory-pattern

616685
attributes	properties
also you should either apply the editor attributes to the type rather than the properties

616693
web-applications	enterprise
java platform enterprise edition java ee builds on the solid foundation of java platform standard edition java se and is the industry standard for implementing enterprise-class service-oriented architecture soa and next-generation web-applications

616706
c-preprocessor	macros
that said if you do choose to use the catch throw mechanism don t forget that even c++ still has c-preprocessor available and that the macros __file__ and __line__ are defined

616708
document-ready	.when
looks like you need to wrap this in a document-ready block that way it will happen .when the page is ready

616709
stderr	stdout
create a logger and attach two handler one would be writing to a file and the other to stdout or stderr

616716
methods	extend
if you extend an interface the same applies if you implement an interface you can t override a methods and have it throw more checked exceptions than the original

616737
attributes	properties
the parsechildren attributes tells .net whether to treat your control s children as properties or as controls

616743
abstract-class	subclassing
the reason i don t want to just implement this cache in the subclassing is because i also have some methods in my abstract-class that needs to be able to operate on the cache namely to iterate over all of them

616759
logging	trace
he had placed a try catch block in the main working function for catching all unhadled exceptions that bubbled up to this level logging them together with stack trace info etc

616767
stderr	stdout
also remember to close the stdout stderr and stdin streams or some file handles might leak well that s true on some jdks on some unix oses.

616782
base-class	subclass
use a generic base-class parameterized with the subclass

616797
document	editing
if you don t want to do the markup manually which can be tedious and interrupt the flow of editing the neat latexdiff utility will take a diff of your document and produce a versioning of it with markup added to visually display the changes between the two versionings in the typeset output

616808
abstract-class	subclassing
i have an abstract-class which i would like to be able to expose to wcf so that any subclassing will also be able to be started as a wcf service

616819
spline	smooth
does anyone know how to construct a smooth 3d spline with 3d control points

616834
illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception
in all cases your constructor should throw nullpointerexception or illegalargumentexception if an invalid string is passed in

616854
function-call	inline
if the methods that calls the getcallingassembly methods is expanded inline by the compiler that is if the compiler inserts the function body into the emitted microsoft intermediate language msil rather than emitting a function-call then the assembly returned by the getcallingassembly methods is the assembly contains the inline code

616854
inlining	inline
and b it d probably change the inlining behavior so that it s no longer inline anyway

616904
google-chrome	firefox
i have the site configured so that it runs fine when it s always in ssl i see the ssl padlock in ie7 ie8 firefox safari google-chrome

616932
methods	extend
then you have to create an inner class that extend from ikeylistener interface and then add that methods in to the class

616936
selected	cells
i am using a call to the excel4 api to get the range of cells selected by the user

616951
instances	destroy
read and destroy instances of shared_ptr without further concerns

616953
contains	set
i then generated a second data set that contains an entry for every minute of the day but with a count of 0

616958
swing	swt
i know how to do it in win32 listview + lvs_ownerdata and in xul custom treeview and i found something for swt but not swing

616963
traffic	subnet
instead of breaking the traffic down per protocols or per subnet like most tools do it grouping bandwidth by process

616991
value	field
there are two gotchas 1 knowing the name of the object field and how to access the object to get the value which you want to format

616991
value	field
you can get the value of the field using the .send methods

617005
distinct-values	contains
should only the distinct-values be counted or should each number in the arrays be counted number 5 is contains 3 times

617010
http	ssl
and you request this page using ssl but your evaluation of requestrequiresssl does not take into account the images as secured resources it will form a http not https request and you will see the warning

617045
installshield	orca
originally we just gave the customers instructions to use orca but that really only enables them to update properties value - if you need to replace a configuration file then it ends up a bit complicated for most it staff unless they have access to wise installshield or similar

617071
interpreter	runtime
innosetup include an interpreter pascal-like extension language that can be used to a lot of things during the install s runtime

617093
32-bit	64bit
what do we do if we have some devs working on 64bit machines and some on 32-bit machines but we need to reference unmanaged assemblies that need to be in x86 for half the team and x64 for the other half

617100
32-bit	64bit
what do we do if we have some devs working on 64bit machines and some on 32-bit machines but we need to reference unmanaged assemblies that need to be in x86 for half the team and x64 for the other half

617113
deep-copy	object
isn t the whole point of deep-copy that each object will ask its children to copy themselves

617115
textbox	button
even if you ve tried to fix the previous issue by giving the textbox its own context menu users can right-click outside your control hold down the right button drag over your textbox and let go to access the default context-menu and paste in invalid values

617115
textchanged	textbox
do basic validation in the textchanged event and doing something passive like changing the textbox background color

617119
click	mouse
activity could be input from the user mouse movement a button click typing or it could be network activity the response from the server

617143
value	field
i m thinking a view that selected from the underlying table and has a bit field that says value of 1234 or 1235 is a 0

617144
expression-blend	designer
the triggers designer in expression-blend only allows adding and modifying eventtriggers and property triggers

617170
sql-server	oracle
i ve seen in oracle 10g a feature that estimates the remaining time for a long running query and i was wondering if this is possible too in sql-server at least in 2008

617178
put	get
i ve only used 10.4 which had an ld that ignored -l for indirect dependencies and i used -dylib_file to get rid of a lot of phantom explicit dependencies that other people had put in to get round the very problem you describe

617185
any	set
my problem is that whenever i set any of the frequencies to 0 my output image is very small and comes out as very weird patterns

617187
postback	ajax
i would first look if there is some other issue with the custom control causing the full page postback as in any case what should be happening is that the whole update panel refreshes still with ajax

617197
compatibility	legacy
this violation is motivated by a desire for compatibility with legacy content

617223
constructor	object
then before creating the initial context read the property value decrypt it and update the property before passing the jndiprops object to the initialcontext constructor

617241
delphi	c++
you will find you need to write at least 10x maybe 100x more code than you would do if you used a c++ class library or a rad tool such as delphi

617244
http-method	post
http-method post

617245
handler	service
you should also manually clear out the authentication cookie on the client in your jquery handler after a successful call to the web service

617254
python	java
you ll start to think in python and c++ and java will be like building a ship in a bottle one twiggy little stick at a time

617256
global-asax	web-config
we created a new project it inharits the global-asax of the main project and also accesses the web-config of the main project just fine however in the global asax code there s session checking for data integrity to see if the user is logged in

617256
global-asax	web-config
we create another project that inheirits the global-asax can access the web-config - done

617256
contains	set
have this new project contains a page addon feature from the main project have this page access the session userid that is set from the main project

617277
contains	elements
the rest of the book contains examples that create user-interface elements with code

617288
attributes	properties
as other people suggests use an external css file and apply the styes to the class attributes on html elements or cssclass properties on asp.net web control

617302
early-binding	late-binding
with vba it is often recommended that you develop with early-binding but release with late-binding

617313
windows-xp	windows
1 windows-xp 2003 vista 2008 windows 7 2008r2 windows 8 2012 windows 8.1 2012r2 windows 10 windows server 2016

617317
versioning	upgrade
if i remember correctly vsts team suite is about twice the cost of a specific role versioning of vsts so rather than purchasing multiple role editions most people just opt to upgrade to team suite since the cost is approx

617318
macros	let
the only way i can think of to do this without having to declare each macros as global ahead of time and then do a let statement is to use a macros in place of the let statement

617318
macros	let
i then use this macros in place of let everywhere i want global variables defined

617328
handler	service
you can install the service on the same machine and then use pipes or whatever remoting channel you want to connect between your page handler to the service

617333
value	field
dependency properties are properties of classes that derive from dependencyobject and they re special in that rather than simply using a backing field to store their value they use some helper methods on dependencyobject

617339
constructor	object
they are via chaining you would have to chain the constructor in your derived object

617339
constructor	object
the constructor in the derived object will then chain the calls do the constructor in the base object

617344
constructor	object
a commonly given example for this is that in many languages the base class for all objects commonly called object has a constructor with no parameters

617344
constructor	object
if constructors were inherited this would mean that all object have a parameterless constructor and there s no way to say i want people who make an instance of this class to provide parameters x y and z otherwise their code shouldn t compile. for many classes it s important that certain parameters be defined for their proper function and making constructors non-heritable is part of the way that class authors can guarantee that some parameters are always defined

617344
base-class	inherited
edit to respond to comments ramesh points out that if constructor were inherited as he would like them to be he could always override base-class constructor using privately declared constructor in each derived class

617344
constructor	private
it requires that writers of derived classes have to watch base classes closely and add a private constructor if they want block inheritance of the base class constructor

617350
perl	c++
personally i really like python syntax defining code blocks by using indentation and not by the words begin and end as in microsoft s basic and visual basic - i don t like these or by using left- and right-braces as in c c++ java perl - i like these

617363
constructor	object
the foo constructor can only know how to initialize a foo object so it makes no sense that it should also know how to initialize any potential subclass

617377
updating	updates
when i try and call endgetmessage and then updates my user-interface i get an exception-handling about updating the user-interface on the wrong thread

617385
uninstaller	orca
put the vs2008 behaviour back to how it worked in vs2005 the old versions uninstaller custom action is called before the new version install by using orca to alter the installexecutesequence.removeexistingproducts to be immediately after .installinitialize - usually you set the .removeexistingproducts to 1525 but check your individual msi

617405
treeview	listview
if you add an png image to an imagelist control and use that imagelist with a listview or treeview in a windows forms .net 2. application the icons shown in the listview have a blue halo around them

617407
inherited	subclass
how would you disable the inherited constructor in the many cases were they don t make sense for a subclass

617411
.when	ready
the objects to be persistent should be ready for persistent or as close as possible .when they are given to the repository

617412
constructor	object
really its because the parent constructor wouldn t fully initialize the child object

617432
mouseover	mouseout
the anims plugins basically applies a bunch of animation on mouseover and mouseout using hover based on the top and left parameters supplied

617440
regasm	heat
if you have a type library generated automatically and install via regasm heat can take the .tlb as an argument in

617451
stdin	pipe
uuencode is funny is that it will whine when you launch it if there s no incoming pipe in just the right way try launching the darn thing on it s own in a popen call to see the explosion with just pipe as the stdin and stdout

617457
document-database	couchdb
and now for the completely off the wall suggestion - you could consider storing the binaries as attachments in a couchdb document-database

617468
contains	any
i expected this exception-handling because in the new version of the interface same version number - old library clobbered methods x is defined but even though the old version of the object that is passed contains metadata that says it implements the corresponding interface the mapping fails on the new interface methods x because it doesn t have any implementation in that class

617480
postgresql	mysql
zeoslib seems to have an sql parser to parse interbase mysql oracle postgresql sqlite and sybase

617485
assign	add
just add another if test before you assign the match to

617493
value	field
i need to insert a row into a table with one field value being calculated from another table

617504
profiling	debugging
you should be able to attach an unmanaged debuggingger to the managed executable you are profiling and use that to debugging your profiling dll

617514
groovy	java
so i was wondering if anybody knew of an easyeclipse-like distribution that would contain common things people in different areas of java groovy development might need

617518
pointers	stack
if you think about how stack allocation works at compile time basically by incrementing a pointers for each object then it should be clear that vector memory comes from the heap

617523
pointers	stack
the above allocates a few bytes on stack for pointers size info etc

617536
author	posts
let s say you have to validate a wiki that has many posts where each post has an author and maybe many comments where each comment also has an author and that you have one xml file for all posts one for all comments one for all authors and you want to validate constraints between these files that each post uses authors and comments that exist that each comment uses authors that exist and so on

617543
any	set
if you set overflow auto on the parent div that locks any child div from breaking out of the content box

617545
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i agree with everyone here except the one who said skip webforms and go straight to asp.net-mvc

617550
backslash	regex
currently if any element of andkeywords contains a quote backslash or special regex character things will break

617556
numeric	digits
my own experience is with oracle which does not have a year data type but i have always tried to avoid using numeric data types for elements just because they are comprised only of digits

617582
contains	set
you could use an abstract mustinherit class instead of an interface in the library contains the interfaces and set the methods and properties as overridable

617593
compatibility	platform
if you need cross-platform compatibility you have two choices implement them with macros on the non-windows platform or turn off the deprecation warnings

617618
contains	any
this makes maintenance easy since the views only define a single constraint on the customer and do not contains any other schema information

617654
pascal	delphi
since the age of the dinosaurs turbo pascal and nowadays delphi have a write and writeln procedure that quietly do some neat stuff

617654
double	int
you can supply int double strings booleans and mix them all up in any order

617668
mathml	latex
is there such a thing as a small self-contained library that will render an equation written in a text-based format latex or mathml to an image either vector or raster

617668
latex	tex
edit by self-contained i mean they can t use tex latex itself since unfortunately i can t rely on it being install

617678
attributes	properties
i believe that in the absence of order attributes the xmlserializer serialization all public properties alpha-sorted by prop name and then all public fields alpha-sorted by name

617689
windows-server	windows
windows sdk for windows-server 2008 and .net 3.5 is over 1.3gb of download and i don t want to download and install that for solving such a simple issue

617691
value	field
from just the description you ve posted the best i can come up with is perhaps you are trying to marshal a date value 20081219 into a time field

617702
oracle	mysql
you might be interested in something that simulates the rownum of oracle in mysql

617709
debugging	trace
in a debugging flash player i get a nice popup dialog with a stack trace when the overflow occurs

617713
swing	swt
i was wondering if anybody had any experience trying to run a complex swt ui hosted inside a swing component

617713
swing	swt
so to reiterate my application is a swing app i wish to make use of a complex swt ui component drag and drop popup windows and dialogs - anybody managed this

617714
output	mode
so i changed the browser settings to enable mode and then the activex control gave me the expected output

617715
linux	osx
for both solutions shared libs or different linking you would have foo_linux.c foo_osx.c foo_win32.c or a better way is linux foo.c osx foo.c and win32 foo.c and then compile and link with the appropriate one

617723
versionone	rally
anyway i gave up using low-tech board on a very first sprint because i had remote team members so we used some electronic format - excel twiki versionone rally

617738
execution	exit
when the main thread finishes execution main that thread exit but the jvm will not

617747
contains	elements
it is a function that combines two sequences of equal length into a single sequence contains a pair or n-tuple of elements

617764
gethashcode	equals
methods to retain their full functionality you should also be overriding equals and gethashcode so that they return a consistent set of response to callers

617767
pascal	delphi
yes you can do it in delphi and friends free pascal kylix etc. but not in more standard pascals

617785
where-clause	sql
that way the where-clause is built just prior to the sql getting run

617789
treeview	gridview
i have a treeview and a gridview in my page.my application is windows application in vb.i want to use splitter to move treeview and a gridview.can anyone help to give the splitter code to do this

617834
unsigned	integer
cast it to unsigned char instead to avoid that it becomes a negative integer when casting to int

617836
data-structures	dictionary
if they re coming from other things we have a bunch of extension methods to build dictionary from various data-structures

617837
versioning	upgrade
measuring will give the definitive answer on what is better - and remember this may change at each new compiler versioning system upgrade .

617849
32-bit	x86
at least x86 and arm are capable of loading and storing a byte to and from a 32-bit register without any penalties so there really is no performance impact for using char

617852
google-docs	spreadsheet
in google-docs spreadsheet one can use range names to put labels on ranges of cells to make formulas more legible

617858
selected	checkbox
you can also modify an existing service s setting by using the services tool selected properties for the service click on the log on tab and selected the checkbox allow service to interact with desktop

617867
entity-framework	ado.net
using the ado.net entity-framework we have an object model like this

617867
checkbox	button
i want the create page to list the roles in the staffroles table with a checkbox next to each and when the submit button is pressed these are added to the new staffmember staffrole ienumable and so the appropriate entries are made in the staffmembersinroles table

617895
uiscrollview	subviews
a scrollview is set up and displayed in exactly the same way as a uiview - you set the frame add it to another view and to show your text you need to add subviews to the uiscrollview that can actualy render the text

617895
uiscrollview	subviews
in order to set up a basic uiscrollview you request you should just create it like a normal full screen view - set the frame to be the same size as the windows and add the scrollview to the windows as a subviews

617895
uiscrollview	subviews
set the contentsize property of the uiscrollview to be the same as the frame of the uitextview and then add the uitext view as a subviews of the uiscrollview

617898
external	host
you could setup an email account and have an external server one you create and host outside of ae access the gmail account via imap

617900
value	field
everyone understands just fine how comma separated sort field work in sql - but on face value i m skeptical that thenby is going to do what i really want it to do

617909
access-control	authentication
this second server is used for authentication and access-control for a few different things such as our internal timesheet web-based system footy tipping system forums and subversion repository control

617909
aggregate	grouping
actually internally would probably be better as there would be grouping that would exist only on the aggregate server to which we would like to assign users from the ad server as members.

617928
version-control	git
i would not advise for a dvcs distributed version-control system like git or alike for backup strategy

617942
abstract	extends
i could make daterange abstract and extends it but then i m going to have a bunch of tiny classes

617945
code-coverage	ncover
it s a code-coverage tool gpl but it works similarly to ncover which means it uses profiling api to do its job

617949
selected	button
selected the add button pushes an add view

617950
moss	wss
what is the simplest way to query a wss moss list from a remote client

617951
required	checked
but when the response header is parsing it checked the required information in browser-cache

617951
required	checked
but this time when the response header is parsing it do not checked any required information in cache and bring all updates information form server only

617955
xsd	xml
when having xsd xml data files you have to regenerate your code for each change

617979
textarea	pre
text inside pre and textarea elements will be damaged

617980
contains	set
you could build this into a dvcs if something set up watches on files contains in the versioned directory committing each time a file is changed but that would get ugly quick

618294
keyboard	mouse
it is important for users of touchscreen interface to get feedback when click somewhere on screen and because this cannot be mechanical as on normal keyboard or mouse button we use sound and or changing color

618314
ip-address	proxy
if your client is behind a farm of proxy their external ip-address may change on every request

618403
emacs	vim
whether learning to edit using emacs vim and compiling debugging using the gcc-toolchain is worth it instead of just using an ide and why

618412
linux	unix
if you use linux or any other unix flavour for dev you ve got immediate access to the best suite of low level tools - sed grep awk piping output stderr etc

618416
arrays	map
if you want to read directlry from the file make use of the java.nio.channels.filechannel class specifically the map method - that will let you use memory mapped i o which will be very fast and use less memory than the copying to arrays

618419
emacs	vim
one real benefit is that you can learn how to work with emacs or vim and this can help you in the future when you will use remote terminals

both have very sophisticated code-folding syntax-highlighting for all languages you can think of

618459
keyboard	mouse
in this case it is what we see on our monitor perhaps hear from our speakers and manipulate through our keyboard and perhaps a mouse

618483
sharpdevelop	monodevelop
i d prefer to have monodevelop if possible just because i ve started to get familiar with the interface and i believe the sharpdevelop and monodevelop are not so closely related any more

618488
sharpdevelop	monodevelop
monodevelop is built on sharpdevelop s code base

618498
supervisor	worker
you better do java-thread supervisor that will start some may be number of cpus amount worker java-threads with otpmbox and send otpmbox s pids to erlang system

618524
put	get
if you however put enough effort in your poms and few custom plugins you ll get a much better build environment as with ant for example depends on you project of course but it gets more and more true for bigger projects

618530
latex	tex
is a successor for tex latex in sight

618533
linux	unix
apart from the tools it ll make one a much better programmer if one follows the unix linux ideology as seeing in the command line - make small universal isolated components that do a limited and logical amount of work and are well defined and highly reusable

618541
detect	move
for instance you don t want to detect a curtain near an open windows move by the wind

edit in this case your real problem appears to be mixing up prepared statements as supported by mysqli prepare and mysqli_stmt execute with plain old queries as done with mysqli query

618655
python	java
spanning from c and c++ to java and python to name few languages i am currently working with

618666
instances	private
if the classes that are using the data class create their own private instances of that class this would be a 1 1 composition assuming that the data class instances s lifcycle is tied to the object that is using it

618685
configuration	installation
ease of use installation configuration maintainance for me who builds the site but also for the members of the organisation they must be able to easily change the the content of some main pages add supages add a new mailinglist upload a file to the repository etc

618687
itemtemplate	itemscontrol
if you are defining it as a member of something else like say an itemscontrol you need to get a handle to the itemscontrol instance and call the itemtemplate property

618698
shell	bash
the availability of a powerful shell i use bash and fish under linux is the other time-saver for me

618702
rollback	commit
in general when creating using transactions within sps you may already be within a transaction scope you have to code for this instance when doing a commit rollback

618713
sql-server	oracle
for example it might be deployed with sql-server oracle

618713
sql-server	oracle
i think i can use linq to dataset for both sql-server and oracle

618713
linq-to-dataset	linq-to-sql
but will i loose something ease of programming performance reliability etc if i use linq-to-dataset for sql-server compared to linq-to-sql offcourse

618747
linux	unix
there is a standard way on unix and linux - ident

618753
linq-to-dataset	linq-to-sql
i assume that reliability is as good with linq-to-dataset as with linq-to-sql never had problems performance seemed to be good enough never could really profiling it though

618755
entity-framework	ado.net
also checkout the ado.net entity-framework

618762

i ve set several up and rarely have to use any coding during setup plus there s a vibrant community if you need help

618766
python	c++
something like a c++ map or a python dictionary

618793
execute	prepare
the problem is not in the prepare statement but in the call to the query methods that shouldn t be there - as it is used to execute standard not prepare statements

618826
pixels	line
what s the magic combination of commands to draw a really short line or one pixels

618826
pixels	line
note if i make my really short line 4 pixelss or more long it is rendering as expected 4+ pixelss long 1 pixels tall every rendering pixels #ff0000

618843
joomla	drupal
but after implementing my first site in drupal i decided to create the next one in joomla to have a frame of comparison

618849
order	add
however if you only care about the order in this one particular case i suggest you add an extra field in your java in-memory representation to store the original index in the loaded list - as you read the data keep track of how many you ve read and assign the field accordingly

618850
capture	player
i ve successfully written the capture part - using a player object created by manager i can display realtime video from a webcam

618850
swing	awt
i m not familiar with awt swing but based on knowledge of other gui frameworks i d say something derived from a say jpanel that draws the video when a repaint request is made or a new frame is available. i would like to be able to process every new frame and loop on x y over all the pixels

618852
filtering	grouping
using multiple port groupinging each port grouping can then directly subscribe to the desired message type and filtering on promoted properties

618855
deployment	install
i built a vs 2005 setup and deployment project and i m able to install the setup without any problems

618859
boost	stl
the exact task is absolutely stupid and the lecturer told us it need to be self-compilable should be able to compile itself - so he meant not to use libraries such as boost and stl

618864
macros	vba
if you re willing to make use of a little vba rather than stick exclusively with macros the following might help you

618864
worksheet	excel
this module takes any sql you throw at it and exports it to a defined location in an excel worksheet

618870
python	java
i learned c c++ java python c# in that order

618870

the two i actually invariably end up using are c++ python

618870
python	c++
i also think i didn t really get c++ functors and boost bind until i d been exposed to python

618871
global-variables	call
depending on what you call shielded global-variables in c different answers are possible

618871
defined	declare
if you mean a global-variables defined in another source file or a linked library you only have to declare it again with the extern prefix

618890
markup	xhtml
why not to get an additional useful info such as instant xhtml markup validation status

618891
contains	any
that way if any errors occurred and the error debugging log doesn t contains enough information for my liking i can always do a grep -a 50 -b 50 timestamp tracing_file to get more detail

618903
fckeditor	wysiwyg
anyway the page that the linkbutton does not work on has a wysiwyg editor fckeditor in it and firebug throws the following error when i click the linkbutton

618904
contains	elements
another way would be to walk the visual tree up to a listboxitem contains all the elements you defined in the datatemplate

618905
jar	war
compare the war jar ear to the old version see if there is any change

618906
value	field
it is responsible for understanding how to render the field at design time when its added to a list at run time when its being filled out in a form or viewed on a list view page and the type of value the field contains

618906
value	field
the run-time user-interface rendering control templates optional - this is the user-interface that is display when your field is collecting new value from a user on the new edit item page

618906
value	field
the field value class optional - this is how you will store the value that the user enters into the field

618933

618966
dictionary	arrays
i would like to know the iteration order for the arrays dictionary and object types in as3 for both the for-each and the for-in loops

618973
aggregate	grouping
in sql terms you should grouping and aggregate the results

618995
rollback	commit
perhaps a commit rollback or even reconnect would sort the problem

618996
required	checked
now you need to find it back at runtime and that required checked the types of the value on the evaluation stack

619002
updating	updates
the best strategy is to ignore the exception-handling the record was not updates possibly pushing the failed record to a queue in memory then do a second pass over the failed records re-evaluating the conditional in query and updating as appropriate - add as one of the conditional in query if this is not already the case. repeat until no more records fail

619013
dictionary	arrays
ecma-262 section 12.6.4 state that the order of enumeration is defined by the object - in other words it will depend on whether you re iterating through a list a dictionary an arrays etc

619014
calloc	free
thus i was trying to calloc zero bytes and free didn t like it

619028
selected	button
what i would like to implement is that the edit delete button should be disabled when i select a row containing a team member in a certain role key account manager and some others and be enabled when the selected member has no such role

619062
communication	messages
manage messages templates for communication with users

619080
order	add
the key is that you always have to add dynamically created controls to the page every postback and you have to do it before the viewstate loads in order for the controls to get their form-posted values loaded back into them

619098
order	add
which you do not want to do as it will double your memory footprint and add an extra iteration over the inevitable iteration that needs to be performed in order to output the data to disk

619102
rollback	commit
we have had luck with putting the log entries into table variables and then inserting to the real tables after the commit or rollback

619112
hide	show
it s about databinding let s say i have an object for binding to my user-interface and i want to hide show it based on other properties of the object

if there are two different value for field a in table b based on the join how would you know which one to use

619117
communication	messages
messages objects communication through messages

619128

constructor	object
i understand that the shellpresenter takes the shell object as a parameter of its constructor and is responsible for making sure all the modules place their views in the proper regions

619153
value	field
the problem is as explained that model value haven t been updated so the submitted inputs are still in component.submittedvalue field and that field is display if not empty

619155
32-bit	64bit
if i can configure this from an environment variables then i can access 32-bit functionality when needed but also run as a 64bit app when needed

619155
32-bit	64bit
note effectively i want to be able to switch whether an application runs as 32-bit or 64bit at launch time instead of forcing it at compile time.

619163
widget	button
i m creating an app where i drag button widget into a panels

619163
panels	grid
i would like to have a visible grid in the panels where i drop the widgets so the widgets will be aligned to the grid

619163
panels	grid
i guess it isn t hard making a grid where the squares are 15x15 pixels using a gridbagsizer since the widgets will span between multiple cells but how can the number of squares be made dynamically according to the size of the panels

619179
arrays	loops
using the loops variable i to build up an arrays of 12 values mtotal

619188
language-features	idioms
first should programmers or c++ novices specifically be encouraged to use libraries idioms paradigms languages or language-features they don t understand

header-only	boost
further most boost libraries are header-only and don t require you to install the whole thing

619191
put	get
when put into il - you get this

619196
contains	any
any control itself is breaking the mvp because it contains data and representation

619213
iteration	set
there s going to be iteration over your entire set of data regardless of which methods you use so there s no point in playing with bytes

619225
highlight	tooltip
for example check out where this sort of hint tooltip stuff in resharper is used to highlight lines of code that have stylecop issues

619230
primitive	int
this seems to work for primitive int

619230
primitive	int
i will use the nullable for my primitive int

619244
boost	stl
this means teaching them about the stl containers and algorithms and some of the boost libraries at first so the first thing they think about when needing a grouping of things is a vector

619247
compact-framework	.net
when it fails the first thing it does is pop up a dialog saying the feature you are trying to use is on a cd rom or other removable disk that is not available. the dialog provides a text box to enter a path and a browse button to find it so i provide the path click the open button and get this error error 1706.no valid source could be found for product microsoft .net compact-framework 3.5

619251
bison	yacc

619350
contains	elements
whenever the node isn t present i get a sequence contains no elements error

619369
button	slide
what i expect when i click the button is to see it slide to the right 50 units 3 times

here s an example command which assuming bash shell and the location to my macports bin directory

619381
compression	streaming
as an advantage the streaming in dotnetzip do not exhibit the anomaly of expanding data size under compression reported against the built-in streaming

619392
compression	streaming
include in dotnetzip there is a zlibstream for compression or decompression zlib streaming of data

619392
buffering	streaming
just inflates or deflates buffering as opposed to streaming

619405

619427
mp3	wma
mark heath s answer is correct - only certain formats are supported - mp3 and certain flavours of wma unfortunately not wma lossless which would be closer to pcm

619428
contains	any
so if you use escape to create uri parameter values you will get the wrong results for strings contains a plus or any non-ascii characters

619437
ironpython	cpython
what are some advantages it will bring to the table over its siblings cpython jython and ironpython

619437
compatibility	platform
is it speed cross-platform compatibility including mobile platform the ability to use c-extensions without the gil or is this more of a technical exercise on what can be done

619464
silverlight	wpf
the thing to remember that silverlight is not wpf it s close but many things are different--just enough to be a pain

619467
parentheses	operators
the trouble appears to be that operators new can either be coded with or without parentheses therefore

619476
lightbox	jquery
jquery lightbox may also be an option.

619479
hosts-file	hosts
have you ever altered your hosts

619486

assuming there s no side effects with regards to when _mc is instantiated all else being equals i prefer option 3 as that saves the overhead of an additional instance of myclass on the heap in the case where the getter of mc is never called

619491
versioning	upgrade
if this were a paid product would customers pay to upgrade to this newer versioning

619496
value	field
in that case not only should the setter defend the field from null but the constructor should ensure its initialised to the correct value

619500
document	editing
the default implementation is such that if you have 10 document open and you are editing the 5th one it s tab will be the 5th tab in the grouping

619572
ienumerator	ienumerable
ienumerable and ienumerator are both interfaces

619572
enumerator	any
when you implement enumerator logic in any of your collection class you implement ienumerable either generic or non generic

619572
ienumerator	ienumerable
ienumerable has just one methods whereas ienumerator has 2 methodss movenext and reset and a property current

619574
ienumerator	ienumerable
ienumerable is an interface that defines one methods getenumerator which returns an ienumerator interface this in turn allows readonly access to a collection

dynamic-memory-allocation	c++
a c++ program may provide the definition for any of eight dynamic-memory-allocation

619610
substring	ends-with
the standard php way to test whether a string ends-with a substring is

619613
python	perl
since i work more in more dynamic languages perl and python such conventions can be vital for quickly determining where variables and functions are scoped located

619620
authentication	login
here s how my university handles authentication we redirect the user to a website they enter in their username and password then they get redirected back to us with the username and a login key passed in the query string

619635
digits	base
i ve returned the digits as a char to allow for base more than 10

619636
ienumerator	ienumerable
an ienumerable is a thing that can be enumerated...which simply means that it has a getenumerator methods that returns an ienumerator

619636
ienumerator	ienumerable
but you d still need to return that ienumerator in an ienumerable class

619636
contains	any
for a look at what an enumerator implementing looks like see any class such as the ones contains in or

619640
python	java
see python is not java for more info

619650
compact-framework	.net
windows mobile + .net compact-framework

619675
click	mouse
the problematic code shown below is when a mouse click is detected to run a small animation in a nested panels

619675
click	mouse
if the animation is run independently of the mouse click it works fine and repaints perfectly

619675
click	mouse
when the methods is called when a mouse click is recognized the repaint at every animation interval us ignored and only once the animation is completed will the panels be repainted

619675
click	mouse
i think it might have something to do with when a mouse click is recognized the application is synchronized with itself stopping any internal methods calls to paint or that the paint operation does not have high enough priority over the mouse click

619685
autoscroll	panels
if you don t want to use databinding via the datarepeater control as mentioned above you could use a regular panels control and set its autoscroll property to true to enable scrollbar

619700
authentication	login
your scenario falls between those two so i d think that the best answer would be to write your authentication to take a username and a login key and return the right user or none as appropriate

619713
bazaar	git
take a look at this article comparing subversion mercurial git and bazaar for managing the files in a home directory including image files and large photoshop files that are being edited and versioned

619714
json	xml
typically a handler would return xml rss restful etc json for jquery or other javascript or sometimes just pure data such as file binary downloads

619714
json	xml
you restfulcontentcontroller would have a method for index that would not return a view but instead pure xml or json

619718
json	xml
returning rest-based xml or json data to ajax code on the client

619718
webforms	asp.net
custom html return totally custom html for a page when the asp.net webforms or mvc framework is too restrictive

619769
if-statement	loops
start by moving the if-statement out of the loops

619777
linkbutton	onclick
how can i determine in a webserver control inherited from linkbutton if an event handler is set for onclick or oncommand

619798
checkbox	textbox
i have a wpf popup control that contains some editing controls list boxes textbox checkbox laid out with quite a bit of whitespace

619802
numerical	matrix
for numerical reasons i d probably choose the second approach by generating the diagonal matrix with desired properties then generating q as the composition of a number of householder reflections generate a random vector v scale to unit length h i - 2vv t

619804
stderr	stdout
i am suspicious that the mysql password prompt is not actually on stdout or stderr although i don t know how that could be or if it means i could trap it

619804
stderr	stdout
it simulates a tty and gets all output even that which bypasses stdout and stderr

619809
instances	private
with reflection everything can be an open book in my example we are binding to a private instances level field

619816
webforms	asp.net
i would really like use the jquery validation plugin in my asp.net webforms application not mvc

619819
hide	show
edit this code should go into your handler i assume you already have your show s and hide s in there

619838

i would do a lot of research on tinyurl and bit.ly to see how they ve addressed these issues

619843
www-mechanize	perl-module
the perl-module www-mechanize does exactly that

619848

value	field
when the user click a button use javascript to assign value to the hidden field and then post the http form

619855
sql-server	mysql
all of our projects utilize sqlserver2005 but i do not see anything wrong with modifications which could help make it more flexible with other database systems such as mysql or older newer versions of sql-server

619860
digits	base
the following methods placevalue returns a char because base 11-36 have digits greater than 9

619876
perl	php
on the other hand there are plenty of non-standard non-corporate languages that gain popularity perl php ruby

619881
webserver	security
if you control the webserver and maintain it for security updates then in the source preferably in a configuration module or in a configuration file that the source uses is probably best

619881
host	root
if the application can decrypt the credentials on a given host than the host can be used to decrypt the credentials without your intervention think root or administrator looking at the source code and adapting the decryption routine so that it can be used to read the configuration

619900
getter	setter
the user class has the expected load insert updates and delete methods setter getter and a few others

619908
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
the sharpdevelop ide is an open source visual-studio alternative and its editor provides syntax colouring and autocomplete for c# and other languages

619917
constructor	object
the use of a shared class pattern without a constructor means that a user cannot run consequent queries using the same object without having to go through the same initialization

619938
entity-framework	nhibernate
if you have never used any type of business entity or o rm such as nhibernate or llblgen you probably won t find a lot of cons with entity-framework

619940
pixels	line
if you just want to draw a line you can use rectangle 2 pixels height then you can set horizontalalignment stretch it so it will stretch automatically

619943
iteration	elements
using continue at the beginning of a loop to avoid iteration over unnecessary elements is not harmful and can be very useful but using it in the middle of nested ifs and elses can turn the loop code into a complex maze to understand and validate

619957
calloc	malloc
since you are using c99 you could avoid calloc malloc if you really want to by using c99 s variables arrays declaration

619967
rollback	commit
have you forgotten to commit rollback one of the sessions after doing an updates delete insert

619981
python	c++
jython isn t fully compatible with cpython or whatever you would rather call the original c++ python interpreter but wherever either differs from the language spec is a bug

619982
children	nodes
i m trying to insert an element nodes that has some children from one xml into another in java

619994
attributes	properties
the update and insert methods are just extension methods that set the update and insert attributes of a properties in the generated mapping file

619994
attributes	properties
i am looking at something like the generated attributes for properties which retrieve the correct value after the session is flushed

620011
hash	md5
a good idea for passwords is to convert the password into a md5 hash and store that as the user s password

620024
data-members	instances
static data-members are shared among all instances of a class

620024

620051
rollback	commit
sql-server transactions - ado.net 2.0 - commit and rollback - using statement - idisposable

620108
permission-denied	sysadmin
the solution is to add the role sysadmin to the setup user of tfs i had another issues tfswarehouse problems but the problem about permission-denied in master was solved

620120
panels	grid
maybe you need separate windows or maybe you just need to have a sub part of a grid panels change content depending on state.

620120
textbox	button
control templates these are the more heavyweight versions of styles where you actually reconstitute a control so that say a button can have a textbox inside of it

620139
jqmodal	jquery
i have used both the ajax modal extender as well as the jquery jqmodal both have worked pretty well

620139
simplemodal	jqmodal
if i were to pick an option today i would probably pick the jqmodal or simplemodal for jquery

620144
managementeventwatcher	wmi
- using wmi query with managementeventwatcher

620153
selected	button
i ve put together a basic applet where the user selected a file from their hard drive it reads the first line of this file and passes that off to javascript for some additional preprocessing and then when you click a button it tries to upload that file through an http-post request

620159
instances	self
however in a class methods the self points to the class in which the methods is called instead of an instances

620159
class-members	static-class
this means a static-class methods can only access class-members in the class it was defined in while a normal class methods can access overridden class-members in derived classes

620172
cappuccino	sproutcore
since then two amazing frameworks have appeared sproutit s sproutcore and 280 north s cappuccino +objective-j

620185
attributes	properties
all you need to do is have the class in your classpath and set the type attributes in your hbm.xml to the fully qualified classname i.e add type my.fully.qualified.hibernateusertype to your properties element

620186
triggers	insert
it may also be possible to accomplish this by using a triggers on b to insert into a separate mapping table or update a column in a

620192
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
i don t know about these particular frameworks but a lot of web frameworks these days are structured around the mvc model such as asp mvc cakephp ruby on ruby-on-rails etc

620219
display	height
custom intellisense dropdown height for example display 50 items instead of the default which is imo ridiculously small 8

running the configure command doesn t require any permissions except to the directory contains your php source

620249
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r youruser yourgroup .

620270
post-increment	pre-increment
but normally first and foremost you optimize by choosing the right algorithm not by fiddly little things like worrying about whether to post-increment or pre-increment

620284
.when	ready
these sources use mach ports to signals .when the sources are ready to fire

620286
triggers	insert
at least snapshot isolation levels online index rebuild reading insert deleted in triggers used to read the log file

620293
checkbox	listbox
i want to create a listbox filled with checkbox in wpf and i want to databind the content value with a simple string value

620302
getdate	dateadd
in sql-server you can use dateadd mi -1 getdate

620304
double	int
on some cpu s double in general suffer from the same problem - on the other hand while a floating-point square root will block the fp pipeline it won t prevent you from executing int instructions simultaneously

620308
simpledateformat	date-format
you can use the date-format class more specifically the simpledate-format concrete subclass to format the date however you want

620317
push	pull
first attempt to pull from the same refspec that you are trying to push to

620336
double	int
when i is an int and d is a double works but does not

620344
contains	set
if you re using apache you will need to have to set allowoverride fileinfo for the directory contains your joomla installation

620348
double	int
i i + d does not work because you would be assigning a double to an int and that is not allowed

620348
double	int
the + operator casts the double automatically to an int so that is why it works

620375
cursor	row
move cursor to row 1 column 9 and press p thats capital p in command mode

620377
perl	ruby
most modern interpreted languages perl python and ruby to name a few precompile the source code into some intermediary form to be executed at the end citation

620439
push	pull
push pull with per-user permissions not tied to linux account

620465
tostring	equals
this in turn references a source templates for getters setters equals tostring etc that was written to trim all java.lang.string properties in the setter

620470
font-size	width
note that in addition to getting font and font_size i multiplied width with font-size to get the real width of the string

620475
32-bit	64bit
64bit machines have a bigger word size an yeah bigger usually means better here so that most operations can be carried out faster as for example double precision operations where double usually means 2 32-bit

620475
order	add
by knowing the pipeline structure the compiler can reorder the assembly instructions in order to provide enough distance between the loads and the add so that the cpu need not to wait

620475
arrays	loops
the most typical example is put for an incorrectly ordered access to an double arrays in a loops

620500
contains	any
by default it will allow access to any directory that looks like a git directory and contains the magic file git-daemon-export-ok

620519
constructor	object
object initializers are only supported for constructor calls

620519
private-members	instances
if you don t mind mytype being strictly speaking mutable you can leave an immutable api but make an instances of builder immediately create a new instances of mytype then set properties as it goes as it has access to private-members and then finally return the instances of mytype in the build method

620530
superclass	subclass
so looking up str would return a string and looking up classb would return this is classa or a subclass the problem is i don t know how to find the superclass or rather trace the mro chain of a type object

620532
cappuccino	sproutcore
sproutcore and cappuccino are frameworks for front-end development that required the user to have both javascript and css enabled

620532
cappuccino	sproutcore
i like the fact that sproutcore and cappuccino and probably others are testing the limits of what s possible within a web browser

620542
display	width
in order to set the height and width of the element you need to set it s display mode to block and use float to align the elements horizontally

620550
display	width
in css elements with display inline cannot have width or height applied to them

620562
stringbuilder	substring
this is based on inferis s answer but it uses a stringbuilder and avoids the need for the final substring call

620568
binary-tree	tree
after you have that you create a binary-tree using that info such that the most frequently used symbols are at the top of the tree and thus use less bits and such that no encoding has a prefix code

620570
textbox	onblur
on the onblur or onchange clientside events you should check two textbox s values

620595
checkbox	button
when the submit button is clicked use javascript to post the post data by grabbing everything in row whose checkbox is checked

620602
default-value	default
it says default but i don t know if that means the default-value set in the configuration file or the default-value that it uses when memory limiting is disabled

620612
perl	ruby
of course adding a perl program to a rails project via a parallel process and a pipe is very much in the engineering spectrum rather than computer science. it gets the job done but is not elegant. but it does work well and saved me the weeks it would take to port the writeexcel code to ruby

620621
toolchain	gnu
the gnu toolchain cygwin

620621
linux	unix
with linux you can learn a lot of unix and networking principles

620621
ftp	ssh
a developer should have enough know how today to setup a development environment with a webserver ftp ssh svn cvs on a unix based system.

620631
temporary	copy
if you look at it like this you can see that the first reference to rec before the dot . has to call getrec which will create a temporary local copy of rec

620646
associations	model
so far i ve got a basic card model with various attributes such as copies_in_deck but no associations

620653
selected	checkbox
in the parent i have a checkbox and when i selected the checkbox i have to remove the existing data of children and replace with new ones

620662
nsurlconnection	nsxmlparser
then you can use a combination of nsurlconnection nsxmlparser and key-value coding to make it almost as easy

620668
concat	where
with a concat it does like so where

620671
revision	updates
the revision attribute is updates on check-in but not check-out

620671
revision	svn
the one that svn prints out at the end of the checkout ie checked out revision 27.

620695
getter	setter
because you have implicit getter and setter functions and you cannot modify the result of a function as it is a const parameter

620695
getter	setter
see the different behaviors in the following code with the explicit getter and setter functions

620702
filtering	sorting
if you re just displaying data or sorting and filtering using the methods properties provided by arrayscollection rather than editing the arrays directly it should have no effect on the underlying shared arrays

620712
contains	any
do the lines themselves contains any index information

620715
json	xml
let the page connect to the server and get xml or json with the ids for the images

620721
double	int
if you have a type that is constantly created and discarded like an int float double etc then you can get a good boost by turning these into struct

620724
revision	svn
it is similar to cvs you can use revision you just have to set the keyword property for that file for svn to know it is supposed to do a keyword replace

620726
cappuccino	sproutcore
in this regard sproutcore and cappuccino are giant improvements in my book

620749
simplemodal	blockui
for simplemodal displays i ve found blockui to be a great solution

620749
blockui	.post
for example here s a .post about using blockui as a modal progress indicator and here s one about using blockui to display a modal confirmation dialog

620789
integer	digits
i don t think it s a spoiler to say that the crux of the problem is calculating a 303 digits integer accurately

620850
jquery	dojo
whats wrong with with using an ajax call using jquery prototype or dojo

620856
scala	java
new languages like scala and ruby seem to offer quite a variety that java and c# are not going to easily match

620868
arrays	loops
although it seems like just writing more code you could replace all those rules with a validator object and have all the validations in some arrays and loops through them

620871
methods	extend
you can further extend this by creating objects that all implement the same interface and are in a repository of handlers that your run methods can iterate over to see which will handle it

620876
createobject	clsid
when vbscript uses new or createobject the registration ensures that com knows what dll to load in order to make a new instances whether by name or clsid

620894
constructor	private
if i do a or a stub the constructor runs and the mock s private field _params gets initialized but the mock s parameters property is simply null

620932
firefox	safari
testing with firefox 3.0.7 safari 3.2.2 and msie 7.0.5730.13 all on winxp sp3 it appears that everything within the tags is completely omitted from the dom tree

620937
document	element
the user agent doesn t support a scriptinging language invoked by a scripting element earlier in the document

620938
random-seed	generator
your algorithm will be a pseudo-random number generator that is to say it will take in a random-seed and produce potentially large number strings which look fairly random

620955
contains	elements
if scripting is enabled the noscript elements is defined as contains only text - though it must be parsable text with some restrictions on content

620976
ironpython	cpython
i m not sure exactly how you re drawing the conclusion that ironpython is faster than cpython

620979
arrays	map
the next c++ standard goes further it defines a container concept that will be fit by plain arrays by something caled concept map that defines how some type fits some concept and other existing standard containers

620994
enumerator	any
these changes basically mean can collaborate with an enumerator of any subtyping of t .

621003
rar	zip
text files will be mostly alphabetical characters while binary files - especially compressed ones like rar zip and such - will tend to have bytes more evenly represented

621079
subtract	add
your best bet is to probably have a sorted dictionary of coin sizes and then loop through them checking if your change is greater than the value add that coin and subtract the value otherwise move along to the next row in the dictionary

621085
constructor	object
do i have to always lug these object back and forth between constructor

621087
directory	folder
it s located in the root directory of a web application so for sharepoint it s usually located in the folder c inetpub wwwroot wss virtualdirectories sharepoint80 where sharepoint80 is the name of your web application

621096
any	set
the hasownproperty call can be added to this function to refine it a little by only allowing direct properties of windows which act as global variables including the ones you set explicitly and not of any of its prototypes

621108
contains	any
if the file contains any other ascii control character 0x00 through 0x1f excluding the three above then it s probably binary data

621189
administration	account
since the only account on the server is administration with no password i tried domain as the computer s ip-address as 10.0.0.11 username as administration and password as

621196
jquery	dojo
it s interesting because it showed dojo peaked and jquery is really ascendant suggesting jquery has eaten dojo s market share

621198
derived-class	base-class
slicing is when a derived object is assign copied to a base-class object -- the derived-class s specialization is sliced off

621202
positioning	slider
from my experience the slider event will get you the previous positioning of the sliderr

621212
type-conversion	int
however what i get is a type-conversion error as it fails to turn the string phil the user s name that was saved into the owner field into an int to turn it into the foreignkey

621219
python	ruby
since it s part of cocoa it should be available to both python and ruby

621226
early-binding	late-binding
if you are deploying to different versioning of excel you can use late-binding instead of early-binding to relieve this problem

621230
spring	seam

621266
while-loop	loops
i have a while-loops inside a foreach loops and i wish to jump to the next item in foreach when a certain condition occurs

621266
while-loop	loops
continue would jump to the beginning of the while-loops not the foreach loops

621267
build-process	ant
i ve used ant s xmlvalidate task to validate static xhtml files as part of the build-process

621273
execution	exit
that will exit the while-loop and continue execution outside it

621279
authentication	impersonation
the code project you mentioned is not dealing with impersonation in a way that is directly useful to wcf as the authentication happens before you can even hit this code

621293
unsigned-integer	int
wikipedia page on signed number representations explains the difference in the representation at the bit level and the int computer science page provides a table of ranges for each signed unsigned-int type

621319
versioning	upgrade
these determine how the msi can be install and if it upgrade overwrite or install beside any other versioning of the same application

621319
versioning	upgrade
for instance if you have two versioning of your software and they have different upgrade codes then to windows they are completely different pieces of software regardless of what the name is

621319
configuration	upgrade
however if the upgrade code is the same but the product code is different then when you try to install the 2nd msi it will ask you if you want to upgrade at which time it is supposed to copy the values from the old configuration to a new configuration

621335
unsigned	zero
unsigned variables are variables which are internally represented without a mathematical sign plus or minus can store zero or positive values only

621343
globalization	localization
if instead you are asking whether or not you can use something like code pages in vb.net the answer is an indirect yes although i see no reason to jump through that hoop to support globalization localization as the paradigm has shifted

621363
temporary	copy
although one could in such cases recommend having the forward migration automatically save the data or keep it around in the eventuality of rollback as an alternative to outright failure save to yml copy move to a special table etc. you don t have to as the time required to test such an automated procedure could exceed the time required to restore the data manually should the need arise. but even in such cases instead of just failing you can always make the reverse migration conditionally and temporary fail pending some user action test for the existence of some required table that has to be restored manually

621365
document	element
the featureloader may write body elements directly to the document which if it happens within the element is reported as an

621392
hide	show
c don t hide anything and make the wordpress install show up with a different theme

621396
firefox	safari
i only tested it on firefox and safari

621396

what helped me the most was consistency in the toolchain gnu gets most of the credit for that

621420
oracle	mysql
navicat works for oracle postrgres and mysql

621423
postgresql	mysql
you could try a company called toad by toad soft they don t handle postgresql but there are tools for mysql and sql server

621424
postgresql	oracle
oracle sql developer is free and supports all of these except postgresql

621427
response	timeout
this will cause the send methods to block until a response has been received from the server thus placing the event loop at the mercy of network latency and potentially hanging the browser until network timeout

621428
perl	php
apis in c c# php java perl and the free version geolite has an ipv6 version in addition to the downloadable csv format

621434
cout	cin
you can then use infile as you would use cin and outfile as you would use cout

ref	out
it s worth reading through so you know some of the not-so-obvious difference between c# and c++ for example struct are pass-by-value whereas classes are pass by ref and usage of out ref and other keyword

621461
contains	set
i have a solution that contains several c# projects and i would like to be able to set the output path and other properties on all the projects together in a single place

621461
any	set
are there any other methods to set properties across several c# projects

621461
any	set
any properties which are also set in a individual project will override the common properties

621463
virtual-machine	vmware
when i mean standard i going to use the benchmark virtual-machine vmware server 2.0

621465
msbuild	nant
i would suggest you to use a build tool such as msbuild or nant which would give you more flexibility on your builds

621467
.net	wcf
wcf on the client is typically the best choice for any service provided you can take a dependency on .net 3.0 and above

621478
rubinius	ironruby
a look at the different ruby virtual machines jruby maglev ironruby rubinius macruby and how to choose what fits best within the enterprise

621483
spaces	output
the output kinda right except that instead of a line with 4 spaces with a star a line with 3 spaces with 3 stars and so on up to no spaces and 9 stars and then reverses ...i get a line with a star a line with a space and 2 stars a line with two spaces three stars etc up to 4 spaces five stars and then reverses .

621489
spaces	output
you only need to output the newline once after you re done with all the spaces and stars outputing the newline doesn t belong inside a for-loop

621503
edmx	dbml
also dbml is used in linq to sql l2s - edmx is the mapping used in the ado entity-framework

621507
selected	checkbox
sometimes a gesture above all checkbox will selected all of them but one or two

621519
activerecord	datamapper
i would suggest looking at the activerecord and datamapper patterns

621528
python	ruby
if you just want to check it out for fun i would try ruby or python which are much more cooler things to fiddle around with

621539
iteration	set
for example you can set a breakpoint when i 10 in a typical for-loop to stop after the 10th iteration

621544
hardware	monitor
it has very few jobs beyond accessing the underlying hardware such as monitor of event channels and granting guest domains access to specific resources

621565
vb.net	vb6
i have upgraded my project from vb6 to vb.net

621574
document-ready	ready
the jquery document-ready methods won t be activated until the document is loaded which i assume guarantees that the javascript is all present and ready to be run

621574
javascript	dom
edit i m comfortable that dom manipulation - such as a lightbox that can appear when any thumbnail with class lightboxthumb is clicked - would use unobtrusive javascript

621594
search-engine	web-crawler
the downside of confusing the hell out of bots is that it will also confuse the hell out of search-engine web-crawler

621605
ip-address	hostname
reverse dns is simply a record where the lookup is to find your hostname from your ip-address

621619
any	set
however you should set it to false to elliminate the effect that it has and see if you can notice any improvement

621624
32-bit	64bit
problem is gdiplus color class is only 32-bit each component is byte only max 255 so how can i draw over a 64bit image using gdiplus

621653
hash	md5
why not take first 21 chars from md5 or sha1 hash

621655
contains	any
the statet object can contains any state that is useful to communicate to or from the specialized do_in or

621661
32-bit	16-bit
that is on a 16-bit cpu a word is 16-bit on a 32-bit cpu it s 32 and so on

621661
16-bit	x86
and the exception-handling of course is x86 where a word is 16 bit wide because x86 was originally a 16-bit cpu a dword is 32-bit because it became a 32-bit cpu and a qword is 64-bit because it now has 64-bit extensions bolted on

621663
16-bit	x86
16-bit 2 bytes to a word is universal for x86

621665
32-bit	64bit
in windows x64 for example an application can be run either as a 64bit application having a 64bit mahine word or as a 32-bit application having a 32-bit machine word

621671
32-bit	64bit
all you youngsters yappin on about 32-bit thiss and 64bit that you know there were and are other machine architectures than the x86 family

621710
scripting-language	language-features
to go back briefly to the original question i can think of two language-features that almost every scripting-language has that as3 lacks

621716
ubuntu	linux
and i also get a completely different scan code on linux ubuntu from getrawkeycode

621724
buildpath	libs
at least under flex buildpath - libs path click on the add flex sdk button since that s probably why you want to do this in the first place

621729
contains	elements
all the google-chrome is contains inside a grid elements called navgoogle-chrome but i can find any reference to it

621735
selected	checkbox
when i selected few of the checkbox in first page and go to the next page through pagination it unselecteds the previous page s checkbox

621735
selected	checkbox
and when i click submit it gives me values of the current page s selected checkbox only

621735
selected	checkbox
how to retrieve all the selected checkbox in one go

621739
checkbox	button
make the next button a submit button which goes to the next page read the checkbox values out of the post data and set them manually on the next page

621746
traffic	packets
that will instruct the router to handle packets coming in from the internal interface and destined for the external ip just as it would handle packets coming in from the external interface effectively correctly looping back the traffic

621746
forwarding	port
that will triggers the port forwarding and your site will work

621746
hosts-file	hosts
add the dns name you re using to your own hosts making it correspond to the internal ip

621753
arrays	loops
now the system loops all the child elements and gets their dimensions width height left right into arrays like this

621753
arrays	loops
when the loops is complete system joins the arrays into a string where different elements are separated with semicolon

621753
arrays	loops
now it loops through the content of the arrays parsing each string into 4 variables

621763
debugging	trace
you should look into trace and debugging directives of .net

621763
debugging	trace
any debugging statements will only be compiled into a debugging build while trace statements are available to both debugging and release builds depnding on the directive specified

621770
freebsd	linux
you likely want uuid4 which generates a random uuid and uses os support if available on linux mac freebsd and likely others

621770
mac-address	ethernet
that gets its entropy from os.urandom if available otherwise from the current time and the local ethernet mac-address

621788
value	field
b the second most recommended solution is to define temporary serialization data transfer objects dtos sometimes called value objects vo which have only field and properties no methods and are only used to briefly transfer the data back up to the bll layer where there are used to populate new bo s at which point they are then discarded

621800
constructor	object
anyway i was wondering whether doing lots of workflow type activity in an object s constructor is a good idea

621819
httpd.conf	hosts
shared hostsing doesn t allow to modify httpd.conf which allows me to create a wildcard virtual hosts for an ip

621830
overlapping	z-index
the there is no direct support for overlapping z-index a div either in the api or dom

621851
virtual-machine	virtualbox
i run ubuntu as my primary os and then use a windows 2003 virtual-machine using virtualbox to develop in windows

621851
windows-server	windows
it s not quite as fast as if i run it all via windows directly but having one nicely setup virtual machine means i can share it with other developers plus easily switch between vms we re looking at trying out windows-server 2008

621860
principles	srp
in particular this blog is a good place to read up on srp and the other keystone principles of good oo design

621862
macros	vba
i would like to do this using a vba macros and not only for strings as contents

621865
any	set
i want to set a common standard for all the sources but i wonder if this would have any drawbacks

621869
drawimage	draw
if you just want to draw the sprites java s graphics class has a drawimage methods that will pull a specific area of the image out for you

621869
frame	width
you just have to specify the source image where you want to draw the sprite on your graphics object x y width height and in what frame of the image the sprite is located x y width height

621869
frame	width
assuming the width and the height of the sprite are the same width and height that you want to draw on the drawing area you could define your own methods to draw a sprite frame as follows

621869
frame	width
here x and y are the positioning you want to draw the sprite on your graphics object 15 is the number of columns in your sprite-sheet 19 is the frame numbering starts at 0 and 25 is the width and height of each sprite i approximated

621873
build-process	scons
for the build-process i use scons which produces the following commands

621891
innodb	myisam
you ll find people who are using myisam or those that are using innodb but aren t using it anyway

621891
oracle	mysql
they are invented purely for identifying the entity and are typically auto-incrementing fields sql server mysql others or sequences most notably oracle

621891
database-normalization	database-design
database-normalization is basically the process of optimizing database-design or how you organize your data into tables

621891
union-all	union
over-reliance on union-all and particularly union constructs

621891
union-all	union
the difference between them is that union-all is a simple concatenation and should be preferred wherever possible whereas a union will implicitly do a distinct to remove duplicate tuples

621901
macros	vba
or a vba macros

621902
malloc	free
you will need to create special malloc and free wrappers in port.h as well

621913
compact-framework	.net
it appears that the datacontractserializer isn t available in the .net compact-framework

621928
scripting	shebang
if you re sure that python is found test using the simplest possible scripting or by logging into the webserver if you can and typing which python then you can get much better debugging output by adding the following to the top of your scripting just below the shebang

621936
contains	sorted
the server receives a request contains a request parameter where the key is the name of the property for example lastname and the value is the value that the property needs to be sorted on for example smith

621947
implements	extends
in actionscript 3.0 i want to extends classa and implements interfaceb

621959
moss	wss
maybe you are using wss 3.0 windows sharepoint services and not the moss 2007

621964
put	get
the left and top values i ve put in may be a little off but you can tweak to get what you want

621964
pixels	line
i ve corrected the pixels value and added a width to your line div and a height since ie defaults all divs to one text line high

621964
text-align	width
also your title div should be full width with text-align right so that the title will expand to the left instead of the right

621992
grouping	sorting
to avoid the overhead of sorting that grouping by produces add order by null

621997
value	field
use an auto_increment primary key field in each table and then use to extract the value after each insert

622000
subtraction	modulo
written this way to avoid an unneccesary extra modulo or subtraction

622003
google-chrome	firefox
this will display consistently in firefox 3 ie 7 ie 8 opera 9 and google-chrome 1

622022
sql-server	oracle
i ve used this tool to generate as many as 40 000 000 rows of data to a sql-server database and 8 000 000 rows of data to an oracle

622047
callgrind	valgrind
i think that you could try various valgrind tools especially callgrind used to get call counts and inclusive cost for each call happening in your program

622048
parentheses	operators
i do like the removal of the strange doubled parentheses operators a but that s likely just aesthetics

622060
perl	tcl
does all your 4 points and also works for perl python ruby and tcl

622067
constructor	object
also using a method of a real object as a functor allows you to store the instance of it for later execution something you cannot do with your constructor approach

622075
communication	messages
that way you ll have standardized your error communication mechanism but allowed yourself the ability to customize error messages by each action

622091
perl	php
perl php asp etc and if you only have one account to add then this would be trivial to do

622097
principles	srp
the trick here is to follow the single responsibility principles srp and separate those kinds of code that you have to fiddle with from those kinds that are deterministic

622099
json	xml
i also don t see the need even when heterogeneity is the rule because we already have json and xml

622114
iteration	elements
the cost of iteration is deferred until iteration which may be a big win if in the end you don t need to touch all the elements in the list

622120
constructor	object
if the constructor does all that work then the constructor knows about many other domain object

622120
constructor	object
another reason i dislike constructor that do things is that it makes the object around them very hard to test

622120
constructor	object
if the constructor of ticket controls the workflow and the dance between customer and other domain object then it is unlikely that i will be able to mock it out to test the customer

622133
base-class	subclass
notice that the subclass depends on the base-class and that the base-class is independent of the subclass

622141
required	checked
i ve heard that in silverlight 2 this process is more complicated due to the fact that it is required to use a policy server and that could slow down my application not to mention that each string passed through the socket would have to be checked with the policy server

622145
derived-class	inherited
a virtual inherited property can be overridden in a derived-class by

622151
authenticode	code-signing
for more details on how the process actually works read signing and checking code with authenticode and introduction to code-signing on msdn

622187
order	add
just to add to the order suggestions

622188
value	field
second because productprice is a public field instead of a public property there s no way for class a to prevent productprice from being set to invalid value negative value for example

622189
boost-function	boost-lambda
that allow your algorithms to be very generic pass in functions functors stl-bind boost-function boost bind boost-lambda ... which is what one usually wants

622199
zend-debugger	xdebug
you can thry tracking it down using xdebug or the zend-debugger but i f you have neither

622204
constructor	object
also avoid creating new object in the constructor in these situations

622204
constructor	object
instead pass the object already created to the constructor or set them after construction possibly by using an initalization method

622205
.net	wcf
.net remoting is more or less deprecated it has been dissolved into wcf

622208
.net	wcf
you can check here a performance comparison between wcf and other communication technologies including .net remoting

622210
subproject	libs
it turns out i had some #ifdef blocks in my header-files and the corresponding #define statement was in the precompiled header for the main project but not in the subproject the libs

622249
having	select
what you are looking to do is done by having a couple of themes on the server theme1.css theme2.css theme3.css etc. and letting the user select the theme he likes

622265
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m experimenting with asp.net-mvc and my question is - where i had page_load logic in master pages with webforms where should it go in asp.net-mvc

622266
attributes	properties
in the example above it s okay for gettypeid to query the typeid of attr because typeid is a properties of an attributes and because attr is a t it must be a type that inherits from attributes

622301
jquery	.post
whether you want to start with modality the popup or with the asynchronous .post with jquery is up to you

622301
jquery	.post
in your action form you ll probably be calling jquery s .post where the callback of the .post hides your form and updates the rest of the page

622301
hide	show
then it s just a matter of wiring up events to show and hide the popup and you re all set

622308
python	php
unlike php only the sqlite driver is installed by default with python

622336
cassini	iis
i m using win xp and i was using cassini but i want to give a tray to iis instead of

622357
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you are thinking too webforms and not enough asp.net-mvc

622367
keyboard	mouse
by idle i mean the state when there s no user activity keyboard mouse or any other else

622374
sin	pow
the question was mainly concerning methods which only effect a single number such as round abs sin pow etc

622376
show	next
next entry show the instantaneous

622379
httpd.conf	hosts
if you use a cname or indeed an a record pointing to the same ip address then you must as paul says either have serveralias entries in httpd.conf or point them at the default virtual hosts

622392
sftp	ftp
the files are just tranferred with ftp or sftp my preference so os-level locking isn t an option

622403
margins	padding
at the top of his .css stack because firefox and ie both have difirefoxerent default padding and margins for elements like ul ol etc

622403
google-chrome	firefox
i don t have a mac and really don t wanna incur the test cost of ie firefox opera safari google-chrome across all the myriad versions and platforms

622406
webforms	asp.net
and now the good thing you could do this mvc style even with webforms and the solution still works with asp.net mvc

622406
any	set
you could later change the controllers logic to set the tenant in the model not only based on the sub domain but maybe based on a cookie a referrer search term user agent s language or whatever you can think about without modifying any of your code depending on the model

622409
any	set
is there any reason why these properties set on the directory files are needed

622423
affinity	cpu
of course if you intend to set affinity to a single cpu only that cpu would be of interest its still the sixth field in units of user_hz or typically in 100 ths of a second

622433
db2-connect	ibm
there are forums on ibm s site for helping out specifically with db2-connect ee wwhich i think is a pretty pricey product not sure tho

622441
value	field
to show some field values uneditable you ll have to create a simple custom widget whose render methods just returns the value and then override the formfield_for_dbfield methods to assign your widget to the proper field

622442
javascript	dom
in either case the ajax call could either return javascript directly which then gets parsed to update the dom and replaces the image with the new image source or it could return a json response which then needs to get read and parsed by the ajax callback and then updates the dom

622442
attr	src
#buttonimage attr src data.imagesrc

622443
migrate	staging
having a reversible migration is fine for development and staging but assuming well tested code it should be extremely rare that you would ever want to migrate down in production

622450
directory	folder
however if you do find yourself with mergeinfo properties on individual files and folder there are two things you can do the first thing is simply to remove the svn mergeinfo property from the files and directory in question

622455
contains	any
note that if either the path to perl.exe or the path to your scripting or any additional arguments to your scripting too has spaces in it then you will need to form a string that contains double-quote characters quoting them something like

622463
firefox	safari
i have some of my users what os and browsers they are using and they usually say a mac os and firefox or safari

622484
virtual-machine	virtualbox
i use sun s virtualbox and an xp virtual-machine with all the browsers loaded up

622484
google-chrome	opera
i regularly use ff3 and ie7 so my vm has in it ie6 ff2 google-chrome opera and safari

622492
command-line	cmd
i do know however that this variables does not get set when you run an msbuild cmd via the cmd-line on a specific project that is contained in a solution

622500
arrays	map
i d draw the graphical map and then create a 2d data arrays which represents the map

622500
arrays	map
once all the logic for everything is handled just use the 2d arrays to display everything in their proper pixel coordinates over the graphical map

622500
contains	elements
elements 3 2 contains information denoting a wall so you can implement the code to make him ignore the command

622514
python	c++
for c++ i ve found that statically typed oop use zope.interface in python work well for higher-level parts connecting updating signaling etc and functional stuff solves many lower-level problems parsing nuts n bolts data processing etc more nicely

622514
python	c++
this may be the language itself python or something else an xml-script engine + necessary system for dynamic links in c++

622534
command-line	cmd
copy my command-line apps basic unix cmd and sysinternals apps

622546
contains	elements
each elements in the map would contains along with other information a list of all present entities with a sort of positioning value for added precision

622548
jquery	.post
i m using jquery to send .post data to the view which saves the new order in the database

622551
reflection	runtime
reflection is built deep into the core runtime and provides access to the underlying type definitions

622585
document	element
there is no way directly in .net to set a scripting element in the document head

622587
enterprise	platform
i d recommend you to get the enterprise integration patterns book to build your own answer to these questions -- to some extent the answer depends on the technologies and platform you are using for endpoint implementation and for file transfer

622612
enterprise	platform
so technically they are on an enterprise platform

622628
any	set
and is there any function to check if a given element index exists has been set

622638
primitive	int
i won t return null because int is a primitive type

622638
any	set
there is no way of knowing if any element has been set short of keeping a separate boolean arrays

622642
space	input
to use one of these the data elements would be the input colors the labels would be the set of thread colors the data terms could be something like the euclidean distance in lab space suggested by bzlm and the neighborhood terms would penalize for switching thread colors

622660
communication	messages
implements this kind of inter-thread communication i was sure that my threads would work independently and i would never expect that the reception of messages sent directly to a thread would be dependent on the main thread

622666
configuration	environment
sometimes a non-console program is called a gui program so you might look for a choice between console and gui in the configuration options of your development environment

622695
webserver	upload
i have a desktop application that needs to upload files to a webserver

622695
webserver	upload
what is the best algorithm for upload from a desktop application to a webserver over https

622707
qpainter	qimage
this is easily possible by opening a qpainter on a qimage

622714
mime	rfc
as long as they re not huge 100 mb you could generate a multipart mime encoded upload rfc 1867 from your application

622722
expression	evaluation
functional-programming phoenix lazy evaluation expression templates we can create domain-specific embedded languages in c++ we have great proto library we have blitz++

622729
direct3d	directx
the most important competitor to opengl is direct3d not the whole directx

622729
user-interface	drawing
so you can use them for user-interface drawing and include your performance critical realtime graphics where it suser-interfacets

622730
apache	squid
for caching of content you should look at squid apache s mod_cache and memcached

622730
postgresql	mysql
db your obvious choices are mysql and postgresql

622730
ruby	php
you can create a scalable well performing site in any of python ruby php java .net etc

622734
webserver	upload
they can be added by clicking on the new button in the web-part gallery and select the correct classes or by upload the webpart definition files from commonprogramfiles microsoft shared webserver extensions 12 template features bizappssitetemplates dwp

622735
.net	wcf
also i can t use wcf or anything that s in .net 3.0 or 3.5 though i can use c# 3 because i m developing on vs2008

622749
expression	evaluation
no the whole call incuding any expression evaluation is removed from compilation if the symbol isn t defined

622763
easymock	jmock
i did not found a way to do this expectation in java using easymock or jmock and i think it is not possible

622763
any	set
there is a relative clean solution to create a delegate with the super class methods logic and then set expectations on it but i don t know why and when use that solution â any ideas examples

622773
nsmutablestring	nsstring
for instance objective-c and cocoa define both an nsstring class immutable and an nsmutablestring class

622773
constructor	object
you could think of it as only the constructor can change the object

622787
any	set
an area of physical memory once set aside may be modified in whole or part by a thread of execution at any time during the program s execution

622787
haskell	lisp
many functional programming languages such as lisp haskell erlang f# and clojure encourage immutable data structures by their very nature

622787
data-structures	tree
a lot of research has gone into the development of immutable data-structures such as lists and tree

622819
wxwidgets	mfc
gtk qt mfc wxwidgets etc are windows toolkits - they provide controls such as dialog boxes widgets button etc to create gui apps

622823
windows-server	windows
i currently have an application that sends xml over tcp sockets from windows client to windows-server

622835
multiplication	modulo
short answer multiplication and modulo operations

622837
http	ssl
how big are the messages how often would you be hitting the rest service is it straight http or do you need to secure it with ssl

622837
lighttpd	apache
rest offers two advantages here first the tcp ip time often does dominate the message transmission and that s pretty well optimized in production web servers like apache or lighttpd

622851
arrays	map
the tiles can be internally represented as a 2d arrays or a single arrays in which case you d use some kind of internal representation scheme to map your arrays to the board squares thus the mod arithmetic

622857
keyboard	mouse
is there any way to prevent all the mdi windows toolbar and other controls from receiving mouse clicks and keyboard input during my background threadâ s operation

622867
aggregate	grouping
this include your example of grouping aggregate query results and also include joined query result sets expression as columns etc

622868
ethernet	lan
is your upstairs router on the same ethernet lan and your wifi card is also accessing that router

622870
webserver	upload
try something that s directly supported by the webserver rather than rolling your own such as the suggestion made by chris hynes multipart mime encoded upload

622875
perl	php
and to answer your question c supports code like that except of course for not having a string type and that sounds like something php or perl would have but i could be totally wrong on that

622876
hide	show
hide all forms and only show the one main form

622879
value	field
i have a state field that stores the value as 2 characters

622903
scp	ssh
what i need to do is only allow scp to a specific directory based on the ssh key of the incoming connections

622917
ruby	php
i m looking at learning php ruby probably ror or python using django

622919
progress-bar	progress
when you are using a statusbar or a progress-bar while your background thread is processing some longduring task disabling your form will also disable your progress status bar from updating

622933
contains	any
either a compiler error would be generated or a run time exception-handling would be thrown but never at any time would a foobar memory address contains data that was not a valid foobar

622933
strong-typing	types
enforcing strong-typing usually requires some types of runtime support

622934
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome both support the const keyword

622934
jquery-plugins	jquery
note that something similar to this is commonly used by jquery-plugins but for the opposite reason jquery code is usually written using the shorthand to refer to the jquery object but the library is intended to continue working even if some other code redefines that symbol

622943
python	java
java python c# all offer better designed languages and more consistent libraries at the cost of slightly more layers of abstraction

622944
arrays	loops
i loops through all members of this arrays and

622945
perl	php
i would personally choose php or perl for a few reasons

622945
perl	php
breadth of support almost every unix web hosting service offers php and perl either through mod-perl or cgi

622945
ruby	php
the same is true for ruby but there are few applications of php outside of web development

622949
hash	md5
md5 is generally considered insecure if hash collisions are a major concern

622949
hash	md5
you can try to create your own hash â it would probably not be as good as md5 and security through obscurity is likewise not advisable

622952
wamp	php
php is pretty easy you can use a wamp bundle or build your own lamp kit to start learning

622955
salt	md5
another good option is used salt md5

622955
append	input
for example the input to your md5 hash function is append with string acidzom

622970
ruby-on-rails	django
once you ve progressed far enough definitely go for a framework such as ruby-on-rails or django

622971
.net	wcf
i used wcf for the .net cient server

622981
double	int
objects are passed by reference value where the value is the reference things that inherit from object primitive values int long double etc. are passed by value

622988
arrays	loops
you want to output each element of the arrays individually instead of outputting the result of the loops

623005
linux	osx
i d really like a platform independent solution that works across osx linux win but at the very least would like a windows implementation

623005
perl	c++
i have a good amount of experience with java python and perl but limited exposure to c c++ which is why i m hoping there is already a library or some code out there to do this if not though i m more than willing to get my hands dirty

623029
any	set
at the mail client level using email client rules like the ones available in thunderbird is easy just set a rule that delete any email marked as spam in the subject

623040
required	checked
does it only check if the required libraries are install or does it more than just checked requirements

623040
emacs	vim
i am currently using nano and i ve heard of vim and emacs but don t know what the benefits of them are over eachother

623045
scala	java
from what i ve seen scala looks like it handles normal java just fine

623045
scala	java
hence anything that java can handle for business scala could too

623053
for-loop	arrays
these days when ever i see the boilerplate for-loop to iterate over an arrays one-by-one using an index variable it makes me want to scream

623053
for-loop	arrays
clearly the code has meaning to iterate over the collection rather than the old for-loop saying how to iterate over an arrays

623055
environment	building
i m in the process of rearchitecting our own building environment at work so i m going through the options for a lot of building development tools

623055
revision	svn
features svn integration to tie issues being tracked to subversion revision

623060
required	checked
does it only check if the required libraries are install or does it more than just checked requirements

623060
environment	building
it s a scripting usually used to set up various things based on the environment being used for building

623060
emacs	vim
i am currently using nano and i ve heard of vim and emacs but don t know what the benefits of them are over eachother

623060
emacs	vim
vim and emacs are very flexible editors that support a whole bunch of different usages

623063
checkbox	listbox
what i want is the checkbox thingyinlistcheckbox to be checked if the thingy object is in the list that is the selected item in the listofgroups listbox

623065
lookup	any
in groovy if i know that a given methods expects a map so it can lookup things by a string key - i can give it the full map a stripped-down map an expando with a property named the same thing as the key or any other object that has a property named the same thing as the key

623068
emacs	vim
vim and emacs but don t know what the

623068
emacs	vim
emacs via a variety of lisp and vim via its own scripting language

623068
emacs	vim
i personally use emacs so i can t say much about vim but you should be able to find lots of information about both online

623068
atom-editor	sublimetext
i recommend looking at sublimetext or atom-editor

623074
environment	building
imho it s a nifty feature of the building environment

623075
linux	unix
it also gives a good sense for the mindset behind programming on unix or linux

623075
emacs	vim
for editors you probably want either vim or emacs

623077
linux	unix
creating make files by hand is usually a very unportable way of building across linux distro s unix variants

623077
scons	cmake
gnu autotools cmake scons jam etc

623087
rollback	commit
you can rollback the last commit but only the last one with hg rollback and then reapply it

623104
decimal	hex
also how do i get the value in hex instead of a decimal

623109
webserver	host
sure can - any file or webserver can host a clickonce app

623112
instances	self
details differ this methods or the superclass s or both may take arguments and some people prefer on its own line and wil shipley doesn t assign to self at all but the basic idea is the same call make sure it didn t return nil set up the instances if it didn t and return whatever the superclass returned

623113
sql-server	firebird
there are of course pre-existing connectors for using sql-server which includes sql express but if you need a fully functional rdbms that is file-based you need to use something like sqlite or firebird also a fan of vistadb not free or open source but very solid and pretty affordable

623115
emacs	vim
i am currently using nano and i ve heard of vim and emacs but don t know what the benefits of them are over eachother

623115
gnome	kde
if you re using linux with a windows manager kde gnome etc. you could also consider using the standard text-editor for your windows manager

623115
emacs	vim
the main benefit it would have over vim emacs nano is that it would seem more familiar to one coming from a windowss environment - an editor written to run on the windows manager has a menu bar file open save dialogs undo redo and plenty of other neat features that console editors probably can t match

623115
emacs	vim
though emacs and vim are pretty sophisticated these days so who knows

623115
kdevelop	kde
fyi the ide for kde is kdevelop

623118
required	checked
does it only checked if the required

623118
cmake	jam
some of the more popular ones are cmake jam boost jam might be of interest for c++ and waf

623121
postgresql	mysql
ms sql and it s derivatives are database applications much like oracle mysql or postgresql

623130
version-control	git
does anyone know of or have any experience setting up something like trac with git version-control

623139
pixels	line
if you just have a grid of pixels - an big field on which pacman and ghost can move about freely - then the shortest path is easy - a straight line between the ghost and the pacman

623155
contains	elements
that is enough because the methods then modifies the arrays elements and by convention you re expecting elements 0 to contains the return value

623155
contains	set
obviously you can do this in other ways such as structuring your code so this isn t necessary or constructing a class that can contains the return value or allow it to be set

623159
hash	md5
my text file says the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog however when i try to get the hash from this file both the md5 and sha1 is different from the wikipedias result

623194
textbox	button
update the gridview is very standard 4 columns one of which is a date column the datatemplate for that column creates a datepicker which initially looks like a textbox and a button the button is placed on a canvas panel and when clicked a calendar is added to the canvas

623198
callback	methods
it s a little more complex making the callback an object methods like this but gives you a little more flexibility as opposed to doing a simple function callback

623199
pointers	stack
things may get more difficult with return value - it may be via eax register or via a special pointers passed to the function as the last pseudo-argument on the top of stack

623202
contains	any
if your command contains any strange characters it s very easy for cmd.exe s idea of which parts of text are quoted and which aren t to get out of sync with your target program s and all hell breaks loose

623206
click	mouse
tester a utility for recording mouse click and keystrokes then playing them back program checking behaviour

623226
contains	any
header shall not contains any macros

623226
defined	declare
that defined names declare or definedd

623228
typename	typedef
typedef typename in ancestor types aren t inherited by templates classes

623237
getter-setter	initializer
everything else inferred variables automatic getter-setter collection initializer property initializer lambda are just compiler magics not dependent on 3.5

623240
base-class	inherited
if you see that the class implements idisposable or has a dispose methods because it inherited the interface from a base-class you have two choises

623242
click	mouse
by a mouse click in the close icon or alt+f4

623250
keyboard	mouse
the formclosingevent provides a formclosingeventargs with a closereason but the reason doesn t distinguish between using a mouse or the keyboard

623255
document	element
i need to add an element to an existing xml document which uses a namespace that doesn t exist in the original

623259
canvas	pixel
my first two attempts were involved hackishly trying to draw each pixel in the browser using div tags or the canvas tag

623260
any	set
we d been using castle to handle dependencies and hadn t set any of the controllers to be transient

623272
document	element
if both the initial document and the element to be added are internally consistent then namespaces are okay

623272
document	element
it is important that both the initial document and the element define a default namespace with the xmlns attributes

623272
document	element
assume the initial document is in initial.xml and the element is in element.xml

623274
required	checked
bring target database up to the required versioning depending on the checked out code versioning

623287
input-devices	keyboard
it just listens input from client instead of physical input-devices like keyboard

623288
constructor	object
in the constructor i create the instance of the entity manager and when i created a new object it would create a new instance all the time which was quite time consuming

623289
web-config	app-config
you can register type aliases either in app-config web-config

623294
emacs	vim
editor vim and emacs are popular

623294
scons	cmake
as other said there are alternatives cmake scons etc...

623294
autotools	scons
i am quite familiar with both scons and autotools but i still use make for small couple of files projects

623296
ruby	php
the documentation for php is honestly top notch- and you learn the language and the fundamentals of web development side-by-side whereas with say ruby or python you have to learn the framework and the language.

623296
ruby-on-rails	django
step up to django or ruby on ruby-on-rails

623306
webserver	upload
you ll need to build a jar for your applet and an html page to launch it from and then upload them both to your webserver

623316
methods	extend
or you could try changing the extension methods to extend iqueryable as the other commenter suggested

623321
logging	trace
now a sysadmin would never turn on trace logging in production

623339
contains	elements
even though a canvas can contains large elements it does not necessarily show all of its children

623347
centering	fixed
for how hard even simple layout can be with pure css particularly when you want to do vertical centering when the containers or the child aren t fixed height or side by side content

623352
entity	poco
if i were to define a poco type of class say a product class would that be a business object or an entity

623353
debugging	exit
so now the problem is that whenever the dll encounter any error it will just call exit with the status code 999 and my exceptionfilter will not catch it and thus no minidump created for postmortem debugging

623364
constructor	object
your suspicions are correct it is being through during the constructor the constructor in c# is trying to create an object it is already wrapped and work perfect when the application is running normally that is written in c++ and in c++ in the constructor of the object the exception is thrown

623372
debugging	trace
log4j defines the following levels trace debugging info warn error and fatal but one can also filtering the output according to the class in which the log is done

623381
sendmessage	message
afaik the two message loops should be independent of each other as long as you don t use other means of synchronizing the threads like sendmessage

623389
profiling	trace
i couldn t get the profiling produce any trace in one such case

623397
hide	show
mind you i don t want to change which tab is active i want to completely hide one tab then show it and hide another tab

623417
google-chrome	firefox
i tend to agree with the use a table advocates but after messing around for a while in a not really knowing what i m doing kind of way i came up with this variation which fixes the vertical align problem in firefox safari google-chrome etc and doesn t make it any worse in ie

623430
expression	evaluation
for evaluation the expression tree i would suggest to use the visitor pattern

623437
global-variables	call
the collector must be aware of the location of object references within the global-variables area as well as in the activation frame of each function methods procedure call for each thread

623440
decrement	increment
other scheme used or still in use are for example reference counting where each object has a counter of references to it which must be increment each time someone gets a reference to that object and decrement each time someone loses a reference to that object

623441
pointers	stack
start with the root objects those on stack in your main - equivalent then just follow every pointers reference and mark each object as reachable

623503
bison	yacc
what is the difference between flex lex and yacc bison

623503
bison	yacc
can i install pure lex and yacc on ubuntu or i can install only flex and bison

623506
bison	yacc
bison is the gnu implementation extension of yacc flex is the successor of lex

623509
shell	bash
before you turn into a bash shell vim emacs junkie try a few gui based tools first so you have some transition time.

623509
emacs	vim
i m sure the longhairs will scoff and claim that vim or emacs gives them the best and fastest development environment but different strokes for different folks

623511
any	set
when trying to set a transparent color as a stroke on any kind of text like this

623512
triggers	insert
and lastly you could have an insert update triggers that enforced that no other record existed with a duplicate compositiondate date part only

623513
document	element
document type does not allow element input here

623513
document	element
document type does not allow element input here

623518
shell	bash
with this option you have to use the bash shell to work with git

623518
directory	folder
or will it suffer from infinite recursion if say the directory structure was such that some folder was actually a symbolic link to one of its parents

623520
getattr	setattr
from my python knowledge i would say that datetime overrides setattr getattr but i am not sure

623527
constructor	object
the constructor is supposed to initialize the object into a good state as defined by the class

623535
bison	yacc
yacc and bison are pretty closely compatible though bison has some extra tricks it can do

623535
solaris	aix
lex and yacc are maintained by the unix svrx licencees - companies such as ibm aix hp hp-ux and sun solaris have modified versions of lex and yacc at their command

623552
reliability	scalability
with erlang the scalability and reliability is there but from your project definition you don t outline what type of text processing you will need

623564
directory	folder
with every different solution you have create folder foreign name foreign silverlight toolkit in this case in your root solution directory

623581
textbox	button
i have an appfolderdialog form which i use as a dialogue on which there are ok and cancel button a read only textbox and a browse button

623581
having	select
now i also need a cancel button on the dialogue itself so the user can cancel without having to select an invalid directory

623585
backslash	regex
when using double quotes watch out for backslash escapes in the regex

623600
decrement	increment
this counter will be increment each time a reference to the object is established from another object and decrement when a reference is deleted

623610
dialog	pop-up
once the user clicks ok the first dialog is dismissed you check the result in your application and if the expected file doesn t exist pop-up an error dialog informing them that the chosen directory was not correct

623610
dialog	pop-up
you could give them the option of retrying which would just pop-up the first dialog again

623613
temporary	copy
ash is correct but i d like to add that if a column s type affinity is causing problems for you for example if strings that look like numbers are being converted and stored inaccurately your only option is to copy all the data to a temporary table drop the original recreate it with the right definition and copy the data back

623624
constructor	object
if you want to create multiple instances of similar object you should use plain old constructor functions remember to put shared properties in the prototype

623624
constructor	object
if you want to create a single object consider using an anonymous constructor

623624
constructor	object
this has an additional benefit over object literals the constructor function can be used as a closure over private variables

623626
getter	setter
so generally that applies just to getter and setter

623630
dialog	pop-up
when i run or debugging my compiled program i d like the option of having a dialog pop-up which asks me for the command-line parameters

623631
getter	setter
by accessors i tend to think of getter and setter

623631
getter	setter
it seems fairly straight forwarding that the add instances methods is not a getter nor a setter

623632
value	field
so yes i d say it just gets the value of a field

623645
linux	unix
i would recommend micro focus server enterprise edition as a new production platform running on a unix linux box

623661
checkbox	button
the problem with this method is when the usercontrol is visible i cannot click any controls button checkbox in the windows behind the usercontrol

623691
constructor	object
you could use this trick in your constructor see generic data access object section preparing daos with lookup

623703
droppable	draggable
im using the standard user-interface draggable and droppable

623704
mocking	stubs
you can use mocking isolation framework to stubs the actual calls to the server and use a unit-testing framework to write proper unit tests

623706
syntax-error	syntax
a missing parenthesis might mean that the entire latter half of your program may be considered one giant syntax-error rather than being syntax checked line by line

623713
order	add
in order to add contents to display on a jtable one uses the tablemodel to add items to display

623734
interface-builder	ibtool
ibtool is extremely verbose in its string-files output and generates stirngs by object-id instead of by unique source string.â this type of output is extremely useful when you re trying to re-create interface-builder or otherwise need extensive control over the objects in your xib files but less so when you simply want to localize your software

623736
user-controls	ascx
they are pretty much exactly like a user-controls only instead of using the ascx file to create the controls you create them all programmatically

623750
web-hosting	hosting
keep in mind that good java web-hosting isn t usually so cheap as php hosting jvm simply needs more resources memory to run than php

623751
swing	awt
in java awt or swing the reverse is really true

623757
c#-to-vb.net	vb.net-to-c#
convert vb.net-to-c# c#-to-vb.net tools

623760
xsd	xml
the problem is that xsd is xml - language agnostic

623767
publishing	release
right click on the project you want to release and choose publishing menu item

623779
any	set
my understanding is when i go to the scripting tab in firebug i would see the javascripting functions on the aspx and the javascripting in any files that are include and i would be able to set breakpoints

623798
selected	textbox
selected the file loaded into the frame you want to debugging and it s contents will appear in the textbox

623809
fgetcsv	fputcsv
try searching php.net for fgetcsv and fputcsv

623833
c++	lua
it allows one to make an engine usage interface where engine is done in c c++ and the behaviour or customization done in lua

623849
comma	words
i would go for a comma as it is more natural to separate multiple words tags by comma then use hyphens or other less usable replacement techniques

623856
getter	setter
if you want getter and setter for a field you must do this

623865
python	java
i think this question is like why java is not indentation-sensitive like python

623871
javascript	dom
i don t know of a native jquery function to do it but there s a cross-browser javascript way to get xml from an xml dom node

623871
javascript	dom
serialize a dom node to xml text using javascript

623877
order	join
selected from comments left join photos on comments.id photos.id where comments.id photoid order by whenadd desc

623885
constructor	object
you need to define a copy constructor and possibly also assignment operator if you ever copy such an object like transfer it by value

623885
constructor	object
the default copy constructor will leave you with a copy whose reference members point to the value members of the original object not the ones of the new object

623929
ppm	png
in the past i ve saved rgb images generated from physical simulations as 8-bits channel ppm or png or jpeg

623930
libavformat	ffmpeg
and you do have the libavformat implementation in ffmpeg as a reference

623932
defined	declare
you re close you can forwarding declare the class in the namespace and then defined it outside if you want

623950
revision	rcs
on the plus if you have a revision control you can look at the history of changes something that can t be done with a designed that uses a binary format or an xml format which is not rcs friendly

623954
swing	swt
it works with swing and swt its syntax is very concise and clear and it has a debug mode that s unbelievably useful

623960
authentication	login
i am logged with windows authentication and create an entry user in the login table

623960
authentication	login
the new testuser has a sql-server authentication but if a try to login local or remote only fault 18456

623961
nvidia	ati
nvidia and ati both support exr data in their graphics cards

623975
any	set
i often see people set lots of options when half of them are the default in any case

623976
google-chrome	firefox
the problem i am having is that within a select box only firefox supports .hide on option values i can t figure out a snappy approach for ie safari opera and google-chrome

623980
ip-address	proxy
i would add that it would be wise to check the http_x_forwarded_for server variables representing the ip forwarded by a proxy or null if none firstly in order to avoid the issue of the ip-address for the proxy and thus potentially many other users also being banned

623996
getter-setter	getter
chris answer is likely all you ll need for the scenario you ve outlined but consider a slightly more complex scenario where you need a getter-setter on your class but the interface only defines the getter

624010
switching	screens
you can visualize the distinction by putting your computer into screens capture mode cmd-shift-4 and pressing the spaces bar to switching to capture whole windows

624041
repository	entity
in my repository i get the entity like this

624043
authentication	login
also if i login as a user with staff status i show as authentication without any issues

624050
wxpython	pyqt
wx and wxpython has two events i miss in pyqt

624066
mouseleave	mouseenter
instead of the ismouseover property you can use mouseenter and mouseleave events

624077
expression-blend	designer
best way to use expression-blend for the designer to create the ui

624090
udp	mtu
packet encapsulation for vpns poorly-designed or implemented udp protocols and l1 l2 protocols that drop the end-to-end mtu below endpoint values can all cause ip fragmentation

624102
selected	button
here is the scenario i have two radio button 1 for a normal customers and 2 for business partners which also has a drop down control so that one of x number of business partners can be selected

624102
radio	click
i ve tried using both the click event for the radio button and the labels but the disabled dropdown list seems to be an event handling black hole

624114
xml-serialization	xml
see customize your .net object xml-serialization with .net xml attributes

624119
perl	php
this would be the same whether you were moving from web frameworks written in java php ruby perl or any other language for that matter

624124
perl	php
candidates c# python perl ruby php java

624177
authentication	login
the application uses a single sql-server login to authentication as all rights are data driven within the application itself

624177
administration	credentials
administration of the users on the database server can be automated by the application but the potential number of credentials may be a concern

624177
authentication	impersonation
we have looked into user impersonation techniques but they become difficult to implement when a report client such as excel authentication directly to the server

624217
methods	extend
but it appears that if an object is passed into a methods that changes to it s properties extend beyond the methods

624239
data-members	private
you will have to declare it as a friend if it depends on private data-members but you will get symmetry for the callers

624258
iostream	boost
boost s iostream lib has gzip and bzip2 streams too

624278
administration	account
but we didn t experience any kind of administration overhead except when power users restored databases without telling us causing the sql login account to become out of synch with the database

624301
contains	set
i have the following very simple code which retrieves utf8 formatetd data such as contains umlauts from a mysql database which may or may not be set as utf8

624327
stripes	spring
for php there is codeigniter kohanaphp and cakephp and in the java realm you might want to look at struts 2 stripes and spring

624328
data-members	private
datacontract is opt-in - you need to explicitly add a data-members attribute to any field or property public private internal or whatever to serialization - if you don t have it won t be in there

624328
constructor	object
in simple examples these advantages of the datacontractserializer might not seem like much really - but it can be a distinct advantage in larger scale apps if your data object do not have to have a public parameter-less constructor and that you do not have to artificially surface elements as public properties just to include them in serialization

624329
xsd	xml
i need to check that the xml satisfies its xsd i ve defined and then read it

624339
any	set
we set it to 1 ms without any adverse effects.

624374
perl	awk

you can also use ssh or ftp and access your web on the host with sftp or ftp

624476
ftp	ssh
inside your vm you can use fuse with ssh ftp to mount the connection to a local path for easy access with the webserver

624646
rollback	commit
the server will interleave execution of such batches which means that if the batches change server state via set or use statements for example or use tsql transaction management statements begin tran commit rollback both you and the server can get confused about what your actual intent is.â

624656
exception-handling	error-handling
true there s an ongoing debate between exception-handling and return values as the better error-handling methods but i m pretty certain there s a consensus about being consistent and sticking with whatever choice you make

624663
rollback	commit
it has atomicity commit transactions rollback etc

624673
imperative-programming	declarative
i think that the gap between engineers and non-engineers customers marketing slave traders etc. is a little like the contrast between declarative and imperative-programming

624674
jquery	dojo
why not use a framework such as jquery mootools extjs dojo prototype etc. that has already solved all of these problems

624680
minimum	max
i m not following your logic there - the gap between the maximum of row 2 300 and minimum of row 3 330 is 30 if you are including either the min or max values 29 if not

624680
populate	row
at any rate if your table has a row id of some sort as the example seems to indicate then you could try something like this assuming a table mytable with columns rowid minval and maxval populate with the data in your example

624683
client-server	web-services
if you are writing web-services as with a client-server system then you find you want things like language-agnostic data representation argument validation client server code generation error handling access controls

624723
google-chrome	firefox
the code works fine in firefox opera google-chrome and safari but not ie7

624749

624853
execute	prepare
give pdo prepare and pdostatement execute a read

624896
python	java
i would have loved to work in c# or java or better yet python but the nature of the problem required me to use c++

624913
execute	prepare
i went the other way and made a class that extends pdo with a bunch of wrapper functions around prepare execute and it s much nicer than the built-in functions though that s a bit subjective...

624914
hash	md5
then i have blobs of xyz bits required for my checksum md5 sha1 sha512 etc one blob for each in a checksum hash table looked up by fileid

624921
difference	zero

my custom tab control is built dynamically with asp.net but the tabbing and the hide show functionality is all jquery

625015
perl	ksh
now there are a bunch of reasons that i choose other languages python java perl ksh etc. when the opportunity presents itself

625015
python	java
i know that java is the platform neutral solution of choice and ruby python are the rapid development alternatives du jour

625015
python	ruby
my guess is that a large number of the purer oop languages will start to loose market share to more general purpose dynamic languages probably ruby and python and that those languages will pick up some more serious oo chops as well

625016
javascript	dom
through regular rss reading i became aware that a significant number of javascript frameworks had been developed and it seemed to make more sense to use a js framework than coding dom manipulation by hand

625025
google-chrome	firefox
the menu looks great in firefox google-chrome etc but in ie7 the menu drop downs don t break through the nested divs

625029
python	c++
i have used sqlite in c++ python and now perhaps in c#

625102
filtering	sorting
i can pass in delegates for filtering and sorting which works fine but being able to use linq expressions would be much more elegant

625119
perl	php
it s simply not supported and i d expect to see support for java or perl or php before python 3.x

625130
perl	php
that python 3.0 support may not be forthcoming too soon but i m not sure i agree that it will come sooner than perl or php

625131
attributes	properties
if it helps i believe you don t need to make it a public properties since the attributes implements iserializable on the class behind your back

versioning	upgrade
that environment was upgrade to versioning 4 before we did the export â import process for migrating it to the current environment

625137
row	col
override setvalueat object value int row int col methods as well

625137

625336
jquery-plugins	jqmodal
try one of the excellent jquery-plugins for displaying modal windows such as jqmodal

625358
base-class	subclass
thus i have defined an abstract subclass of user-controls that defines these properties and updated the .xaml.cs and .g.cs files to inherit from this base-class

625359
arrays	loops
a loops control variable used to index an arrays should just take raw int types so the compile will generate the best code for your processor

its benefit is to simplify memory-management and thus avoid risk of memory-leaks

625396
malloc	free
all it takes is to free the malloc ed block

625404
.net	wcf
the .net framework 2.0 runtime is only 22mb and it s a good framework to target especially if you don t need wpf or wcf

625430
malloc	free
malloc free doesn t know or care about the type of the object just the size

625433
subtract	time
when he finishes i will subtract the current system.currenttimemillis from the start variables and i want to show them the time elapsed using a human readable format such as xx hours xx mins xx seconds or even xx mins xx seconds because its not likely to take someone an hour

625440
autotools	cmake
many would suggest autotools for project configuration i on the other hand recommend cmake rather nice language no more m4

625542
hash	md5
i am wondering if someone had his file match my file would salting the md5 or sha-1 hash change the result so both files no longer collide

625559
hash	md5
md5 has shown to be vulnerable to hash collision but i believe sha-1 has not so far

625562
hash	md5
as for collisions i don t think you need to worry about entire files having the same md5 or sha1 hash

625578
stream	send
tee splits the output stream and send it to two destinations

625582
hash	md5
md5 and sha1 are cryptography hash intended for the second kind of application

625583
silverlight	wpf
the advantage seemed that you could start with the silverlight version and then if you later needed more client control mostly just copy the xaml and app code into wpf

625583
silverlight	wpf
but it is much harder to start with wpf and port to silverlight

625585
hash	md5
the attack against crc-32 is irrelevant if the hash you are using is not crc-32 - md5 and sha-1 are not vulnerable to that kind of attack yet

625585
hash	md5
the current attacks against md5 are where an attacker creates two documents with the same hash

625591
value	field
you can write a javascript methods that returns the value from the different field in your form

i know that when i call adapter.updates it will updates only the necessary rows of datatable however i don t know how to write a updates command so it will be able to know what field in what table needs updating

625677
methods	extend
the solution is to add the methods to a partial class that will extend the native linq2sql classes instead of as an extension methods

625687
directory	folder
in my c project src folder i have only the test.java file and the assets directory which contains pacman.png

625696

625831
value	field
say my field is i can use as the field as label and but how about this value

625833
return-value	arguments
but since all of these arguments aren t strings what you actually want to use for return-value and for arguments is or lpvoid

625844
lighttpd	apache
so you have one or more processes getting http requests from your web server apache nginx lighttpd etc.

625850

625916
macros	vba
i have to parse the vba code in macros using c#

625926
macros	vba
the biggest offence was the loss of macros - i had spent a long time creating a set of useful vba macros to automate some of the code i write - but apparently there was a security hole and instead of fixing it the macro system was disabled

625927
xsd	xml
to remove the xsi and xsd namespaces i can follow the answer from how to serialize an object to xml without getting xmlns â â â

625996
callback	methods
in your methods invoke the service call asynchronously and register a callback that sets a flag

625996
callback	methods
the callback should set the backing field for your methods and you should be able to return it as soon as you detect the flag has been set indicating success

625998
selected	button
in the system preferences selected displays and click the detect displays button while the simulator is running

626045
constructor	object

626084
value	field
update the region table so that the real id field now has the newid value and the oldid field has what the region used to be

626103
order	add
edit as konrad rudolph pointed out in order to use dynamic casting you will have to add a virtual methods to your base class

626103
derived-class	base-class
actually it is a good practice to define a virtual destructor for every class that you want to use as a base-class anyway to ensure the destructor of your derived-class will be called more information

626123
realloc	malloc
in our c++ iam current using realloc methods to resize the memory allocated by malloc

626126

realloc	malloc
malloc and realloc are c functions

626241
realloc	malloc
actually realloc does malloc and free depending on the arguments you pass

626241
realloc	malloc
if you pass it a null pointers realloc does what malloc does

626241
realloc	free
if you pass it a zero size realloc does what free does

626242
sharing	share
both applications the ones were trying to share session data with are running 2.0 framework both in the same application-pool both with the same machine key and state server information both running on the same machine just out of different folder sharing the same parent folder however

easymock	mockito
now when i look at mockito samples or easymock ones in the java world i see

626351
thread-dump	jvm
on linux you can send the jvm the quit signal to make it do a thread-dump to the console

626353
configuration	environment
use two configuration files and simply rename them as needed to enable each environment

626354
apache-felix	eclipse-rcp
besides of the eclipse-rcp you should have a look at apache-felix and knopflerfish which are smaller open source osgi framework implementations

626356
easymock	mockito
iâ ve never worked with mockito or easymock but i donâ t think the call does what you think it does

626359
conditional	operators
we can initialize more than one variables we can check for more than one conditional we can iterate more than one variables using the comma operators

626359
for-loop	loops
the following for-loops will take you into an infinite loops

626368
widget	button
slots in objects managing the start button and status bar widget or subclasses can be connected to those signals rather than polling for current state in an idle event

626387
csv	xml
how can i change my xslt file so that it dynamically includes in the csv file all the fields from the xml file

626395
python	java
i just finished a user-group tour where i was part of a panel on development technologies .net me php python and java and every one of us agreed you need to know the web languages first

626398
value	field
if you can modify the code you can set the system.out field to a different value

626403
assign	add
you won t be able to add inline javascript but you might be able to use javascript to find your menu and assign rollovers to each item

626407
versioning	upgrade
the point isn t about justifying the upgrade but more planning where and when it is going to be sensible to do the update especially in a .net versioning upgrade where backwards compatability is mostly fine

626412
value	field
you can store the two value in a hidden form field as an object in json notation

626412
onchange	keyup
you will need to use a combination of the onchange keyup and keydown event to capture possible changes to the form so that you can re-selected the please selected option

626421
forgot-password	account
i m using my gmail apps for domain account to send email within my ruby-on-rails application for standard automated email user signup forgot-password notify admin of new comment etc but i m worried about the 500 email per day limit set by google

626443
uibutton	uilabel
i keep thinking in interaction problems with the uilabel due to its touch events not getting through the uibutton s view

626443
uibutton	uilabel
on the other hand with a uilabel as subview of the uibutton i m pretty confortable knowing that the touch events will always be propagated to the uilabel s superview

626474
traffic	packets
winpcap for doing more low-level packets oriented things for example capture certain types of traffic using the power and speed of bpf filtering

626484
contains	any
any software can contains malicious parts intentionally or unintentionally

626499
google-chrome	firefox
as javascript gets faster as jit compilers start showing up like in google-chrome firefox 3.1 and safari 4 and as html support gets better html5 the need for plugins to display fancy rendered widgets will diminish

626512
csv	xml
i ve read xml or csv before but i ve never seen anything like edi

626526
positioning	sidebar
you can also positioning your sidebar absolute inside your centre div make them really long and apply an overflow hidden to the centre div

626536
linux	unix
user.home .java deployment log on unix linux

626541
icmp	udp
the cases i am referring to are when an attempt to send to a udp socket results in an icmp destination unreachable packet being generated by the remote host

626541
icmp	udp
if i attempt to send a udp packet to a host that s up but that the port is not listening i can see the icmp message arriving back with a packet tracer but the question is how do i get access to that from my c# code

626541
raw-sockets	packets
i m playing around with raw-sockets but as yet have not been able to get the icmp packets to be received by my program

626541
icmp	udp
below is a wireshark trace showing the icmp responses coming into my pc from an attempt to send a udp packet from 10.0.0.100 my pc to 10.0.0.138 my router on a port i know it s not listening on

626541
icmp	udp
my problem is how to make use of those icmp packets to realise the udp send has failed rather than just waiting for the application to timeout after an arbitrary period

626551
entity-framework	ado.net
there s some talk about ms giving up on linq-to-sql the sqlserver-only database version of linq in favour of the ado.net entity-framework but even that s still a bit unclear

626557
realloc	malloc
why are you using malloc and realloc

626580
scriptaculous	jquery
i don t know if you are able to make use of any libraries like jquery or prototype scriptaculous which may increase your available options

626593
globalization	localization
with this in mind slapping your globalization localization code in the presenter is not a great idea

626624
malloc	free
you can say that both sides should use malloc free but what if they are using diffeent compiler implementations

626630
contains	elements
the problem here is that the first row could contains 3 elements and other rows 5 elements

626637
triggers	insert
otherwise you ll need to write some sort of custom constraint or a triggers probably 2 - one for insert one for updates that makes sure that you don t have 2 records with the same id where both are active

626643
vb.net	vb6
i m mainly a vb6 developer but am currently trying to write a web service using vb.net to allow for communication between our product and a third-party

626643
xsd	xml
this made me think - should my input parameter be an instance of this class rather than an xml document based on the xsd

626643
value	field
my idea was therefore to have a parameter naming the field to be updated and their value

626643
xsd	xml
my assumption regarding the request from our clients for the xsd came about so that we can make sure that the xml parameter will only include valid fields

626643
xsd	xml
a xml clidata as xml.xmldocument appears in wsdl but how would i generate an xsd to make sure the xml is valid

626661
value	field
you can get the current value of the field from the data property

626698
scons	jam
in the end what really defines a project is a leaf makefile -- and why restrict ourselves to makefiles what about scons autotools ant b jam aap

626698
dialog	pop-up
when i run or debugging my compiled program i d like the option of having a dialog pop-up which asks me for the command-line parameters

626767
silverlight	wpf
i ve come to the conclusion that silverlight doesn t work the same way as as wpf or asp.net with respect to service connectivity

626772
.when	ready
you will need to bind the event s to all new elements that are added after the ready handler is execute .when the page loads

626779
value	field
if i change the value of the textbox which is contains within the field control on the page from xxxx to yyyy i always get back xxxx

626788
sql-server	mysql
i m a mysql user who is trying to port some things over to ms sql-server

626789
derived-class	base-class
you have to call the base-class constructor prior to the derived-class constructor s body

626803
attributes	properties
attributes on the properties declaration

626806
interpreter	runtime
the base code type maybe different and sure you ll be needing the msil interpreter but ms has shown in many cases you ll actually see a performance increase in a .net runtime over a native one

626806
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in my non-.net asp.net-mvc testing i m seeing considerable 10x or more performance benefits over webforms

626815
click	mouse
i created a user-controls in xaml now i want a mouse click event which is triggers if the user clicks on any of these paths

626817
punctuation	words
what if the words starts with punctuation like ...words

626826
value	field
but if you using reports inside web application you can determine timezone from request variables with javascript and send time zone value back in hidden field urlparameter or postback

626843
lexical-scope	let
let is not make a lexical binding in the current scope but make a new lexical-scope with the following bindings

626850
put	get
i haven t got time to verify this but off the top of my head if you put your event on the canvas and don t specify a background for it then you should only get the click event when the user clicks on any of the paths it contains

626860
.when	ready
the server decides .when it s ready to send you data

626860
.when	ready
bob open connections to alice ports 20 .when it s ready and send the files there

626860
.when	ready
alice connect to ports 20 on charles .when ready and sends the files

626867
hide	show
i have a jsp with a javascript tree control and i want the user to be able to hide or show this tree at the touch of a button and for this change of state to be carried through to other pages visited if on page a the user hide the tree then on page b the tree should remain hidden and so on until the user decides to show the tree

626867
hide	show
if i invoke the show hide button i get a java numberformatexception error because the query string is lost

626888
configuration	environment
what i suggest you do is make use of package configuration that reference a database within your environment

626890
contains	set
this key contains a set of rules which affect how stepping is performed

626901
hidden-field	checkbox
nb there s more than one checkbox in the page to allow multiple selection so the false value is of no use as i need the values from the hidden-field to know which items were ticked and which weren t as non-checked checkbox values aren t posted - only the hidden-fields are

626908
checkbox	textbox
if you have one instructions textbox and one workplacehazards textbox per checkbox then you have to have a way to associate the checkbox that was clicked with those other two controls

626916
contains	any
not really any better way than custom fields although you could always write out a unique class name contains the post id on the container div and add the images via css each time you add a post

626923
telnet	ssh
once you ve got one check you can ssh telnet in

626927
directory	folder
specifically you probably want allusersprofiling to get the location of the common user profiling folder which is where the application data directory resides

626932
stderr	stdout
does abap allow writing to stdout and stderr

626946
defined	declare
to defined your own delegation you ll have to declare their methods somewhere as discussed in the apple docs on protocols

626952
punctuation	words
you want words capitalize even if there is punctuation before them try something more like this

626953
internet-explorer	google-chrome
i ve tested this in internet-explorer 7.0 mozilla firefox 3 safari 3 and google-chrome

626959
floating	margins
as floating point value have a finite precision they can only represent a subset of the real numbers which means it s often necessary to check equality with a margins for rounding errors

626965
put	get
if i put a info light button in the lower corner of my screen on dark background and check shows touch on hightlight i get a nice highlight effect when the user touches the icon

626965
selected	button
so i selected info dark button

626976
hide	show
what code is behind the show hide button

626977
stateless	stateful
if you re writing an ip telephony type application then you re probably going to want something fairly stateful if you can get away with stateless it s likely to be cheaper and easier to do it that way

627000
stateless	stateful
i m not personally familiar with all of the design issues of stateful versus stateless but i do know that nfsv4 is stateful after 15 years worth of previous versioning of nfs being stateless so apparently statelessness became a significant limitation for the nfs designers

627002
contains	any
this matches all of these variants match grouping one would contains first in any case

627021
solaris	linux
is there a generic ip device name for windows similar to eth0 used by linux and solaris

627028
rtsp	rtp
you should have a look at the rtsp + rtp protcol

627036
for-loop	arrays
i need to retrieve data from several rows and then insert the results into an enumerated arrays so then i can use a for-loop to echo it.

627050
selected	textbox
when i click on a tab it opens the page and selected a textbox on that page txttextbox1.selected

627050
textbox	button
although on these pages i can mouse click on the textbox enter info save then click my add button that clears the textbox and has the code txttextbox1.select

627050
selected	textbox
the textbox is selected just fine

627050
checkbox	textbox
the first 8 pages have a total of 256 labels buttons list boxes textbox and checkbox on them

627063
arrays	loops
this will produce an associative arrays that you can loops over pretty easily like so

627097
strict	let
let s suppose you have a page with a relatively strict doctype and html markup that s pretty close to compliant but perhaps misses in a few silly ways perhaps because of user content that s out of your control.

627097
google-chrome	firefox
i m looking for answers for each of the major browsers since ie google-chrome safari and firefox will of course all handle that differently

627111
reflection	runtime
reflection will not have the compile time type checking that the interface way of doing it has which means you could crash at runtime

627122
symbolic-math	maple
short of using a symbolic-math language like maple the best you can do is to approximate the derivative at various points

627124
firefox	opera
in firefox and opera you can determine if your browser is in quirks mode by checking page info

627124
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari and ie run this javascript in the address bar

627127
selected	button
users can click on a name in the div which opens the record in a new windows - new windows has a button selected this author which takes you back to the original page with that author in the textfield as author name id

627131
directory	folder
the above code shows how i get the number of free bytes on a particular drive which contains the folder manager.capdir it is the variables containing the full path name of the directory

627132
sctp	tcp
newer ip protocols such as sctp are designed to solve some of the shortcommings of tcp that could lead one to use multiple ports

627138
quirks-mode	doctype
the problem was that some pages written in quirks-mode did have doctype

627138
quirks-mode	doctype
therefore each browser has its own list with doctype that trigger quirks-mode

627140
sympy	sage
if there s any way you can get the analytical derivative of the function using pen and paper or a computer algebra system such as maple mathematica sage or sympy this is by far the best option

627141
xsd	xml
you can also create your own custom xsd xml file ala

627153
for-loop	arrays
this isn t really an answer to the question but if you want to print out an arrays as a comma-separated list it s better to use the implode command than a for-loop

627160
ruby-on-rails	django
else use php django ruby-on-rails or some other framework that supports templates fully

627161
priority-queue	queue
the api documentation on priority-queue says the head of this queue is the least element with respect to the specified ordering

627165
tuples	any
if you went for a walk you could note your coordinates at any instant in an x y tuples

627185
ruby	php
so in deciding to create a web app based on php django or ruby on rails can people share what maintenance on the website has entailed when upgrading all or parts of the framework or language

627190
having	select
for instance if john jones 1 writes articles about genetics and john jones 2 writes articles about computer networking bu having the user select the general subejct matter first you may be able to filtering out many of the less applicable possible duplicate names

627194
groovy	java
java unfortunately doesn t have anything like this but groovy does

627200
quirks-mode	doctype
if i understand quirks-mode correctly a page that does not validate against its declared doctype is not enough to trigger quirks-mode

627211
pointers	stack
when the function returns stack pointers reverts to the value it had before the function was called so the memory is automatically reclaimed

627213
conditional	operators
and now let s do the same to the version with the conditional operators

627225
malloc	free
you don t always have to use free on a pointers just ones declared with malloc

627225
pointers	stack
you can declare a pointers that points to a memory location on stack

627228
pointers	stack
there are ways to emulate garbage-collection but this involves when you have no more variables on stack and heap holding a pointers to the data on the heap

627228
pointers	stack
just to clarify pointers variables are created on stack and they hold a memory address to the data allocated on the heap

627228
32-bit	64bit
they take 4 bytes on the stack on a 32-bit system and 8 bytes on the stack on a 64bit system

627231
select	union
to write a select query that s tailored for each of the tables you can union the results to get one resultset

627233
arrays	loops
loops through the results arrays and use the specified word padding to get words on each side of the search term while also keeping track of the word count in a separate name value pair

627235
triggers	insert
the key to this sort of triggers is to remember that insert updates deletes can occur in batches even if this is the not the norm and to make sure the triggers works in a set-based fashion

627245
return-value	arguments
on a 32-bit system nearly all values fit into a 32-bit word and shorter values are pushed onto stack as 32-bit words for function call arguments so you should be able to call virtually all win32 api functions this way just cast the arguments to int and the return-value from int to the appropriate types

627247
widget	button
i ve searched until my head is sore for some indication of how to track the email as they go out how to measure the session size or something to just allow the process to be one button press and for the widget to be self-throttling but no one seems to want to talk about it online

627254
typedef	struct
typedef struct

627267
hidden	reset
is there some kind of middle-ground solution i m not thinking of which will keep the objects safely hidden from the gc for a period of time x but also allow them to be collected at the end of that time preferably where that time counter gets reset every time they re used in a way similar to session tokens

627270
abstract-class	subclassing
an abstract-class is a class whose purpose is to share implementation details between its subclassing

627285
abstract-class	subclassing
abstract-class may provide certain functionality yet will also leave some operations which must be implemented by their subclassing

627289
return-value	arguments
rundll32 has some limitations and i don t believe you can access the return-value whatsoever but if you form the command-line arguments properly it will call the function

627295
python	perl
finally there are a range of third party scripting languages such as python or perl that will run on windows

627310
malloc	free
the need to free doesn t depend on whether or not you ve declared a pointers but rather whether or not you ve malloc ed memory

627310
malloc	free
so the pointers in your question temp doesn t go away when you call free -- rather whatever your code allocated when it called malloc goes away

627328
msbuild	nant
you can invoke msbuild as a nant task

627330
msbuild	nant
the easiest approach in my experience is to use nant to call msbuild and get msbuild to build the solution file itself

627349
restart	exit
you could put it in inittab and let init worry about restart the process when it exit for any reason

627349
restart	exit
that would also take care of automatic restart if your process happens to crash or assert or otherwise exit unexpectedly

627351
order	add
i have been hacking on the code for xournal in order to add auto-save functionality

627372
panels	grid
navigation panels grid repeater card etc

627372
clearfix	margins
utilities stores things like my clearfix or margins normalizer page stores overall site layout header footer main and content is a universal set of rules for headings paragraphs links lists etc

627390
sql-server	mysql
i ve seen a date conversion done this way before in sql-server not sure if this works in mysql

627406
ubuntu	linux
to add to what ori has already said some linux distros still use initab but ubuntu and possibly others have switched to etc event.d

627406
restart	exit
or it could decide on its own that it s time to restart by calling exit 0

627418
webserver	security
if you don t leave time for providing architectural support for security at all layers database webserver application operational procedures etc. you will create software with security holes

627436
ellipse	line
sorry don t know the formula offhand but you ll basically find your point on the ellipse then figure out it s positioning given the angle of the rotation and then change your line s endpoint using that information

627440
constructor	private
in addition we have made the whatami property accessor abstract so that we can implement our own specific property accessor logic in each derived class and have also defined a constructor that accepts a string argument and assigns the value to the _name private field

627441
arguments	default
by default pop without any arguments removes the last item

627454
compression	streaming
dotnetzip does zip compression via streaming but does not do multi-part zip files

627470
updating	updates
you cannot updates the system-python without updating the whole os

627524
restart	exit
with this set up correctly all you service has to do is exit and the system will take care of the restart respawn for you auto-magically

627536
for-loop	arrays
try initializing the arrays elements in your structure individually say with a for-loop

627547
abstract-class	subclassing
abstract-class describes basic functionality and let specialized functionality to a subclassing

627547
abstract-class	subclassing
on the other hand you may have an abstract-class defining all common behavior the object may have and let the subclassing define specialized versions

627547
base-class	inherited
of course if the identification may be based on the common attributes the cars may have the getidentifiableid may be implemented by the base-class and the subclasses will inherited that methods

627547
base-class	subclass
case 2 the base-class implements the interface and the subclass benefit from it

627551
constructor	object
you could instead have a structure that contained all of the constants used and pass it into your object constructor

627551
value	field
normally that structure will be whatever value are necessary to run but when you re testing you would instead pass a structure with the field initialized to test parameters

627576
malloc	free
and this is done by using the standard functions malloc or derivatives and free

627576
malloc	free
it is a trade-off where you don t have to worry about free ing objects which is not a minor thing as simple examples might make you think but where gc_malloc here is more complex than a simple malloc and there s invisible code executing at that where temp goes out of scope

627580
z-index	overlay
previous versions of sifr allowed users to enter swmode transparent to avoid the common problem of flash objects being overlay on regular html objects on screen no matter the z-index of either elements

627585
value	field
however i want the value of this field to come from the user information which i d normally access using

627607
webforms	asp.net
please note that this is not asp.net mvc the view namespace directory is simply where all the webforms are kept

627613
ellipse	line
you can animate both the ellipse and the line together like so

627614
crystal-reports	birt
if you re writing a data-intensive application and require the ability to perform non-trivial reporting do you bypass your application and use something like birt or crystal-reports

627625
document	editing
i m working on a asp.net-mvc mvp gui for editing a document

627653
versioning	upgrade
my planned iphone application will work a remote http web service quite hard so until a user decides to upgrade from the free to pro versioning of my app i need to generate a trickle of click revenue per free user

627658
registration	login
you can write your own templates file as needed for eg if you need to alter the display of user registration form or login page you can create a tpl file for that and have to redirect the data to that tpl file

627660
filtering	grouping
as soon as you ve done a report users want another one or change the colour or optional grouping or more filtering or.

627663
constructor	object
you can however provide your own deleter object to perform delete if you wish using this constructor

627687
entity-framework	nhibernate
subsonic nhibernate entity-framework

627698
directory	folder
if you deploy the executable together with your project to the same folder you can use the environment class to get the working directory of your executable

627712
shadowbox	lightbox
i want to use a lightbox like shadowbox or similar inside a firefox extension

627714
value	field
if you go the custom field route - in your templates code you can save the value of the custom field to a variables and then echo it out to your image

627715
lookup	any
get order details 10 - lookup order 10 show the order and any extra information related to it

627721
python	perl
lott many differences between perl python

627721
python	perl
so here s my question which one should i try first -- perl || python

627721
python	perl
both perl and python have their own fans which is great

627729
common-lisp	lisp
also look on page 65 of on lisp for a common-lisp implementation of memoize

627734
object-reference	instances
exception-handling details system.nullreferenceexception-handling object-reference not set to an instances of an object

627742
arrays	map
by comparing the two arrays i can then determine if the user has added something new to the db and if not then i can just map them to the other file and not waste hard disk drive space

627749
ubuntu	linux
apparently most of the sifr demos i found fail to work with ff3 on ubuntu linux

627753
exception-handling	try-catch
this exception-handling leads my app to crash goes to main methods in debugging and could not be caught by try-catch

627763
arrays	loops
i think because genre is an arrays so i need to loops trough it to get a different value from genreid each time

627763
arrays	loops
when dbgenre is equal to action then store the genreid in an arrays1 and then loops the genre arrays to get the genreid for the next value and store it again in arrays1

627764
perl	php
honestly the majority of my programming has been in perl and php and i recently decided to do my latest project in python and i must admit it is very nice to program with

627764
python	php
at the end of the day though you can make good web applications with all 3 but if you are dead-set on dropping php to try something new i would recommend python and the django framework

627771
sql-server	oracle
see the sql navigator toad for oracle and or toad for sql-server

627772
selected	checkbox
i would like to show each available choice in domain and grouping with a checkbox that is selected unselected depending on the user properties

627790
perl	php
but coming from php i think perl is too similar and you won t actually get that much out of it

627790
haskell	lua
i d suggest something completely different haskell suggested by joel lisp lua javascript or c

627794
python	perl
i haven t worked with python much but i can tell why i didn t like about perl when i used it

627794
perl	php
oo in perl is very different from oo support in the other languages i ve used which include things like php java and c#

627801
object-reference	instances
i get an object-reference not set to an instances of an object error on line dim tb

627830
arrays	loops
you already know the length of the arrays so just code the loops using that value

627835
getter	setter
you may have to make a setter which will inform the outside of some of your internal details but there s no need to make a getter

627838
webforms	asp.net
under asp.net mvc are you supposed to pick up querystring params the same way you do in asp.net webforms

627846
versioning	upgrade
the deal was i had to dl the trial versioning and then do an upgrade

627846
installation	upgrade
the suggestion to use programs and features to amend the installation doesn t work as it does not give me the upgrade enter serial # option as described

627846
windows-vista	windows
this works in windows-vista but not on windows 7 -- so i m hoping someone here has solved this issue

627847
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you can always use request.querystring collection like webforms but you can also make asp.net-mvc handle them and pass them as parameters

627854
swing	awt
so my question is does anyone know of an interesting java gui library that is not swing or awt

627859
jface	swt
i think that swt jface come with eclipse but can supposedly be used standalone are well designed and more interesting to use learn

627866
administration	account
the back-end security is tied to their user account so we can t use generic account like user and administration

627878
udp	tcp
i was planning to try several types of encoding with tcp udp connection and measure the traffic and data loss

627896
chown	chmod
these mechanisms let users share files more easily by lessening the need to use chmod or chown to share new files

627896
mkdir	chmod
if commands like chmod and mkdir routinely cleared these bits on directory the mechanisms would be less convenient and it would be harder to share files

627909
host	root
unfortunately your server.xml will still have to contain the root host elements

627922
freebsd	linux
please be aware that this is a security risk and know what you are doing when you enable it in freebsd but i believe linux as well it requires special mount flag to be enabled and will change the way files in that directory behave

627951
display	width
you cannot determine the width of a column to be display on screen just from the sql data reader - after all the width of the column is heavily dependant on what screen font you re using what size bold or not and so forth

627951
font-size	display
what you need to do is render the text into your user-interface where you want to display it - there on the user-interface side of things you can measure the spaces needed to display a given text using a given font-size and font characteristics

627965
fwrite	fopen
i can t look at the code of the first solution since it is compiled into a .dll makes sense otherwise people can just edit the delay and not purchase it... and the second one seems only to use fopen to open the port and later fwrite to it for writing just like one would do to a stream

627972
python	ruby
i d like to follow oop structure... advocates for python or even more so if you re open ruby

627972
perl	ruby
on the other hand in terms of existing libraries the order is probably perl python ruby

627972
perl	ruby
in terms of your career perl on your resume is unlikely to make you stand out while python and ruby may catch the eye of a hiring manager

627972
python	perl
i think that python is quite likely to be a better choice for you than perl

627974
arrays	loops
first solution loops over arrays bind each value one at a time and execute the sql query for each value

627975
stderr	stdout
below sets stdout stdin stderr to use utf-8..

627987
authentication	impersonation
implement windows authentication and identity impersonation and setup the windows account with access to the sql-server box

628005
contains	elements
this declaration contains the basic elements id name and class

628041
contains	any
any other directory provided you define a link by creating a foo.link file inside the links directory of an eclipse installation you might have to create the directory contains

628043
associations	model
you need to complete your associations with the card model

628045
getter	setter
as noted by mauris javascript 1.5 does support getter and setter see also here - you can think of them as methods disguised as properties

628057
processor	affinity
so i tried to play with processor affinity via sysinternals process explorer and limit those pesky processes to 3 cores out of 4 and dedicate the 4th core to the third party webserver and it seems to work quite well

628076
processor	affinity
and beware processor affinity is inherited

628081
processor	affinity
as processor affinity on windows is a bitmask you may need some experimentation but i d assume 1 being the first core therefore 7 being the first three cores and f being all four

628084
processor	affinity
you can use the single-proc affinity application shim to force one processor on the executable level which will force the process onto one core

628087
any	set
ideally you need to buffer your data in your own memory buffers and only have a set number of overlapped sends pending at any one time

628141
contains	elements
for some reason it seems the add operation on a hashset is slower than the contains operation when the elements already exists in the hashset

628141
contains	elements
why is contains faster than add for already-existing elements

628143
handler	service
when accessing an application i ve written firebug shows that each call to a web service or http handler is attempted three times and the first two times show as 401 unauthorized even though they return the correct result

628157
getter	setter
your object needs to create a copy of the string in both the getter and the setter

628159
haskell	python
python is not a true functional language so it has less scope to do clever tricks with higher order functions than say haskell

628189
exception-handling	try-catch
in the try-catch block i parsing the error message and it is a unique key error i throw an instance of a custom error to the calling class if not i just throw the original exception-handling the the calling class

628192
python	java
does anybody know if python has an equivalent to java s sortedset interface

628204
getter	setter
there s no getter setter or operator-overloading in javascript yet so you really do need to write a function to set the price and get those fun side-effects

628212
arrays	map
2 abc will use as the key for map to insert name0 into an arrays list

628212
arrays	map
4 abc will use as the key for map to insert name1 into an arrays list

628212
arrays	map
map will return an arrays list which is containing name0 and name1

628220
ruby	php
for example why should i use python over ruby php over asp c# over java etc

628235
value	field
the field are populate with default value but in many cases the user will wish to enter their own

628235
value	field
when the page loads the value in the first field is selected so the user can either replace it by simply starting to type and tabbing out to the next field or simply leave it and tab out

628235
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome and firefox i believe but i don t have it here

628237
perl	php
if it is a web app then java c# php and maybe python but not perl cobol f# or lisp

628251
apache	squid
for proxy round-robin again several solutions are possible apache mod_rewrite apache mod_proxy squid and surely many others i don t know

628251
apache	squid
in your case i would consider running apache mod_proxy or squid if you want caching on linux if it is an option

628270
haskell	scheme
i think that functional declarative programming haskell scheme lisp etc is more powerful and more abstract than imperative programming and therefore is intrinsically harder to learn

628277
shell	bash
i don t know enough bash shell

628295
command-prompt	command-line
if you choose this option but then invoke git from a windows command-prompt all of the unix-y command-line utilities that git relies upon will not be found

628301
firefox	safari
i ve made a simple page to demonstrate the problem here firefox safari only

628301
specifications	w3c
i would also like to point out that this problem is a result of the w3c specifications not poor css3 support so any solution will still be relevant and useful when css3 has more widespread support

628306
javascript	dom
this solution while elegant still does not work for me b c first it only solves the javascript name clashed but not the dom id ones or css class names and second i also use javascriptonp for which i need to provide a callback function name which eventually needs to be in the global scope so it cannot be nested in the anonymous function scope

628315
command-line	cmd
you can do it from cmd-line using tf status cmd

628329
json	xml
i did test performance of pb with number of other data formats xml json default object serialization hessian one proprietary one and libraries jaxb fast infoset hand-written for data binding task both reading and writing but thrift s format s was not included

628329
value	field
there are indexes of course and value types but from what you have reverse-engineer back to field names if you want i personally would only choose it for specific use cases -- size-sensitive closely coupled system where interface format never or very very rarely changes

628334
python	perl
the ms scriptomatic tool can generate wmi scripts in python as well as vbscript jscript and perl

628351
web-services	security
go straight to wcf and pay no attention to asmx web-services which are the next best thing to obsolete - there will be few if any enhancements made to them and maybe only critical security fixes

628387
pascal	basic
i hate to say it but the best languages were probably the old basic and pascal

628387
void	main
it doesn t require the hardest java syntax such as public static void main and system.out.print --they are unnecessary because of the unique way it deals with objects

628421
constructor	object
that pattern is called raii you associate some useful action with the constructor and destructor of a locally allocated object

628428
contains	elements
the fact that float ing a parent elements will cause it to expand to contains all of its float ed children

628437
entity-framework	data-access
it s a fairly simple data-access application using the still-fairly-new entity-framework but i haven t been able to find a lot of guidance online for the best way to use these two technologies wpf and ef together

628437
filtering	sorting
i then map the observablecollection to a collectionviewsource so that i can get filtering sorting etc. without having to return to the database

628437
design-time	designer
the wpf designer that comes with vs is sort of vaguely helpful to see what your form is going to look like but even then well not really especially if you re using data templates that aren t binding to data that s available at design-time

628447
sql-server	mysql
we have a mysql database mostly read-only so myisam tables living in the data center that talks to a sql-server db living on-site

628447
sql-server	mysql
in the mysql db i have several thousand rows that i need to update from results in the sql-server database

628447
sql-server	mysql
this process will need to run every few minutes sooner the better and issuing dual connections to sql-server and mysql from ruby is just too slow

628447
innodb	myisam
it could be some write table locks issued by the myisam engine but converting to innodb doesn t seem to make it any faster the system is in test and so not easy to simulate the same sort of load that production would receive leading me to believe that it is not lock related

628448
livequery	.post
in addition if you do need to define the hooks before the .post takes place look at using livequery as it allows you to listen for any new elements that match your selector and bind them too

628455
ruby	php
for a web app i would choose php because i know it and there is a ton of documentation although i hear ruby is pretty good

628458
while-loop	loops
that means the output variable you create in the first while-loops does not exist after the loops

628458
while-loop	loops
you should define them outside the while-loops and then set the values inside the loops

628460
expression-blend	designer
my recommendations is if possible use expression-blend for designing your interface instead of code behind and instead of using the visual-studio designer it will save you lots of time

628470
operators	keyword
i ve never tried what you re doing here with a modelform before but you might be able to use the operators to expand your cleaned_data dictionary into the keyword arguments expected for your registration constructor

628470
constructor	object
the constructor to your model classes take keyword arguments that django s model meta class converts to instance-level attributes on the resulting object

628470
operators	keyword
the operators is a calling-convention that tells python to expand your dictionary into those keyword arguments

628472
content-length	content-type
what s very odd about this crash is this if i do not call sethttpbody with my nsdata object setvalue application json for content-type and setvalue requestdatalengthstring for content-length the crash does not happen

628496
numeric	zero
for numeric fields you d have to use your available sql dialect s function for converting null to zero

628500
margins	padding
textbox have margins borders padding by default which makes a 100 width textbox larger than its containers

628504
background-color	transparency
background-color transparency

628508
value	field
i have a form with a selected field and a div i wish to update with a value depending on what the user selecteds

628522
delegation	dealloc
the other thing about delegation is that they are not retained so you always have to set the delegate to nil in your myclass dealloc methods

628526
expression	evaluation
i also remember reading can t remember where that evaluation order isn t strictly defined so your code shouldn t depend or assume functions within an expression would be executed in a specific order by the end of a statement all referenced functions will have been called but the compiler has freedom in selected the most efficient order

628526
expression	evaluation
does the standard indicate the evaluation order of this expression

628533
conditional	operators
conditional operators is a sequence point

628533
expression	evaluation
in the evaluation of each of the expression

628533
expression	evaluation
using the built-in meaning of the operators in these expressions 5.14 5.15 5.16 5.18 there is a sequence point after the evaluation of the first expression

628554
expression	evaluation
in the evaluation of the following expression

628554
expression	evaluation
using the built-in meaning of the operators in these expressions there is a sequence point after the evaluation of the first expression 12

628559
selected	button
if a secondary sort key is desired the user clicks the more button and another dropdown list is inserted and opened for the user to selected the second key

628565
object-reference	instances
i only deployed the pdb file for the class library-project that is generating the object-reference not set to an instances of an object error

628567
specifications	w3c
w3c s specifications

628570
spring	jsf
our system is build using jsf and spring for the presentation layer the back end is ejb spring and hibernate all running on websphere 6.1

628585
spring	jsf
if you follow the spring idiom it should be a relatively simple matter of replacing jsf with jstl-based jsps and spring controllers

628610
selected	button
if all windowss options donâ t fit on a single home windows then show only selected common windowss for each category on the home windows and provide a button or link to show an exhaustive list

628613
.when	ready
waitforinputidle will return approximately but usually close enough .when botulsim.exe is ready for user integration

628617
linux	unix
is there a compact way to do it in linux unix

628622
knapsack-problem	np-hard
also the knapsack-problem which is np-hard show up fairly frequently

628624
bash	zsh
the following works in at least bash and zsh

628630
spacing	layout
in the end i did end up placing spacing html - in code - between my controls in order to make the layout work and have never regretted it

628652
rtsp	rtp
but for video audio i suggest looking here and i would guess rtsp and rtp can be used

628657
double-quotes	single-quotes
is there any difference between the use of double-quotes to single-quotes in python

628662
shell	bash
is this possible in the standard bash shell

628666
value	field
is there any way to get value of private static field from known class using reflection

628672
synonym	term
i also used the â œtraceâ term in a more conservative sense â a list of function-calls is actually a trace so func_call and trace sound as synonym to me

628674
silverlight	wpf
how do i filter out the silverlight documentation when i m developing wpf application in vs2008

628674
silverlight	wpf
i d prefer not to remove the documentation for silverlight altogether since i will need it in the future but some way to choose between wpf and silverlight help would be great

628675
order-of-evaluation	operators
for the operators and operators || for pod types the evaluation order is left to right otherwise short cutting would be hard - but for overloaded operatorss that you define these are basically syntactic sugar to defining a methods and thus the order-of-evaluation of the parameters is undefined

628678
integer	digits
mysql 15 5 15 digits 10 integer 15-5 5 decimal

628682
continuous-integration	teamcity
the only change you should do to your source versioning system is to integrate it with the continuous-integration system like teamcity or cruisecontrol.net

628684
binaries	install
there are tons of ways to do this one of which is to download binaries from adobe and install them on your server

628708
subclass	nsobject
i call it connectioncenter subclass of nsobject and add the following codes to it

628735
selected	textbox
if i have a databound form how do i know if a user has modified it either by typing text into a textbox or by selected an item in a combobox

628735
textchanged	textbox
i ve tried hooking into my textbox s textchanged event but the problem is that when my form participates in databinding the textchanged event fires prematurely marking my form as dirty.

628739
folder	dir
what i would like is to not only have all the binaries dropped in the bin dir but also have each executable program have it s own deployed folder similar to what each website gets

628746
ruby	php
this applies to ruby php asp.net and asp.net mvc - it applies to all languages as it is the html 2.0 spec that limits the httpfileupload data you can obtain on a form post

628746
rad-controls	telerik
one of the easiest i ve seen is rad-controls by telerik

628746
httphandler	httpmodule
what these controls do us they install an httpmodule httphandler and special javascript

628746
webforms	asp.net
the problem with these 3rd party tools is that they only work under asp.net webforms - the standard asp.net

628746
webforms	asp.net
asp.net mvc removes the entire asp.net webforms concept - therefore rendering these controls useless

628747
linked-list	hashmap
2 that is the downside of linked-list you might as well use hashmap or other data structures

628756
directory	folder
let s say that i m in foo folder and here is how the directory are organized

628785
getter-setter	getter
getter-setter creation type â œgetâ ctrl-space choose a getter to create

628799
dependency-injection	inject
my answer would be that 1 this is probably going to be hard with static-methods and 2 you ll probably need to use dependency-injection and inject the mock timers etc

628817
children	nodes
the way you would do this is by placing a letter in each nodes so you first check for the nodes a then you check a s children for p and it s children for p and then l and then e

628844
tuples	any
i have a mysql table with multiple fields and i d like to find any entries that duplicates a tuples

628846
margins	padding
actually it s because css defines 100 relative to the entire width of the containers including its margins borders and padding

628846
margins	padding
to its contents is some amount smaller than 100 unless the containers has no margins borders or padding

628846
margins	padding
it effectively means that dimensions are no good for anything other than a top level containers and even then only if it has no margins borders or padding

628846
margins	padding
note that the text field s margins borders and padding are include in the css size specified for it - it s the containers s which throw things off

628859
order	add
what i did was add an start event and stop event for each item to a list sort the list by time point and then process it in order

628873
vbulletin	phpbb
but if you need a way to capture user issues i d try using something like a dedicated forum topic in vbulletin or phpbb or similar

628892
indexof	equals
if you need to find an object with indexof you could override the equals methods for your object in my case application so if in equals i declared that and application its equals to and other app if the field name is the same then

628894
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the menu works fine

628896
bug-tracking	fogbugz
we use fogbugz as our bug-tracking software and have made a submit error dialog that allows the user to send a message along with the stack-trace

628899
contains	sorted
at the end resultranges should have the results you re looking for unusedranges and rangesinuse should be empty beginningboundary should be nil and usedranges should contains what unusedranges used to contains but sorted by range.end

628904
children	nodes
you color a nodes black once you ve finished processing its children

628905
selected	listbox
for example let s say i have a list of authors databound to a list and when i selected an author it populates another listbox with books from that author

628935
content-length	content-type
however if i post to the .asmx page setting the soapaction content-type content-length and httpbody i just keep getting didreceiveauthenticationchallenge messages

628935
ntlm	iwa
additionally i m trying to post to iis using integrated windows-authentication iwa which means i m trying to negotiate an ntlm challenge

628937
reflection.emit	dynamicmethod
there is also the dynamicmethod stuff which allows you to define bits of il using reflection.emit and compile them as delegates

628947
python	perl
in my opinion perl is faster on the draw at the command line than python is

628967
contains	elements
if it helps here is the code i m using to get the list item s index relative to it s contains ul elements

628972
web-services	api
if your applications are not that closely related perhaps they should be sharing the same database as a means to exchange data or using an api based on web-services to exchange information

628978
data-structures	tree
tree and arrays are very different data-structures and require different methods to traverse

628987
web-services	api
if your applications are not that closely related perhaps they should be sharing the same database as a means to exchange data or using an api based on web-services to exchange information

628995
highlight	selected
whenever i selected an item in the listview it highlight with the color blue so it is not possible to view what is selecteded

629006
constructor	object
so - for simple classes value object etc. constructor is just fine you don t want to overengineer your application but for complex class hierarchies factory method is a preferred way

629015
click	mouse
getitemat x y will only work if the mouse was click on actual text that belongs to an item

629029
any	set
if you have a class with some plain get set properties is there any reason to use the getters within the class methods or should you just use the private member variables

629036
conditional	operators
is there a conditional ternary operators in vb.net

629036
conditional	operators
and conditional ternary operators in vb.net as in c#

629037
compatibility	platform
to ensure complete compatibility of the application with different versioning of the base platform

629059
selected	button
other options include disabling scrolling in the list view placing the listview inside a stackpanel along with your selected all and then placing that stack panel in a scrollviewer or just putting a button in the user-interface

629068
hide	show
i simply hide the flash and show it again when dialog is dismissed

629074
deployment	install
if you can build apps with the development certificate but not the deployment one check to make sure that everything s properly install in the keychain and that the correct provisioning profiling is selected in the settings for the active target

629136
command-line	cmd
the pear cmd is a cmd-line cmd

629136
shell	bash
your shell application terminal likely bash in you re on os x has the pear directory in its include path

629136
shell	bash
finally and this is what i think your problem is we need to ensure that the pear command line command is in your shell bash path

629137
contains	elements
disregarding your disabled selected box issue for a moment even though you use the for ... syntax on your labels i don t think it s valid to have multiple form elements contains within a single label tag

629141
64bit	x86
i am using vs 2005 64bit x86 machine

629147
wordpress	blogs
i m an administrator of 10-20 separate wordpress blogs and it s a big pain for me to login to all of them separately

629158
element	dynamic
my code is meant to replace radio button with dynamic ones and allow clicking both the label and new dynamic radio element to toggle the state of the hidden with css radio box

629164
32-bit	64bit
gcc makes a 4 byte struct in either case on both a 32-bit and a 64bit machine under linux

629170
perl	php
the content is in html and programming experience in perl php

629171
paster	pylons
it has the tools for testing and deployment in 1.x series but now transformed to paster equivalents in 2.0 series which shoud seem familiar if you ve expermiented with pylons

629171
turbogears	pylons
the pylons admin interface is very similar to turbogears

629171
paster	pylons
paster create -t pylons helloworld

629173
webserver	host
is your webserver setup to host asp.net

629177
constructor	object
use a factory only when you need extra control with object creation in a way that couldn t be done with constructor

629179
linux	osx
linux and maybe mac osx linux smaps

629189
double	int
that is if it s a double i don t want to return an int

629198
getter	setter
it s not a performance issue either as the getter or setter will be inlined by the compiler if it s simple enough

629199
put	get
where should i put a url to get it to appear in the version information in windows

629213
element	dynamic
to use a dynamic arrays with the move procedure you need to pass the first element of the arrays

629216
protected	public
when providing only static factory methods classes without public or protected constructor cannot be subclassed

629219
command-prompt	cmd
3 open a command-prompt start run cmd and execute the batch file

629228
perl	php
the content is in html and programming experience in perl php

629236
boost	stl
i used a queue from the stl and threads condition variables and mutexes from the boost library

629247
double	int
i have also seen implementations where a value class was used to store results of calculations results that could represent either a string double int or boolean

629247
double	int
but the problem was that client code had to check a value.type property of an enum string int double boolean and then either cast the value.value property which was exposed externally by the value class as an object type or use the specific valuestring valuedouble valueint valueboolean getters

629255
double	int
why not just use string double and int

629256
daemons	systemd
in this case i would write a daemons run by a systemd user that accepted socket connections and relayed them to the appropriate device then use sockets within the web application to talk to the daemons

629256
.when	ready
this also helps keep the web app from blocking .when opening a device that isn t quite ready to deal with users settle locks a little more sanely than you could with cgi etc

629266
order	add
order is reordered if you add new calculated tags it specifies the order of the calculation for these tags.

629290
freebsd	linux
an example of setting up user authentication with ldap on linux and freebsd is on my blog in french comptes unix stockã s sur ldap

629301
windows-mobile	symbian
j2me apps are inevitably compared with native applications iphone windows-mobile symbian

629307

i have not used oracle and mysql only for small datasets so i can t compare performance

630670
account	userid
problem is when you define a schtask you must specify the userid and password of the account to run the job

the whole point of virtualization support in 64bit systems is to make 32-bit processes believe they are living in a 32-bit os.

630796
32-bit	64bit
the technique relies on the fact that .net s any cpu executable will run as 64bit process even when invoked from a 32-bit process

630796
32-bit	64bit
it runs csc 32-bit but it doesn t matter - and then runs result of csc compiler passing one argument full path to visibility.ps1 this is the commandlet we want to run in 64bit powershell

you would then reflect on the static field of the type of the enum in this case grouptypes and get the descriptionattribute for the value you were looking for using reflection

630826
arrays	loops
the implementation is very similar to yours except it hoists the arrays length out of the loops

630871
constructor	object
to add to vartec s post since it appears from your design and use of the factory pattern the scheduler subclass properties are only read after the objects are created you may want to make each scheduler immutable by allowing the properties to only be set at the time the object is created in the constructor

630907

selection	cell
currently i am simply resetting the datasource but that causes a problem - it interrupts any ongoing edits in the gridview and makes the selection jump to the top-left cell

631113
administration	account
on all tests i have used the administration account

631114
space	input
the values in the div depend on how large the border is on the input and how much space you want between the input and the border

631131
order	add
you could add the fields to the specific table creating a wide table that had values in it that not all clients utilized or you could create a tall table that listed a column-name and value so as to make it appear that you are append on columns to a specific object for instance wanting a home phone number on the order table when there only exists a work phone number

631135
derived-class	subclassing
in c++ the type changes during construction so that methods cannot be called from a constructor to derived-class subclassing methods

631149
arrays	loops
loops is the one that allows the jit to safely remove arrays bounds checks whether the index is within 0..length-1

631149
for-loop	arrays
the foreach loop over arrays is equivalent to that standard for-loop over arrays

631154

631165
checkstyle	ant
there s a checkstyle ant task defined in the checkstyle jar file

631186
account	api

631198
pascal	delphi
remember pascal delphi

631202
for-loop	arrays
would it be better to use a much smaller number of regular expressions up to about 10 to select many more entries into an arrays and then use a for-loop and some simple if statements to filter out the data i m not interested in

631261
any	set
you call it like any other function expression like a above using the second set of parens

631263
ado	jet
if you re using ado you re not really using access but jet the underlying database

631299
protected	public
however the standard makes no guarantees about the layout of struct -- even pod struct -- other than that the address of a later member will be greater than the address of an earlier member provided there are no access specifiers private protected or public between them

631305
constructor	private
this instruction is used when the target is known at compile time like a constructor or a private method

631341
hosts-file	hosts
i needed to use the same server name in the hosts

631341
hosts-file	hosts
since windows looks in the hosts first the ip-address on the private network will be used but the publisher will still see the correct name

631355
emacs	vim
there are various ides if that s your poison available on unix starting with the ubiquitous eclipse to things like sunstudio if you re on sun and of course all the integration tools that allow you to use the more powerful unix editors like emacs or vim

631355
solaris	linux
if your server connection is slow flaky expensive etc and you d rather develop on your desktop why not stick a vm with a linux version or if you re developing for solaris one of the opensolaris or solaris 11 developer preview builds into a vm on your machine and work on that one

631366
convention	standards
what is the correct way to dynamically change the view the view aspx that a controllers methods uses versus using the standards naming convention

631374
revision	svn
if you use subversion you can also use subwcrev.exe from tortoisesvn to update the version number to include the svn revision number

631396
silverlight	wpf
i would like to rewrite the ui using wpf and maybe even create a silverlight version on the web

631396
silverlight	wpf
i am sure i could learn xaml wpf and silverlight

631410
required	checked
should able to checked required and optional-parameters

631410
required	checked
command-line parsing is quite good i really like the design of it but there is no documentation no new updates and i couldn t figure out to do certain stuff such as how to checked for required parameters

631422
contains	any
for example you can use tcl which supports the ability to create a single file executable that containss both the application code and a virtual filesystems that can contains any other files needed by the application

631427
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
essentially the touchesbegan and touchesmoved should be passed on to the main view when touching the uibarbuttonitem but also should send the button press action

631427
touch	drag
the drag exit calls the touch up inside section to set the control then calls the touches began section to start the main area touching operation

631431
vmware	esx
also vmware esx implements cdp

631475
contains	set
an ascii file can not contains the character 0x97 as the ascii character set only ranges from 0x00 to 0x7f

631481
command-line	cmd
my personal favourite 3rd party cmd-line parsing library is cmd line parsing and i assume this is the one you are referring to

631486
hide	show
at the gwt level the javascript is changing the style.display attributes to hide and show the contents of the tabs

631486
restart	reload
it appears that the flash component include in the page by scripting an embed tag is reload restart each time that it is made visible

631486
restart	reload
how can i prevent it from restart reload

631487
python	php
python dictionaries also work much like associative arrays in php if you have any experience in that language

631496
benchmarking	profiling
if speed is an issue you may want to benchmarking the various methods but i suspect they would all have quite similar performance profiling

631508
compression	streaming
as native code is used to implement the decompression compression algorithm be very careful to close the streaming and not just the underlying streaming after use

631508
compression	streaming
zipinputstreaming deals with archives of files which is a completely different thing from compression a streaming

631510
silverlight	wpf
in a typical wpf or silverlight development there are 3 major development processes involved based on the skill set needed

631510
fireworks	photoshop
photoshop illustrator fireworks expression design skills

631510
silverlight	wpf
note if you are targeting both silverlight and wpf it is good you make async webservices and let both wpf and sl consume that as the data layer

631515
temporary	copy
++iter returns a reference to itself so there is no temporary copy needed

631515
temporary	copy
iter++ returns a temporary copy of the variablesiables create temp variables with old value increment return temp variables

631528
post-increment	pre-increment
pre-increment is in general better provided you don t have a specific need for post-increment

631532
primitive	int
they are only the same when you are dealing with primitive int char etc.

631542
any	set
is there any way i access profiling information set in one sub-domain across another sub-domain

631552
.when	ready
but why not install the visual basic express edition of vs2008 so you can learn about linq now and be ready to use it .when the rest of the company is happy to buy the full versioning

631568
directory	folder
the output folder can be changed by going into project properties but by default they are bin debugging and bin release under the project root directory containing the .csproj or .vbproj file

631568
contains	any
also note that there is an obj directory in the same parent directory of bin - this stores temporary files used during the build-process it contains your compiled exe dll without any dependencies for example

631580
radio	click
if i fill popup menu with radio items they do not change state when click

631589
constructor	object
what i want to do next is to save this new image much smaller so i used the bitmap constructor that takes a source image object and a height and width then saved that

631593
.when	ready
for changes to a database any of us developers can make the change in the development-environment and then pass along the scripting to a dba to be done .when it is ready for production

631618
data-members	instances
you need an instances to the object in order to call a non-static member function or access a non-static data-members

631624
repository	entity
so i have a repository for basically each entity but my model has a relational-division where entities aren t directly related in the model

631625
any	set
here is the rule if the score for any outcome_id is -x and that is the minimum score for the set add x to all scores in order to zero-out the minimum score

631629
g++	gcc
but actually looking in math.h it isn t there and gcc cannot compile the following test program while g++ can

631629
g++	gcc
what does g++ pull in that gcc doesn t

631629
g++	gcc
so g++ must be grabbing different headers than gcc but which ones

631632
double	int
the problem boils down to the following simplification i have an image only 1d were the pixel values may be int float or double

631643
highlight	selected
master pages has tab like navigation options and when they click on a certain naviagtion option i will enable the sitenavigation control and highlight the selected tab in master pages

631652
local-variables	class-variables
local-variables have no problems with thread safety as long as they don t access or mutate instance or class-variables

631657
double	int
to use void as a container for int float double you must allocate it arrays is genericarrays of your old type - with void storage

631662
void-pointers	dereference
that s because you can t dereference a void-pointers without first casting it to something else

631671
external	host
is there a way to reference an external link in an html javascript file that would let you specify a fallback location for that file if it is unavailable in the first external host

631700
export	csv
a bit of background i have a java program which export it s data to csv files so they can be read into a thrid-party application

631702
repository	entity
a repository for every entity is probably not a good idea

631706
firefox	opera
it is specific to firefox and opera 9.0+

631712
drawimage	draw
use the drawimage methods to draw the image onto the new bitmap

631717
linux	unix
on other linux unix based systems use getenv

631730

go and put this in a .html file on your pc and open it in a browser if its ie7 you ll get security warning just allow it this won t happen when launched from a url

631758
.net	wcf
i have written a .net wcf client for geonames available here

631773
installation	upgrade
i m running intellij-idea 8.0.1 and would like to upgrade my grails installation to grails 1.1 which was released today march 10 2009

631791
instances	destroy
for another instances what if you have an object that has a manager or itself that may destroy it or may decline to destroy it depending on other conditional in the program such as a database connection being open or a file being written

631820
put	get
i d like to be able to get all of the files in the grouping at once and put them in a directory

631827
g++	gcc
according to my tests g++ does include libm automatically but gcc doesn t

631852
constructor	object
the xml-serialization in .net allows polymorphic object through the parameter of the xmlserializer constructor

631852
xml-serialization	ixmlserializable
it also allows customization of xml-serialization for types that implement ixmlserializable

631884
linux	osx
the above works fine in linux and osx but on windows it will encode the first few characters then cut short

631891
document	element
an alternative is to set innerhtml on a standalone div not attached to the document then append its childnodes one-by-one to the element where you really want it

631914
protected	public
they are a sleight of hand of making static-methodss look like they are defined within a class -- as long as they don t access private protected stuff they only can access public methodss like any other methods you can get away with them

631920
google-chrome	firefox
you can actually see the image works fine in safari firefox google-chrome and opera

631957
input-devices	keyboard
the glutkeyboardfunc and glutspecialfunc combined with glutgetmodifiers could be sufficient for cross-platform keyboard code and glut can even be used for other input-devices

631969
shared-objects	.so
this is the first time i try to compile this project .so i never sucessfully compiled before and i have little experience with c++ dlls although i do know standalone c++ and created linux c shared-objects before

631972
directory	folder
from the directory containing the two new folder i ran

631975
directory	folder
i d look up a little higher in the directory structure the one that the solution is in and see if your debugging release folder with the dll are there

631975
directory	folder
i think the default is to put the actual dlls in folder in the solution directory not the project directory i think the assumption is that you want all the dlls that you build for a solution to go to the same place

632007
web-services	security
i m looking at doing some security testing on web-services

632037
protected	public
public protected

632045
triggers	insert
i would create a triggers that executed on insert and update would verify using a selected statement that the values were unique in the two columns when transposed and when not transposed

632046
python	php
apache php mysql python django

632046
python	php
please give me some steps with mamp or not to get a nicely working environment for apache php mysql python and django

632063
git-repo	repo
the -r option sets the name of the svn repo inside of the git-repo it s the name we use with git when refering to the svn repository project

632065
panels	grid
what about some ajax code on that button to retrieve details - leave the underlying grid in place and display details in a div panels or a new windows tab

632074
textbox	button
however if i type a non-existent filename for example c a.jpg which does not exist on my computer into the fileupload s textbox and click the sumbit button hasfile still returns true

632075
websphere	ibm
is this an ibm websphere page

632105
contains	elements
this code applies a rule to all th elementss which are contains by a div elements with a class named test in addition to all td elementss and all caption elementss

632105
contains	elements
it is not the same as all td th and caption elementss which are contains by a div elements with a class of test

632123
silverlight	wpf
edit the reason i m doing this is in the next couple months we are converting this wpf application to silverlight which requires async calls

632151
directory	folder
as above and noldrin says the default directory is the bin directory under the project folder but it can also be set by right clicking on the project in the vs explorer selected properties and then when the project properties panel appears under compile you should have bin release which defaults to the bin directory under the project saved directory you can change it to c bin and the output will be stored in the bin directory in the root

632185
pixels	line
the world file is just 6 line of text and you already know everything needed x y pixels size coordinate of your upper left corner

632185
pixels	line
you d make an image that was the appropriate number of pixels then a world file that had the following 6 line

632208
synchronous	.when
i am perhaps a bit puzzled as to why you need to use asynchronous wcf operations .when you need things to be synchronous inside the loop

632240
png	gif
well the bufferedimage doesn t know that it s being written as a jpeg - as far as it s concerned it could be png or gif or tga or tiff or bmp.

632268
decrement	increment
you could possibly put a windows count into the session and increment it on windows.onload and decrement it on windows.onunload

632271
google-chrome	firefox
we tested the site fairly rigorously in ie6 7 8 firefox safari opera and google-chrome

632274
webserver	upload
this is not about your actual question but you should validate any user input especially if you want users to upload files to a virtual folder on your webserver

632292
selected	button
on top of this i would like to selected both united states of america and united kingdom by clicking on a link or button available directly on the narrowed down searh result next to united states of america and united kingdom

632332
value	field
i m working on a table design that could involve many null value in about 10 field maybe 75 of the time the field would be unused

632336
versioning	upgrade
you may well have to upgrade vs versioning

632337
persistence	hibernate
in fact i use java persistence with hibernate as a reference

632350
value	field
that way you can avoid having to do checks for value field 0 and check for null separately field is null or is not null

632364
python	tcl
vera++ based on user defined rules written in tcl python or lua

632369
double	int
defining the inputs and outputs as double lets you take advantage of type promotion so this function will also work for int

632371
dependency-injection	inject
extract your dependency out of your classes and use dependency-injection to inject the data in

632388
contains	elements
when a new elements is added i check whether the new field contains a value is not then i update the new field with the id of the logged in user

632414
aes	des
agreed -- des is largely outdated so unless there is a good reason to use it go with aes

632431
handler	service
if you want to make your own handler or even use an aspx page to deliver the doc you are fine but the standard asmx web service methods of doing this is to actually return the bits of the document as an encoded blob

632434
selected	textbox
specifically a few textbox that could have a value or have an empty string and a few drop down lists that could have had a value selected or maybe not.

632436
globalization	localization
if you want to research msdn has some good articles on globalization localization

632445
font-size	width
specifically i d like to determine the display height of each string given uniform formatting same font-size weight etc. and the maximum width the string may occupy

632453
netbsd	linux
i don t know if this will help but i use a mac these days but i used to use netbsd and linux at uni

632471
firefox	safari
ie and firefox safari seem to deal differently with base href and javascript window.location type requests

632473
google-chrome	firefox
generally speaking i target the top 4 browsers ie-7 ie-8 firefox google-chrome safari

632481
getter	setter
a good parallels would be having a public variables instead of setter getter

632481
getter	setter
the setter getter allows you to change your underlying implementation without effecting the outside world

632525
primitive	int
i assume the data comes as primitive int which seems sane

632537
default-value	default
that will set the selected list to the default-value and remove all of the list items related to the last displayed category and get the ul ready for the new li s to be displayed from the default

632559
.net	wcf
i have a .net wcf service that will need to handle multiple client requests at once

632563
.net	wcf
you may use .net remoting .net 2.0 or wcf .net 3.5 to communicate between programs on the same or different computers

632567
document	element
javax.xml.transform.transformerexception org.xml.sax.saxparseexception the markup in the document following the root element must be well-formed.

632569
mediawiki	trac
so i can recommend to use trac with integration with svn and mediawiki

632573
.net	wcf
.net remoting and wcf as well as your own custom socket protocols

632583
getter	setter
so the question is should you use getter setter or directly send the object as an arguments to the methods - in order for the methods to work properly

632583
constructor	object
or should you set object via the constructor if they are really crucial to the class operating correctly

632605
constructor	object
if it doesn t make sense to have an instance of this class without a certain object eg it might make no sense to construct a data-access class without a connection to a database then it s a dependency and should be part of the constructor

632608
rewrite	rule
which the above rewrite rule changes to

632617
revision	updates
apply any patches from one revision to another including any possible model updates and new fixtures without re-loading the entire database

632628
contains	any
then you can have a loop that blocks your methods from returning while the collection contains the key with optional logic for adding a timeout or any other additional ways where you might want the methods to be able to return and not be blocked forever

632643
constructor	object
this is also something that can be quantified easily by looking at parameters for various methods as well as having coding standards to prevent bypassing things here all the object s methods besides the constructor take 0 parameters and thus have no boundary tests

632654
project-management	project
project-management ensures engineers stick to those features for fear that the project will exceed the time allocated.

632657
firefox	safari
ie and firefox safari seem to deal differently with base href and javascript window.location type requests

632657
document	element
ie enforces base-href only at the point a document element is interacted-with

632663
.when	ready
you table could list all of your client databases and have a flag to mark .when you are ready to move them

632669
widget	button
i would like to triggers a click on the browse button on a hidden fileupload widget

632700
hash	md5
take all params of the call a timestamp + - 5 min wiggle a shared secret and hash it using sha-1 or md5 sha-1 better

632703
contains	elements
transformer requires a full document as input because xslt works on full documents and would be confused by something that contains zero or more-than-one root elements

632703
document	element
the usual trick is to create a single root element by wrapping the document in start and end tags but this does mean you can t have an xml-declaration as mentioned by eddie

632708
constructor	object
as i m trying to shove only 400 x 170 s worth of data into a 400 x 171 bitmap object s constructor it s getting rather upset and causing a v exceptions

632713
listbox	textbox
so my question is how do i get hold of the textbox and how do i update the listbox

632729
show	next
this works so the next time i try to merge from the trunk into a branch it show no new changes

632737
animation	rotation
guess you ll have to use a uiview animation block with a 3d rotation transform of 90 degrees have the core animation delegate call you when that s done swap the view with the new one 3d rotated on the other side and chain with the last 90 degrees for the new view.

632753
click	mouse
this runs in onmousedown so when you release the mouse and the click is handled you magically get sent to that new href

632755
java-3d	jogl
cruachan no java-3d for me i m sticking with jogl

632768
design-principles	principles
the article aspect-oriented design-principles lessons from object-oriented design pdf gives some ideas of how solid and other oop principles can be applied to aop

632769
display	height
i ve had luck cloning the element moving it offscreen then display it to get the client height

632769
display	height
either way the element must not be set to display none in order to measure it s height

632769
margins	padding
edit 2 also worth noting that after jquery gathers the height it adds allowances for padding margins and border sizes so you may need to as well

632781
put	get
on my content pages i use different usercontrols that require the use of many of the functions within the validation.js file however if i dont put the tag and the javascript functions within a contentholder on the contentpage the usercontrols do not see these functions and i get errors like onnamevalidation is not defined

632793
perl	php
it ll be easy for me to create perl php files on the server which the java flash code contacts to update the player position actions etc

632793
perl	php
as long as each server ran the core perl php files for updating the database it should work fine

632793
perl	php
any thoughts regarding the server architecture os database choice and whether my method of using perl php python scripts for server-side programing is a good one will be appreciated

632797
lightbox	jquery
slibox2 - ultimate lightbox clone for jquery very easy to use

632798
listbox	textbox
it would then have properties that would represent each control in the item - the text in the textbox and the items in the listbox a list of tasks i think based on your click handler

632804
forwarding	port
you d need to forwarding a port to that first machine

632830
perl	php
i cannot for the life of me see any convincing reason to do this and perl or php

632831
getter	setter
however don t these simple getter setter always get in-lined by the jit

632831
inlining	inline
edit 2 so i created another struct that used explicit getx methods o how i don t miss my java days at all and that performed the same whether i disabled inlining on it through or not so conclusion non-static methods are apparently never inline not even on struct

632843
document	element
consider an element that has been created and filled with a bunch of text but not yet added to the document tree

632850
compact-framework	.net
xna has to target the xbox 360 and the jit in the .net compact-framework isn t as sophisticated as its desktop counterpart

632851
shutdown	restart
i thought a solution would be to cancel the logoff shutdown restart and resume it when the user answered to the file save dialog

632856
value	field
i d like to do something like below particularly the f.eval field part such that it evaluates the value of the variables as the field name

632868
any	set
if you set the first element to zero or any value then you have done exactly that and nothing more

632921
rewrite	rule
no longer works since the disallow rule is triggers after the rewrite to

632945
keyboard	mouse
although it should be noted that computers can gather entropy from the environment connected to it like keyboard and mouse actions what aids in generating random numbers either directly or by seeding a prng

632965
children	nodes
one alternative is to use the universal selector to make a more specific rule which will take effect if the nodes aren t direct children

632972
required	checked
last i checked this required you to build your own viewengine

632973
instances	private
com makes the destructor private and provides an interface for deleting the instances

632975
json	xml
also both have bit less tool support than standard formats like xml and maybe even json

632975
json	xml
edit here s an interesting comparison that tackles both size performance differences and includes numbers for some other formats xml json as well

632979
uibutton	uitouch
your uibutton has a responder controller that receives the uitouch events my guess is that once it has preformed its interpretation of the message it returns - the touch has been handled and disposed of

632997
internet-explorer	firefox
i tested this in internet-explorer 7 and firefox 3.0

633010
udp	tcp
if not you can use cfnetwork framework to use sockets tcp udp to allow your app and server to communicate

633010
stream	send
so in your example you could send the information over the socket to your server and then you could define a callback that would listen for incoming data on the stream and then updates your app accordingly

633056
put	get
trying to get the user to put 3 numbers in 3 textbox and get the average

633057
abstract-class	superclass
in procedural programming a unit may be an individual program function procedure etc. while in object-oriented programming the smallest unit is a methods which may belong to a base superclass abstract-class or derived child class

633067
double	int
try changing the type of average from int to double

633087
type-conversion	int
and i m not sure if i m right about this maybe someone will enlighten me but does .net consider type-conversion from string to int differently in these two cases

633097
postback	ajax
when it completes and the browser detects this via ajax have the browser do a real postback or get by changing location.href pick up the saved data and generate the page

633111
value	field
the 2 field has the advantage of being some what faster i think because mysql doesn t have to convert the value from a date to an integer although this is probably negligible

633113
value	field
if you re talking about data value for your field then the best way is to use mysql_real_escape_string

633568
user-interface	look-and-feel
if you can convince them that in order to feel native the program s user-interface has to look-and-feel very differently on windows and osx because of different design guides philosophies whatever they should understand that even with wx you would still have to implement it twice to accommodate those different requirements so you might just as well use the real thing the native api

every browser has potentially different margins padding font-size defaults

634123
margins	padding
should hopefully start you off with all block elements having no margins or padding and then you can rather add margins and padding back in where you need it

if you have traditional controls that render markup and use the asp.net webforms model for posting data consider modifying the controls to be scriptcontrols which allows you to handle loading data etc

634282
postback	ajax
with data from your codebehind during load and then instead of doing postback have your javascript communicate with a web service using ajax

634290
for-loop	arrays
usually you won t have large number of functions in class rather than using map you can create simple struct arrays and use a for-loop

634290
arrays	map
if the number of functions are small there won t be any big performance difference in map and arrays

634296
any	set
the hyperlinkevent that is triggers when i mouse over the link hands me the html element but it won t let me set any style attributes on it and i can t figure out how to get the elements that do have settable attributes

634406
aquamacs	emacs
also you ll find that a lot of the recent ports of emacs to other platforms like carbon emacs aquamacs or emacsw32 are all based on gnu emacs

634414
selected	button
i d think that if you were to set the commandname of the selector button in the first listview to select - from the second list view s itemcommand event you should be able to alter either the selecteditemtemplate or the current item for the selected item in the first list

634424
select	union
the fix was a further â 60k which was a validate func that was only checking for union select having et al key words

macports	fink
it s just another nix style system so all the tools you are familiar with will already exist and if they don t just use fink or macports to get them yourself

634451
carbon	cocoa
also if you really wanted to use c++ for developing gui os x apps you could always use carbon instead of cocoa

634480
carbon	cocoa
cocoa is better faster and simpler than carbon

634480
carbon	cocoa
iphone dev is exclusively cocoa carbon is not supported

634493

that s why most dependency injectors allow you to configure them in app-config web-config some other external configuration file

634522
forwarding	port
the service is fronted by bigip which handles ssl encryption and decryption and forwarding the unencrypted request to servera at the moment it does not actually do any load balancing but that is likely to be added in the future on a specific port

http	ssl
now on top of the http https problem we have an issue as the wsdl contains the port number in all the urls where bigip works on port 443 for the ssl

ubuntu	debian
for debian systems ubuntu included the correct way is to make an init script in etc init.d based on the skeleton file in that directory

634536
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
if you had said you could checkout but not commit add modify delete and verified that authentication is ok then i d say check your working copy url server name there is a tricky issue with path-based authentication where checkout is case-insensitive for server name but commit is case-sensitive

634653
attributes	properties
place a typeconverter attributes on each properties too

634655
constructor	object
the container should in theory be able to give you a complete object graph in any given circumstance so you should never have to pass parameters in and making your objects dependent on constructor parameters other than injectable object dependencies which the container will resolve for you is seen as bad design

634665
value	field
in my asp.net-mvc ontroller i accept a bunch of form field value and from those create a string the lucene library understands

634672
tostring	indexof
these include all built-in methodss of objects such as string s indexof methods or object s tostring methods

634790
carbon	cocoa
don t expect carbon applications to look 100 native and it s much more complicated for programming than cocoa

select	union
select from table1 union select from table2

634911

634947
any	set
so if at any point your c program needs to store grouping or retrieve a large data-set or subsets of a large data set then chances are you ll be interacting with a database

634949
firefox	safari
this doesn t happen in firefox or safari

634976
jar	war
you could use an overlay although that requires that the sibling be of type war rather than jar

634988
haskell	scheme
one of the best ways to learn recursion is to get some experience in a functional programming language such as haskell or lisp or scheme

634988
scheme	lisp
it really only takes 5 minutes to learn scheme or lisp so you can get started with examples right away for the test tomorrow you mentioned

635019
32-bit	64bit
i am in the process of writing a new .net application which will be deployed in both 32-bit and 64bit

635043
gethashcode	equals
if you would use the foo object as key you would just implement the gethashcode and equals methods to only consider the fooid property

635046
sorteddictionary	sorted
i have never used a sorteddictionary and was just curious if when you add value to it for example in a for-loop do the value get sorted automatically when you add them or do you have to sort them after you add them

635059
sorteddictionary	sorted
being in sorted order is an invariant of sorteddictionary so you never need to sort it explicitly

635068
cursor	row
in sql-server transact-sql the most common such loop is called a cursor and allows you to operate on one result row at a time

635069
nswindow	nsbutton
the nswindow has various controls for settings properties of an object an nstextfield a nsdatepicker etc and two nsbutton s add and cancel which are used to confirm or cancel the action

635082
32-bit	x86
however i am aware of one major problem that can arise if you set your app to auto-detect the platform x86 vs x64 and also have any dependencies on 32-bit 3rd party dlls

635098
linked-list	tree
this article explains recursion and has some simple c examples for traversing linked-list and binary tree

635103
fadeout	fadein
fadein and fadeout are the frame names inside cover_mc

635121
callback	methods
if you need the textbox to make this decision based on each other you can have a static callback at the page level that you call from within the convert methods that will make a determination if you re still in resizing mode and keep track of any other information min or max fontsize already calculated etc

635140
temporary	copy
it optimises away the temporary copy in this instance

635158
methods	extend
however architecturally i would be better to extend the classes you need using polymorphism and override the tosting methods

635159
python	lua
i m looking for real life benchmarks comparing web frameworks based on dynamic languages python ruby groovy and lua

635159
perl	php
even better if they re compared up against classic solutions based on php java asp.net maybe even perl

635167
attributes	properties
i m just curious why class properties attributes in vb.net have a weird optional syntax such as

635190
optional-parameters	named
it looks like you re confusing optional-parameters with named attributes arguments here

635190
attributes	properties
with attributess it s legal to set public field properties of the attributes which have no corresponding parameter in the constructor

635198
sqrt	exp
or you could even go further in this account exercise and use exp frac m log n q -0.5 q sqrt 10 which also has the same mantissa + hence same first k digits so that the arguments of the exp function is centered around 0 and between + - 0.5 log 10 1.151 for speedy convergence

635198
sqrt	exp
this equals the first 5 digits of exp frac 100 log 2 q -0.5 q sqrt 10 1.267650600228226

635201
webforms	asp.net
as far as flexibility we have deployed a working site with asp.net webforms mvc and .net 1.1 libraries so yes it is flexible

635205
bug-tracking	manual
probably too late but the company might want to look at the new features for bug-tracking and manual tests coming in the 2010 release

635210
web-config	app-config
when calling a wcf service from a console app asp.net app wpf winform app you have to have a app-config or web-config file for the wcf service endpoint information

635218
.when	ready
.when you are ready for real deployment then you ll need mysql apache nginx etc.

635219
installation	uninstall
the only thing i can think of is that some plugins broke my installation i installed paperclip but don t know how to uninstall it where are my pluginss

635224
teamcity	nant
i m using teamcity to manage one of my projects however it doesn t seem to be working well with nant on windows-server 2008

635230
credentials	security
its not a horrible security hole because the credentials are not sent en clair over the wire and the end user has specifically told the browser to send credentials to the website in question

635231
hide	show
on my submit button what i d like to do is onclick show a please wait panels and hide the button unless the validators say something s invalid - then i need the button still showing obviously

635240
value	field
how can i find all text field that have an empty value

635291
attributes	properties
i would like to apply obsoleteattributes to a properties but it seems that compiler generates warnings errors only for direct usage of attributes any indirect usage is silently ignored

635299
ethernet	lan
if for example you are on a private lan and cannot access a dhcp server windows will automatically assign your ethernet adapter an autoconfiguration ip-address

635301
document	element
the problem i have is that i want to be able to define an area of the document as a containers for some text that will be retrieved at a later date and then use document.setinnerhtml element data

635361
stdin	eof
doing cat 0 . tmp.dat to check tmp.dat s size hangs up waiting for an eof from stdin if stdin is empty 2nd case

635380
selected	checkbox
i ve added a checkbox column to gridview1 to allow users to selected the records they d like to move

635401
variables	boolean
page_isvalid | boolean variables | indicates whether the page is currently valid

635412
any	set
when the setgid bit is set any files created will get the same grouping membership of the parent directory

635421
put	get
i tap the switch to turn it on and then put my hand over the sensor for a second then move it away and get

635423
any	set
i think this will do it without any indent switches being set

635424
sql-server	oracle
oracle sql-server db2 udb sybase

635424
postgresql	mysql
informix postgresql teradata mysql

635429
any	set
this image when viewing the requests with firebug in the .net panels shows image 2 any idea why this would be set this way on the server side

635434
getter	setter
but the generated usermanagement object does not have any accessible object securitycontext nor getter or setter for such a private object

635460
xargs	zcat
in addition to the fine answers about using xargs or find you can also get rid of an extra process by eliminating zcat and piping to zgrep or grep -z instead

635494
union-all	union
i ve looked into union keyword to union-all my tables but i m getting the error

635495
fortran	pascal
while there s certainly programming interfaces for many other languages c is probably the most common modern language fortran and pascal are still kicking around in this area in use in high performance computing

635496
configuration	installation
have you read the installation and configuration guide for the http classes functions

635504
python	java
unfortunately i don t know anything specific that will help you in python specifically -- however just as points of reference you might take a peak at the wadl specification that the jax-rs java spec is using -- -- additionally there is a xslt that will transform the wadl into html --

635513
itemtemplate	treeview
next you would set the itemtemplate of the treeview to the firstleveltemplate

635513
order	add
finally you need to add controls to your datatemplates in order to display the data

635551
select	union
if you choose to use union make sure that the you use the same number of columns in each select query that the union is comprised of

635565
value	field
that all works fine and good but i really want to avoid all the if else statements and just use the data coming back from the getjson methods to determine what field get populate with what value

635582
haskell	lisp
sql haskell lisp when it feels like it are functional programming languages

635586
default-value	default
answering your questing the solution presented in that code snippet can generate big issues in production you don t know whether the default-value appeared there due to invalid input or just because something else set the value to the default

635605
configuration-files	web-config
we often run into this with web-config and other configuration-files

635611
export	report
on an asp.net page when a user is viewing a report from the crystal report viewer crv they have the ability to export the report eg to pdf

635629
static-cast	explicit
it seems java compiler generates the function string static-cast object arg in which you have a line even though i explicit say that the templates type should be myclass

635649
revision	svn
the svn info subcommand will tell you the revision number in your working copy

635658
defined	declare
i commonly use declare and defined in cpp file and then use extern in other cpp file and not headers

635672
defined	declare
declare as extern in one header file include by many and defined it in one .cpp file

635673
drawimage	draw
you can tweak the second parameter of rhe drawimage methods call to draw it in other places if you want to

635674
defined	declare
declare and defined in cpp file

635680
pylons	django
i know twisted much more than django or pylons

635681
revision	svn
or automatic svn revision numbering in asp.net-mvc

635683
execute	declare
if you declare the instances as a normal static member or as a normal global-variables in the source file you ll probably have an easier time because the constructor will be called before main execute before you have a chance to start other threads

635684
revision	updates
it does require more work for you and you can only apply the changelist to your working copy obviously imagine the chaos that could ensue if you could apply a never updates property to a revision

635690
python	c++
it is implemented in c++ but it also supports end-user programming in python or in a visual link-and-node language

635692
shell	bash
you can then use that in a bash shell script to store the value in a variable

635709
nsurlconnection	nsdata
i get from a nsurlconnection a nsdata object which i convert with

635723
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and opera just change the parent windows

635754
capacity	storage
860-960 mhz ultra-high-frequency tags are typically read write and can have much larger information storage capacity i think that 64 kb is the highest currently available for passive tags in addition to their preset permanent unique id number

635760
jquery-slider	slider
i currently use a jquery-slider and display the quantity in the asp label which works just fine on product pages however it gets out of hand with multiple slider in the cart i need to allow the customer to adjust quantities in the cart

635760
order	add
if i add a sku for 1 16th of a case and a user wants 1 2 of a case they would have to order 8x1 16th s not cool

635777
value	field
how can i specify the same field in an inheritance chain with different value if i can t use new

635787
.when	ready
.when you re ready to commit your modified files you do wish to commit you d then simply add --cl work to your commit

635796
defined	declare
declare it in one header file using extern and defined it in one .cpp or whatever other extension file

635796
defined	declare
alternatively just declare it in a header but defined it in one .cpp file but then remove the inline from it

635810
any	set
i never had any problems and the set up was a lot more simple than it would have been had i chosen i2c

635822
select	union
another side note about the union approach if you decide to take it if you have difference in parameters length you can select bogus parameters on some of the union for example

635822
select	union
select userid username from users union select 0 username from notes

635823
decrement	increment
another possible solution since you are against having a fixed denominator is to use a series of up down arrows button whatever and you can use the up and down to increment or decrement the amount of product and on each increment decrement correctly updates the fractional value in the label

635823
decrement	increment
edit this could be further refined by adding in a separate increment decrement button to modify the quantity by a whole case instead of by a single fractional amount

635837
methods	extend
generally i recommend to use a base interface that has the business methods defined and extend a local and a remote interface

635837
methods	extend
so you do not have to duplicate methods and you are able to extend functionality for local and remote access seperatly

635853
32-bit	64bit
i need for my program to determine if it was compiled for 32-bit windows or 64bit any cpu

635865
contains	any
which will match any url starting with http and contains only the characters in the - a through z 0 though 9 -

635883
32-bit	64bit
the easiest other way is to check the intptr.size property to see if it s 4 32-bit or 8 64bit

635892
communication	messages
where a windows needs to communication an action to a parent a click it sends messages as notifications or commands

635892
contains	any
these messages are manually created by the child control and contains an identifier and any pertinent data

635899
any	set
documented assumptions - any estimator will have had to make some set of assumptions about the task

635906
initializer	getter
it works in ejb beans but when trying to invoke initializer in entity getter i get couldn t associate with session exception-handling

635913
silverlight	wpf
if you re used to the way these work in wpf they are thoroughly broken in silverlight

635915
ref	out
you use ref or out if you want to be able to switching out or create a new object in the function which is like a double-pointer

635918
32-bit	64bit
to see whether your process is 64bit or 32-bit you can simply check the intptr.size or any other pointer type

635918
32-bit	64bit
contrary to what other people have posted iswow64process will not tell you if you are running a 32-bit or a 64bit application

635918
32-bit	64bit
on 32-bit machines it will tell you false for 32-bit applications when run and on a 64bit machine it will tell you true for a 32-bit application

635931
filtering	sorting
sorting and filtering especially if the user can choose between different sorting filtering criteria

635934
ref	out
useful answer you almost never need to use ref out

635934
ref	out
that s not always the case tryparse etc are the canonical examples of reasonable use of out but using ref out should be a relative rarity

635939
sql-server	mysql
i know this will work in sql-server and it should port to mysql

635951
callback	methods
you must call the corresponding methods in your callback normally the first thing in the callback however

635963
json	xml
i m guessing the presence of this header is a cue for the asp.net web service plumbing to decide whether to return either a json or xml formatted response

635967
double-pointer	pointers
think of a non-ref parameter as being a pointers and a ref parameter as a double-pointers

635972
windows-xp	windows
windows-xp home edition windows-xp professional x64 edition windows server 2003

635974
windows-xp	windows
windows-xp home edition windows-xp professional x64 edition windows server 2003

635988
32-bit	64bit
while it seems like an odd route to go you can tell whether you re running in 32-bit or 64bit in wow64 or 64bit .net code by checking intptr.size

635988
32-bit	64bit
source migrating 32-bit managed code to 64bit managed code on msdn

636004
subtract	add
it handles leap years leap seconds invalid dates times it can output dates in any format it can compare add subtract etc.

636015
exception-handling	try-catch
once you have identified each of boundary entry points you should use a try-catch and then pass the exception to the microsoft exception-handling block

636040
anchor	iframe
there s a link called add file and unobtrusively i would like to attach an event to the add file anchor so that when clicked it inserts a new iframe below the existing one with the id of the iframe incremented

636073
expression	evaluation
this occurs because you are evaluation an expression rather than invoking a methods

636102
value	field
i looked at this question which asks if the .net clr will really always initialize field value

636119
slimdx	xna
the methods calls are very similar in xna and the theory behind it all should apply to you even with slimdx

636122
value	field
the .net platform initializes all field to default value

636150
any	set
then allow properties to be set on the object in any order

636150
constructor	object
a default constructor is the canonical method of object construction

636151
linkedhashmap	treemap
maps contains similar factory methods for instantiating other types of maps as well such as treemap or linkedhashmap

636157
value	field
as a related question if i have form elements in a flex component like the selected map areas and i post the form using an html component on the same page will the value of the flex field post alongside the html field

636165
put	get
with the consumer calling get when empty or at the end of each loop and the consumer calling put after adding so many items or time or .

636169
network-monitoring	nagios
one thing you could do to communicate server status is to have our infrastructure grouping setup a network-monitoring system like nagios

636169
network-monitoring	nagios
nagios gives you network-monitoring but also allows you to show scheduling down time for a particular server in the system

636175
entity-relationship	diagram
do you use flow-charts data flow diagram entity-relationship diagram etc

636204
touchesbegan	touchesmoved

636245
textbox	button
there is a ton on the web about this error when too many textbox are used over 250 but i m able to reproduce my error with a single button in a grid

636253
mergetool	winmerge
mergetool winmerge

636261
minimum	max
on sun s windows jvm version 1.6.0_06 i believe the minimum max heap size is approximately 6mb -xmx6m

636266
environment	building
i m currently leaning toward writing a custom errormessage function that would check the building type and possibly a #define master toggle before display anything and probably saving to a .log file if i m in a beta environment

636272
profiling	debugging
i suggest that you check the appropriate issue tracker before doing more debugging and profiling

636283
ruby-on-rails	rspec
i ve barely used rjs have never used rspec but i use git jquery and ruby-on-rails every single day

636285
tuples	set
if you are only calling the udf with 100 000 tuples of parameters over a 17 000 000 row set this is very much more efficient

636286
version-control	git
make an account on github install git and get used to it - you need some kind of version-control might as well make it the new cool buzzwordy one

636316
gnome	xfce
i think kde xfce and gnome are display managers are they x server clients then

636322
contains	elements
unless you specify a specific width for any elements of a webpage such as the body or some contains div it will expand to the width of the browser windows

636328
jquery	.post
i have a problem with an async call using jquery ajax load get .post

636342
windows-xp	windows
because the windows manager draws all the windows decorations it can make the desktop look like windowss-xp or a mac or nextstep

636342
gnome	kde
many modern x applications are written to use a desktop environment such as gnome or kde

636344
basic	abap
they are an integral part of the abap basic components

636365
exception-handling	try-catch
oh and a good way to find out any errors cause i wasnt getting any exception-handling either is to throw all your db code into a try-catch and return pass or if failed return ex.tostring

636366
entity-relationship	diagram
i use entity-relationship and class diagram on papentity-relationship and whiteboard for any project that s biggentity-relationship than a shell scripting

636369
python	c++
miro is python and they ve written just a couple of c++ classes to embed gecko on windows while using gtkmozembed on linux

636371
gnome	xfce
gnome kde xfce and lxde are desktop environment

636378
display	width
you could just describe that specific elements should be display with a specific width and so on.

636401
substring	strstr
if you only want to search for plain substring you are much better off using the standard c string.h function strstr

636407
entity-relationship	diagram
when doing transactional db design i use entity-relationship diagram to work our data storage

636418
sorteddictionary	sorted
a sorteddictionary would be constantly sorted

636425
redmine	trac
we used trac before with a burndown plugins then went to redmine

636451
configuration	logging
adding yet another layer of complexity the application server may have global logging configuration that may not recognize local configuration for a particular web application

636497
space	input
if a field received as input an empty string the cell seems to contain so is there no way to distinguish between an input of an empty string and a space

636523
dfa	nfa
it gives information on how to identify the back-end engines dfa vs nfa vs hybrid that a regex flavour uses

636527
python	java
my experience with testing is mostly with simple programs written in c python java so i m not sure if this is entirely applicable but whenever i have a program that can accept any sort of user input i always include a test with random input data or at least input data generated by the computer in an unpredictable way because you can never make assumptions about what users will enter

636534
base-class	inherited
i have a base-class called inventory_item which i have setup to be abstract and then many different services that inherited from it basewash

636542
document	element
are you sure the element is include in the document tree and rendering

636542
document	element
an element that is not actually taking part in the document rendering process has no dimensions and will give an offsetwidth height of 0

636542
any	set
normally as an inline element this cannot be set to any particular size

636542
display	width
the exception-handling is the first image because you ve given it â display blockâ which makes it amenable to the explicit sizing provided by width height

636558
hide	show
the hide and show methods of java.awt.component have been deprecated for a

636578
processor	cpu
processor intel r core tm 2 quad cpu q6700 2.66ghz 4 cpus 2.7ghz

second there are plugins which help in identifying dead-code up to a certain computable limit such as pmd

636615
javascript	dom
are they afraid of dom access through javascript or browser plugins

636616
synchronous	.when
.when a delete is made that delete is made to a memory copy of the data buffering cache and then written to a transaction log file in synchronous mode

636618
any	set
and this methods will work if i substitute letter with any number so if its set to 1 it will find all records that begin with 1 but i need it to work for any number 0-9

636633
qtextdocument	qtextedit
if you are using a sufficiently recent versioning of qt you should find that a qtextedit has an associated qtextdocument and it would seem that the functionality you seek may be there

636688
treeview	listview
i use it for all my listview and treeview

636691
postgresql	mysql
what are your methods of linking data spread over multiple databases architectures think mysql vs postgresql etc into a single application

636691
postgresql	mysql
if you were to use data both from a mysql postgresql source with no way of converting one db to the other application constraints lack of time lack of knowledge .

636693
administration	account
also when i do use the usr bin find command it says permission-denied to me even though i am logged into mac osx as the system administration account

636700
configuration	environment
configuration files are not always a good indication of the current environment variables since they are modified by many programs and files all across your system

636714
postback	ajax
the postback is sent to the server it renders an update which is sent back to the client all via ajax because of the updatepanel

636727
entity-relationship	diagram
i don t have a handy entity-relationship diagram to share at the moment but this is just a ventity-relationshipy basic starting point for a set of tables anyway

636728
dialog	pop-up
perhaps use a pop-up - you can make these act as a modal dialog by covering the entire app in a grid and forcing keyboard navigation to cycle within the pop-up

636736
oracle	mysql
oracle ms-sql mysql sap and various off-the-shelf pieces of software come to mind for this piece of software that is the final processing of the data

636736
contains	any
overlap can exist between any of these as you could have everything poured into one layer like an asp.net website that uses the built-in ajax functionality that generates javascript while the code behind may contains database commands making the code behind contains both middle and back-end tiers

636757
php-ini	fopen
fopen will only open remote urls if allow_fopen_url is enabled in php-ini

636769
directory	folder
in iis there s no hard and fast way to find out which asp.net version is used by a website or virtual directory website application folder - the one that has cogs as an icon

636769
attributes	properties
my own detailed examination of the metabase windows 2000 and windows 2003 file based xml reveals that there isn t a conspicuous properties attributes that stores a specific asp.net version number

636775
controller	routes
as for the controller part you ll have to register new routes also in the global.asax

636778
data-access	nhibernate
if you were using nhibernate for data-access in an asp.net-mvc app what would be the best cache provider syscache syscache2 memcache hashtable

636790
postback	ajax
you can hook into the client page lifecycle of asp.net ajax like so to inspect the id of the control initiating the postback

636797
any	set
is there any way to set up external editor integration for vs2008

636810

you could have an app where the bulk of the work is done in java but there might be some portion of it like maybe a data parser or something is written in python or what have you

636858
erlang	ada
java c# erlang ada etc - most good programmers will grasp what is going on with just a little explanation

636861
double	int
there can be many different ways basic data types such as int float and double are represented internally and there is even more ways to represent strings

636869
selected	button
if you can create the manifest i m not sure what one should look like it s easy enough to just load the dll into visual-studio s resource editor file- open- file- selected dll - click down chevron on the open button - resource view and just add the manifest to the dll

636884
pascal	delphi
context or editpad pro both offer syntax highlighting for delphi code as do many other programmers editors they sometimes call it pascal though

636919
hide	show
so show hide didn t conform to the naming pattern and were replaced with setvisible boolean which did

636921
silverlight	wpf
as you are multi-skilled asp.net winform skills you may see the advantage of skilling-up in wpf as it is very closely related to silverlight

636931
contains	any
drop any input that contains

636933
ubuntu	debian
you should really be in the habit of filtering all input but you might like to check out which distributes a hardening patch and suhosin which is in many binary distributions by default opensuse mandriva and debian ubuntu

636940
smalltalk	rebol
btw i dont use ruby now as i currently use smalltalk rebol but i would not use

636942
any	set
you ll need to set the dependencies for all of your configuration as well as any new projects you add to your solution in order to seemlessly switch between them

636982
unique	words
that s the unique space-delimited words in no particular order

636992
selected	button
when the user clicks on the save button the controls get user controls get dynamically reloaded but iose the value the user has selected in the dropdown

637023
python	c++
just to add to the list of examples it s fairly common to optimize python code in c or c++ or write a c library to bind another library to python

637032
default	reset
therefore the default that are being set when you load the control are being treated as changes by the viewstate engine and are being reset on the postback

637037
triggers	insert
the common way of doing this is using a triggers that fires on insert and update

637050
web-services	security
there s also microsoft s web-services enhancements wse 3.0 which i believe implements some of the ws- security specifications

637051
selected	checkbox
compatibility viewâ checkbox selected

637051
selected	checkbox
compatibility viewâ checkbox selected

637089
windows-xp	windows
the hard drive has windows-xp and the goal is to move data from a smaller hdd to this larger one without having to explicitly re-install windows

637099
perl	php
it would have development features like php perl sql databases

637102
perl	php
generally any decently sized web project will use about five languages html css javascript some kind of server-side â œgetting things doneâ language asp jsp cgi scripts with perl php etc. and some variant of sql for database connectivity

637104
communication	messages
the majority of the communication is via an enterprise level messages bus which contains bindings for multiple-languages to tap into and pass data back and forth

637118
double	int
for the parsing i used a std stringstream so that i would easily be able to convert the std string i was handed into a valid float or int double

637121
value	field
the only identity field is id which has a value of 0

637122
perl	php
ruby php perl svn mysql or whatever sql you prefer

637129
void	main
a long time ago i found this page void main void which contains many reasons outside of the the standard says it is not valid arguments

637138
attributes	properties
on the insert it is really weird as the properties attributes you posted seems to be correct so the insert methods linq2sql generates should be correct as well

637176
urlclassloader	classpath
urlclassloader thread.currentthread .getcontextclassloader .geturl helps you to reconstruct the classpath of current application

637186
pixels	line
this will draw an angled line of your chosen length with a thickness equal to your chosen thickness presuming your textures is a 1x1 pixels white image

637186
increment	reset
so if you start at zero and increment by something like 0.1 until you hit 2pi and then reset to 0 you ll have a line that rotates around a center like a clock hand or radar sweep

637195
attributes	properties
i always use the displayname description and defaultvalue attributes over public properties of my user controls custom controls or any class i ll edit through a properties grid

637197
double	int
atoi converts to an int you want atof which converts to a double

637230
32-bit	64bit
if you re running on a 64bit system make sure that you re using the 32 bit version of odbc to create your dsn otherwise it will never be visible to access which is a 32-bit application

637235
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
the actual value stored in the index will be the same regardless of collation for instances because it will still return the value in its original casing regardless of whether it s using a case-sensitive or case-insensitive collation

637266
constructor	object
it will create a temporary std string by one of those ways that is then used to initialize the object s by using std string s copy constructor

637266
constructor	object
the compiler is allowed to assume that a copy constructor copies in this context and can eliminate the extra copy of the temporary string and instead construct the temporary std string directly into the initialized object

637276
attributes	properties
try adding the readonly attributes to the properties of your derived classes

637283
postback	ajax
it will add some ajax to your form and you will not have some postback

637288
silverlight	wpf
here are some things i encountered when i converted a wpf app to silverlight

637288
silverlight	wpf
enum class is different...cannot do this in silverlight can in wpf to bind to an enum

637288
click	mouse
haven t worked this one out yet but something is different about this wpf code which i had used to check where the mouse was click

637302
arrays	loops
in any case depending on what you are trying to achieve you can just loops and verify if the unique id is already taken in an arrays with file_exists etc. and just generate another one if it s the case

637303
constructor	private
however the first requires that the copy constructor be accessible not private even if it isn t actually used

637305
export	csv
i want to write a desktop-application that can read this data and export it in csv format

637341
haskell	ocaml
iirc does not haskell ocaml #light and f# also use whitespace in the same fashion

637342
pascal	basic
this was a tedious and annoying system and led to many errors and newer languages such as basic pascal and so forth were designed without this dependency

637357
any	set
constructing indexes for views would be expensive anyway because while i ve not tried to profiling any views i m fairly certain that a temp table is constructed behind the scenes and then the result set returned

637372
scp	ssh
as for the security restrictions right now i can ssh and scp but not telnet or ftp .

637380
any	set
a skeleton reproduction of my code is set out as below any ideas for how to structure my code better

637383
linux	unix
if you are using linux unix then getopt is the option parser for you it

637410
command-line	cmd
i have an command-line that uses arguments i have no problem with this but each time i want to test the application i need to compile it run the cmd call the application with the parameters from the cmd because i didn t find any solution that let me dynamically pass arguments to the console in visual-studio

637419
bonjour	avahi
just make sure avahi bonjour s running then type hostname .local or also try hostname .localdomain - it resolves using mdns so you don t have to care what your ip is or rigging etc hosts

637424
selected	button
it is easy enough to come up with a user-interface with the button but i cannot figure how to make it so that the keyboard doesn t show up at all when the user selected the textview i d like them to never see it at all

637434
initializer	getter
in this case your cart getter could lazily load initializer the cart

637446
ruby	php
in addition to the old php standby - there is also django python and rails ruby worth considering

637446
python	ruby
the strongly typed languages themselves also tend to be more verbose than the python ruby where you can take advantage of functional programming techniques such as clojures and lambdas

637447
alignment	layout
is it possible to implement different layout modes for a windows form without having to manual compute the alignment locations

637449
interpreter	runtime
a problem in a runtime evaluated code block will be difficult for the interpreter to express - so looking for it will be difficult

637452
children	nodes
when i click a nodes which has children i would like all of them to be checked

637452
selected	checkbox
iâ ve already taken care of printing the tree and the checkbox and i am now trying to selected children nodes and i am not able

637460
account	userid
and if so how to keep anonymous userid from conflicting with regular userid or create fake user account for anonymous users in my existing users table

637480
constructor	private
additionally you should make the cart constructor just responsible for creating a new cart and make it private so that clients are forced to use getcurrentcart

637494
python	php
personally i will learn ajax as essential if my existing knowledge was server side programming language asp php python especially php since it s object oriented and multi-platform

637508
arguments	default
by default the conditional in the find arguments list are and ed together

637520
bitwise-and	modulo
which ought to be slightly faster trading modulo for a bitwise-and which we can do since the value of max doesn t really matter as long as it exceeds the maximum well-formed value and we re free to choose one that makes our computations easy

637549
ironpython	cpython
firstly to my knowledge only cpython has raii - you have to close your own resources in jython ironpython etc

637553
32-bit	64bit
if it s not a little big endian issue maybe the server is a 64bit system and you try to read 64bit 8 byte from the socket as the message length while your flash on your 32-bit system just sends 32 bit 4 byte

637562
contains	any
in my editor i have a composite contains a label control right at the top which flashes informative message in red colour whenever the user enters erroneous inputs in any of the below lying fields

637565
any	set
i ve set up the directory exactly as in that tutorial and ensured that django is on my pythonpath i can run python and type import django without any errors

637568
value	field
and you copy the value in your user table to that field for logged in users

637571
installation	upgrade
i recently had to struggle with one installation project which uses most popular product for creating installations installshield to make it work for product upgrade migrating from one version to another

637590
put	get
http methods put post get delete

637590
http-method	post
post http-method but follows

637617
keyboard	mouse
after an uptime of about 3 weeks the entire computer freezes and nothing works not mouse not keyboard nothing -just power off

637619
element	dynamic
the purpose of the dynamic type is to ensure that a single xml element exists in the message body being submitted to the wcf service.

637640
deployment	install
installation is normally done only with a command-line xcodebuild install but setting deployment postprocessing makes it install on every build

637662
adplus	dump
usually you d create a dump with a keystroke using a tool like userdump or adplus but if the os is not responding to keystrokes that won t work. that way you know what state your process is in during or shortly before a hang

637675
processor	affinity
if you want to set processor affinity you need to explicitly configure this.

637676
processor	affinity
processor affinity is switched off in iis6 which means the load will be distributed across all available cpus

637676
processor	affinity
if you want to restrict it you can use processor affinity to stop this default behaviour

637679
processor	affinity
any multithreading program will be distributed over all available cores by the windows scheduler by default though processor affinity can be tuned in the task manager for example

637683
required	checked
menu items which opens a form that does not required user-input about checked for updates

637695
visual-studio	release-mode
i m using visual-studio 2008 release-mode

637698
autodesk	maya
in some programs like at least older versioning of autodesk s maya a high-end 3d modelling package the ellipsis was actually a small dialog-icon

637706
constructor	object
it could be that you re structuring your code using stl in a way that causes more constructor to run or not re-using allocated object in a way that matches what you do when you implement the operations yourself and so on

637742
malloc	free
the char will be reallocated for every iteration yes but it will also be free before the next iteration so at least this won t cause a memory leak unless you use malloc without a free in that loop

637744
pointers	stack
space for the pointers will be allocated on stack but it will be popped off at the end of every iteration so you don t need to worry about it

637753
subshell	bash
the variable is a bash builtin that contains the process id of the most recently started subshell

637776
dictionary	arrays
when your c-like c++ code starts to get more complex you need to implement more advanced data structures like automatically expanding arrays dictionary efficient priority queues

637779
put	get
a data service is reachable via regular http requests using standard http verbs such as get post put and delete to perform crud operations against the service

637781
nested	order
in order to parsing arbitrarily nested expressions you can t use a fsm because you need infinitely many states to keep track of the arbitrary nesting

637806
filtering	grouping
or you find a property that all students share a direct grouping membership for example or a special value somewhere and use that as the filtering

637821
directory	folder
i know with wspbuilder you cloud definitely deploy files into the bin and resource folder within an application s directory ... inetpub wwwroot wss virtualdirectories 80

637824
powerpc	arm
i m currently working on a multithreading application that would be deployed on arm and powerpc architecture

637824
powerpc	arm
pthread_cancel on arm doesn t behave the same with powerpc

637824
g++	gcc
using gcc instead of g++ and adding -fno-exception compiler option did the trick

637827
stderr	stdout
i want to redirect both stdout and stderr of a process to a single file

637834
stderr	stdout
this is going to redirect stderr to stdout and stdout to some_file and print it to stdout

637837
stderr	stdout
1 file.log instructs the shell to send stdout to the file file.log and tells it to redirect stderr file-descriptor 2 to stdout file-descriptor 1

637838
stderr	stdout
you can redirect stderr to stdout and the stdout into a file

637839
stderr	stdout
redirects both stdout and stderr to filename

637870
signals	sigint
now i want to send data from one program to another using message queue and then intimate it through a signals sigint

637871
any	set
i m trying to remove an acl set for johndoe from all the folders recursively on one of my drives without hosing any other entries

637883
.when	ready
to be sure we can run tests .when things are ready the build has to start the containers and deploy the application in a blocking way

637886
value	field
except date field all the value are obtained using

637889
required	checked
the overload required a publication and is getting one i ve checked the typename in quickwatch don t know what is going on here

637913
priority-queue	queue
as i roughly checked the built-in java libraries i couldn t find any priority-queue which supports modifying updating priority value of an element externally after it has been put to the queue

637914
arrays	loops
the algorithm loops module also provides the nextpermute and nextpermutenum functions which efficiently find all unique permutations of an arrays even if it contains duplicate values modifying it in-place if its elements are in reverse-sorted order then the arrays is reversed making it sorted and it returns false

637931
triggers	insert
you could use an insert update triggers

637931
triggers	insert
within the triggers after an insert or update if the count of rows with isdefault 1 is more than 1 then rollback the transaction

637937
heatmap	plot
this is also called thematic mapping or contour plot or heatmap or 2.5d plot in other gis packages

637948
daemons	systemd
is it possible to obtain a service systemd daemons in linux like behavior

637953
shell	bash
if i attempt to open cygwin bash shell g++ make and gdc all work there

637961
shell	bash
i haven t used cygwin much but my understanding is you have to use it from the cygwin bash shell

637963
build-system	cmake
i would like to have this automatically generated by cmake when creating the build-system in order to avoid bad size struct in public interface when i change the struct in private header

637965
getter	setter
you could do the same as in your example but using timespan.tostring in the getter and timespan.parse value in the setter

637969
derivative	sine
for functions like sine waves they can be quite bad at calculating the derivative to a good degree of accuracy

637975
shell	bash
in the cmd windows try typing bash to start a bash shell in that windows

637985
xsd	xml
now i have a set of c# classes xsd schema and actual xml data

637992
ubuntu	debian
change the configuration etc network interfaces in ubuntu and debian to assign static ip address to the interface

637994
hosts-file	hosts
the etc hosts can be used to override dns definitions to point an hostname to a different ip

638016
xml-serialization	xml
you use the xml-serialization deserialization to export import data to xml

638031
put	get
and if you put a hashtable in there to cache the functions for each encountered codesnippet you could get close to your original example

638034
sftp	ftp
with current technologies is ftp sftp a good technology

638041
document-management	alfresco
alfresco does a document-management sytem

638041
linux	osx
i m using .net but these network folders should be accessible from other systems such as mac osx and linux

638054
associations	model
in your example you have defined in item model relationship as has_many for collection_items and collections the generated associations methods is collection_items and collections respectively both of them returns an arrays so the way you are trying to access here is wrong

638064
margins	padding
the important thing that every padding margins and content must be the same in both the .background as .foreground

638065
any	set
i want to do a query to retrieve the record immediately after a record for any given record in a result set ordered by list

638070
execution	restart
if you do have to make changes like this execution the alter-table on a regular db server will probably lock the table anyway so restart the app is not your biggest problem

638070
relational-database	schema
hibernate assumes a traditional relational-database where schema changes are often very expensive

638073
c++	lua
this is because lua is built in c++ unmanaged and therefore you will not be able to deploy that to your xbox360

638074
directory	folder
smart client software factory â april 2008 - this creates the folder scsf-apr2008 with a lib directory that has lots of microsoft.practices.enterpriselibrary

638095
double	int
everything works fine except that numerical values double and int are being inserted as zeros

638095
double	int
seems to solve the problem for both double and int fields

638100
revision	svn
that way it is easy to inject the svn revision number into assemblyinfo.cs equivalent for c++

638107
hosts-file	hosts
this shell scripting might do the trick for you if you just need to have the up-to-date ip in your hosts and don t like the overhead of a custom dns setup

638124
perl	ruby
it should be able to trigger scripts written in any language either based on native framework python perl ruby or based on the dlr ironpython ruby.net whatever

638124
debugging	trace
the failure should easily be traced either through some sort of debugging output or stack trace

638133
entity-framework	ado.net
when i come to creating the association in ado.net entity-framework i am getting problems because a second column on the table from the external db has an index on it and the ef is creating an entity key for it it s the name descr of the record - i think they just wanted to speed the ordering on it

638150
python	ruby
although i am fascinated both by python and ruby as both of them seem to be having every similar styles when it comes to writing business logic or data crunching logic

638158
g++	gcc
if all you want is to learn c++ gcc g++ is a great free compiler and an editor with syntax highlighting should be enough

638160
python	ruby
ruby and python are languages

638160
python	ruby
so it is not really sensible to compare ruby on rails vs python

638188
constructor	object
you will need a copy constructor but your copy constructor can use reflection to find the common fields between the two objects get their values from the prototype object and set them on the child object

638189
deep-copy	object
for instance suppose the car has a collection of tyres - you could do a shallow copy of the collection such that if the original object changes the contents of its collection the new object would see the change too or you could do a deep-copy which created a new collection

638199
webforms	asp.net
update there is paypal helper for web matrix that could be easily integrated to asp.net mvc or asp.net webforms

638206
selected	checkbox
unfortunately it works as documented and not as i wanted and selected all but the very last checkbox

638214
32-bit	64bit
both objects are provided by windows system32 scrrun.dll or windows syswow64 scrrun.dll if you re executing 32-bit on 64bit host

638235
value	field
you could use the reflection api to loop through each of the car field and assign the value to the equivalent truck field

638242
scheme	lisp
spend some time looking at lisp or scheme as they re the mother and father of functional programming

638243
haskell	python
if you look at the project euler stats python and haskell are very highly ranked

638250
macros	let
its macros language should let to recreate this easily

638256
constructor	object
will it guarantee that everything is in a consistent state if creating a new node and thereby calling the object type s constructor throws an exception

638256
sequences	subset
iterators abstractions that let you navigate a containers or subset of a containers or any other sequences of value in memory on disk in the form of streams or computed on the fly

638257
dependency-injection	inject
dependency-injection in its simplest form will instead inject the necessary behaviour into classes without regard for the actual implementation

638268
associations	model
you shouldn t need the source parameters in the has_many declarations since you have named your model and associations in a sensible way

638272
ruby	php
c++ and some frontend language php python ruby + flash

638275
revision	svn
i use a pre-build script written in javascript and executed using the cscript.exe engine that defines the major minor release gets the svn revision number and generates a magic build number based on the current date

638279
checkbox	button
the window.xaml contains a button and a checkbox

638279
selected	checkbox
when the checkbox is checked i set the viewmodel s selected property to true and false when it is unchecked

638292
put	get
if so the only way i could think of to do this would be to put your first build in the tasks and the others in the publishers section yes you can do this this is the only way to ensure the following tasks get exectued no matter if the main build pases or fails

638299
portrait	screens
provided that the map image starts from the top of the screens in portrait orientation the code looks something like

638306
icmp	udp
on an unconnected udp socket the kernel doesn t know what application to deliver icmp errors to and so they just get discarded

638309
value	field
with multiple value in the groupinging field its impossible to know which grouping to add the item document to

638341
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
you could read the inputstream into a bytearrayoutputstream using one of the read methods and extract the from there

638351
contains	elements
this is because label is an inline elements and is therefore only as big as the text it contains

638351
alignment	wrap
and give it an explicit width which doesn t work on most browsers or you need to wrap it inside a div and do the alignment in the div

638355
contains	elements
label is an inline elements so its width is equal to the width of the text it contains

638355
text-align	display
the browser is actually display the label with text-align center but since the label is only as wide as the text you don t notice

638378
background-color	transparency
with graphics2d you can set the background-color which might help to prevent the unwanted transparency

638382
proxy-server	http-proxy
my questions is which are the known good hardware based http-proxy-servers in production today and secondly what are the pros and cons of using a hardware based http-proxy-server as opposed to a software based http-proxy

638385
constructor	object
what i m going to do is loading the xml file before creating the object and passing it as a parameter to the constructor

638388
httplistener	http.sys
i m using the .net class httplistener which is the iis webserver engine http.sys without the iis admin tools

638407
linux	bsd
i d wonder first if the appliance is just running apache httpd on bsd or linux anyway so i wonder if there would be any real difference

638416
vb.net	vb6
i have extensive experience in both languages as i write and maintain a simulation of mercury and gemini space capsule written in c++ with some utilities written in c# in addition to the cad cam program in vb6 vb.net for my company

638426
constructor	object
then pass that as a constructor argument to object that need it

638439
duplicates	elements
to obtain the result for all entries just enclose the code in a loop over all of them. furthermore it looks like each entry is a set it has not duplicates elements

638444
redmine	trac
trac and redmine in particular are very good at this

638446
udp	tcp
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

638446
udp	mtu
for example i read an experiment in which a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

638446
udp	tcp
especially since you can give tcp the same sort of latency as udp by disabling the nagle algorithm for example if you re transmitting real-time sensor data and you re not worried about congesting the network with lot s of small packets

638477
.net	wcf
they went on to release the wcf rest starter kit to follow on from the release of .net 3.5 and also the ado.net data services that are part of .net 3.5 sp1

638484
implements	extends
exactly which class you re getting back depends on your configuration but they all implements the principal interface by way of spring s own org.springframework.security.authentication interface which extends it

638498
dictionary	arrays
i m trying to create a dictionary of two-dimensional arrays in c# i can t figure out the proper syntax

638503
put	get
to get more complicated than that you could put a hidden one time use key in each form and once the form with that key has been submitted display an error when they try to submit a form with the same key

638523
haskell	agda
epigram and agda do a bit of this and haskell does to some extent though i disagree that monoid is correct mzero and mappend okay mconcat bad

638546
value	field
if however they are not part of the datakeynames collection then you can use the following hack to make sure that the value is persisted in viewstate as opposed to normal behaviour for hidden field in asp.net 2+

638547
databound	gridview
to minimize code duplication i would use asp.net themes to skin the datasets and i would also hook into the same gridview functions update command databound etc so that you don t have to re-write much

638553
ubuntu-server	linux
now we are attempting to use this solution on linux actually it does run on various other flavours of linux out in the field - with ubuntu-server mode

638553
ubuntu	linux
linux - ubuntu

638796
if-statement	for-loop
you can satisfy the single method single purpose principle even if you put a blank line between a for-loop and an if-statement in the same method

margins	padding
i ve had this before and making the box bigger with margins or padding makes it work ok

638854
required	checked
so if that would be the most common scenario being on the correct thread it might cause a small performance hit by not checked but i dont believe its actually required

638873
constructor	object
the constructor of the dao class could simply accept a connection object and thus externalize the problem of creating connections or it could invoke a factory method somewhere that doled out a connection object

638873
connection-pooling	pool
even if you use connection-pooling it is still necessary to close the connections return to the pool once you are done with them

638894
django-forms	django
django admin panel and django-forms

638911

the problem is that the datasourcecontroller does not have a parameterless constructor and requires an oraclesqlconnection object to be passed in which is a public property in my app code-behind

638929
groovy	java
compare this expressive groovy with the less expressive java eqivalent

638929
groovy	java
sometimes you trade precision for expressiveness -- the groovy example works because it assumes stuff that java makes you to specify explicitly

638934
methods	extend
the first is that we simply extend the smtpclient class and override the send methods when in a development or testing environment

638934
configuration	environment

638948
any	set
i couldn t find any way to get hex of the background-color even though it s set as hex in css

the basic problem you have with a word file is that it is effectively a binary file as opposed to a plain-text file so you cannot be sure a key string like header doesn t appear somewhere vb macros code for example by accident

639102
64bit	x86
in addition you need to create separate assemblies in c++-cli for x86 and x64 targets if you re going to be targetting 64bit systems

639102
python	java
once you have the wrappers making java python ruby etc wrappers is easy

639115
python	lua
this suggests something like lua or python

639288
processor	affinity
so maybe processor affinity can only be queried on processes

639316
sql-server	mysql
don t get me wrong php and mysql certainly have their place but there are some instances where you really have to stick with asp.net and sql-server implementations due to other limitations

639352
triggers	insert
i have other non-nhibernate options i could employ like using a triggers insert the generation into the provider

639359
default-value	default
or you can specify the default value in your entity by giving the property a default-value in the constructor

639372
sql-server	oracle
in sql-server what you wrote is perfectly valid i d assume it should work in oracle as well

639388

at least by reading the quoted value into a single field

639397
selected	button
ctrl button and a row is selected

639397
click	mouse
i ve been asked to create a table where the ctrl + click mouse click on a row will only deselected a selecteded row never selected a row

639397
selected	button
i ve been able to create a table and disable functions like ctrl + a selected all and i ve been able to check if the control button is pressed when a mouseevent is generated but i can t seem to figure out how the ctrl + click can be adjusted

639409
turbogears	django
a long-running process using tools such as django or turbogears for python

639412
class-variables	getattr
also the way it tries to replicate the java behaviour of making outer class-variables available on the inner class with getattr setattr is very dodgy and unnecessary really since the more pythonic way would be to call i.__outer__.attr explicitly

639429
required	checked
so what i did was created a delegate for the few steps that required special processing in this case an email when the click complete and when they routed it on the next page i would checked for the existance of the delegate and if it was there call it to fire my stored event

639452
ubuntu	debian
the problem you will face as an ubuntu user is that there s always been a slight tension between debian packagers users and the main exim user base because debian chose to heavily customize their configuration

639452
ubuntu	debian
unfortunately this ends up causing you a problem because ubuntu adopted all these packages from debian but doesn t support them in the same way as debian does and debian packagers seem to feel put upon to be asked to support these ubuntu users

639452
ubuntu	debian
now to answer your original question there are a ton of ways to do what you ask and probably the best way for you is going to be specific to the debian ubuntu configurations

639461
any	set
if you do not set it yourself i do not believe that there is any way to determine if the class is nested

639489
memcached	apc
with apc data store or memcached you can have persistent objects in ram instead of for example always creating them all anew by fetching data from db

639493
exception-handling	try-catch
here is an example of an exception-handling happening inside a lock with a try-catch block

639507
selected	checkbox
2 selected the let me override defaults for this request checkbox

639507
selected	checkbox
4 selected the let me override defaults checkbox

639516
any	set
the advantage of any of these approaches is that you can then store the set map somewhere common and avoid having to build the set of matching responses every time

639522
subtract	add
specifically how do i add or subtract x amount of time from the result of the current_timestamp function

639525
hashtable	set
5 or more put in a set or hashtable

639540
32-bit	64bit
when running a 32-bit process on a 64bit operating system how much memory is available

639548
hosts-file	hosts
just block the domain where google analytics lives via your systemd s hosts

i would do something like so in button click of the popup

639597
subnet	ping
while i can successfully ping a global address from my teredo-enabled end-host i m unable to connect two end-host within the same ipv4 subnet

639607
abstract-class	subclassing
when you use abstract-class you create a coupling between the subclassing and the base class

639610
javascript	dom
the trouble is by the time the elements are available in the dom for javascript to inspect the images are already being loaded anyway

639621
abstract	extends
defining an interface is a very safe way to define how an object is supposed to act without risking the brittleness that can come with extends another class abstract or not

639621
implements	extends
also as you mention you can only extends one class at a time but you can implements as many interfaces as you wish

639628
groovy	java
when you re going to learn ror you can move to jruby or groovy grails and take profit of the immense impact of the java j2ee world

639633
implements	abstract
2.define abstract member signatures that base classes must implements

639633
abstract-class	subclassing
6.deriving from an abstract-class uses up a subclassing s one and only base class option

639650
python	ruby
ruby gets more attention than python simply because ruby has one clear favourite when it comes to web apps while python has traditionally had a very splintered approach zope plone django pylons turbogears

639656
abstract-class	subclassing
if you have a wide arrays of subclassing which will be doing largely the same implementation plus extra functionality then you might want an abstract-class

639662
linked-list	tree
if those values are really part of a tree or a linked-list then you have your set container already and your best bet is to just use some recursion

639668
configuration	environment
every cloned environment starts out the same and works the same the first couple of days but sooner or later someone reconfigure something in only one of the server environments be it a database update an update of a component library a web file update or other configuration thereby leading to discrepancy

639671
code-snippets	indentation
it can be annoying posting code-snippets on web sites that ignore your indentation

639671
python	php
it makes it hard to embed python in html files to make templates in the way that php or c# can be embedded in php or asp.net pages

639682
getter-setter	setter
when you need to extend the getter-setter behavior of a class it is useful have encapsulated fields getters setter instead of direct member access

639682
subclassing	inherited
yet in inherited it is conceptualy interesting to preserve the inners of your class if its subclassing shouldn t be aware of its private stuff

639688
required	checked
ideally all requirements should be checked into your version-control systemd along the lines of how ruby-on-rails lets you store gems in the vendor directory and preferentially loads those at runtime along with a readme file that describes exactly how to set up the environment required libraries etc

639703
cvs	git
for code this means a versioning systems such as cvs subversion or git

639707
python	ruby
if you re in a small company that s more entrepreneurial i can see where it s more likely that they re taking a chance on a technology like ruby python etc

639730
latitude-longitude	great-circle
if you re asking about the shortest distance between two latitude-longitude points see this wikipedia article on great-circle distances

639731
implements	extends
an existing class that already extends something can implements the interface assuming you have control over the code for the existing class

639737
vb.net	vba
i have googled for this and found some sites giving some code for c# and vb.net but none for vba

639740
contains	any
it won t actually load render any data contains with the response actually i don t think any data is sent

639747
implements	extends
so someone can extends an existing class to implements an interface without affecting the previously existing behavior of that class

639747
postgresql	oracle
internally the oracle jdbc driver may be very different from the postgresql driver but that s irrelevant to you

639751
webforms	asp.net
i am currently working on a small feature and am trying to implement the asp.net mvc framework into my current webforms web application

639751
webforms	asp.net
i have been following the professional asp.net 3.5 mvc chapter 13 pdf document that i recently found on stack overflow to get webforms and mvc to work together

639787
webforms	asp.net
i find that i can get legacy asp.net webforms working fine with mvc

639796
variables	boolean
you could always just set a boolean member variables to indicate that button a is disabled and ignore any events sent to it when this boolean member is set

639798
webforms	asp.net
it is not an appropriate suggestion to use mvc and jquery instead of webforms and asp.net ajax

639798
webforms	asp.net
there are many different implementations of mvc for asp.net and webforms

639798
globalization	localization
second jquery being a great javascripting library does not allow any integration with and does not leverage server side asp.net functionality as opposed to asp.net ajax framework that comes standard with the asp.net 3.5+ and fully utilizes asp.net features such as server side mark-up scriptingmanager control server-side scripting combining localization and globalization etc

639813
exception-handling	try-catch
i added a try-catch block and sure enough i caught the exception-handling i was expecting

639821
dictionary	arrays
the object is fairly simple a dictionary of arrays

639833
connection-pooling	pool
regarding connection-pooling the sqlclient pool connections by default so unless you explicitly turn it off you should be taking advantage of it already

639855
jruby	mri
ruby mri is written in c and even jruby is written in java which is based on c++ which is based on c.

639860
sql-server	oracle
i know in sql-server you can drag the columns over from the object browser wouldn t be surprised if oracle had something similar

639868
restrict	shared
you should restrict its use to when you need to access resources that are outside sharedpoint for example a database file shared etc.

639883
updatepanel	gridview
i am trying to call this function from code behind in an asp .net page due to the fact that once someone adds to the database the updatepanel fires and retrieves a gridview the table that has been affected by the function at document.ready

639883
document-ready	.when
ok what i tried to do is create a function-call it on document-ready and also in the code behind .when after the database has been updates

639903
specifications	w3c
the disabled attributes is not part of the w3c specifications for div elements only for form elements

639911

radio	click
click on the label should activate the radio control anyway

639926
png	gif
which image format gif png did you use for the icons

value	field
the annotations then describe things like this field is never null this string buffering is guarded by this integer value this field can only be accessed by the thread labeled background etc

639933
contains	any
find lines contains a less-than symbol followed by the string img followed by one or more grouping of some whitespace followed by one or more letters followed by either a double-quoted string or a single-quoted string and those grouping are followed by any length of whitespace then a slash and a greater-than sign

639955
shutdown	exit
this way whenever your child windowss close you keep them around for faster display later but your app still shutsdown when the main windows closes exit shutdown etc

640001
python	perl
perl or python syntax would be preferred

640004
where-clause	sql
the command simply starts us off collecting the sql statement the where starts our sql where-clause and enters the first parameter append tacks on more sql paramval just enters a parameter value to match the sql parameter found on the previous line and returnlist does the magic needed to convert to a class

640012
export	csv
create a csv export showing all users order by last name

640012
show	next

assign	add
onto the issue to add to a vector use push_back or some other methods that adds to a vector what you ve done is try to assign to the vector

640046
implements	abstract

640052
webforms	asp.net
i have an asp.net webforms application that has a feature that requires the user to provide data in multiple steps

640053
.net	wcf
this is especially a problem if you integrate it directly into wcf using the .net 3.5 send and recieve activities - there are some properly crazy config settings you have to set to allow it run multiple workflows at once

640064
wxpython	pyqt
for something like a card game however i d go with wxpython or rather pyqt

640067
build-server	msbuild
i need a concise high-level documentation on msbuild and tfsbuild helping me setup a build-server

640095
textures	fbo
nothing i try to render to the fbo textures sticks and when i use the textures it contains random garbage

640099
contains	set

640117
contains	elements
produces the wanted two files file1.xml and file2.xml which contains correspondingly the num elements with odd and with even values

640123
binary	hex
this is a 32 character hex value which you should store in a hex binary column format but if the table isn t going to be heavily used than char 32 will work

640135
libxml2	hpricot
nokogiri uses libxml2 and is a drop in replacement for hpricot

640135

put	get
the scripting when receives the http-post i need to somehow get the data from the xml and put it into my data-base

640163
csv	xml
it seems like getting the data from the xml is way complicated so if there is an easier way using something like csv instead of xml please share that

640167
firefox	safari
the browsers i ve tested firefox 3 and safari 3 on os x think i m trying to select the text inside the textarea even when there is none

640383
oracle	mysql
you can obtain a pretty good database of geolocated cities placenames from - find an appropriate database dump import it into your db and performing the kind of query your need is pretty straightforward particularly if your dbms supports some kind of spatial queries like oracle spatial mysql spatial extensions postgis or sqlserver 2008

i ve spent the last 5 years working professionally with things like microsoft s cms and recently a bit of moss web content-management and before that on two or three bespoke cms that we d written for a publishing house so i consider a cms to be a complete site building tools focused around publishing multiple types and styles of content

640438
binaries	install
that install project depends on a merge module project which assembles various data files that need to be install alongside the binaries

640514
space	input
afaik without modifying something in kernel space it s impossible to read the input from a tty or pty that is not the current tty

640516

640651
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
we have a few custom exception-handling and are throwing some exception-handling whose classes are defined in the .net s standard class libraries argumentexception invalidoperationexception argumentnullexception etc.

640651
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
today our team lead decided that he didn t want us to use the latter since the .net would throw those types of exception-handling and in order to facilitate filtering with the application block s policies we should use only custom exception-handling going so far as to practically duplicates .net standard class library exception-handling with custom versioning as in custom argumentexception custom invalidoperationexception etc

640660
revision	svn
i need to provide our clients with a dump of a single sub directory in our svn repository along with the revision history if possible

640663
silverlight	wpf
the latest version of the sample part 4 shows how to synchronize pushed updates between both silverlight and wpf clients using two server endpoints as follows

640663
silverlight	wpf
wpf clients connect to the wsdualhttpbinding endpoint and silverlight clients connect to the pollingduplexhttpbinding endpoint of the same wcf service

640663
silverlight	wpf
clients silverlight or wpf can add notes against a stock in their ui and these notes propagate back to the server to be pushed to all other clients

640672
datepicker	checkbox
there are a couple of things missing like a datepicker and having checkbox on tree controls you can actually templates this out but it s not as simple as winforms in that regard

640681
data-uri	data-url
if you re looking for a standards-compliant solution you might consider using a data-url

640684
double	int

640703
put	get
the tooling is getting better and better and if you can get a true designer on your team there are very few things that you canâ t put together

640703
silverlight	wpf
we are starting to realize that our future is actually not wpf but it is silverlight

640703
silverlight	wpf
as silverlight matures it is becoming more and more on par with wpf and it allows you to run cross platform

640721
boost	stl
but i am wondering how people use stl no fancy boost .

640734
postback	ajax
if you use ajax on the page make sure you add a postbasetrigger to your update panel to cause full postback it won t work otherwise

640740
tokenize	parsing
tokenize an input string by spaces and input the result into an std vector for parsing later

640745
firefox	opera
this all works fine in ie firefox and opera

640750
configuration	installation
a common problem with new vs installation is that the current active solution configuration is system-specific and may default to something not matching yours eg release vs debugging

640754
integrated	manual
there is also a topic in the wix manual about how to integrated with msbuild called using wix with msbuild

640761
textures	fbo
check the id of your framebuffer and textures also check if the textures id matches the one attached to your fbo with glgetframebufferattachmentparameteriv

640784
double	int
the data termed as a map essentially consists of int double floats and a single enum

640793
ip-address	hostname
the hosts file produces the internal equivalent of a and ptr records from the dns mapping of hostname to ip-address and vice-versa

640811
decompression	on-the-fly
maybe not relevant in this case but i managed to increase performances in an application with heavy file read and write by writing compressed data zlib and decompression on-the-fly the decreased read write time versus the increased cpu load being a win

640815
children	nodes
the problem is that it adds them to the bottom of the parent nodes s list of children

640833
implements	extends
he show an example of how to implements paging by extends the content query web part

640842
arrays	loops
alternatively if you have an arrays of keys and and arrays of data values you can loops over them calling map.insert make_pair key value

640843
contains	elements
see the value of propertyvaluecollection at runtime in the watch windows to identify types of elements it contains you can expand on it to further see what property each of the elements has

640870
contains	elements
each of those arrays elements contains a child arrays which holds types of cars for that vendor

640877
pylons	web2py
i ve tried out others like pylons web2py nevow and others

640888
compatibility	legacy
if you don t want to use framebuffer objects for compatibility reasons but they are pretty widely available you don t want to use the legacy and non portable pbuffers either

640891
json	xml
you can then make a private function that does the action and just have the public facing one decide to render in html or json xml

640893
document-ready	.when
the .when the document-ready event fires use the appendto methods

640909
alpha	rgba
this does some byte-swapping from rgba to brga and pre-multiplication of alpha

640927
duplicates	contains
collection that contains no duplicates

640932
expression-blend	wpf
i found that once i got a handle on expression-blend and wpf i was more productive at building uis than with windows forms

640946
mocking	tdd
i m trying to move toward tdd orm mocking ect

640949
dictionary	map
the link you are referring to spells out one of my favorite approaches - populating a dictionary and using it as a map from your xml attributes to the values you re setting etc

640962
google-maps	openlayers
openlayers - is an open source implementation of the google-maps component which might be more than you need but is a good place to start

640964
genshi	mako
tg2 takes pylons and changes some defaults - object dispatching instead of routes and genshi instead of mako

640964
turbogears	django
tg2 and django both distinguish between websites and components so you ll eventually see reusable building blocks for turbogears too

640972
mstest	mbunit
i am not sure that this feature is possible in mstest out of box like in other test frameworks mbunit

640972
abstract-class	base-class
if i have to use mstest then i am solving this by defining abstract-class testbase with testinitialize attributes and every test which needs this behaviour derives from this base-class

640979
webforms	asp.net
what i mean by that is it strikes me that any ui components i build with mvc maybe not very amenable to reuse in the same way you can reuse a contol in asp.net webforms

640979
asp.net-mvc	webforms
does this dichotomy go to the heart of asp.net-mvc vs webforms or can reusable ui components work in an asp.net-mvc world

640998
linux	unix
static libraries on linux unix normally end with .a

640998
shared-objects	.so
shared-objects end with .so

641013
webforms	asp.net
you can still use ascx files and other features in asp.net webforms

641013
webforms	asp.net
so yes as long as your controls don t rely on a server side form for postback you can use them exactly the same way you d use in asp.net webforms

641020
procmail	qmail
then your mta such as postfix or qmail will deliver mail to that address to procmail instead of an actual mailbox

641021
webforms	asp.net
it some ways this is because asp.net webforms is very abstracted from http semantics and that abstraction is a framework where its possible to create reusable user controls

641021
webforms	asp.net
asp.net mvc doesn t have the abstraction of webforms so you can have a control the posts to three different controllers

641033
jquery	dojo
turbogears now uses toscawidgets which can use jquery extjs dojo etc

641033
turbogears	django
this strikes me as a pro for turbogears if you don t have any javascript experience and a pro for django if you are writing a lot of specialized javascript

641034
loading	png
my gut says that png optimization shouldn t be the issue that mostly affects the loading of images but once they are in memory it doesn t matter what file format they were originally in

641055
ubuntu	debian
i ve googled for it of course but apart from some scripts i ve found there s no real project no package in debian ubuntu

641065
populate	row
here s the thing a sortable jtable backed by jtablemodel with an arrays of objects that populate rows one object one row

641066
coldfusion	.post
if you are going to save them all at once then this .post on iterating over a coldfusion query in flex may be helpful

641074
jxtable	jtable
i think this was on jxtable which supports sorting or in jtable in java 6

641079
compact-framework	.net
i write gui application on c# for .net compact-framework 1.0 sp3 platform that uses web-services to retrieve data from our server

641093
buffering	streaming
this will add some insignificant extra memory to buffering the output streaming but the effect will be most noticed in the extra few hundred bytes your sending over the network

641104
any	set
if you want to assure your code runs in a 1.5 environment set your ide to to build against the 1.5 jdk that way you won t inadvertently use any of the new api

641107
ruby-on-rails	grails
or ruby-on-rails or grails or whichever suit best to you but cruds shouldn t be still being coded by hand from scratch

641117
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i find it very easy to just instantiate my uitabbarcontroller in my app delegate instantiate a uinavigationcontroller then push and pop view controllers as i go

641143
carbon	cocoa
it s more to do with the operating system or system apis you re using carbon cocoa win32

641148
put	get
i put a breakpoint on a line in my application_start methods and am expecting that when i attempt to debugging the application that the breakpoint should get hit.

641150
perl	php
i m not sure where to get one for php and lime but there s a pure perl project called dbix myparsepp that is based on mysql s grammar

641153
delphi	c++
if your code compiles in delphi 2007 into .net assemblies you may have a much easier option than trying to port from delphi s object pascal to c++

641159
delphi	c++
one thing to bear in mind is that typically delphi uses try...finally structures for resource management whereas c++ uses a technique known as raii resource acquisition is initialisation

641168
google-chrome	firefox
i just hope google-chrome firefox and safari can be temporary friends so they can overthrow ie

641171
dictionary	arrays
depending on your case you may consider using a dictionary instead of an arrays if you want to prioritize the performance

641174
pascal	delphi
free pascal claims to support delphi on os x though not being a pascal coder i haven t tried it

641175
dictionary	arrays
if your build process populates the entire arrays associated with a given key at a time you might just dump the key arrays pair in a file as a separate dictionary

641182
entity-framework	ado.net
using ado.net entity-framework

641215
delphi	c++
simple answer you simply can t port non-trivial delphi code to c++ without a complete rewrite

641215
delphi	c++
c++ s object model is very different from delphi s

641215
delphi	c++
and there s no simple way to reimplement delphi rtti in c++ since a lot of it s done at the compiler level and a lot of it s based on the fact that all delphi classes descend from tobject

641215
delphi	c++
c++ also lacks support for the concept of unit initialization and finalization sections that are so common in delphi and what it has instead is badly broken

641215
delphi	c++
delphi s exception handling is also much more advanced than c++ s

641215
pascal	delphi
if you want to port a delphi project to the mac free pascal is your best solution

641240
configuration	logging
i have a project i am working on using log4net and it works great but i want to know if i can override the xml configuration for the root level attribute for the logging when in debugging and release

641247
nhibernate	ado.net
on the project i am working on now i started with ado.net went to nhibernate with xml mappings then fluent nhibernate and now trying to get the automappings to work

641274
webserver	host
another option is temporarily host in the built in webserver until you finish debugging application start

641289
display	outline
when the textbox is bound to an integer property and the user enters text then the textbox outline display as red as i haven t set up a custom style

641330
required	checked
now you would think that it would be as simple as checked for the presence of these three properties and in particular the appisolated property because that s the property used to indicate the application isolation type in-process 0 out-of-process 1 or pooled 2 - and every application required this property

641358
filtering	grouping
is it possible to filtering the list of available grouping that i can see based on some criteria

641378
exception-handling	try-catch
exception-handling and try-catch blocks

641404
gnome	kde
if users are going to be shutting down via gnome kde just inhibit them from doing so

641417
boost	stl
if you want to learn how to interact with windows through c++ the vc++ main site is here and the how-do-i videos here also download the feature pack if you haven t installed sp1 yet is here besides ribbonizing mfc they ve included boost in the stl which is awesome

641420
multiple-processes	multiprocessing
right now i have a central module in a framework that spawns multiple-processes using the python 2.6 multiprocessing module

641427
any	set
given a set of pdf files among which some pages are color and the remaining are black white is there any program to find out among the given pages which are color and which are black white

641435
typedef	struct
typedef struct _some_tag_

641446
attributes	properties
set the properties or bean that you want to display in the request attributes and fetch the value from it in the final page

641473
contains	set
if you intend for your static variables to contains a reference to an object for part of the time and you forget to set it to null when you re done with that object you would likely end up with a leak

641478
archetypes	appfuse
also i have used archetypes in the past from appfuse and webtide although i don t know where to find their archetype catalogs

641484
deployment	install
i ll also agree that windows install lacks built-in support for common deployment scenarios

641494
portrait	screens
i want my main content view to be autorotatable but i want my navigation hierarchy and settings screens to always display in portrait even if the content view was rotated to landscape

641511
attributes	properties
because alltags is a properties and has the retain attributes whenever you assign via it implicitly calls the setter methods which invokes retain on the new value and release on the old value if any

641518
any	set
you can transfer the credentials over a secure channel using scp with non-interactive authentication key pair so that you would not need to perform any custom encryption only make sure that permissions are properly set to 0400 on the key file at all times set the permissions on the master files and use scp -p

641518
credentials	security
this could be mitigated if the s3 credentials were only required for a limited period of time during the deployment process only if amazon-web-services allowed you to overwrite or remove the contents of user-data when done with it but this does not appear to be the case. an alternative would be the creation of temporary s3 credentials for the duration of the deployment process if possible compromising these credentials from user-data after the deployment process is completed and the credentials have been invalidated with amazon-web-services no longer poses a security threat.

641544
notepad++	textpad
personally and i know this probably won t be popular but i tend to use excel and something like textpad or notepad++ or even vanilla notepad for once-off database inserts and table creations like this

641583
cryptography	security
i expected you to be choosing between concentration for example game design vs security and cryptography

641627
attributes	properties
can anyone clearly articulate when you use an attributes and when to use a properties in class design

641631
getter	setter
properties are more maintainable than fields you can encapsulate logic in your setter getter allowing you to hide the implementation

641632
surrogate-pairs	utf8-decode
however it is possible that if we allowed these surrogate code points in our whitelist utf8-decode our string might produce valid xml in the end as long as proper utf8-decode was produced from the surrogate-pairs of utf-16 characters in the .net string

641633
getter	setter
seems like the getter setter will be defined twice

641644
getter	setter
seen examples on this and seems straighforward enough although somewhat duplicates in terms of writing setter getter

641658
median	min
name median mean stddev min max samples

641666
javascript	dom
for my understanding is the last row which is the dom object but in the anonymous function the closure has this dom object in scope so there is a circular reference between dom and javascript objects

641670
rollback	commit
i believe that if there s an exception-handling such that commit was never called then the transaction will automatically rollback

641690
highlight	selected
when i selected a node in the treeview it highlight and i show data based on that node below

641690
highlight	selected
when i selected another control the treeview loses focus it is no longer highlight

641690
selected	textbox
while doing a search i cant tell which node is selected since i must keep the focus on the textbox so the user can type more text

641692
contains	set
i have a ms sql db contains set of tables each table represents a collection of variables calculated based on our formulas

641692
numeric	digits
all the variables are numeric with predefined percision we are using numeric data type with n.m as n number of digits for integral part and m number of digits for fractional part

641692
exception-handling	try-catch
currently we are doing simple try-catch as ado.net throws an exception-handling for invalid values is there any better way

641714
turing-machines	automata
foundation finite automata regular expression turing-machines etc.

641725
linux	unix
schmidt s implemention gives you the standard posix api feel which is the widely used standard on most modern unix linux systems

641736
iteration	elements
the naive way is to do an n 2 iteration comparing each elements in the first vector against each elements in the second arrays and adding any matches to a third vector

641786
haskell	lisp
i think a lisp haskell c++ c java etc challenge would be a fun introduction to the languages for people

641786
haskell	lisp
the c++ challenge could quickly start having challenges involving pointers and other commonly misunderstood aspects to help drive home those difficult bits while the lisp haskell challenges could start to ask some questions that are more tailored to functional languages

641792
latitude-longitude	great-circle
you can calculate the distance of two geographical coordinates latitude-longitude using the great-circle distance algorithm

641794
textmate	emacs
i would like to do something like this textmate tip so that trailing whitespace are always highlighted in some way when i code something in python - it makes it easier to correct it immediately and other editors such as emacs can do it

641797
data-structures	tree
people suggest programming simple stuff like binary search tree and other data-structures along with a simple way to test that it works

641813
vb.net	vb6
i agree with franci - vb6 is no longer sold or supported so vb.net would be the way to go for compiled code

641813
vbscript	vb.net
express is free. vbscript is not very much like vb.net so that might be a good bit of work to port unless it s all wmi or ldap queries or something like that

641833
contains	any
showing your data in a normal memo field gives you problems although a delphi string can contains any character including 0 bytes displaying them will give you problems

641842
cassini	iis
i can also add that everything works as expected on cassini but we need to get it up on iis to prove that it s worth investing time in doing the switch

641847
administration	account
change the app-pool s identity to an administration account or yourself

641849
rijndaelmanaged	aes
replace the rijndaelmanaged class with one of the aes classes and a suitable key

641861
display	width
i ve tried making the two inner divs display inline-block with vertical-align top setting the left one to width 3px but then there s no way to set the right to have width 100 - 3px

641861
scrollbar	popup
i ve also tried using the float left margin-left -100 margin-left 3px trick but it has the same problem the 100 plus the 3px overflows the parent containing block and causes a scrollbar to popup

641874
firefox	safari
jquery may do some work to ensure that the resize event gets fired consistently in all browsers but i m not sure if any of the browsers differ but i d encourage you to test in firefox safari and ie

641882
signals	sigint
the signals for ctrl-c is sigint but you may want to also trap sigterm and sighup

641900
value	field
with the property you have control over whether to allow the setting of new values to the field massaging the value before storing it notifying interested parties about the change of the field s value etc

641900
getter	setter
say you only want the user to only have read access to the field then you make the getter public but the setter private or protected

641908
any	set
when i declared a variables in the header and set the property as retain i still can use the alloc function to that object but not cause a memory leak but from this post it seems like once declared a retain object at header then you no longer can alloc the object because both will retain the object can anybody tell me why i still can code like this without causing any memory leak

641929
value	field
- get the value of the field value with filtering name preferredname

641929
textbox	button
test it and enter the userlogin into the textbox and click on the validate button

641947
ubuntu	debian
jsvc is bundled with at least debian and ubuntu

641962
selected	checkbox
in the head of the table there is a checkbox that selected unselected all the rows of the table

641965
cvs	git
i have only tried fossil and git though but i have used perforce cvs and subversion and it looks like dvcs all have really cheap branching and tagging

641978
selected	button
however i noticed the new folder button on the source control explorer toolbar is grayed out when the selected repository folder isn t available as a working folder in the local workspace

administration	account
i m running mysql 5.x on my local windows box and using mysql administration i can t connect to the databases i created using the root account

641984
credentials	account
i can t recall changing root account credentials but i know i tried to give other computers on the lan access to the db by adding their ips

642000
updating	updates
in the ideal case the deprecated objects would be marked while updating the schema but then during the next updates our backup scripting would simply not selected the objects which have been marked in this way allowing us to eventually phase out these parts of the schema

642007
authentication	login
and upon logging in on a login page and after authentication the user by checking if he exists in the db and so forth

642008
silverlight	wpf
for wpf take a look at prism patterns practices composite application guidance for wpf and silverlight site it does the assembly loading you require and actually uses unity internally as it s ioc container

in a dialog i ve got a listbox with users and a textbox for a username

642010
listbox	textbox
i want the textbox to update its text when i click on a name in the listbox

642010
listbox	textbox
i also want the selecteditem in the listbox to be updated when i enter a username directly into the textbox

642010
listbox	textbox
partial names in the textbox will be resolved to the first matching value in the listbox or null if there is none

642010
listbox	textbox
at first the textbox gets updated every time i click into the listbox

642010
listbox	textbox
there will be no further updates of the textbox when i click into the listbox

642025
textchanged	textbox
i want to do additional work only after the textchanged event is fired or in other ways once the text is added to the textbox

642063
margins	padding
i have tried to set margins and padding to 0 without result

642071
procedure	records
if you are retrieving the records from a database the performance will be better if you call a stored procedure instead

642081
eventmachine	twisted
e.g twisted eventmachine or libevent

642117
any	set
any one of those could be set up to call a page on your site that would kick off this process

642127
listbox	textbox
bind the listbox s selecteditem to the selecteduser property and the textbox s text property to the userentry property

642137
servicecontract	datacontract
so for my second batch i tried to go the other route - create my service interface in c# and adorn it with servicecontract and operationcontract attributes create my classes that make up my request and response objects in c# and add datacontract and data-members attributes to them - works nicely my c# code now looks great

642161
value	field
googling that exact phrase gives me this cicso page which goes on to say the field specifies a time_t value that is obtained from the operating system

642177
contains	any
the code snippet will fail if any of the rows contains objects that can t be converted by int

642187
selected	cell
in excel selected paste special the text although column alignment is then screwed when a cell is null

642221
logging	daemon
this way you could easily have a logging daemon somewhere that you could write to safely and would handle the results correctly

642225
worksheet	excel
but i think you ll find this blog post very useful it explains a number of quirks to be aware of when reading excel worksheet using ado.net

642229
typename	typedef
but i ve never understood why gcc requires typedef typename within templates while vs and i guess icc don t

642229
typename	typedef
is the typedef typename thing a bug or an overstrict standard or something that is left up to the compiler writers

642245
traffic	packets
now i ve read about ndis but i am not sure whether the network traffic that is neither originating from my machine nor is destined for my machine will enter my tcp-ip stack so that i can block unblock packets via ndis on a windows machine

642257
typename	typedef
well gcc doesn t actually require the typedef -- typename is sufficient

642274
exponentiation	mod
using modular exponentiation it is possible to calculate 10 morder 53 or in general any a b mod c without getting value much bigger than c

642329
perl	ruby
but unfortunately i can t just shove ruby to replace perl because the people who are writing all of this don t know ruby and it s quite certain that they wont want this kind of interruption

642329
perl	ruby
so to bring ruby s cucumber a bit closer to their work i rewrote it using perl 5

642345
reliability	scalability
from my point of view bigger difference in erlang is reliability and serendipitous scalability

642345
reliability	scalability
to be brief in erlang you can design your program differently than in c++ because you can do it without big performance issue and promise good scalability and reliability without big effort

642360
any	set
in addition to looking for excluded from build check if you have any defines set or not set that would exclude the missing function from your release build

642377
scheme	lisp
lucky in scheme code and data looks the same but thats about it you can never accidentally mix code with data as is very possible in lisp with unhygienic macros

642378
windows-xp	windows
windows vista windows-xp professional x64 edition windows-xp with sp3

642392
constructor	private
should i set the constructor to private and implement the singleton pattern as it is afterall a settings class and only need one instance

642400
handler	service
in the isr that service the irq i disable interrupts unregister the interrupt handler and then signal to the task to go read from the i2c bus

642402
callback	methods
the first argument is a callback type containing the classname and methods name in this case

642413
scripting-language	dsl
a dsl might be something as simple as a table parsing or an xml-parsing or it could be something as sophisticated as a scripting-language

642413
python	lua
from c it s easy to embed python or lua

642413
groovy	java
from java it s easy to embed groovy or clojure

642417
decimal	hex
i need to convert hex to a decimal in vb.net

642433
response	timeout
instead of using the timeout call that function on every ajax response - provided you can tweak it

642446
decimal	hex
this won t work for decimal and the hex is too long for integer.

642496
sftp	scp
sftp and fish give you a lot more then plain scp

642496
sftp	ftps
note that sftp should not be confused with ftps

642506
order	add
in order to add items you will need access to the data store behind the iqueryable

642520
value	field
maybe you need a size table with those value in it x-large medium small 1 year etc. and an id field that goes in the other table

642524
jar	war
we also take a copy of the deployable jar or war and place it in the version directory under binaries along with any dependencies and configuration files

642525
execute	declare
there aren t any safe file types when a jpg image can infect you with a virus and you can even trick the browser to execute javascript in any file no matter its declare type

642532
superclass	subclass
as scott below guessed i want a superclass to call a specific set of methods defined in a subclass

642533
multiplying	modulo
can t you just multiplying modulo n in a loop

using .net 3.5 moq may be gaining on rhino-mocks for new projects

642620
rhino-mocks	moq
so what drives the choice between rhino-mocks and moq if you are using .net 3.5

642620
rhino-mocks	moq
what are the capabilities of moq and rhino-mocks

642623
duplicates	contains
note that if your enum contains duplicates values synonymous entries then this or any other technique listed here will fail given one of those values

642631
debian	linux
if the latter if you just want to backup some data you may use a utility like rsync available on most linux distributions like debian

642648
formatting	import
optparse does great except for this one formatting nuance which i feel like we should be able to fix without import whole other packages

642656
database-table	mysql
i have a mysql database-table with two columns that interest me

642686
bazaar	git
sourceforge.net just added mercurial bazaar and git support

642693
administration	account
just make sure if you disable the sa account that you have another account with administration privileges

642694
exception-handling	error-handling
ignore the first-chance exception-handling it is not a problem with your application just some internal error-handling

642703
superclass	subclass
if you want a superclass to call a specific set of methods defined in a subclass you can do a few things

642707
traffic	packets
i checked the traffic via wireshark and the successful request manually typed sends the trailing newline in a second packets whereas the echo printf and text file methods keep the newline in the same packets but i m not sure what causes this behavior

642713
archive	backup
backup manager is an easy-to-use tool for generating archive

642726
solaris	unix
use windows services for unix to create an nfs share on the windows xp system which you mount as normal on the solaris system

642738
performancepoint	moss
i have a custom query in a database which i want to display to users in a moss via performancepoint webpart

642779
administration	account
sa is the main administration account it was the owner of master database holding data for user roles schema etc so it can t be deleted

642782
any	set
i haven t found any way around that or how to do any complex stuff a given set of options is described beneath the description for a positional arg because they only apply to that arg

642817
contains	elements
otherwise you could try nesting your form inside a table elements and then have a table inside this form that actually contains your columnar data though you ll probably have to fix the column widths for this to look like a single table of data

642834
forms-authentication	security
if forms-authentication has security issues or does not support grouping then i need to remove that form of authentication

642877
python	c++
does anyone know about anything related to problems like this in python 2.5.1 or in build events in visual c++ 2005 sp1

642911
conditional	operators
for transact-sql there is a defined precedence for operators in the conditional of the where-clause

642925
hide	show
the jfilechooser component already handles the esc key by itself when the file chooser is show embedded in my dialog and i press esc the file chooser hide itself

642925
hide	show
mind you when the embedded file chooser is show the esc key should only hide it

642932
contains	any
when any user clicks on those specific links another page opens which contains a asp login control

642951
sql-server	sqlcommand
when cancel happens i cancel the sqlcommand object and this would kill the executing job on sql-server

642951
callback	methods
however as soon as i cancel it the callback methods specified in the beginexecute query is called and it errors out when trying to call endexecutequery

642951
callback	methods
is there any way to detect in the callback methods that the command is canceled

642970
required	checked
aside from anything else this only required a single execution time checked instead of two

642989
web-hosting	hosting
i am a product manager for a medium size web hosting company and we offer a variety of complementary services besides just web-hosting

642989
web-hosting	hosting
today our company has about a dozen 3-6 developer teams each working on different facets of web-hosting dns registration shared hosting cloud computing dedicated servers resales etc.

642989
web-hosting	hosting
another example web-hosting features like one-click web application install are developed by the shared hosting team but we also want to make them available to dedicated hosting customers

642991
firefox	safari
i just read codes of a web product that is supposed to support multiple modern browser including firefox 3.x safari 3.x and ie7+ but not including ie6-

642999
triggers	insert
remember that when you use an instead triggers it will not commit the insert unless you specifically tell it to in the triggers

643018
if-statement	loops
in an if-statement there is only a forward jump to the point after the if-body if the condition evaluates to false remember the cpu anyways assumes to not take a branch jump but in a loops there is maybe a forward branch to the position after the loops not to be taken and a backward branch upon repetetion to be taken

643064
oprofile	gprof
it can be used to visualize several different formats this is a python scripting to convert the output from prof gprof oprofile shark aqtime and python profiling into a dot graph. this is what the output look like

643069
selection	highlight
the textbox will not realize it lost the focus and will still show the highlight selection

643078
getter	setter
i understand the difference between class and interface thankyou my point is that my marking it with the interface i shouldn t have to have this property inside every implements class unless i want to change the default behaviour of the getter or setter

643092
ref	out
out and ref parameters

643099
.when	ready
the big difference is that you either specify which event callback to call .when done or are required to enter the wait at a time .when your ready to wait

643113
contains	any
basically i want to remove any line contains

643114
callback	methods
make sure you assign it a callback methods for when the item is dropped

643115
keyboard	mouse
it is very fast to provide useful control names...very little keyboard mouse jockeying to do this...so high productivity with intuitive results

643118
any	set
of course with the kind of hardware you have i d probably say use server 2008 as your base os then set up vms for any other oses you want to develop on

643130
logout	login
but it lacks a more useful base application that reads and writes to a data source xml or database allowing users to login edit data logout etc

643145
reference-type	generics
since you re constraining to a control you know the base class and it s a reference-type control so you can avoid the generics and the ref parameter declaration

643150
entity-framework	ado.net
it will be good to follow some blogs like the ado.net team blog tagged entity-framework

643155
perl	php
i can easily search for string contents of text file based code like php and perl using the unix command grep

643157
contains	any
keep in mind that any regex you use will fail if the file you re parsing has a string contains something that matches these conditions

643161
base-class	inherited
i have 7 subclasses that inherited the super base-class

643161
subclassing	base-class
my question issue is all of the subclassing use the same value for most of the parameters in the new constructor of the base-class and these subclassing can be called one after the other

643161
subclassing	superclass
i would like to populate the common value for the superclass and then use those for each of the subclassing but i can t come up with a good way to do this

643162
shell	bash
i am using a generic usb keyboard linux 2.6.27 with gnome desktop gnome-terminal and bash shell

643171
.net	wcf
using sql-server 2008 .net on the server side data is coming in via a web service wse or wcf

643180
duplicates	sorted
you can run uniq -d on the sorted version of the file to find the duplicates lines then run some scripting that says

643188
any	set
change users if you have any besides root set up and repeat step 1

643215
sql-server	postgresql
i am not familiar with postgresql but i would think that like sql-server it has meta-data tables views that describe the schema of the database for sql-server 2005+ i d be referring you to sys.tables and sys.columns

643217
key-value	key
i could make a key-value value structure instead of key key-value but i m wondering what type of performance impact that would have

643229
data-structures	dictionary
i think that because the most common dictionary is single key to value and a lot of effort goes into providing efficient data-structures for that maps it s often best to just use two of those sharing the memory for the values if at all possible

643230
filtering	grouping
please note when using the memberof in an ldap filtering the search value must be a complete string to a grouping and so you can t use a wildcard such as memberof cn students grouping

643273
authentication	login
the clients would be authenticated against a custom sql based method so i d like to be able to pass that info in the initial login request and then set an authentication token of some kind

643274
databound	gridview
the gridview databound is like this

643286
keyvaluepair	key
i think that is a good methods if it s always know what parameters you have if this is unknown at the time you could always keep a list keyvaluepair string string with the key being the name and value being the value then build the query string using a foreach loop like

643298
driver	kernel
first is the hardware and a device driver in the linux kernel will have specific methods for controlling and responding to the keyboard via status registers in the device and interrupt handler for example

643298
driver	kernel
next is the linux kernel which will have some methods of loading the appropriate driver for each piece of hardware detected at boot time

643298
driver	kernel
once loaded the device driver conforms to some kernel-driver interface providing data from the device to the kernel and vice versa

643298
driver	kernel
outside the kernel at some level the device driver and hardware are visible usually as a listing in the dev directory

643298
driver	kernel
these trap into the kernel see the manual pages for these for some detail at which point the kernel communicates with the device driver loaded above

643312
contains	any
however you will have to put quotes around strings on any columns that might contains embedded comma characters

643336
msiexec	psexec
bit more long winded that just calling msiexec directly through psexec but i was delivering the msi and a settings file already so sending down a little scripting isn t really an issue

643339
text-rendering	pango
i know shoes uses pango cairo for text-rendering so i imagine there s a way to turn this on

643355
hash	md5
so we re intending to pass a token like a 40 characters combination of letters and digit or a md5 hash in the url and to use ssl

643361
dictionary	arrays
i want to be able to bind a list or a dictionary arrays to the data grid

643364
any	set
if any of the 4 points are in a different interval range then that pixel in the contour grid should be set to true or the value of the contour range being crossed

643366
webmail	gmail
take a look at mail webmail gmail

643368
windows-xp	windows
the main reason is for 64bitness and the 16gb ram - it allows us to use hyperv to include local virtual machines running anything from windows-xp to windows server 2008 itself which allows the developers to maintain their own local scratch environments without bothering the infrastructure administrators

643393
joomla	drupal
this also means projects like drupal joomla wordpress etc

643393
perl	php
part of the reason php won out over perl was a single install had everything you ever needed

643396
session-cookies	cookies
this is because in ie when you block persistant cookies they are completely blocked not downgraded to session-cookies as on some other browsers

643402
subtraction	time
of course you could do a simple subtraction of milliseconds divided by the number of milliseconds per day which works fine - until daylight saving time enter the scene

643406
any	set
if this property is set to true any installed products with the same upgradecode but with an earlier version will be automatically uninstalled when the new version is installed

643434
version-control	cvs
use text-based version-control cvs svn etc.

643435
uniq	grep
using only uniq and grep

643439
highlight	selected
highlight the text then press ctrl-shift-f or open the context menu and selected source format

643455
key-value	key
...actually i think i might have slightly misread the question - but an ilookup might still fit the bill but the key-value set might need to be the key and the enum.

643503
display	height
you could get the maximum number of lines display at one time by calculating the font height and devide the textbox height by that

643516
docbook	mathml
but nowadays there is interesting alternative which is docbook with mathml extension

643580
erlang	python
examples being programming in imperative interpreted languages such as vbscript python or shell scripts such as csh or bash or expressing a task in declaritive languages such as xsl sql or erlang

643584
perl	awk
now this is all probably pretty easy in perl or python but i d really prefer a bash shell or awk solution

643593
base-class	inherited
in a user-controls that inherited from base-class

643594
any	set
a delivery vehicle needs to make a series of deliveries d 1 d 2 ...d n and can do so in any order--in other words all the possible permutations of the set d d 1 d 2 ...d n are valid solutions--but the particular solution needs to be determined before it leaves the base station at one end of the route imagine that the packages need to be loaded in the vehicle lifo for example

643594
any	set
given the set of deliveries d represented as their distance from the base station so abs d i -d j is the distance between two deliveries and an iterator permutations d which will produce each permutation in succession find a permutation which has a cost less than or equal to that of any other permutation

643598
jedit	emacs
jedit is fairly light-weight and so is emacs and i know they both have java modes

643612
installation	uninstall
the reasoning is that what if for whatever reason the user decided to put their own files in your installation directory that they didn t want removed or saved data that they might want to keep around maybe they uninstall is to install a newer version

643617
arrays	loops
note that s not actually what my function does but i do loops through the arrays

643619
dictionary	arrays
the member variable bars is a separate instance of a dictionary -like associative arrays class

643626
internet-explorer	firefox
this problem seems to have an effect on internet-explorer and firefox

643627
grouping	sorting
at a more mature stage where user deliverables are a priority use traditional tools where you don t have to spend dev time writing sorting grouping or pagination logic

643640
uninstaller	inno-setup
you can t use inno-setup to uninstaller anything it didn t install and you shouldn t want to do so

643644
apache-fop	docbook
i like docbook and use apache-fop to create pdfs from it

643645
assign	add
you just register the control in the page load the control cast it to the correct type and assign the event handler add it to the page sit back and let the magic happen easy peasy

643649
value	field
you ll want to use instance field so your process methods returns the appropriate value contextually to each individual user-controls

643649
base-class	subclass
use static fields if you want the return-value of process to be the same across all subclass instances of your base-class

643681
ruby	php
but i believe it s being surpassed by other languages such as python and ruby and php on the web

643688
spacing	layout
the plus and minus parts tell tex how much it can adjust the value to improve the layout that is they make the spacing elastic thus the rubber designation

643700
annotations	mapping
what can i change in my annotations mapping xml files caching provider or logic to keep the cached item from being locked

643707
convention	standards
i think the problem here is that the hasone convention means that you are pointing at the other thing the standards relational way to say many to one one to one

643716
radio-button	button
for the first radio-button you can hide the actual button and then its parent

643716
hide	next
for the second case you can hide the button and the next sibling

643733
contains	lookup
if the switch contains more than a few items five iirc it s implemented using a hash lookup so it s very fast even if you put a lot of cases in it

643762
overlapping	insets
the itemscontrol is bound to data that is display as an inset on a map for various cities so the goal is to keep the insets as close to their cities without overlapping any other insets

643762
overlapping	insets
2. i tried using visualtreehelper.findelementinhostcoordinates using the canvas.left and canvas.top properties of each itemscontrol a few levels underneath the contentpresenter of each insets to find other overlapping items within the overlappanel subtree

643766
any	set
to fix this you could set the size explicitly like you do for graphwidget or you could do some dynamic sizing based on the parent s size or graphwidget could control the size or any of a large number of various options

643795
derived-class	base-class
walk up the stack checking for base-class - derived-class relationship

643795
superclass	subclass
but a scenario where the subclass is instantiating the superclass in a methods other than it s constructor may still want the current behaviour

643796
windows-xp	windows
if you re using windows-xp i wouldn t recommend windows live search

643803
adplus	dump
your best bet might be to use adplus to capture a memory dump of the hanging w3wp process and then use windbg + the sos extension to try to determine the cause of the hang

643808
unicode	ucs
unicode is just a standard that defines a character set ucs and encodings utf to encode this character set

643810
16-bit	8bit
skipping a bit of history here and ignoring memory addressing issues 8bit computers would treat an 8bit byte as the largest numerical unit easily represented on the hardware 16-bit computers would expand that to two bytes and so forth

643810
32-bit	16-bit
examples of these encodings would be ucs2 2 bytes 16-bit and ucs4 4 bytes 32-bit

643810
32-bit	16-bit
all utf encodings work in roughly the same manner you choose a unit size which for utf-8 is 8 bits for utf-16 is 16-bit and for utf-32 is 32-bit

643810
unicode	ucs
both the ucs standards and the utf standards encode the code points as defined in unicode

643814
radio-button	selected
this selected the label with the for attribute set to the radio-button your looking for as well as the radio-button itself and hides them both

643826
python	java
i started my career as a powerbuilder developer but quickly changed to java and python as soon as i realized pb was almost a dead language

643836
ubuntu	linux
it s not supported for ubuntu but there are linux editions available here

643839
32-bit	64bit
however i run vista ultimate 64bit so i have to target 32-bit if i am using 32-bit compiled libraries

643845
linux	unix
i know a lot of people feel differently but i love uac strong unix linux background

643852
order	join
in order to get the information i use in sp i have to filtering and join the information with other tables such as email

643854
value	field
i want to see blank field is the value is 0

643864
windows-vista	windows
windows-vista security is quite better than earlier versions of windows

643864
windows-vista	windows
windows-vista will gives standard rights to all non-administrative application when user starts that app even if the user log on windows as an administator

643867
credentials	integrated
think we did something like that to integrated mstsc.exe launching using already supplied credentials

643868
command-line	cmd
do i need to save the diff output and process it using awk or is there a cmd-line option to pipe those files into an export cmd

643869
bazaar	git
but distributed version control systems like git mercurial and bazaar are much better suited for your type of environment than subversion

643901
inlining	inline
making a property or methods private can enhance execution speed because the compiler may be more likely to inline the code but i don t know of any instances where this reduces the memory footprint inlining may actually increase footprint at the benefit of speed

643921
checkbox	listbox
this listbox can be enabeled by checking a checkbox on the page

643921
selected	listbox
is there any way to re-enable the listbox using jquery so the selected values will be posted to the server

643927
decrement	increment
in particular except in sizeof expression functions class objects pointers or references shall not be used and assignment increment decrement function-call or comma operators shall not be used

643928

i then set their cell templates some of my columns contains combo boxes and checkbox

643932
linux	bsd
the simplest setup is probably a linux or bsd machine running apache and phusion passenger

643932
postgresql	mysql
for a database i generally use mysql though postgresql might be more suitable if you do lots of really complex queries

643951
value	field
edit if you don t want the user to tamper with the value you could encrypt obfuscate the hidden post field

643964
any	set
the .net code wouldn t see any log events until the procedure finished or flushed the buffer no matter what options you set on the connection or what you did in your sql

643973
.when	ready
it s essentially identical to the linq solutions and it will enable you to get use to this style of list processing ready for .when you can upgrade your compiler

643983
conditional	operators
ternary conditional operators in python

643993
selected	listbox
you could get the value of the selected from the request.form collection and assigning the value to your listbox during page_init

644001
conditional	operators
use the ternary operators formally conditional expression in python 2.5+

644009
binary	hex
if you re building what amounts to a hex editor then you re working with binary data

644020
filtering	grouping
put your objects in a container and filtering grouping so each one only appears once

644055
parentheses	braces
they look at the code slowly statement by statement line by line and stack machine in their brains keeps counting braces and parentheses at the subconscious level

644055
parentheses	keyword
for us it is an irregular mess of keyword and silly parentheses

644055
forth	lisp
notable exception-handling are lisp and forth which are first grouping only and python which is second grouping only

644057
scheme	let
it has to be maintained but at least you would be able to access something that would let you know you have deployed build 9876.5.4.321 or whatever version numbering scheme you use

644069
malloc	free
you snipped out the code that actually uses buf but if you use malloc or similar to make a buffer it won t be free unless you also free it

644076
msbuild	nant
nant hasn t been updated for some time the development stopped when msbuild was released

644076
msbuild	nant
if you do a search on stackoverflow you will find quite a few should i swap to msbuild type questions personally we have a reasonable amound of knowledge in nant it does what we want and there are some things that we do that appear very hard in msbuild so we will hang on for a while longer

644083
attributes	properties
it might be decorated with a validator attributes that will give the error â œ properties is a date that needs to occur in the future

644093

order	add
it depends on the order in which you add the controls

644103
32-bit	64bit
it may not be the 32-bit vs 64bit but i have no other ideas

644118
administration	account
the easy way to check this is give the account running the service administration access to the machine then take it away when you re done

644118
administration	account
to give the account rights go to administration tools -- computer management -- local users and grouping -- grouping

644128

i have a reference to a div which contains the form elements

644166
authentication	login
i am trying to authentication a user using the login domain name and use a web service to authentication

644167
linked-list	nodes
the typical textbook linked-list example shows a nodes with an integer and a pointer to the next and it just doesn t seem very useful

644177
internationalization	translation
also remember that internationalization and translation are two very different things manage them separately

644178
dictionary	arrays
i am working on a program that among other things reads a csv file in it gets stored as an arrays of dictionary in the form

644202

644213
currentculture	uiculture
windows has settings for currentculture uiculture and invariantculture

644237
ruby-on-rails	django
altho ruby-on-rails and django offer for a much better and faster development stack it is a big task to convince businessmen to use these platforms

644237
ruby-on-rails	django
the task begins with introducing django or ruby-on-rails quoting some blog research

644237
ruby-on-rails	django
what are the sources blogs whitepapers and other materials you use to make a case for django or ruby-on-rails

644237
ruby-on-rails	django
there seems to be enough discussion on django vs ruby-on-rails

644237
ruby-on-rails	django
whereas the need is django and ruby-on-rails vs .net and j2ee at least so while making a business case

644249
implements	abstract
exception-handling translation for the data-access layer to abstract from the actual persistence technology used to implements the dao interfaces

644259
methods	extend
this is a great feature added to the latest version of c# which allows you to extend existing classes and interfaces by adding methods to them defined with a special syntax

644262
deprecated	javadoc
if yes is there a handy shortcut to get a javadoc popup for deprecated members

644262
deprecated	javadoc
typically the alternate use of the a deprecated member is in the deprecated javadoc tag

644273
linked-list	arrays
first thing to understand is that a linked-list is conceptually the same as an arrays

644273
linked-list	arrays
thus any analogy that can be used for an arrays all the engines of a plane all the items on a shopping list... also applies to a linked-list but the efficiency consideration could make it appropriate to make another analogy

644274
driver	kernel
without a kernel driver this is not possible

644275
filtering	grouping
to filtering the grouping by domain and user try

644293
linux	unix

even if the methods is deprecated the javadoc will be display in the javadoc view

644358
attributes	properties
need find a way to add a valid tag attributes properties to a normal html control

644358
hide	show
what i have is some javascript jquery adding a click event to a link that will show or hide a div

644364
attributes	properties
apart from checking each properties s validation attributes you can also check for nulls or invalid casts or any other custom logic like this

644393
ruby-on-rails	django
before you begin making the case for django or ruby-on-rails you have to be convinced it s the right stack first in the context of the business person s needs

644393
ruby-on-rails	django
it may not make sense to have your client install sql-server or complicate their stack further with a ruby-on-rails django friendly stack

644393
ruby-on-rails	django
if you ve cross this chasm and are convinced you have the client s best interest in mind then i would look for examples on the internet where the same application has been authored in both java and ruby-on-rails django

644403

644436
any	set
it ll run 64 bit if it s targeting 64bit architecture or is set to run on any platform

644439
32-bit	64bit
- if you didn t specify a specific model then your app will run as a 32-bit on x86 and a 64bit on x64

644439
32-bit	64bit
the exception-handling to this start popping up when you re interoperating with 32-bit code on the 64bit system

644439
32-bit	64bit
for example if you re calling out to a dll that expects an int to be 32-bit and you pass it 64bit then things go very wrong very fast

644455
having	select
how would i employ an assignment program that would select a promo code from the table and assign it to a contact without having concurrency issues collisions

644456
any	set
any fd value greater than 9 is simply not in the set period.

644457
32-bit	64bit
if you specify 32-bit then it will be compiled into 32-bit and then converted as if it was 32-bit machine code running on a 64bit os

644490
viewwillappear	viewdidload
instead of viewdidload try putting that code in viewwillappear which gets called every time the view will show on the screens

644498
put	get
you might get better results if you put your custom stuff in a separate view or layer and let the os deal with compositing the result over the background

644514
linux	unix
x is the gui protocol for unix linux

644517
lookup	any
lookup deming and total quality management for his thoughts on why performance appraisals should not be done at all for any job

644543
png	gif
png and gif are the two file formats that support transparency

644553
scriptmanager	web-parts
the standard methods to ensure you have access the the asp.net-ajax client-side libraries is to add a scriptmanager control to your master page and then to use scriptmanagerproxy controls in content pages user-controls and web-parts when needed

644632
compact-framework	.net
under the .net compact-framework there is no formwindowstate.minimize value

644640
.when	ready
i would still expect to get an event .when data is ready and not have it skip some bytes entirely

644656
32-bit	64bit
it seems the 64bit jit is really limited compared to the more mature 32-bit jit

644658
packets	ping
use ping first but you can measure the rtt by sending a packets and having the other end sending the packets back

644678
mersenne-twister	generator
the problem is that my generator algorithm the floating-point mersenne-twister if you re curious only returns value in the range 1 2 - ie i want an inclusive upper bound but my source generator value is from an exclusive upper bound

644707
weblogic	oc4j
i ve worked with jboss and weblogic before but at my current job we re using oc4j which is a first for me

644709
dictionary	arrays
if what you want is to reset the contents of an nsmutablearrays nsmutabledictionaryionary you can also call removeallobjects and you have a fresh arrays dictionary to work with

644735
64bit	x86
64bit shifts cannot be done in one instruction on x86

644735
32-bit	64bit
32-bit shifts as well as 64bit shifts on 64bit systems can get jit compiled into a single opcode

644738
constructor	object
if the object is wired via constructor injection there might not even be a setter method

644741
processor	cpu
this is because some compilers or processor will use more bits of precision in a cpu register than in memory msvc has 3 different floating-point behavior options for example

644742
selected	button
when the user select an item from a dropdownlist and presses a button my application shows a list of data manually binded and filtering according the selected value

644786
any	set
so far i ve gotten a set of labels that apply to any version of a particular file

644788
member-function-pointers	member-functions
the different notations are because member-function-pointers need to be able to handle various virtual and non-virtual member-functions although not static member-functions and it needs to be able to handle member-functions which belong to the class via various forms of inherited public private and or virtual

644788
member-function-pointers	function-pointers
you d probably guess that a member-function-pointers like a normal function-pointers just holds a code pointers

644788
member-function-pointers	function-pointers
on almost all compilers a member-function-pointers is bigger than a function-pointers

644791
directory	folder
the question has already been answered so i m just gonna make a brief remark in your question you use the terms folder and directory interchangeably

644791
directory	folder
remember unix has directory not folder

644791
directory	folder
that s why i believe the folder metaphor for unix directory is wrong and even dangerous

644813
directory	folder
if you place the swf file in your application s src directory it will give you the option to include in the installer previously i tried putting it in the application s root folder

644814
persistence	hibernate
my question is does hibernate entitymanager called standard java persistence api for java se and java ee on hibernate s home page depend on or use the hibernate core code

644817

udp	tcp
are there any open source high level tools that would facilitate and simplify development of experimental network protocols tcp udp using a gui

644857
any	set
a generic type is basically for any type possible where you have a limited set of types that are allowed

644859

644869
proxy-server	http-proxy
imagine that your http request go through a transparent http-proxy you are trying to access a blacklisted site and you get a http response from the proxy-server telling you about access denied

644876
double	int
looking for more help on converting to double int and decimal format when doing calculations

644891
postback	ajax
in addition to what rex said if you are using asp.net ajax you ll need to use the registerclientscript methods on the scriptmanager if you want to update these values between partial postback which it does sound like you are doing

644894
any	set
basically you want to set the viewscripting property of the element to the path to your scripting and then pass any additional information you d want to send perhaps the linkhref or title of the link you re building

644903

i know you can change the frame size in the .emacs file with set-frame-width or add-to-list default-frame-alist width

644917
frame	width
80 but how can i change the width after emacs has started up aside from dragging the edge of the frame

644929
revision	winmerge
i ve been using an application called winmerge lately for document comparisons but one of the requirements of my teams script files for auditing purposes is that when we release a revision of a script we highlight the changes in red rtf format i believe it s through lotus notes to that end is there any software that can automatically highlight changes for me or is the best i m going to get a list of differences and be expected to manually highlight all changes

644942

644948
constructor	object
now imagine that creating an object of this class fails halfway through the constructor say the network connection is down

644948
constructor	object
now imagine a class that contains ten object and the constructor for each of those object does one thing that must be rolled back opens a network connection allocates memory on the heap writes data to a file etc. and the destructor for each of those object includes the code necessary to roll back the action closes the network connection deallocates object closes the file etc.

644948
pointers	stack
well it refers to pointers that in this code example refer to objects allocated on the heap pointers can also refer to objects allocated on stack

644996
perl	php
does it bother anyone else that the op compares the documentation for php s readdir to perl s file find

644996
perl	php
the comparison should be php s readdir versus perl s readdir no

644998
datagridview	databound
the fact that datasets can easily be databound to various controls like the datagridview makes it a good choice for data-driven applications

645013
linux	unix
in either scenario you could use a virtual machine in either windows or linux unix for basically nothing using virtual box or vmware player

645025
buffering	streaming
because the serial-port class buffering data and the streaming contains in the basestreaming property does not the two might conflict about how many bytes are available to read

645025
buffering	streaming
the bytestoread property can indicate that there are bytes to read but these bytes might not be accessible to the streaming contains in the basestreaming property because they have been buffering to the serial-port class

645033
sorteddictionary	generic-list
if you have the choice you re not hooked to some component that uses datatable s i d strongly suggest using an appropriate strongly-typed collection like a generic-list dictionary or sorteddictionary

645046
superclass	inherited
i have a need to be able to have a superclass execute callback defined by a class that inherited from it

645066

the compiler runs under cp m-80 running in a z80 simulator that itself runs in the ms-dos simulator built into windows

645221
g++	gcc
i know that gcc g++ provides the -i flag

645226
attributes	properties
if your texttoshow attributes was an expando properties then this.texttoshow would not return undefined but since it is a custom attributes you need to use jquery s this.attr texttoshow or the standard dom this.getattributes texttoshow

645228
document	element
i ve run into xml document where the xml element names change based on data and it is horrible to work with

645229

if you make the browser windows very narrow such that scrollbar appear then if you scroll across to the right you ll notice that the background-image of upbg doesn t fill the entire width of the page

645298
driver	kernel
a kernel driver then interpreter the number and makes the right led blink

645315
forwarding	port
try checking the port sql-server is listening on on that specific machine and ensure that you have either port forwarding set up on the work lan gateway and or that the port is unblocked between your laptop home lan gateway and the work lan gateway and the sql box itself

645322
administration	account
you ll use your administration windows user account to access the box rather than sa

645346
silverlight	xbap
as an aside even though silverlight is not an option have you considered xbap

645348
font-size	height
i left out the rest of the code b c it seemed to at least one error it had newfont oldfont newdpi-olddpi which would give you zero height font-size if the dpi hadn t changed

645350
alpha	rgba
the textures has an alpha channel rgba

645356

keep in mind that you may have to restart reload the server every time you updates the code for the website i m not sure if django or whatever you re running it on is able to work around that

645390
conditional	operators
in your specific case it s not a particular problem because this and that are strings for which the conditional or operators makes no sense

645400
binary-operators	operands
the || operators is a binary-operators which takes two operands and returns a single value

645424
manual	rcs
of course you can use a triggers for rcs keyword substitution clearcase manual checkin triggers example provided you use an appropriate merge manager

645424
overwrite	import
here sccs has an advantage over rcs the expanded forms of the sccs keywords are indistinguishable from regular text whereas the rcs keywords continue to look like keywords so if the other person has import the material into their own rcs repository their metadata replaces my metadata a problem that does not happen with sccs in the same way the other person has to do work to overwrite the metadata

645437
downgrade	upgrade
you may need to run db scripting both upgrade and downgrade scripting restart crontab or move files around

645474
.net	wcf
i d recommend looking into wcf for your .net server side components

645474
authentication	login
then you will likely be able to use standard http basic authentication for your login logic

645480
solaris	unix
the picture you provided is a typical large datacenter but each individual machine you see there is a single server probably running linux unix windows or possibly solaris or something

645491
tokenize	parsing
both the query parsing and the document tokenize use these techs

645493
environment	building
these networks consist of many small robots communicating individual sensor data to building a complex sensory map of the environment

645493
implements	abstract
i wish to abstract all this complexity away from the user such that all the user must do is define which sensors are present on the node and what type of sensor node mobile fixed positioning is being implements

645493
instances	self
however this possensor.position would then need to access information local to the instances passed as self during init so why call possensor at all when you can access the information locally

645493
constructor	object
when an object of type mysensornode is constructed all constructor from the superclasses need to be called

645493
instances	self
this works as self is an instances of mysensornode

645505
contains	elements
but i recommend to use a vertically cropped image which contains both color tones and then repeat-x the background for the body elements

645511
ip-address	proxy
you can attempt to track terminal identity through ip-address cookies or a combination of the two - all too easily defeatable by the determinate user use of anonymizer proxy or of multiple wifi connections cookie clearing or use of multiple browsers etc. and of course the inevitable dislike of individuals accessing your site from behind corporate proxy

645515
linux	unix
as for working with dedicated servers that relies entirely on what os it is running if it is running windows you will most likely be rdc ing into the server to maintain it if it is running some flavour of unix or linux you will most likely ssh into it giving you a terminal

645521
web-config	app-config
when you deploy a project the only app-config web-config you will get is the one that is in your executable project website console app windows service windows forms app etc

645531
expression	evaluation
what you are attempting to build has a lot in common with programming languages variables values types expression evaluation etc

645532
parsing	comma
any place you handle text input ends up using some kind of lexer parsing although some times they end up being the degenerate case lex anything but a comma as one token type and a comma as another

645550
execution	exit
stop the timer when you start execution your subroutine and start it again on exit

645550
restart	exit
you should probably include error-handling such that the timer is restart even on an unexpected exit

645556
form-submit	onsubmit
according to javascript - capturing onsubmit when calling form-submit

645557
widget	button
the user can view the list of widget in the widgetlistview backed by a widgetlistviewmodel and click a button to add a new widget

645564
scala	java
if you really want new language features for your new code try another jvm-based language that interoperates with java groovy scala clojure

645571
order	add
you need to add the button to another view using adsubview in order for it to display and then you can release it

645588
authentication	login
if you use the save authentication feature your password is not saved in plaintext but encrypted with your login credentials

645609
hash	md5
i ve noticed that when the password is entered in a text field say i enter the password sarmenhb the hash that gets created doesn t stay the same where as if i did it with md5

645625
show	next
after the user click the forwarding button 10 next images should be show

645629
silverlight	wpf
it is mostly about wpf 3d but the concepts will be applicable to kit3d and silverlight 3.0 presumably when it s announced next week

645649
contains	set
in this case left join is the correct type of join to use because even if there is no matching record in the d table for a particular c record your result set will still contains that c record and numprogs will just be zero as you would expect

645688
expression	brackets
i d probably do it as three regular expression starting with both parentheses and brackets and falling back to less items if that fails

645691
bugzilla	trac
if you begin contributing and show yourself to be friendly and useful you might meet no resistance when suggesting something like trac or bugzilla

645697
linux	unix
aside on unix linux the first one should be

645699
if-statement	loops
the same problem could be solved more efficiently in most procedural languages just by writing a lot of if-statement in a loops

645700
freebsd	linux
i have tested this on freebsd not sure if this will work on linux or windows so you may need to modify it a little

645714
quirks-mode	doctype
turns out you need a correct doctype to make it work properly otherwise prototype will be in quirks-mode which doesn t let getheight work as intended

645719
order	join
selected top 1 question from questions join answers on questions.id answers.questionid order by answers.createdon desc

645735
host	root
i ve added each ip as a host for root

645737
reflection	runtime
yes you can access assemblies modules classes functions properties fields etc all via reflection at runtime

645742
audio	ogg
it may seem quite basic but once you start sacrificing small children to the unholy gods of sdl stuff like sdl_image perfect for reading numerous image file formats - to the extent i sometimes use sdl solely to read jpeg or sdl_mixer sole solution you need for reading and playing basic audio - ogg wav ...

645744
value	field
your update query is a bit confusing you re using lastpolleddtg as a field and as value for it

645746
groovy	java
due to team structure java as implementation language is preferred although less exotic jvm-based languages groovy might be acceptable as well

645747
boost	stl
most of these projects share the same set of headers in their respective stdafx.h stl boost etc

645750
msbuild	nant
i ve not used nant so i don t know if you can pass this parameter with the msbuild task

645762
parentheses	operators
i was assigned a task for creating a parsing for arithmetic expressions with parentheses and unary operators

645762
binary-operators	associativity
associativity for binary-operators

645765
groovy	scala
but i think the focus of language improvements has pretty much shifted to new jvm languages such as groovy and scala

645771
revision	svn
this is different from other systems where the version number is unique and always growing like the revision in svn or is just unique like the sha1 keys in git

645771
lan	wan
a deported storage the storage is not part of the view workspace itself but can be located elsewhere on the computer or even outside on the lan wan

645771
push	pull
git has no direct rights management and must be controlled by hooks during push or pull between repositories

645778
defined	declare
a class is usually declare with it s members in a .h file and these are then defined in a corresponding .c file

645788
arrays	loops
if the arrays aka is not empty i loops trough it and when it finds that the lang index is equal to es i just save the title value for that index in sptitle

645793
defined	declare
but remember if you declare and defined in the header make sure they are inline

645847
groovy	java
or do i have to use java s java.util.zip.zipfile to process zip files in groovy

645853
webserver	nginx
i use nginx as webserver

645853
rewrite	rule
i need the rewrite rule for this

645853
rewrite	rule
i think i should a rewrite rule

645856
wicket	spring
frameworks like spring hibernate wicket certainly help to simplify and accelerate web development as they provide a high degree of testability and integrate very well

645856
ruby-on-rails	grails
grails is maybe the missing piece in this picture to get closer to ruby-on-rails

645858
msbuild	nant
so either bypass the csproj file and have nant or msbuild publish the code

645862
put	get
i am dealing with language file and i want to get all couples name value and put them in arrays

645865
firefox	safari
does this hack appear in any versions of firefox or safari

645870
directory	folder
in vs2008 i have a setup project which installs the primary output of one app to the application folder and the primary output of class library-project into a subfolder of the application directory

645874
command-prompt	cmd
do you want a python script which you can run from a windows cmd-prompt which will change the working directory of the windows cmd session

645885
installation	building
although it adds weight to the solution because of the installation of eclipse this is what i really use to building my small dlls jni wrappers in my case

645886
wicket	spring
consider maybe using an presentation framework wicket struts2 spring asp.net-mvc ... hibernate for data access and spring for other facilities and wiring

645886
ruby-on-rails	grails
if you look for really high productivity go for ruby-on-rails or grails

645897
profiling	debugging
when i debugging i usually just copy the sql from the profiling and paste it into management studio and run it

645902
httpwebrequest	webclient
why is that httpwebrequest works and webclient doesn t

645907
defined	declare
the declaration where you declare the name the parameters and the members in the case of a struct class and the definition where you defined what the functions does

645907
defined	declare
amongst the disadvantages are repetition yet one big advantage is that you can declare your function as int foo float f and leave the details in the implementation definition so anyone who wants to use your function foo just include your header file and links to your library objectfile so library users as well as compilers just have to care for the defined interface which helps understanding the interfaces and speeds up compile times

645908
hide	show
any information that you can toggle to show hide these can be cached and even preloaded

645908
hide	show
that way you just transpose them to the dom and simply show and hide that element when needed

645914
double-quotes	single-quotes
they can be declared with single-quotes double-quotes or in certain circumstances with no quotes at all

645943
binaries	install
the problem with using 2.5 is that python 2.5 is compiled with visual-studio 2003 i install it using the provided binaries

645944
double-quotes	single-quotes
the templates system.in django only supports double-quotes which explains the syntax-error you get when using single-quotes

646005
constructor	object
the object being edited is given to the form s constructor in the instance argument

646005
filtering	grouping
you should be able to use that to filtering the grouping choices

646012
contains	elements
in perl i can use exists to check whether hash arrays elements contains data with

646014
arrays	loops
then you loops through your arrays of characters and pull that information..

646025
swing	gwt
gwt is a gui toolkit similar to swing for the browser

646070
contains	any
you want to cast tryparse the values and handle any empty parameters that your expected to contains a value

646073
web-config	app-config
i copy the connection strings section from the app-config file to my web-config and change the connection string to the correct database i have separate web-config s for dev qa prod

646075
any	set
assuming that you re running ie on vista or later which it sounds like since you re talking about integrity levels you can set the integrity level of debugview to a lower integrity so any application can send messages to it

646077
continuous-integration	teamcity
if want to display the latest revision number of your entire repository or branch keyword substitution will not help i think a better solution would be to use a build management continuous-integration software like cruisecontrol.net or teamcity with a good build script

646077
revision	svn
how do i sync the svn revision number with my asp.net web site

646077
revision	svn
asp.net display svn revision number

646078
versioning	upgrade
but if you want a compile time error while building your app you might as well upgrade your schema to the latest versioning as part of your build-process avoiding the possibility of schema changes in the first place

646080
scala	java
if you re interested in some experimentation like new stuff and would like to reuse the plethora of java libs including jdbc then you might be interested in the lift web framework which is scala -based

646086
aes	rsa
from what i could gather so far people either recommend aes or rsa for this

646086
required	checked
how could i then generate thousands of product keys and still validate them in my app which by the way won t required internet access....so no checked back with a server

646103
doskey	alias
then i create a doskey alias

646111
order	add
in order to make it easy to add another row to the results of the linq query you might want to consider creating a class to hold the results of the query

646115
shell	bash
if you don t quote it the shell bash

646116
licensing	gpl
while raknet seems fairly interesting and really appealing from a feature-point of view its licensing terms seem to be possibly troublesome for gpl ed projects that may be leveraged commercially something which is explicitly forbidden by the terms of the creative commons license

646135
global-asax	web-config
a disadvantage is that it s harder to revert resources that don t end up in your binaries like templates and images and such. i don t remember how this actually worked--i think the application did some late assembly loading in its global-asax based on its own web-config section since you touched the web-config the app had restarted so it was okay

646141
detect	move
specifically i want to detect when the user move their finger along a specific circular path

646159
required	checked
it doesn t come include with a standard python install though but it only required standard python but it s definitely worth checked out

646161
postback	ajax
clientscript is not ajax enabled scriptmanager knows how to deal with partial postback

646182
constructor	object
the constructor is run when you create an object of the struct and the destructor is run when that object is destroyed

646182
constructor	object
so what we did above is creating an object called c which is constructed and the constructor called at program start - even before main is run

646183
python	ruby
actually ruby has functionality very similar to john s python example

646184
value	field
to return a value from a delphi message handler assign a value to the msg.result field

646193
aes	rsa
yes rsa and aes are two very different things

646193
private-key	rsa
rsa is public key cryptography involving a public key and a private-key and is fairly slow

646216
xsd	xml
i need to have an xsd file for xml documents which will look like this

646259
sniffing	packets
there are much simpler ways such as sniffing the packets so it is highly unlikely anyone would rely on this approach

646260
chown	sudo
for instances i ll often chmod chown dev devices serial ports etc under sudo root so i can use them from my software without being root

646270
value	field
when i use updatemodel or tryupdatemodel the asp.net-mvc framework is smart enough to know if you are trying to pass in a null into a value type the user forgets to fill out the required birth day field

646274
json	xml
xml can be tranformed easily to json

646274
javascript	dom
it does realy modify the dom so other methods can access the used templates javascript repeater doesn t

646283
sql-server	oracle
if you want to integrate something that uses oracle into a existing infrastructure that uses sql-server for example it can really suck - much better if the oracle or sql-server pieces can be moved to the other system i know of some places that have 3 different databases for their financial systems.

646288
put	get
as you can above i put a system.out.print statement in and every time i click on something in the list i get two ouputs for that item eg

646340
sql-server	firebird
as far as i can tell you will not be able to do this neither against ms sql-server nor against interbase firebird

646370
wlan	lan
i have an asp.net web-page application and i want it to be accessed using a local area network lan or wireless area network wlan

646379
void	main
void is not a standard return-type for main

646381
ubuntu	linux
and also download another installation and install on my ubuntu to run my apps on linux

646381
ubuntu	linux
or could i just install on ubuntu and compile my applications to run on both windows and linux

646388
virtualbox	vmware
i ve found that better disk io performance gives me a better overall experience so i traded the better cpu performance and overall stability unfortunately of vmware server for the better io performance of virtualbox

646395
tcplistener	sslstream
i ve got a simple client-server application based on tcpclient tcplistener and sslstream

646395
x509certificate	sslstream
clients can authentication themselves to the server using a x509certificate or by sending a user name and password after the sslstream has been established

646395
authentication	login
i m not sure if i need all that claimset stuff but it would be nice if users could login just using their windows account or any other provided authentication mechanism

646400
wlan	lan
you will need to configure you iis assuming this is the webserver your are will using allowing access from wlan lan to specific users or anonymous

646400
wlan	lan
your application won t need to be changed that s just networking problems ans configuration you will have to face to allow acces only trought lan and wlan

646409
administration	account
under an administration account in

646413
integrated	manual
the compiler also comes with a c tutorial as well as good user documentation detailing how to use the integrated win32 resource editor wedit there s also an advanced manual about more complex development tasks

646438
emacs	vim
i keep hearing i should learn vim or emacs but the thing is there is absolutely no way i ll need to use them in work so i feel a bit guilty pouring time into mastering one of them

646438
emacs	vim
worse than that i m wondering if learning vim or emacs could make me slower with visual-studio as i d confusing short cut keys

646438
notepad++	scite
currently i m doing my editing in linux using scite i think this became notepad++ on windows

646438
emacs	vim
for someone who works in a purely ms product environment is there any real reason for me to learn emacs vim

646452
directory	folder
you add the mime types to the httpd.conf like the link jaredpar provided and you set the publishing folder to the directory of the webfolder and then the installation folder to it s equivalent uri

646457
sftp	ssh
we use sftp with ssh on both our development and live servers and i have tried not too hard though to use the wordpress upload feature

646458
emacs	vim
vim and emacs are great if you re willing to learn the keyboard shortcuts

646461
emacs	vim
i d recommend vim if you are going to learn one or the other but i know emacs users will strongly disagree

646499
restart	daemon
i ve heard through teammates that ruby-on-rails default memcached client does not attempt to automatically reconnect to the memcached daemon if for some reason it stops and restart though i haven t confirmed it myself

646534
entity-framework	nhibernate
you ll invest a lot of time in creating maintaining and testing your dal when you could by using an existing well-tested orm -- like linqtosql nhibernate ntier or even entity-framework -- spend more time on code that directly benefits your business needs

646536
hash	md5
you make a 128-bit md5 hash of this information

646536
hash	md5
the client software converts it back to a 128-bit number 16 bytes decrypts that using the public key of your ec crypto and compares the result to an md5 hash of the user s personal information which must match what was used for registration

646542
webforms	asp.net
webforms asp.net would be preferrable

646571
parsing	comma
then split on the comma and parsing each entry according to requirements are they doubles floats valid strings - and if strings what encoding

646574
shutdown	exit
to me it s much clearer to see the call to exit does and your shutdown will be more controlled finalizers and critical finalizers will run

646579
required	checked
the negative aspect of this methods is the extra work required in each protected view checked the session variables

646579
authentication	login
create a custom decorator login_required2 below that returns the requested view if the user is authentication and the project s login view otherwise

646579
authentication	login
if the user correctly authentication returns the view corresponding to the requested path the requested path remains identical throughout the login process and is identical to the path the user requested when they were originally passed the login view instead.

646581
entity-framework	ado.net
i am using silverlight client with ado.net dataservices on entity-framework

646581
repository	entity
i have a repository for my contacts and address which has a methods add t entity .

646589
publish-subscribe	observer-pattern
i used observer-pattern aka the publish-subscribe pattern to solve this same problem

646600
contains	any
if any entry m i i is nonzero there is a cycle contains vertex i

646610
mantis	trac
i d recommend mantis or trac

646611
input-field	selected
how can i programmatically selected a specific range of text in an html input-field

646633
c++	lua
is there a way to run lua code from a c c++ program at a more fine-grained level than a standard lua_pcall function call

646643
polyfills	shim
you ll want to use a shim polyfills to add it on browsers that don t support it

646662
selected	textbox
here s how to select a portion of a textbox range select and get the selected text

646679
any	set
i would use vsftpd on the nix server side it s small and easy to configure and i haven t had any problems with it since i initially set it up about 6 months ago so it s also reliable

646686
winscp	putty
putty and winscp are all you need

646688
internet-explorer	quirks-mode
if it says internet-explorer 8 for the browser mode and not quirks-mode for the document mode you should be ok

646691
put	get
it could be said that perhaps you should have spent more time designing but a key element in an agile process is that coding is part of the design process and in most cases having put some reasonable effort into design it s better to just get on with it

646703
highlight	selected
windows controls tend to suck for showing a well highlighted field while in os x you get a distinctive highlight around the control that is selected in most cases

646710
webforms	asp.net
you could either write an url rewrite handler use asp.net mvc routing in your webforms application or use asp.net mvc instead of webforms

646712
object-reference	instances
i have attempted to install a copy on my local server - windows 2003 sql-server 2005 .net 2.0 and although with a few tweaks i can successfully get it to display the site i cannot login or even access the login module ie just putting in blank username and password attempting to generate a must enter username type error without getting the error object-reference not set to an instances of an object

646717
binary	hex
a less detailed and simpler approach would be to open .ppt file in hex editor and look for information you are interesed in you should be able to see text within the binary data and what surrounds it

646722
versioning	migrate
we adopted it on our team to migrate off of a very old versioning of teamtrack and we have been very impressed

646739
progress-bar	progress
now every time a methods in the task object sets the progress property the progress-bar in the form will get updated

646745
linux	osx
i personally prefer the jvm be a prerequisite and not installed with the application - i have found no compatibility issues with my applications from java 2 through java 6 on a variety of platforms windows osx linux and os 400

646754
delphi	c++
if you were writing a dll in delphi and using it from c++ and you wanted to debug the dll you d open the source for the dll in delphi and set a breakpoint

646754
delphi	c++
you d then use run|parameters and set the c++ application as the host executable and hit run in the delphi ide

646769
increment	reset
when you deleted the other records you probably didn t reset the auto increment count

646779
inlining	inline
limit on the jit for inlining but will it inline properties or just pure methods calls

646780
inlining	inline
it s up to the jit the c# compiler doesn t do any inlining as far as i m aware but i believe the jit will inline trivial properties in most cases

646780
32-bit	64bit
also note that the 64bit and 32-bit jits are different including their treatment of what gets inlined

646789
value	field
in addition to that these messages cause undefined value to be returned in field of struct whose size is larger than 8 bytes on intel processors as well

646802
code-coverage	gcov
basic line and branch code-coverage can be generated with the gcov tool

646816
selected	listbox
i got a linq based windows project.there is a form thats saving personel s departmant title name surname etc..in this form there is 2 combobox item that holding title and departman objects and 1 textbox 1 listbox.when forms loads i filled listbox with personel class.when listbox s selected index change event occur i wanna fill combodepartman and combotitle with this personel s departman and title information getting this from db .i have done this but there is a problem.when i have done this comboboxes showing me only this personel s departman and title info not whole departman and title informations.when i fill combobox with whole departmans and titles i wanna change selectedindex to personel s departman or title

646817
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it was brought to my attention that webforms could be used inside of an asp.net-mvc application

646817
asp.net-mvc	webforms
mixing webforms in an asp.net-mvc solution is an ugly solution but at this point looks better than the alternative of trying to write my own month week day view appointment calendar ui

646830
.net	wcf
there is a securitytokenserializer class which has one implementation in the .net framework the wssecuritytokenserializer class which comes with wcf

646832
filesystems	fat
this is because fat directories are as on many unix filesystems simply a packed arrays of fixed-size directory entry struct along with an ugly hack to fit long file names written in unicode into a directory structure designed for 8.3 names written in ascii

646832
command-prompt	cmd
you can see the differences with the dir cmd at the cmd-prompt

646832
folder	dir
on a fat32 volume dir shows the files in a different order than it will if that same folder is copied to an ntfs volume

646837
global-variables	call
you can declare things at file scope outside of main effectively creating a global-variables but you can t call functions like sem_init at file scope

646840
32-bit	64bit
so the c# 32-bit jit does in-line properties the 64bit doesn t nor any other non-static methods

646857
32-bit	16-bit
write a function to reverse 32-bit and 16-bit numbers

646874
stderr	stdout
on nix type os if you are process is outputting to stdout or stderr you can obviously use pipe

646895
json	xml
you could use json serialization instead of xml

646928
database-table	mysql
added to mysql database-table

646935
perl	php
the only down side is that php is not quite as ubiquitous as say perl or python which is installed on almost every flavor of unix

646937
daemons	systemd
you might want to consider making a mysql triggers that execute a systemd command ffmpeg instead of a daemons

646941
windows-server	windows
the reason i mentioned older versions of windows is that in newer ones vista i know for sure don t know about windows-server 200x the functionality of shutdown has been hobbled a bit

646950
web-config	app-config
it looks in the web-config for web-applications and app-config for windows class library apps

646957
methods	extend
subclasses that extend inputstream are expected to override the close methods should it be needed

646960
hosts-file	hosts
the hosts can be used to filtering online advertising

646964
authentication	login
if the error is occurring only when you navigate to the login module it may be an issue loading the authentication provider

646974
any	set
by packing i mean that for any reasonably large and random data set bytes.length 2 is about the same as packed.length

646990
implements	extends
neither class implements runnable or extends thread so maybe that s the problem

646999
csv	xml
xml vs csv the choice is obvious

647017
abstract-class	subclassing
now in the subclassing i call the run methods of the abstract-class because this should be common to all clients

647026
python	ruby
specifically i d probably throw together something in a scripting language ruby python whatever to read the data and generate pic code that looked the way i wanted

647028
arrays	loops
in my app i loops over the arrays checking for particular conditions position etc.

647039
base-class	inherited
i am seeing in some domain-object models that an abstract base-class is created that implement equals and gethashcode for all domain entity objects to inherited from to gain their identity

647039
subclassing	base-class
if i go toward that direction then i am looking at either overriding the equality of the base-class on the level of subclassing and implements these conditional or have the identity of the entity a string or hash code

647102
json	xml
you can probably tell i m coming at it from a java background but when i see examples in yaml json or even in a dsl i wish xml hadn t ever become popular before people looked for more serious alternatives

647108
pointers	stack
even if your stack was only about 32kb you could store close to eight thousand pointers before it would be an issue

647118
linked-list	tree
if you re implementing it yourself linked-list is probably the easiest otherwise grabbing some appropriately licensed red-black or other type of tree from the internet would be the best option

647128
licensing	platform
joseph.ferris obviously works in a large organization where the cost of switching platform is going to be very very expensive so the cost of paying the licensing costs is much less that the cost of switching

647139
twos-complement	addition
i like bit operations because the code says chopping off the extra bits rather than relying on the effect of addition on numbers expressed in twos-complement notation

647172
registration	login
i have decided to use email as an id but then allow the creation of a username for login purposes after registration

647172
registration	login
i will also be implementing methods to prevent brute-forcing of email addresses out of the registration and login systems mainly a cool-down period after repeated attempts

647213
protected	public
if you declare a methods public protected then it can be overridden by children outside of the package

647213
protected	public
i use package because there is no keyword for it so in the absence of public protected private you get package access

647228
export	report
they can also be very helpful for etl data import and export and later for report and data warehousing

children	nodes
children only looks at the immediate children of the nodes while find traverses the entire dom below the nodes so children should be faster given equivalent implementations

648018
children	nodes
those won t necessarily give the same result will get you any descendant nodes whereas will only get you immediate children that match

648018
children	nodes
at one point find was a lot slower since it had to search for every descendant nodes that could be a match and not just immediate children

649024
emacs	vim
the same is true with emacs as well but for me i find cursor motion much easier on vim

649024
emacs	vim
personally i use emacs to code vim to manipulate text and firefox to look at lolcats

649045
emacs	vim
some people like to work with lightweight texteditors like g vim emacs pico etc

649056
python	c++
this c compatibility is a huge advantage of c++ over something like c# or python bindings where you would have no alternatives if the binding didn t cover part of the api

649059
bug-tracking	fossil
and there s always fossil which is a dvcs with both bug-tracking and wiki built in

emacs	vim
but it s good to mention that you could also figure that out by yourself by reading these kinda posts a lot of users uses vim emacs .

649108
integer	digits
digits sequence in the exponent part is interpreted as a decimal integer

649111
scanf	atof
you are not clear if you mean floating point literal as part of the source code for the compiler to parsing into architecture-dependent binary representation or scanned by library functions such as scanf atof strtol strtod and strtold at run-time to convert to in-memory float double or long double value

649121
jquery	dojo
not sure about why it s not being removed since i don t use dojo but jquery instead

649121
margins	padding
but i ve come into the problem with the animation completing half-way in jquery and it was because of margins padding

649121
margins	padding
add animation to padding and margins to 0 like this

649138
constructor	object
unless the copy constructor is complex it is normally very efficient - after all you are supposed to be doing little more than merely copying the object and copying memory is very fast these days

649148
tripledes	des
i would stick with rijndaelmanaged or tripledes as those are stronger than des

649148
tripledes	des
doing an encryption using des three times is a possible means of strengthening your final result hence tripledes

649155
constructor	object
don t forget to count the copy constructor calls needed to push_back a temporary c object into the vector

649161
logfile	tail
i d run a mixture of top as well as tail -f variables log messages or wherever your main logfile is

649177
click	mouse
at first to determine the rotation direction i was comparing x-coordinnate between the current mouse positioning and the mouse positioning where the user click to initiate the dragging

649192
aes	des
rijndael is what became aes the general replacement to des so it s definitely preferred over des and tripledes unless you need to be compatible with some old des-based system

649202
triggers	insert
i m modifying a textmate tab triggers so that i can insert the full date including the local offset in standard utc format

649206

649266
shell	bash
on a unix system it s an ur-simple shell script bash syntax here

649268
aes	des
weakest fastest rc2 des 3des aes rijndael strongest slowest

649277
3des	des
3des is a trick to reuse des implementations by cascading three instances of des with distinct keys

649277
aes	des
aes is the successor of des as standard symmetric encryption algorithm for us federal organizations and as standard for pretty much everybody else too

649277
3des	aes
using a block cipher properly is not easy and it is more important than selected between aes or 3des

649288
kate	vim
i have consistently used vim or kate but i would prefer a full-blown ide

649292
command-line	cmd
i can run my program from the cmd-line within the dist dir using the following cmd

649295

649320
stream	send
if for instances the client socket sends a few chunks of data and then blocks waiting for data from another datasource before it could send more data the code above may very well assume that the client has finished sending all data since istream.available will return 0 for the current stream of bytes

649322
show	next
if the sender doesn t send more data the next call will show that there s nothing to read

649357
stream	send
either you can go by header and body approach or you can send a special character or symbol for end of stream to break processing loop

649357
stream	send
something like if you send say end on socket to denote end of stream

649372
temporary	copy
if you re working with an ntfs you can create another hardlink to the file in a temporary location you ll avoid the file copy overhead and the first link should still be deletable either the file itself or a containing directory without effecting the second

649374
lookup	any
here is what i have so far for the lookup query - are there any better ways to do this

649375

649418
twitter	tweets
somewhat wacky thought you could try using the twitter api to download a large set of tweets and then classifying a subset of that set using emoticons one positive grouping for d etc and another negative grouping with etc

649421
emacs	vim
vim and emacs both have great communities where people are willing to code up features for just about any language

649421
emacs	vim
so many ides also feature emacs and vim compatibilty modes or extensions

649421
emacs	vim
sooner or later you will choose which suits you vim emacs ide and then stick to improving your skills with it

649431
stream	send
the hard bit is if you don t want the end of the stream but the end of what the server wants to send you at the moment.

649436
portrait	screens
but don t let having portrait screens be an excuse to write a function with many lines

649436
portrait	screens
writing this on stackoverflow using portrait screens -

649442

used for runtime expression binding for control properties through the server tag attributes

649462
defined	declare
yes you can use the defined keyword to declare a multi-line variables like this

649462
ubuntu	linux
i tested it on ubuntu linux with gnu bash 3.2.13

649473
ethernet	packets
if the cable was not of the right type then you could have had connection up but ethernet negotiated to 10mpbs half duplex which can cause a lot of pain to the use who s not aware of it including symptoms like no connect dropped packets and hence slow connection etc

649507
physics-engine	box2d
in box2d physics-engine i can set a motor speed for a joint on my wheel in radians second

i have an 2-d arrays of size n n which will represent a rectangular area map with n rows and n columns

649560
turing-complete	automata
there are other levels of complexity below turing-complete that may also count such as regular grammars and pushdown automata

649600
msbuild	nant
hmm don t know how to do it with msbuild in nant but using nant i ve done it previously like this

649600
msbuild	nant
but then you re using the nant solution task offcourse instead of using msbuild directly

649605
directory	folder
depending on your folder structure and where the css is located relative to the images it is using you will have to go up to the root level of the image directory and access it from there so you could maybe try something like

649629
text-editor	editor
for even better performance map the .xaml extension to the xml editor in tools options text-editor file extension

649637
windows-xp	windows
the idea is to combine the features of a taksbar on windows-xp and sidebar as in windows vista

649644

649707
driver	kernel
a kernel virtual address and then you can mmap it and write a nice device driver

649726
typedef	struct
you cannot use a templates typedef but you can use a convenience class struct with an inner type

649727
derived-class	base-class
the fact that std vector has non-virtual destructor might lead to undefined behaviour according to c++ standard if you ever try to delete a derived-class variables through a pointers to base-class variables

649727
derived-class	base-class
in real world this shouldn t matter in this particular case - the derived-class has nothing new added compared to the base-class and therefore the destructor for the derived-class just calls the destructor for the base-class

649735
function-call	inline
inline functions are expanded in place by the compiler avoiding the overhead of a function-call

649736
emacs	vim
i have only used emacs briefly and while i prefer vim i am jealous of some of its features

649736
emacs	vim
but i ultimately went with vim because i find the chord-input model that emacs uses to put unnecessary strain on my fingers

649744
administration	account
you can actually do this with any administration account

649755
pointers	stack
if you can use subscript notation to access elements and you have pointers to the parent elements you can use a stack to do a depth first traversal and avoid the not-insignificant cost of recursion

649778
pointers	stack
you can however minimise what goes on stack by passing pointers in your recursive calls rather than whole struct

649782
selection	cell
when i pop this table and push a new one the new table cell again will differ in height based on the amount of text content in the new row selection

649785

i try to updates the classloader logic by updating the manifest files

649797
uninstaller	inno-setup
have a look at the section pascal scripting uninstaller code in the inno-setup documentation

649816
virtual-functions	member-functions
classes and member-functions have zero overhead compared to normal functions unless you use virtual-functions in which case there is no overhead compared to using functions pointers

649832
margins	padding
the padding margins did indeed have something to say stopping the animation half-ways

649835
selected	button
after this is selected you should be able to add a current solution to source control or go to view team explorer to open the team explorer view and then press the little button with a plus + on it to connect to your server and then browse source control to open a shared solution from tfs on your computer

649849
solid-principles	principles
when you look at the solid-principless i think you re saying that you are uncomfortable with mediators breaking the basic single responsibility principles

649851
handler	service
i am basically looking for a way to know programmatically the number of handler configured for this web service 3 in this case and a few other handler specific details

649866
assign	add
if you want that the list item act like a link - or in general if you want assign an action to the list item - you should add an tag inside the and use the a hover css selector to assign the background-image of the link on mouse over

649886
stderr	stdout
before launching a child i create stdout and stderr handles to a log file for example if i am about to launch proca i create handles to loga.log

650031
firefox	safari
examples tested in safari + firefox

650032
operators	keyword
now the inequality operators does not quite have the same analogy as the is and isnot keyword since it can be overriden separately from the operators depending on the class

650032
operators	keyword
in your case because you are testing for null nothing it seems you need to use the is or isnot keyword the equality operators will fail because it can t compare the value of null objects

650036
metaphone	soundex
as far as approximation go though for single terms you could use a modification of an algorithm like soundex or metaphone to pick a color

650036
metaphone	soundex
for multiple terms you could for example apply soundex or metaphone to each word individually then sum them up with overflow

650041
interpreter	runtime
take a look at the dlr dynamic language runtime you can easilly embed an interpreter for dynamic languages that run on it in your code

650045
put	get
having dynamic css across the site will cause you issues as the style sheet will get cached so it s better to put all of the style into the file and allow local caching to speed up the page than try to make lots of small css files

650076
macvim	vim
instead i use vim or macvim if you prefer

650090
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i also copied basically what was the asp.net-mvc view page into a new standard webforms page in this project

650092
google-chrome	firefox

650097
centering	fixed
my problem is in following when i try to include additional page in iframe on the centering of current page and that new page contains some flash object that object is not not visible in iframe its here but its above the fixed flash object if i remove positioning fixed

650115
constructor	object
if you do not do that myclass constructor will try to instantiate an a object as it would for any member object which is not possible since a is abstract

650116
authentication	login
we could only login using windows authentication by being on the actual server

650165

650217
primitive	int
you can only use switch on primitive such as int char and enum

650229
selected	button
if you can t or don t want to use a button setting the normal image to an empty box and the selected image to a checked box

650231
.net	wcf
one relatively straight forward way to implement such an ipc mechansim in .net is to use wcf and expose the interface you need in a wcf endpoint

650233
value	field
in this example i want to set the value of 3 field to equal a 4th

650241
revision	svn
another solution is to add a rule to your build tool makefile whatever which uses svn info on the root directory of your project to determine the current revision and puts that into a temporary file which is not added to your repo

650243
g++	gcc
dmitry is correct you should use -lstdc++ if you use gcc but even better is to use g++ instead

650252
keyboard	mouse
i did find that subscribing to the windows keypressevent did give me keyboard events but not mouse click events

650260
.net	wcf
.net wcf side you ll find that the

650281
priority-queue	queue
however if you really need a queue as opposed to a sorted collection then the inbuilt priority-queue may be of use

650299
unsigned	integer
in this case your constants don t need to be unsigned so just use int in c# or integer in vb.net

650303
32-bit	64bit
note that on 64bit operating systems this will be reflected to the 32-bit section of the registry see this microsoft article for more information on registry reflection

650357
.net	wcf
we have a wcf .net 3.5 sp1 service running in iis7 which is marked to allow asp.net compatibility mode so we can access httpcontext.current

650391
transfer-encoding	chunked
you can use chunked transfer-encoding

650391
transfer-encoding	chunked
basically you send a transfer-encoding chunked header and then the data is sent in chunked mode meaning that you send the length of a chunk followed by the chunk

650403
web-config	app-config
it allows you to provide a seperate file that can override selected values from the main app-config or web-config

650437
button	slide
the problem i m running in to is with the button not passing any touches to the uiscrollview - if i try to flick slide and happen to press on the button it doesn t register for the uiscrollview but if i flick the space between button it will work

650443
dynamic-binding	overrides
your example mixes the dynamic-binding when methods are overrides and static binding when methods are overloaded

650454
return-value	undefined
if you failed to have a return statement at all the return-value is undefined and many older compilers wouldn t warn you about this it s true - i ve seen it

650463

contains	set
there s an opening bracket which is a macros containing try and a closing bracket that contains a set of catch es wrapping of exception-handling into errorinfo and producing hresults

650533
python	java
of course you could supply a c faã ade to the c++ library but once you re doing that c++ is no different to java or python

650572
entity-framework	ado.net
i m just starting developing with ado.net entity-framework and i don t know how i would write this

650587
decrement	increment
i though of using a coounter aka com referece count increment it for reach thread that starts and decrement it in a callback and of keeping a dynamic list with a reference to each thread in it to explicitly keep track of each one as they complete but both of these solutions seem kinda kludgy.

650603
any	set
the potential function y assigns a number to every vertex in your complete bipartite graph in such a way that the sum of potentials of any vertex from s the set of all people and any vertex from t the set of all jobs is smaller than the value of the edge connecting these vertices so smaller than the cost of the person doing the job

650634
administration	account
now looking to do it programatically using visual c# and also how to access a file using administration account in a simple user account

650652
function-call	inline
if we assume the compiler inline the call to the get function of a property so i do not have to save the return-value in a local variables to avoid function-call

650663

icart specifies a getter and setter for cartitems but your implementation only has a get

650690
persistence	hibernate
java persistence with hibernate christian bauer and gavin king

650697
rollback	commit
you should probably let the lifestyle of the session be controlled by something outside of your repositories - if you are doing asp.net web-applications you might want to save the session in the current request httpcontext.current.items if i recall correctly for the duration of the web request and then commit and dispose at the end of the request or rollback if an exception-handling occurs

650710
any	set
when someone changes the build quality to in staging this causes any previous in staging builds to be set to rejected and causes that build to be pushed to our staging servers while updating the configuration files to point to the correct servers

650717
realloc	malloc
and no it won t get freed when it goes out of scope - when you use malloc or realloc it s all up to you

650717
realloc	free
after realloc pointers might be pointing to an entirely different place in memory and continuing to use the original value of pointers could leave you using memory that s been free and which isn t as big as you think it is

650721
realloc	malloc
yes you need to free everything you allocate with malloc and realloc and the other related c style memory allocation functions

650723
realloc	malloc
realloc should only be used to reallocate memory allocated by malloc what you are doing works only by accident and will eventually crash horribly

650734
rhino-mocks	moq
i used to use rhino-mocks but since i discovered moq i only use moq

650741
realloc	malloc
realloc is illegal here the address has to be null or an address returned by an earlier call to realloc malloc or calloc

650741
pointers	stack
every variables you declare is on stack even a pointers

650752
realloc	free
trying to free or realloc a stack variables can lead to undefined behaviour including but not limited to corrupted stack leading to unpredictable flow of control corrupted heap service structures corrupted user memory

650756
realloc	malloc
therefore you provide either a null pointers or a pointers to something allocated by malloc or realloc or calloc and store the pointers returned

650765
msbuild	psake
if you don t like msbuild you could also check out psake

650779

depending on the data format you might be able to use the data-url to load the image

650826
globalization	localization
globalization and localization in .net

650827
hide	show
i think the best way to accomplish it however is to create the item normally as part of the page and just hide it using a css style until you want to show it via javascript rather than creating it from scratch dynamically

650837
directory	folder
otherwise ghost should be able to just pick some folder and files and not only complete os s so that might be a better choice not sure if you can deploy the software in other directory than the one on the master machine though

650861
lookup	any
someone has already benchmarking this and it looks as though the trig.math functions are already optimized and will be faster than any lookup table you can come up with

650862
realloc	malloc
mystring is not allocated with malloc or calloc so it can t be reallocated with realloc or freed with free

650864
puts	gets
gets puts do as well but when i try to do a post to an action in my service i get the following error returned

650869
udp	tcp
these restrictions are somewhat less strict for udp sockets than for tcp sockets so you may still be able to do whatever you are trying to do

650875
configuration	environment
i have various resources that i want to keep at hand in the solution explorer such as alternate configuration files for various environment but i don t really want to publish them to the server

650886

650958
dictionary	map
var map new dictionary

650959
variables	boolean
i was wondering if anyone could explain to me how i could properly bind a grouping of radio buttons to a boolean variables in the model using jface data binding

650959
variables	boolean
i would like to create a binding to a boolean variables in the model in such a way that when a user selects the yes radio button the boolean is set to true and when he she selects the no button the boolean is set to false

650959
selected	button
however because of this once the no button is selected the value of the boolean remains unchanged since no swt.selection event on the yes button was fired

651087
constructor	object
constructor is a pre-defined dontenum property of the object pointed to by the prototype property of a function object and will initially point to the function object itself

651087
constructor	object
when you create an object with the new operator its internal prototype property will be set to the object pointed to by the constructor function s prototype property

651087
constructor	object
this means that .constructor will evaluate to .__proto__.constructor ie the constructor function used to create the object and as we have learned the protoype property of this function was used to set the object s prototype

for a more thorough treatment of this including exactly how you d calculate the entropy for any arbitrary sequences of digits with a few examples checkout this short whitepaper

651216
abstract	extends
when i create a new class and extends system.windows.forms.panels the designer does not work nearly as elegantly - it simply show some kind of abstract list-type view of the components contains in the panels as opposed to showing the actual layout of the controls in the panels.

651218
fckeditor	wysiwyg
the fckeditor should handle the html conversion and to if you paste it in to the wysiwyg portion not the source view

651229
internet-explorer	firefox
i have noticed that internet-explorer is more aggressive at caching ajax calls than firefox is

651237
base-class	subclass
each subclass knows basic things about the domain of the base-class but i m trying to keep it minimal

you also need to ensure that the triggers themselves properly handle multiple row insert and not not not through a cursor

651370
nsurlconnection	nsxmlparser
before this project i just built reused a couple of classes to handle the nsurlconnection and nsxmlparser work but instead of type introspection i used the delegation pattern

651378
integer	zero
a null pointer constant is an integral constant expression 5.19 rvalue of integer type that evaluates to zero

651378
variables	boolean
an assignment of null to a bool variables will try to convert null to a boolean value

651378
integer	zero
as we just read a null pointer constant is some integer value that s zero

651378
integer	zero
because it is a integral constant expression that is essentially an integer value that is known at compile time with value zero

651388
contains	any
it can contains some rows but since the a-mark in k cannot be said to be equal to any value that exists in that referenced relation there s no way to say that the hypothetical missing value satisfies the constraint

651413
hide	show
you can then show or hide the sets depending on what is currently showing on the map you can find the boundary of the map using gmap2.getbounds

651413

though simics is non-free i highly recommend it and its built in debugging profiling tools while making your kernel

651449
filtering	sorting
searching sorting filtering which all implies the internal upercassing engine of tdxmemdataset it s a repeated action

651449
filtering	sorting

.when	ready
having the data in the database ready to expose reduces the risk of processing errors .when you ll write if you ll write other modules you need to remember to ansiuppercase the data in any module in any language you ll write

651451
server-side-includes	ssi
if you are using apache you could use ssi server-side-includes

651452

python	perl
serialization needs of perl python

651487
ruby	php
ruby tcl php javascript and java

651508
coding-style	readability

651535
any	set
is there any way to set my default file location

651543
directory	folder
visual-studio save the reference location as relative paths so put in the a folder in your project and make sure the it proprieties copy local is true it will make the vs to copy the file to the output directory

651565
any	set
with a permutation i mean any tree that has the exact same set of leaves

651571
default-value	default
however that default constructor has to give a default-value for the foo.somefoo field

651595
contains	elements
at this point pieces is an arrays and pieces.length contains the size of the arrays so to get the last elements of the arrays you check

651595
spaces	output
if there are no commas or spaces it will simply output the string as it was given

651601
event-log	logfile
on the server you ll probably want to do some logging either to the event-log or to a logfile

651605
decimal	hex
the newline character has a hex value of 0xa or 10 in decimal

651607
python	java
this is a relatively common question for people transitioning from strongly type languages like c++ or java to more weakly or dynamically typed languages like python ruby or objective-c

651607
defined	declare
if you control the source code for the instances which implements the methods s you wish to call the more common approach would be to defined a protocols that contains those methodss and declare that the classes in question implements that protocols in their declaration

651610
contains	set
you also haven t mentioned if the treeview contains links the navigateurl property is set or text items that postback for each click

651619
execute	prepare
what is the advantage of that methods can i use one try catch block instead of several nested if else blocks to handle all errors for the different steps connect prepare execute etc.

651628
environment	execution
i have a feeling that it s not execution in a normal shell environment

651629
conditional	parentheses
it does not catch if-statement that contains strings with unmatched parentheses in their conditional or statement sections

651632
exception-handling	try-catch
in general try-catch blocks are great because they will break move to the catch statement whenever the exception-handling occurs

651636
binary	hex
in computer engineering it s easier to deal with hexadecimal addresses than decimal numbers since addresses and data inside the computer s memory is binary and can be directly represented as a hex number

651636
decimal	hex
the hex num width function converts a decimal number to its hexadecimal form

651637
innodb	myisam
all the tables support it innodb tables support it but myisam tables don t

651637
create-table	alter-table
alter-table drop table create-table etc causes the transaction to commit

651641
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch is used when an exception-handling can be thrown from the code and you catch it in the catch-clause which is an object oriented way to handle errors

651641
exception-handling	try-catch
you can t catch exception-handling with if else blocks - they share nothing with try-catch

651643
error-handling	try-catch
try-catch totally separates the error-handling logic from the object business logic

651645
exception-handling	try-catch
you should not use try-catch to handle everything in most cases because a useful exception-handling could be raised and you can learn about the presence of a bug from it

651650
exception-handling	try-catch
if the exception-handling are only thrown in rare circumstances then you re better off with a try-catch to avoid the overhead of branching in a tight loop

651671
mime	rfc
mime type of the csv is text csv according to rfc 4180

651677
filesystems	xfs
could someone provide or point me to a list of all the illegal characters in the xfs filesystems

651683
hide	show
the goal is to let the user to hide show move resize columns to save this layout and to be able to restore it when the app re-starts

651686
exception-handling	try-catch
the advantage of try-catch and exception-handling in general is more for the people developing libraries like pdo

651687
binary-tree	tree
seems like the most straightforward solution would be a depth-first traversal of your tree to collect all of the nodes into a list generate all of the permutations of list dump each permutation into binary-tree

651700
png	gif
i would like to have jquery limit a file upload field to only jpg jpeg png and gif

651705
credentials	account
under any other circumstances the user will be prompted for credentials username and password for an account within the active directory domain

keyboard	mouse
ctrl+alt+del is blocked via a keyboard filtering driver and the rest of the keys and mouse are currently blocked using the blockinput function from user32.dll

651709
pointers	stack
if the time spent in the process of virtual function invocations is significant like say 20 then on the average 1 out of 5 samples will show at the bottom of the call stack in the disassembly windows the instructions for following the virtual function pointers

651735
value	field
you can get the value of a file field just the same as any other field

651738
interop	tlbimp
i have a legacy vb6 component that i ve imported into vs using tlbimp to generate my interop assembly

651744

651761
filesystems	xfs
according to wikipedia any character except nul is legal in an xfs filesystems file name

651764
backwards-compatibility	compatibility
for that matter i haven t had any compatibility issues anywhere with 2.6 but obviously switching to python3k isn t exactly recommended if you re concerned about backwards-compatibility

651780
function-call	inline
it can t inline the function-call because it doesn t know at compile-time which function will be called

651788
filesystems	xfs
posix filesystems including xfs allow every character in file names with the exception of nul 0x00 and forward-slash

651811
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch is an actual exception-handling mechanism - so if you change your exceptions it will automatically work on all try-catch statements

651811
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch gives the opportunity to run code even in the case of a major exception-handling that might kill the if else and in addition the try statement can be rolled back if you re savvy

651843
directory	folder
i know the user i m authentication with has a backup folder in his directory

651855
grouping	sorting
i am attempting to export a query from ms-access into ms excel in a way that does not carry over the sorting and grouping

651858

you could also look at the runas cmd but i m not sure if that would meet your needs or not

651863
windows-media-player	embed
you can embed it in the same way you did with windows-media-player

651876
placeholder	required
but wouldn t changing .required to .wasreq as a placeholder to differentiate this from one which maybe wouldn t be required on checking the box do the same thing

651885
access-control	authentication
from there click the directory security tab and click edit by authentication and access-control

651905
powerpc	arm
this is only really a problem for low-volume embedded platforms and perhaps novel research architectures so if by any computer you mean any x86 powerpc arm sparc alpha etc

651913
constructor	object
i hesitate to even call it an object at this point since no constructor was ever called

651913
realloc	malloc
i hope this example makes it clear - the variables are the same size and the amount of additional memory allocated by malloc realloc is the same as well

651919
instances	private
extension methods cannot access the extended class s private state - extension methods look like instances but are still static

651934
abstract-class	subclassing
it still makes sense in a code-organizational context to put public int getcalories in abstract-class food as it d be silly for the person eating it the code using a subclassing of food to define how many calories it has

651944
abstract-class	subclassing
an abstract-class should contains default implementations behaviors the subclassing can override

651952
base-class	inherited
do use inherited if the behavior is part of the logical behavior of the base-class

651953
buffering	streaming
this would make it possible to do things like inherit from a non-streaming class and add streaming functionality and make it more natural to add potentially useful streaming methods like dump streaming contents to memory buffering

651961
textbox	button
i have to create the div element add it to the document and then add the children textbox and submit button

651967
32-bit	64bit
given that it should be obvious why int is only 32-bit on a 64bit platform

651969
any	set
note that anything that modifies your user-interface from another thread must be done within a dispatcher.invoke or dispatcher.begininvoke call wpf does not allow you to get or set dependencyproperty values from any thread but the one where the object was created more about this here

651971
postgresql	mysql
for example gis extensions for mysql and for postgresql both follow opengis simple features specification for sql standard

you can just reference the assembly and convert your html document to a system.xml.xmldocument you can easily pinpoint the html nodes that contains your required data and use the use the children nodess to add into your data

651987
collabnet	sharpsvn
collabnet have a open source product called sharpsvn

652006
protected	public
if you can t change the schema you might want to make the designer generated accessor private protected and create a public accessor to front-end the property in a partials class implementation

652057
required	checked
in the base controllers i d override the onactionexecuting methods to checked the session for the required variables

652068
updating	updates
i m trying to updates an image _browserscreenshot below object in xaml by changing the source image every time an event determines the source needs updating

652107
nhibernate	ado.net
i have an ado.net statement i want to convert to use nhibernate

652127
binary-tree	nodes
so i ve come up with this scheme for locking nodes when rotating in a binary-tree that several threads have both read and write access to at the same time which involves locking four nodes per rotation which seems to be an awfully lot

652134
json	xml
roll-our-own using json or some other data-to-text serialization system php s serialize xml etc etc

652146
json	xml
as per xml well what you gain here are standard rest webservices and it doesn t depend on flash you could pull data from a desktop app as well for example whereas using json or any other technology dependent on browsers don t allow for that

652164
mouseleave	mouseenter
i think it is impossible to do without handling the mouseenter and mouseleave events of all the children but you do not have to wire them manually

652165
malloc	free
hello world is a constant string literal you need to allocate memory using malloc in c or new in c++ if you want memory you are free to modify

652193
typedef	struct

unsigned	short
unsigned short m_short1

652193
unsigned	short
unsigned short m_short2

652193

652193
boost-asio	boost
a href rel noreferrer i m trying to following boost serialization tutorial a a href some other so questions have suggested a but the example is specifically for writing reading to a file not to a socket using boost-asio

652196
create-table	alter-table
the only way to do this is during the create-table statement of by using an alter-table statement after the table has been created

652197
protected	public
i m about to sub-class accordion just to make protected function get contentheight number a public function

652217
constructor	object
however the language runtime does not really guarantee that other threads cannot see a partially constructed object - it depends what the constructor does

652225
order	add
if you want to add values and have the list remain in order it s cleaner and probably still faster to just sort the whole thing

652232
getter	setter
as an example map nhib onto private fields or private property setter and only expose property getter publicly

652241
32-bit	64bit
thus on all platforms int is 32-bit and long is 64bit

652243
string.format	stringbuilder
rather than calling string.replace for each word or constantly append to a stringbuilder you could put the words in an order arrays and use string.format in jdk 1.5 or newer or messageformat.format in jdk 1.4

652243
void	main
public static void main string arguments

652269
entity-framework	ado.net
is there a way to extract common columns from various tables into a single base class in the ado.net entity-framework when using the edmx designer

652273
stream	send
you could use boost.iostreams library for define your own stream which will send data over network instead file or just use asio socket streams

652273
iostream	boost
it is a good way we did something similar on this but we have few streams zip encrypt send and used boost iostream library for all operation

652285
order	add
i wanted to add an index with multiple fields to optimize this query so i added a key i named previous_by_author with these three keys in this order

652286
firefox	safari
take a look at either in safari or firefox then in ie7 and you ll see what i mean

652286

i need to hash a string using the md5 technique in cocoa

652311
sortedset	sortedmap
i need to iterate through sortedmap s entry set which is a sortedset backwards

652313
restart	reload
the problem is your music is restart because you re reload the page each time

652314
wlan	ssid
the available wlan network ssid s

652317
hash	md5
but if you just want to hash something using md5 on an iphone this should give you the information you need

652324
mbunit	nunit
in the .net world you would run these small bits of code using something like nunit or mbunit or even the built in testing tools in visual-studio

652325
istream	ostream
thus any oarchive can use any ostream and any iarchive can use any istream

652329
hash	md5
md5 is not encryption it is a cryptography hash function

652329
hash	md5
the fact that it is cryptography means that it is a computationally hard problem that given an md5 hash output compute a string whose md5 is that value

652341
comparator	sortedmap
you could define a sortedmap such as a treemap with a custom comparator that reverses the sorting order

652377
worksheet	excel
firefox identifies the file as an excel 97-2003 worksheet

652409
build-system	jam
take a look at ant jam and other build-system tools

652411
subscript	zero
i am assuming c and zero based subscript for the example

652428
sql-server	oracle
i need an sql query for both oracle and sql-server that will format each amount with the correct number of decimal places preserving any trailing zeroes as illustrated above

652431
cursor	row
to account for a multi row insert you would have to cursor through the proc

652431
triggers	insert
if i have written the actions i want to do properly in the triggers it will only update delete or insert where columns have changed

652431
updating	updates
as you can see it would only updates the lnames that are different than what is currently in the table i am updating

652460
python	php
is there a rule or any type of analogy with another programming language like python or php that uses an appdelegate like pattern

652467

hide	show
in response to your comment i have put a number of the show hide sections on this example and all appears to work fine for me in ie6 and firefox 3

652486
value	field
for example if that special modifying parameter value is 1 it adds a field in the selected and adds a grouping by clause to the query

652487
any	set
any easy way of checking if foo.bar is already set and if it s not just forcing it to nil

652495
message	alert
you will still see the b alert message when click the page

652503
progress-bar	progress
what i would like to do is have the parent process monitor the progress of each forked process and display something like a progress-bar as the processes run

652511
stderr	stdout
this seems a decent solution and is especially useful in places where you would want to print an error but no longer have access to stdout stderr etc

652512
getter	setter
the insert magic refers to handling each call to the generic property getter or setter that has a different type for the type parameter

652512
getter	setter
i would envisage that for each type t if the getter is called before the setter is called then default t is returned

652512
getter	setter
when the setter is called the value is stored per type t so that when the getter is subsequently called the previous value that was set for that type is returned

652517
linux	unix
in some versions of unix and linux there s a banner command usually usr bin banner that prints great output like this

652564
inherited	subclass
if a class inherited from another the memory used by the subclass is packed by hind the memory of the parent class but a flexible arrays needs to be at the end the structure class

652579
sql-server	oracle
martlark s answer for oracle led me to this solution for sql-server

652587
ms-access	oracle
i get the sense that oracle apex is for dba with little or no programing knowledge to setup a web app quickly sort like ms-access for none programmer

652593
selected	textbox
you might need to give focus to the textbox to see the actual selection happening either before or after selected it might not matter but you ll have to try

652596
rollback	commit
your top-level transaction will not commit until all dependenttransactions have successfully committed and vice-versa with rollback

652596
rollback	commit
i ve found this as an easy way to do all or nothing across threads as long as the operation you re invoking encapsulates commit rollback functionality ienlistmentnotification or the like

652617
multiplying	subtract
this creates 4 button one for adding subtract dividing and multiplying

652617
multiplying	subtract
multiplying and adding works perfectly no problems at all but when the user tries to subtract it always returns 0

652624
ftp	scp
failing all that you could use a generic file transfer utility like ftp or scp -

652645

i m surprised your addition and multiplication are working.

652654
any	set
is there any way i can set these parameters programatically

652661
recording	playing
fms by adobe provides the option for recording and playing streams

652665
.when	ready
what is your personal check .when you are getting ready to deploy a application on a new windows-server

652669
getter	setter
but many developers tend to put computationally intensive or relatively long-running code in the getter and setter where they would be much more appropriate as methods

652698

i have a uiscrollview that has multiple pages of information that are added as subviews to the scrollview

652719
expression	evaluation
if all you re trying to do is count how many times a cmd scripting is called you can just append one character to a file every time it runs rather than fiddling around with expression evaluation every time the scripting is run

652719
put	get
to get a count of the number of calls to date you can use the file size environment variables modifier as in the following scripting i expect this will be done less often than running the scripting so it s better to put the grunt work here in fact it s not a lot of grunt work since it s not counting the characters rather it gets the information directly from the directory entry

652727
administration	account
disable the administration account

default-value	default
the c# will initialize all values to their default-value 0 for numbers null for reference-type which is equivalent to the .net 2.0 default operator

652768
arrays	loops
assuming you released or autoreleased each view controller after you put it in your viewcontrollers arrays there s no need loops over objects in viewcontrollers and release them -- the arrays will do it for you

652769
arrays	loops
nsarrays releases its contents when it s dealloced so the objects are being released both in your loops â which is presumably deallocing them â and afterward by the arrays

652771

dlopen	dlsym
i ve used the older-style dll-functions but if you re at a high-enough level there are also the newer dlopen dlsym c helper functions

652792
put	get
this page seems to offer up another option where you can put the dll program into the same load module as the calling program and use static calls to get to it

652803
dictionary	for-loop
the for-loop is an inevitable consequence of your data structure which is why everyone is advising you to consider dictionary instead

652804
linq-to-objects	ilist
for example i had never realized how often i was exposing ilist instead of ienumerable when it wasn t absolutely necessary until i started using linq-to-objects frequently

652809
external	root
your external client does have the right to access the iorderlinesrepository directly via the interface to obtain a reference of a value object within your aggregate root

i actually grouping all of my aggregate root creations into multiple factories

652817
sctp	tcp
i am considering using sctp instead of tcp for a p2p app written in c

652817
sctp	tcp
also how does the speed of sctp compare to the speed of tcp

652817
sctp	udp
i found that sctp can be tunneled over udp with the only problem being tunneled sctp is not interoperable with untunneled sctp

652828
spawn	exit
your easiest solution may be to just spawn a little helper process that runs in whatever directory you specify c and then just exit and let it do its thing

652836
administration	account
i tries logging in with the administration account and execution the asp.net-mvc install but still can t get the templates in visual-web-developer

653000
purely-functional	scheme
you re right almost if you re implementing a purely-functional subset of scheme no set

653000

i m looking for a string similarity algorithm that yields better results on variables length strings than the ones that are usually suggested levenshtein distance soundex etc

653158
strong-typing	types
strongly-typesd elements not only describe the data more sensibly but when i use them for xml mapping in excel and this is the whole purpose behind these things the strong-typing means that excel sets the cell formatting correctly based on the types

653161
textbox	button
i have to create the div element add it to the document and then add the children textbox and submit button

653176
command-line	cmd

653197
dom4j	jdom
dom4j i think was forked from the earlier jdom

653203

it uses two macros which avois having to update templates arguments in implementation file be careful though if you want to add default templates arguments to the class

653277
wmic	cmd
use the wmic code creator and a little vb script and you can obtain precisely the informations you want need as opposed to the static systeminfo cmd

653308
integer	digits
in those rare use cases where bcd is the right answer then storing them in an unsigned long 8 digits ten s complement or an unsigned 64-bit integer room for 16 digits ten s complement or 15 digits plus sign and flags and using a carefully crafted arithmetic library to manipulate them makes sense

653322
reflection	runtime
it can be used to decorate types so that you can find out it the type is correct at runtime with out using reflection

653334
access-control	authentication
control the operating system level permissions with acls access-control lists so only the authentication users on the computer have access to those objects

653376
perl	php
i m not familiar with any such convention in python perl java php javascript or bash shell scripting

653380
ghostscript	imagemagick
i know imagemagick uses ghostscript to do the conversion and if i do it directly with gs i can get the desired results but i d rather use the convert library as it has other tools i d like to leverage

653384
verilog	rtl
i am assigned with the task of verifying some verilog based rtl code

653384
verilog	rtl
now coding the rtl testbench using verilog seems to be very difficult for me

i have written code in the page behind to bind value to the non pick-list field

653395
linux	aix
oracle is available on windows linux and aix amongst others

653407
windows	ms-dos
it can be saved via notepad for example in a file with the extension .com and it can be run on ms-dos most clones of ms-dos and even in the ms-dos compatibility mode of the windows command prompt including on vista but not on any 64-bit windows since they decided that compatibility with 16-bit real mode was no longer a priority.

653407
command-prompt	cmd
disassembling and dumping eicar.com with the debugging cmd at a cmd-prompt on my xp box i see

653416

how can i get this child element of dockpanel to dock on the top with no other items in the dockpanel

653462
entity-relationship	diagram
doxygen can create entity-relationship diagram directly from source code

653478
parentheses	keyword
using keyword arguments with default values as suggested by kquinn is a good idea but will require you to include the parentheses

653495
command-line	cmd
patterns read from the command-line for those cmd that support them

653495
contains	any
patterns read from a .gitignore file in the same directory as the path or in any parent directory with patterns in the higher level files up to the root being overridden by those in lower level files down to the directory contains the file

you can even ignore a folder content git update-index --assume-unchanged on directory

653506
jquery	.post
i am using the .post function of jquery but when the event actually fires i get this error microsoft jscript runtime error is undefined

653506
jquery	.post
does this mean that the jquery library has been deferenced before the .post function was called and so i will not longer be able to use jquery

653514
put	get
the correct number of shoppingbasketitem s also get put into however both the itemid and itemquantity of each are zero

653524

i have to click next to the textbox to selected the listbox item

653524
listbox	textbox
is there some property i need to set for the textbox to forward the click event to the listbox

653533
listbox	textbox
the listbox handles item selection but does not know about focus of the textbox embedded within

653533
listbox	textbox
if you want to change the selection whenever a textbox gets input focus then you need to change the listbox selection manually afaik

653551
defined	declare
you also haven t declare the a a constructor so you will get a semantic error when you attempt to defined it

653554
32-bit	64bit
however if you use a pointer as in case#2 the amount of memory needed is known because all pointers occupy the same amount of memory 32-bit or 64bit depending on the system

653560
populate	row
all columns are always present if not populate in each row

653568
value	field

i am currently in the preparation phase for a new project that will be developed with .net compact-framework 2.0 or 3.5 we ll see and will run on a custom windows ce 6 hardware

653589
constructor	private
used from public methods or possibly constructor - so the public methods depends on the private ones to succeed with their assignments

653619
installation	building
so maybe the installation instructions or the ant building file is out of date

653639
webforms	asp.net
definitely it s built upon the highly performant asp.net framework and doesn t bring a lot of the webforms baggage with it

653639
webforms	asp.net
if they are only familiar with asp.net webforms drag-and-drop-with-some-code-behind then they will have a whole new paradigm to learn which will take time

653665
button	popup
however when i get to 9 goes and its a draw a message box popup and says draw but i cant seem to get the button to restore themselves to the original state to allow for a new round

653668
filtering	grouping
just grab the data from the database and according to the user provided parameters filtering it grouping it and send as a collection of beans to the jasper report which will do the rendering

653685
getter	setter
properties can have different accessibility for the getter and setter

653692
plugins	add-on
the add-on for firefox is free and there is a free plugins for ie too

653697
malloc	free
my idea is to pass two function pointers - for common allocation and deallocation functions - to every dll in some initialization initialize malloc free and then do all memory-management using these common and thus always compatible functions

653698
value	field
i though it might be possible to make just profilingversion and profilingvalue generic and then have the profiling object assign a type to the profilingversion depending on the value of the profilingdescription field but i cannot find a way to do this

653731
triggers	insert
create an update and insert triggers to update the columns

653762
malloc	free
when developing using win32 is there a reason you want to use function pointers to malloc free

653762
malloc	free
why are you not simply using malloc free directly

653765
put	get
from mysql query i get data which i put into a dictionary d

653772
moss	wss
edit i ve found this to be useful to suggest to people who didn t realize moss isn t free like asp.net or wss

653799
ref	out
fields can be used as input to out ref arguments

653799
getter	setter
properties support different accessibility for getter setter - fields do not but fields can be made readonly

653816
linked-list	arrays
i would opt for a sparse arrays a linked-list of linked-lists to give maximum flexibility with minimum storage

653816
linked-list	arrays
one thing you could do is make one dimension non-sparse such as making the columns the primary arrays rather than linked-list and limiting them to 1 000 - this would make the column lookup indexed fast then a search on the sparse rows

653816
duplicates	lookup
i don t think you can ever get o 1 for a text lookup simply because text can be duplicates in multiple cells unlike row column

653821
xhtml	tidy
if you don t have valid xhtml which a comment posted reminded me of you should at first apply jtidy to tidy up the html and make it valid xhtml

653825
internet-explorer	firefox
they have special firefox plugin but it should work fine with internet-explorer

653831
zend-framework	symfony
i m personally using symfony with zend-framework for some stuff i need mail openid lucene search but have played a bit with django and i like it

653844
attributes	properties
if you are looking for a specific properties you can just use the fail task with the unless attributes

653853
select	union
the most simple solution will be combining 12 select statements in a union

653855
arrays	loops
i have to access both the string arrays outside the loops

653877
for-loop	arrays
both asd and def are string arrays whose scope is limited to the for-loop

653887
python	java
linkedhashmap is the java implementation of a hashtable like data structure dict in python with predictable iteration order

653889
macros	let
more that just functions macros let you perform operations using the symbols in the source file

653895
dictionary	arrays
the dictionary serializes as a key value arrays

653903
atoi	atof
parsing input by yourself atoi atof usually boosts speed at least twice compared to universal read methods

653911

basically the result should be the same as if the user checked the switch primary and secondary button checkbox in the mouse properties through the control panel

653912
contains	any
for further information read this proposal which contains a fix for a next version of the c standard which eventually will require signed char not have any padding bits either

653921
variables	boolean
if i declare a javascript boolean variables like this

653927
variables	boolean
you can also pass the non boolean variables into the new boolean and it will make isloggedin boolean

653937
while-loop	loops
i have created a while-loops in which temporary strings are created string is updated everytime that loops performs

653961
conditional	operators
conditional operators like if and case

653974
fogbugz	svn
layout separation of concerns issues aside it d be nice to have a breakpoint plug-in that would allow you to load breakpoints depending on which bugzilla jira fogbugz svn defect entry you re working off of

653977
arrays	loops
because your question didn t explain the content and relationships between the two arrays being processed in your loops i ve just treated them independently. this isn t complete code but just a sketch to get you started

653985
swing	swt
i ve used both swing and swt although never in the same application project before

653985
any	set
as long as your not trying to mix components together within the same windows i don t see any reason you can t have completely separate windows dialog each using a specific widget set

653985
swing	swt
however trying to mix swt and swing within a single windows would likely never work or at the very least cause lots of problems since both widget sets rely on completely different means of drawing layout - swing s components are all handled directly within java and are completely separated from the underlying os while swt explicitly relies on the underlying os to do all or most of the gui rendering

653985
swing	swt
swing and swt have two completely different philosophies and underlying architectures

653985
swing	swt
in fact swt was born from the fact that ibm oti did not like the approach that was taken with swing and so chose to implement their own widgets

653994
blender	3ds
i saw that oolong uses 3ds and i m not sure if blender exports that format or not so i could be wrong

654008
value	field
i want in the case of an empty data reader to output the field names with empty value

654010
conditional	operators
here i have used if conditional and while loops but no arithmetic operators involved

654031
environment	building
java tm 2 runtime environment standard edition building 1.5.0_16-b06-284

654035
low-level	hardware
understand your code and understand the hardware you re running on and you can do most low-level optimizations

654035
inlining	inline
but it can t simply inline g without inlining f because f might be called from other places as well where it is passed a different function-pointers

654049
double	int
my reason for that is that this call does not explicitly contain the type of the argument so if later on you decide to change it from int to double there is no need to modify this call

654057
bitwise-operators	operators
just digging into the jquery source i ve found a couple of places where bitwise-operatorss are used for example only the operators

654072
double	int
my reason for that is that this call explicitly contains the type of the argument so if later on you decide to change it from int to double it is clear that this call has changed

654074
radio-button	selected
i have a menu in my wpf application with multiple options which act like a radio-button grouping selected one deselects rest of them

654074
selected	button
selected and unselected items do not seem to be synchronized with radio button values

654089

654134
floating	margins
in my case i ve been more keen on using the approach of margins width careful floating adjustments and sometimes the occasional table

654142
decrement	increment
++p is usually faster than p++ and --p is faster than p-- especially for objects of types with overloaded prefix and postfix increment and decrement operators because prefix form just increments or decrement something and returns the new value whereas the postfix form increments or decrement something but has to keep the old value somewhere to return it

654163
boost-asio	boost
it is heavily based on boost using boost-asio for all network code

freebsd	linux
gprof on linux freebsd is a quite simple and efficient tool to identify which routines are hogging the cpu at runtime

654209
contains	elements
your page contains a div with the id container and hence ie assumes the kwick code is is trying to assign a value to a com based elements s default property dom elementss do not have a default property hence the does not support error

654220
highlight	selected
i noticed that emacs always selected c highlight style for a .h header but c++ for hpp or hh

ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu handles this with a cronjob defined in etc cron.d php5

654348

any	set
but if you want to check if there is any other object on the page higher that what you will set dynamically you can check this out

654375
addition	formula
in addition to all useful answers the following formula may provide even more efficiency -- calculating fn in o log n instead of o 2 n

654380
value	field
i would like to be able to modify the value of a field when triggers an error

654380
value	field
for example if there is an error the form should be redisplayed with the field value corrected by clean and an error message data has been corrected below

654380
value	field
it display the error correctly but the field value is not updated with the corrected html when the form is redisplayed

654380
value	field
i d also like to do the same thing with a field but since the errors are triggers by exception-handling i don t get a chance to return the corrected value

654383
contains	any
the modelloactor contains any global data and also serves as an accessor to all viewmodels

654387
graphviz	jgraph
you could look at jgraph though i have never used it so cannot comment on now it compares to graphviz

654389
code-coverage	ncover
if you are familiar with code-coverage tool cobertura for java and ncover for c# that s one of its important features

654423
cassini	iis
my problem is that the page behaves differently when running on iis and on the inbuilt asp.net webserver cassini

654425
aggregate	grouping
i would like to reduce the aggregate the data by time down to n data points so to give the average value over the grouping time spans

654450
debugging	trace
how to find out if a .net assembly was compiled with the trace or debugging flag

654454
ref	out
it is not legal in c# to pass extension methods targets by ref or out in vb it s legal to do byref

654455
credentials	security
it s not ideal because security becomes an issue - now you need to manage credentials to the notes database and to the external file share - however it ll be worth the effort from a notes administrator s perspective

654480
value	field
other objects that have the same value in that field are not added to the containers

654480
value	field
now i would write a generic containers class that accepts objects which implement an interface to get the value of the key field and use a hashmap keyed with those values as the actual storage class

654511
contains	set
but you can override each individual control after the contains panels is disabled and set them to the appropriate color

654514
aggregate	grouping
you should be able to grouping by these and get average aggregate you need

654524
associations	model
i haven t settled on an output format for my script yet but the data s structure largely mirrors my ruby-on-rails model s and contains has_many associations that i would like the import to preserve

654525
command-line	cmd
at the conclusion of this there are series of cmd that i need to run through the command-line in a consecutive manner

654534
user-interface	tray
as i understand windows services can t have a user-interface so do i need to start an app to display the sys tray icon

654563
updating	updates
google is constantly updating its search routines and often will roll the updates out at different times in different data centers so each data center and even each cluster in a data center may return different results

654571
constructor	object
should i create a connection using a static class and calling a method like createconnection on it from the constructor of my business objects something i d like but i don t want to have a connection per object i d like it to be shared for all instances of my objects but since asp.net is multithreading a static class doesn t make sense to store connections

654589
webforms	asp.net
ui i m pretty inexperienced but asp.net mvc looks far less painful to me than asp.net webforms

654594
alter-table	insert-into
there is lots of info to be found on the internet on this subject however there seems to be very little information available on best practices for temporary tuning your mysql server to speed up alter-table on innodb tables or for insert-into

654623
sql-server	mysql
both sql-server and mysql have the information_schema.columns table

654627
value	field
i would create an nsformatter subclass to parsing time value in that format from input data you can put one on a text field to automatically convert user-input or use it to parsing from a data source in code

654643
solaris	aix
platforms of interest include but not limited to aix hp-ux solaris windows

654666
put	get
i m no fan at all of absolute positioning but i have seen web developers use it to get better search result because they can easily put the most important text part at the start of the html and use absolute positioning to position it where it actually belongs

654666
liquid-layout	fluid-layout
i would not use it even for that arguments because there are ways to get the html to be search-engine friendly but still use a fluid-layout such as the the perfect 3 column liquid-layout or other variants

654671
background-color	transparency
you need to set windowsstyle to windowsstyle.none which will remove the google-chrome then you can allow transparency which is an attributes int the windows element and set the background-color to transparent

654678
constructor	object
true they won t be bound to your form subclass so you would have to manually inject the value either using a custom form constructor or by setting some property on your form object after instantiating it with request.post

654682
redmine	trac
take a look at redmine or trac

654687
directory	folder
be sure to check that the plugins directory is correct -- in drupal the plugins folder is different than a default fck install

654691
value	field
if the objects you re adding to the collection have a field that you can use as a unique id just have that field returned by the object s hashcode methods or use a calculated hash code value either way should work

654691
methods	extend
you could wrap or extend hashset so that your add methods returns the unique id that you want as a return value

654693
administration	enterprise
nagios is designed as an enterprise administration up-time monitoring system for data centering but the scripting could easily be used standalone for monitoring in different configuration

654706
windows-server	windows
although the titles refer to sql-server 2005 and windows 2003 the material is still very relevant to sql-server 2008 and windows-server 2008

654707
javascript	dom
but the main problem is you have to understand how the dom and javascript works to write gwt code

654717
virtual-machine	vmware
sandbox a vmware virtual-machine with iptables

654720
click	mouse
it should not change the color when click and return to normal when the mouse moves off

654720
selected	listbox
it must still pass the selected object to the previewmouserightbuttondown event for the listbox

654723
concatenation	comma
this would be a lot less tedious than typing out all of the fields and concatenation them with the comma

654725
export	report
otherwise report this as an import bug and submit the export file that caused this error to customer support

654730
operators	keyword
this rule doesn t apply the same way with pointers though as an asterisk is not a keyword it s an operators

654735
decrement	increment
the key part is that a post increment decrement happens immediately after the expression is evaluated

654737
callback	methods
this code also works as a callback methods anonymous inner class call

654738
dictionary	arrays
the goal is similar to the functionality of ps but preferably in arrays lists and or dictionary

654744
contains	set
both of the solutions i have this problem with contains two web projects one of which is set up to use asp.net forms-authentication

654754
malloc	free
in some obvious cases like when malloc is called inside a loop or part of a thread execution it s very important to free so there are no memory-leaks

654754
linked-list	hashmap
clearly it seems obvious that you d use some solution that will calls some alloc function hashmap linked-list something like that

654754
malloc	free
for this kind of program it doesn t make sense to ever free after calling malloc because these variables must be present at all times during the program s execution and there s no good way that i can see to implement this with statically allocated space

654773
malloc	free
malloc allocates the memory from the memory area called the heap and the complete heap of a process is free when the process exits

654782
verilog	vhdl
you could start programming fpgas in vhdl verilog system c .

654783
malloc	free
if you re writing anything else though -- a server long-running application or a library to be used by someone else you should expect to call free on everything you malloc

654783
malloc	free
ignoring the pragmatic side for a second it s much safer to follow the stricter approach and force yourself to free everything you malloc

654799
postgresql	rdbms
weblocks can use cl-sql as a backend store which can connect to many different rdbms mysql postgresql oracle odbc sqlite

654837
google-chrome	firefox
rendering on both google-chrome and firefox

654838
profiling	trace
also - note that with linq-to-sql you don t need the sql profiling to see the trace

654844
highlight	selected
if you mean to denote a changed part of a form you might just highlight the box around the selected

654848
hide	show
php tags hide the whole tag-enclosed php source output in the browser but view source show them

654862
ienumerator	ienumerable
it definitely doesn t seem as straight forwarding as say c# where you just implement ienumerable and ienumerator or just using the generic collection

654866
click	mouse
if you right click and drag drop your svn folder when you release the mouse button you will be prompted by a menu including these entries

654872
affinity	cpu
we limited the cpu affinity so we can actually use the server when the high load hits

654879
textbox	onblur
...but it does not work in an onblur event because the solution actually causes the textbox to get focus again briefly before bluring again which causes an infinite loop

654879
textbox	onblur
before i give up does anyone have any solution to resetting the cursor to the beginning of a textbox in an onblur event

654881
return-value	arguments
functors are not a priori object-oriented in c++ the term â œfunctorâ usually means a struct defining an operator with arbitrary arguments and return-value that can be used as syntactical drop-in replacements to real functions or function pointers

654883
listbox	textbox
is there some property i need to set for the textbox to forward the click event to the listbox

654883
selected	textbox
it s not a simple property but you can handle the gotfocus event on your textbox then use visualtreehelper to find the listboxitem and selected it

654892
function-pointers	member-functions
you asked specifically about member-functions but there are other uses for function-pointers as well

654893
short-circuiting	equivalent
it also does not use short-circuiting conditional like or || which are in practice equivalent to if

654904
authentication	login
and have a plugin check to see if the controller is restricted and if the user has authentication otherwise redirect them to the login page

654908
treeview	splitter
splitter for the grid and the treeview

654918
thickbox	jquery
i am using jquery and thickbox to create a modal window where i open another aspx page and change some of the data

654927
versioning	upgrade
to manually run the sql portion of the upgrade you ll need to run each upgrade scripting between your versioning and 4.9.2

654947
copy-constructor	constructor
basic things that should go in a c++ struct constructor that initializes the data i dislike using memset and it can later bite back if the pod evolves into something different or construction from other types but not copy-constructor

654950
value	field
i d use a block copy to pull the field into the target here i d be pasting to the value

654959
click	mouse
right mouse click on the project and you should see flex project nature and selected add flex project nature this will resolve the gui builder issues

654968
cakephp	yii
as for the server side php part i would certainly try to taylor it to my needs but if i had to choose a framework i would go for yii code igniter or cakephp depending of your scalability needs

655005
sql-server	oracle
edit in this case i interact with both sql-server 2005 and oracle databases using .net2.0

655029
16-bit	8bit
if i try to access a 16-bit hardware register using two 8bit accesses the high-order byte doesn t read correctly

655029
python	java
i m a high-level c# java python ruby guy that s moving closer to the hardware and this is alien territory

655036
data-members	constructor
a default constructor to initialize the data-members to known values

655040
required	checked
all of the pre post-conditions required ensures can be specified in the annotations above the methods you wish to checked

655051
tiff	png
jpdfimages is a 100 java library that can convert pdf to images in tiff jpeg or png formats and maybe jbig

655066
enumerator	any
every enumerator type has an underlying type which can be any integral type except char

655086
pointers	stack
you shouldn t return a pointers to an object on stack

655092
pointers	stack
the first methods makes room for a pointers on stack which you ve set to the location in memory where a new myclass has been allocated on the heap - or free store

655101
environment	building
a smoke test or building verification test should be done at least every day with every building or if you don t have a daily building then every day anyway to check that your environment is up

655102
16-bit	8bit
apparently the cpu documentation requires that 16-bit hardware registers are accessed with 16-bit reads and writes but your implementation of memcpy uses 8bit reads writes

655132
display	width
you can get a nice effect by making your labels and data display inline-block and giving your labels a fixed width and right-alignment

655159
callback	methods
methods in the ajaxcomplete callback of the pop-up windows

655169
delphi	c++
third i took this approach years ago when transitioning an application from c++ to delphi

655174
credentials	integrated
i would like to know if anyone can suggest a way to integrated the login of my ruby-on-rails app with mediawiki so users don t have to login twice or at the very least can have the same login credentials in both the ruby-on-rails and wiki app

655176
filtering	grouping
i can t think of a slick way to do this but you could index on branch_id add an fkinternalcalc boolean field to your dataset then initialize that field to true on the first row of each branch using grouping state or manually and then filtering the clone on the value of the field

655194
python	ruby
i know that it will be used for things like iron python and iron ruby

655206
pointers	stack
anything allocated on stack has to have a constant size determined at compile-time the compiler has to set stack pointers correctly or if the object is a member of another class it has to adjust the size of that other class

655206
pointers	stack
on line 2 it declares a bar pointers b2 on stack automatic duration and calls new allocating a bar object on the heap

655207
exception-handling	try-catch
wrap every methods called on your background thread with try-catch because since .net 2.0 every unhandled exception-handling on a background thread will shut down the application

655220
http-post	post
i want to create a new web test vsts which sends a http request to the service and post http-post the request in http body as an xml

655243
git-status	gitignore
but now if i add that folder to gitignore simply nothing changes all the stuff is show as deleted by git-status

655248
installation	environment
i m running an apache 2.2 installation with mod_auth_sspi and i use the remote_user environment variables to successfully get the information you re looking for

655251
mime	rfc
from rfc 2387 the mime multipart related content-type

655253
build-system	cmake
if you implement your build-system with cmake to auto-generate the makefiles for gcc on linux it takes only minor modifications to auto-generate projects and solutions for vc++

655259
python	java
various programming languages php python java ...

655273
webforms	asp.net
i have an asp.net web application with a webforms projects with dependencies on several business class library projects and a wcf project

655281
internet-explorer	firefox
i ve got it working ok in internet-explorer 7 and some other browsers but firefox seems to be displaying everything all wrong

655285
any	set
sorting in php sorts the data set in memory of course but has no access to any index

655286
gitignore	git-rm
add a gitignore that ignores the directory you don t want then delete them and remove any stragglers with git-rm --cached

655295
version-control	git
this is not git or svn specific - you should have your compiler and other tools direct the output of intermediate files like .o files to directories that are not under version-control

655300
subtract	add
the kewl part of two s complement is that the machine language add and subtract instructions can ignore all that and just do binary arithmetic and it just works.

655313
any	set
are there any frameworks to set up database and data layer testing

655316
webforms	asp.net
server-side xslt my aim is to avoid standard webforms tending to pure mvc but still keep all the opportunities of asp.net caching session management etc

655316
singleton	facade
now i get xml string from domain via facade domain entities implement ixmlserializable loading and caching a static collection of xslcompiledtransforms from disc as a singleton and a controllers as a httphandler who rules the logic of request processing and has an access to the previous classes and cached pages

655326
contains	elements
i have a c# queue timespan contains 500 elements

655338
double	int
you can convert a double to a long so if you converted your double values to long int in a separate program and output the constant values you could then use them in your program

655341
antivirus	security
deselecting vsdev in here fixed the problem - interestingly enough disabling the firewall and antivirus antispyware did not solve the issue so it is worth looking for a similar setting if you are running different security software

655345
web-config	app-config
in order to get this to work in the host website i had to copy the information in the app-config file into the web-config of the website

655367
selection	highlight
unfortunately changing borderbrush for the listboxitem won t have your desired effect since the border with the selection highlight is internal to the controltemplate of the listboxitem

655367
selection	highlight
instead you can add a new brush resource with the key of systemcolors.highlightbrushkey this is the key that the listboxitem uses for setting the selection highlight color

655375
value	field
so you would always want to access that field through the getter and setter and that way you can always be certain that the value will never get greater than 360

655383
javascript	dom
with javascript the introduction to webkit dom programming topics and webkit dom reference are go-to guides

655427
children	nodes
a parent nodes can have many children

655432
.when	ready
that way even if though private files remain .when you git-checkout your project on the new branch is ready to go

655446
key-value	key
so one final question the only restriction on foreign key is that it they are a valid primary key-value in the table i am referring to

655449
32-bit	64bit
i recently got a new machine at work and moved from xp 32-bit to vista 64bit

655450
pointers	stack
the correct way would probably be not using a smart pointers at all and allocating the object in stack but that s not possible because it uses a library that doesn t allow objects on stack they must be on the heap

655458
triggers	insert
i have used very successfully a model where every table has an audit copy - the same table with a few additional fields time stamp user id operation type and 3 triggers on the first table for insert update delete

655468
arrays	loops
the clr jit will special case this type of loops in certain circumstances since the length of an arrays can t change

655481
value	field
what this means is that you can t have an address that is not connected to a person since the value in the address.person_id field must exist in the table person

655492
any	set
and how pray tell do you run your unit tests on any build for which you ve set unittest to false

655500
similarity	distance
similarity tells your the distance between two different vectors

655521
buffering	streaming
circular or ring buffering - used for streaming among other things

655526
ubuntu	debian
there is a tiny program called wmctrl available at least in debian ubuntu it is in standard distribution which is able to perform many operations on windows and desktops and handles plenty of window managers

655537
multiplication	division
should i use multiplication or division

655551
webserver	security
if you find any part of the framework inhibiting you can write pl sql procedures and expose them to the webserver directly but still take advantage of the security logging session state etc that the apex system manages for you

655562
firefox	safari
when there is a textfield that is focused whenever the page loads or refreshes safari tries to keep the textfield inside the display area unlike firefox or ie

655563
environment	execution
the answer will depend on the architecture of the execution environment

655564
multiplication	multiplying
if you re dividing or multiplying by a variables then it s likely that multiplication is slightly faster because the logic is generally more simple

655572
json	xml
first of all when working with ajax you don t need to return xml from the server you could return plain text xml json strings literally any form of textual data that you want

655581
multiplication	division
division algorithms are slower than multiplication algorithms in most cases

655581
processor	cpu
the reason for that is that a multiplication can be blindly converted to shift and add operations on the processor which are the most optimized operations on a cpu

655581
multiplication	complement
if performance is your need use additions substractions nothing more than adding the two s complement multiplication shiftings but never divisions

655581
multiplying	division
you d get a substantial non-negligible improvement if you compute all your inverses in advance and use them to multiplying in a division intensive program

655584
multiplication	division
which one is faster is indeed a cpu-specific issue or at least how much faster is cpu specific yes division is typically seen as slower than multiplication

655586
document	element
you can t simply write more xml to the end of a serialization dataset since if you do you ll be producing an xml document with more than one top-level element

655590
put	get
and i know the xsl basically works because if i intentionally put an invalid attributes in i get a parsing error

655593
environment	building
by changing one environment variables in a build scripting or otherwise you can cater to specific targets building

655596
malloc	free
1 use std vector instead of malloc free and new delete

655596
buffering	streaming
even though streaming are buffering it s usually more efficient grabbing a chunk at a time

655600
contains	any
the auditrow contains one row per row changed in any other table and the auditfield contains one row per column changed with old value and new value

655600
triggers	insert
we have a triggers on every table that writes a header row auditrow and the needed detail rows one per changed colum on each insert update delete

655621
exception-handling	try-catch
first get rid of these try-catch have asp.net configured with a friendly error page and log any unhandled exception-handling

655622
required	checked
if you have problems with referenced files that must be in a particular directory relative to your other projects eg a common set that sits in c include for example then junction it to the location you checked it out to and you ll be ok assuming you can handle the discipline that managing that required

655624
children	nodes
the second would match all nodes and attributes output nothing and then attempt to match all children

655651
java-server	comet
i m looking for an example of how to do a long running http call from flex actionscript to a java-server that supports comet

655653
uitableview	uiview
i want to be able to switch between a uitableview and a standard uiview in a parent view

655662
subclassing	inherited
i have a tablechoicedialog class that inherited from singlechoicedialog adding generic functionality and i have 2 subclassing for that add more refined functionality

655664
required	checked
this allows each developer to checkedout a templates of the required file but not easily checked in unintended changes

655668
variables	boolean
if something is a boolean variables but the better way to fix this is to avoid the constant

655675
perl	awk
on windows i d still go perl or awk

655676
spring	grails
grails uses spring to help wire your services together

655676
groovy	java
the environment is not only dynamic with groovy but also allows you to use java static environment as well

655691
perl	php
one of the tasks i have to do needs me to encrypt something from php s side and then decrypt it with perl

655697
silverlight	wpf
i m planning on an asp.net and or silverlight ui and maybe some wpf client stuff too on our lan too so i want to craft a data access layer that can support all these front ends

655697
silverlight	wpf
it sure looks like you can hook up any of the ui controls from asp.net silverlight wpf and winforms to either object collections via or m or datasets datatables right

655701
log4net	nlog
i ve been looking at log4net which i ve used in the past as well as nlog and bitfactory

655736
children	nodes
starting at it outputs a root nodes and then selected those children of who are at the start of the grouping for further processing

655754
entity-framework	nhibernate
nhibernate is certainly more robust in many ways and there s also the whole entity-framework migration going on

655765
webforms	asp.net
note that asp.net mvc isn t rtm yet but we ve been using asp.net webforms for years since .net 1.0

655767
python	java
pyjamas is a python port of the gwt so all the javascript is generated using python instead of java

655789
desktop-application	web-applications
not a big issue for a desktop-application but huge for web-applications

655792
nsinteger	int
i am trying to figure out how to convert an nsinteger say 56 to an nsstring that is a binary representation of the original int value

655798
stderr	stdout
here is a scripting that saves redirects and restores stdout and stderr using various methods

655805
value	field
leaving off initializer for a field could either mean that the coder knew it would be initialized to default value or that he knew it would not be initialized and didn t care or else he didn t think about it and his code just happens to work

655811
environment	building
so you will need a complete building test environment to building and run executable for your platform first get to compile all required dependencies some of which may have their own dependencies

655811
joystick	keyboard
in addition just being able to technically compile and run with acceptable performance framerates the code would still not be enough from a usability point of view flightgear is a flight simulator designed for use on personal computers with certain peripherals present - in other words it basically relies on a keyboard and mouse as well as other input hardware joystick pedals

655817
contains	elements
the function should either return an arrays contains the elements of the longest subsequence or the starting and ending indices of the longest subsequence in the original arrays

655831
profiling	debugging
the debugging consists of turning on sql profiling and running the application

655834
conditional	operators
it s a conditional operators

655864
textbox	button
i ve got a textbox and a button on a form on default.aspx and in my downloadhandler.ashx i am getting the value i need from httpcontext.request.form txturi

655873
constructor	object
after this bit of code i could use a copy constructor to make a sonofobject from the more generic query object

655879
value	field
you could add a onclientclick calling a javascript function which would grab the value from the field and do the submit there

655887
triggers	insert
if you really wanted to something of truely wtf proportions you could always keep track of how many rows there were by incrementing some register using a triggers on insert delete

655927
aggregate	grouping
... allows you to grouping the terms for repetition without capturing the aggregate

655943
sqldatasource	gridview
the gridview does this in conjunction with data source controls like the sqldatasource control

655954
windows-vista	windows
it works great when i run it on the asp.net development server but when i try to run the application on a iis7 windows-vista or windows server 2008 i get the error

655954
show	next
if i press continue the browser show me the next message

655973
stdin	pipe
currently i m using dup2 to simply overwrite the stdin and stdout from the pipe

656022
environment	execution
in some commonly encountered scenarios a lambda may execute on another machine in a completely different kind of runtime environment and therefore on another thread and the caller need not necessarily wait for the remote execution to full complete before continuing

656028
data-structures	tree
all you need to do is once you have the type is to create little stacks for the getter and setters of properties and those you can collect via walking the property tree of the type and its properties breadth first limiting the depths to a specified number of levels and removing circular references depending on your data-structures

656036
satellite	altitude
similarly you can t launchd an object into orbited from the surface you have to have something like a last rocket burn once the satellite reaches the desired altitude

656040
postgresql	mysql

656050
dictionary	arrays
...but i ve found some documentation that seems to indicate that when accessing row objects like arrays you re actually still pulling dictionary keys

656050
tuples	any
is there any way to get sa to return results as a list of tuples or a list of lists rather than a list of dictionary

656055
mips	x86

value	field
i began working on an older but simple aspx form and my predecessor used manual server-side form validation checking to see if some form field have a value and if not display an error message in a label

656098
textbox	button
i created a brand new webforms in the same project with just a single textbox validator and submit button and it acts the same way

656098
global-asax	web-config
something in the web-config or global-asax

656118
hide	show
it s very easy to use javascript to detect when the form was submitted and then hide the elements you need to hide and show the success message

656133
contains	elements
you could use javascript to replace the innerhtml of a huge div contains everything or remove all the elements but i d advise against it

656143
if-statement	loops
this includes basic if-statement loops filtering etc

656180
python	php
i have found that gmail has a python api but my site is making use of php

656208
windows	ms-dos
saying macs use r is about as correct as saying that windows runs on top of ms-dos supports only the fat16 filesystem and has no 64-bit support.

656212
cygwin	gnu
i don t know if gnu make has a windows port but you can probably run it under cygwin

656213
virtual-memory	paging
i found the knowledge from that class incredibly useful for understanding stuff in my os class virtual-memory paging cache interrupts... and later for understanding how the jvm is dealing with bytecode

656214
keyboard	mouse
when recording you can t use your mouse to selected anything so you have to use you keyboard to selected the picture and then use the menu options to manipulate it

656250
digits	zero
the next digits is a zero

656250
digits	zero
the next digits is a zero

656279
keyboard	mouse
if you minimize a windows which was in the background and in full screen then you can see the contour of our ghost app - you can move it around it will respond to keyboard mouse input just fine

656281
mips	x86
however if it is just mips programming and you already have a handle on x86 assembly and the concepts of low level programming i would say pass on the class

656295
nested	assign
the problem is in the set function for theint you re assign a value to theint which will result in a nested call to the set function

656315
put	get
if you made methods.m a subfunction in the larger code calling it or if it s possible to put it in a private directory where it can be called by every function that needs to call it then it may get called instead of the java methods when you use the methods object ... syntax

656377
entity-relationship	diagram
it s the only conceptual modeling tool available for relational data the others - erwin and its ilk - being at best logical modeling tools with nothing much better than entity-relationship diagram and ddl synchrnoization which are also provided by object role modeling tools

656395
updating	updates
finally some thoughts on what should be made fibers typically your main updates loop is one fiber updating and drawing all objects and then calls yield

656416
host	dns
assign myapp.mycompany.com and mysubapp.mycompany.com different ip addresses in dns but they should map to the same host robert explains below how or use 2 nics

656435
value	field
we ve all been subject to data entry forms that require value for some field

656435
value	field
and we ve all abandoned forms where we had no sensible value for required field

656446
value	field
there s probably a lot of cases where you need some very serious data integrity and or the intense speed optimization of disallowing null fields but i think that these concerns are tempered against the extra effort it takes to make sure every field has a default-value and or gets set to a sensible value

656462
key-value	key
but in addition to being faster tokens have the added advantage especially with context coloring of screaming out visually look at me i am a key of a key-value pair

656463
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome opera etc

656475
value	field
max value - make sure strings are under a maximum length based on field properties in the db

656477

checkbox	button
make sure you include validation capabilities for non-textbox related fields such as drop-down lists radio button checkbox etc

656518
fflush	stdout
use fflush stdout

656521
shell	bash
your shell if it s bash uses the gnu readline library which provides much more general functionality including detecting terminal types history management programmable key bindings etc

656523
constructor	private
it derives from classsealer and can call the private constructor directly as it is a friend

656523
constructor	private
failstoderive won t compile as it must call the classsealer constructor directly virtual inheritance requirement but it cannot as it is private in the sealed class and in this case failstoderive is not a friend of classsealer

656526
value	field
i don t see a problem with null value if the field can be empty

656526
value	field
an abuse is allowing null value when there should be information in that field

656527
value	field
update per solberg s request here is an example of two tables that have a foreign-key-relationship showing that the foreign key field value can be null

656541
linux	unix
the most simple version of this is on most linux unix terminals to print r carriage return to the normal stdout which resets the cursor position to the first character in the current line

656542
strtok	strchr
given that there is strchr strtok and all manner of other string functions surely there should be a trim function or one that can be repurposed.

value	field
when i click the triggers button i what to open a panels specifying an url as views test blabla.aspx and then storing the selection in the triggers field value

656586
distance	altitude
maybe i m wrong about this but if i remember my physics right and if the distance between the two points is relatively small compared to the earth s radius aside from altitude the path will just follow a great circle

656597
getter	setter
the interface simply says implementor will have a string name with getter and setter

656600
required	checked
of course this approach required diligence too because you re basically trading off left joins for having to checked the presence of your sentinel row in queries so you don t updates delete it etc

656602
postgresql	mysql
if you are thinking of some sort of web app i d say either mysql or postgresql as these will provide better performance and be able to handle a large data set more naturally

656612
linux	unix
this is what most terminals under unix linux xterm rxvt konsole and others like putty understand

656612
readline	ncurses
in practice you would not directly hardcode escape sequences into your software though you could but use a library to print them such as ncurses or gnu readline mentioned above

656616
protected	public
you couldn t declare scope constraints on interfaces public private protected internal as that is an implementation detail

656616
getter	setter
in an interface the property definition will indicate that the methods signatures for the getter and or setter methodss will be available for all classes implements that interface

656620
put	get
so far my experience has been similar to the resume effect if someone doesn t put the effort into spell checking their resume they probably won t get the job.

656622
value	field
i m trying to retrieve a count of all unique value in a field

656623
macros	let
macros let the programmer keep the abstraction of a function almost but avoided the costly overhead of a function call

656631
bitblt	gdi
the low-level bitblt gdi calls are likely to be way more efficient that anything you can do

656655
contains	set
i ve seen the note in msdn that says if the buffer is too small the first two bytes of the lpstrfile buffer will contains the required size but the size it s returning seems to way too small maybe this is correct when ofn_allowmultiselect isn t set

656656
version-control	git
down the road you ll want to become intimately familiar with branching and merging and the tools for doing so quickly and correctly and perhaps learn a dvcs distributed version-control system like git or mercurial

656668
radio-button	button
in short a radio-button through .net 3.5sp1 somehow kills bindings of other radio-button when when it s checked while trying to uncheck any other button

656701
worksheet	excel
the excel workbook will have other worksheet containing calculations and a pivot tables

656704
perl	ruby
i would also be interested in any available solutions that use perl ruby haskell etc

656706
windows-xp	windows
because this can potentially be run on a wide range of computers with varying levels of patches and updates i m steering well clear of .net and anything that isn t native - the tool should just run without the user having to install anything extra well i will say windows-xp no service packs is the bare minimum required version of windows

656707
profiling	trace
you should post your profiling results as well as stack trace around the _get_col call so we know which _get_col is being called

656715
variables	boolean
having issues where in my .aspx page i pass in a boolean variables c# to a javascript function that is expecting a boolean type

656716
minimum	max
if the user enters a maximum and a minimum for example don t just check the two values independently against their legal max and min but also check them against each other to ensure that the values entered are logically consistent

656716
ip-address	hostname
for hostname you may want to validate that dns returns an ip-address

656716
numeric	digits
another thing you can do if you go all out is to only allow digits to be entered in numeric fields only allow digits and - in credit card or phone number fields and so on

656721
order	add
add an additional 3-4 digits for the order number will give you 999 to 9 999 orders per customer more if you consider one off customers

is this correct for a for-loops with a while loops inside

656746
linux	unix
the linux unix find command

656776

the python performance would be pretty much identical since a property lookup is just a dictionary lookup and the java performance would be better

656787
restart	reload
depending upon hosting environments it may not be possible for the deployers of the web application to configure appropriate data sources so the application needs to store it s database connection information somewhere to be reload if the application is restart

656789
implements	abstract
define your interfaces for each class you need based on the real requirements implements them and then see if an abstract base-class makes sense

656814
credentials	security
an attacker who has penetrated your application security can get access to the database credentials

656840
triggers	insert
i usually don t like database triggers since they can lead to strange behind the scenes behavior but putting a trigger on delete to insert the about-to-be-deleted data into a history table might be an option

656845
key-value	key
you can also setup a matching lookup table with the key-value pairs and a foreign key constraint between the tables if you wish

656852
contains	any
now because the application should be able to monitor other programs that it did not know about the xml configuration file should be extensible as well so the configuration class also contains a list of object which maps to any other component specified by user in the configuration file

656867
ado	jet
you can read a csv file using ado and the jet engine to get the data into a ado recordset then an excel range object has a copyfromrecordset methods that will copy very fast from the ado or dao recordset

656886
python	php
i ve used and loved that syntax in both python and javascript but still we wait for php

656917
normal-distribution	probability
the thing you want to plot is the probability density function pdf of the normal-distribution

656919
hide	show
has a navigation that works fine on the main page but due to me making a mistake does not work on the sub pages as it relies on images being loaded and then switching their hide show properties

656920
export	report
new page break is not working when export from crystal report 9 using visual-studio studio.net

656933
twisted	pyro
i think i ll look at both pyro and the web.py werkzeug approaches since twisted is a little more than i want to bite off at this point

32-bit	64bit
i should note that this is a 32-bit application on a 64bit machine at

656941
digits	base
what is the best way to convert decimal numbers base ten to sexagesimal base sixty represented as a string using 0-9 a-z and a-x as the digits

656942
required	checked
run culture and on the main page have something that checked the querystring for this parameter and execute the command required

656944
while-loop	loops
then for every iteration of the outer loops the while-loops executes

656945
switching	screens
have you considered the simple expedient of creating a custom terminfo or termcap entry lacking a sequences to clear the screens and then switching your terminal setting to that right before running your program

656954
required	checked
if the character is escaped checked this probably required examining the previous character continue

656974
difference	count
in general with a 50 1 difference in thread count yes the application with more threads is going to get a lot more time

656977
decrement	increment
a hacky solution comes to mind add a counter that increment when sendanemail is called and decrement when sendcomplete is sent

656985
decrement	increment
just make sure you have a lock statement around the bits where you increment and decrement the counter

656987
cappuccino	sproutcore
cappuccino or sproutcore

656992
probability-density	gaussian
if what you want is the value of the probability-density function p x of a normal gaussian distribution of mean mu and standard deviation sigma at x the formula is

innodb	myisam
berkeley db is going away very soon in mysql so if you re using it i d recommend you shift to innodb or at the very least myisam

657009
quirks-mode	doctype
this method also allows you to write a doctype so you don t unexpectedly end up in quirks-mode

657010
integer	digits
for the integer part take the modulus to pull of the least-significant digits then divide by 60 and repeat

657010
integer	digits
for the fractional part repeatedly multiply by 60 and take the integer part to get the result digits

657026
haskell	lisp
hip counts when you want to get future colleagues excited about what you ve done when they haven t done it. i d venture that it s at least as eye-opening as something based on lisp or smalltalk or haskell but probably more practical because you may actually end up using it at a job or for contract work

657026
ruby-on-rails	django
i haven t used django but it has some industry traction not as much as ruby-on-rails

657034
any	set
if you use full-on absolute positioningingâ â â as in each element has its horizontal and vertical positioning set in pixelsâ â â then any deviation on font-size can result in the lines of text being written on top of each other making the page unreadable

657048
streamreader	streamwriter
does streamreader and streamwriter use recv and send functions of winsock internally

657053
streamreader	streamwriter
a streamreader is not a stream nor is a streamwriter

657053
networkstream	streamreader
networkstream is a stream that knows how to talk on a network but streamreader and streamwriter work with abstract stream references or rather more abstract

657059
multithreading	wait
also if a task wants to then use multithreading core s the handler for the cmd if its an event type model - i personally like the event model - its easier to access the shared state info without needing global singletons can then spawn multiple tasks say using an existing thread pool - so the cost of new threads are not hit every cmd and then use a barrier type class to wait for all the tasks to complete

657064
detailsview	gridview
i am using gridview and detailsview for insert update edit a truckmaster table

657084
alter-table	insert-into
i recommend doing the alter-table on the new empty table which will save mysql copying all the data again which will mean you need to list all the fields correctly in the insert-into .

657099
worksheet	excel
there are quite a few tips about on how to get both good looking reports on the screen and in an excel worksheet

657108
directory	folder
my code directory at work is organized in folder and subfolder and subsubfolder all of which at least in theory contain scripting or programs i want to run on a regular basis

657139

657148
button	popup
compiles fine i add the user control to my app with a button to show the popup

657148
button	popup
this works - popup appears you can click a button to close it and it closes

657150
required	checked
on installation this module using makemaker s prereq_pm to checked that all the modules we required have already been install

657150
versioning	packaging
deployment consists in me pulling from everybody s git branches and packaging a versioning

657150
versioning	upgrade
to try a new versioning we upgrade our own versioning of a module before doing that upgrade on the production server

657167
.when	ready
edit the easiest way to get a release build .when ready is to use the batch build command from the build menu

657214
streamreader	streamwriter
you only need streamreader streamwriter if you want to deal with text instead of binary data

657214
streamreader	streamwriter
textreader textwriter from which streamreader streamwriter are derived deal with text - their methods deal with strings and char arrays

657214
streamreader	streamwriter
streamreader streamwriter basically wrap a stream and do the conversion via an encoding between text and binary data for you

657215
normal-distribution	probability
so you really don t need random numbers and this has nothing to do with probability unless you want it to as in you want your curve to look like a the outline of a normal-distribution or something along those lines

657220
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework

657221
directory	folder
if i correctly understand your question the only working setup that i could imagine is to take the approach you mention host headers to point but c inetpub wwwroot myapp mysubapp without using a redirect and include the main app s dlls in your sub folder s bin directory

657232
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework is better if we are targeting different databases

657232
postgresql	mysql
currently i think a lot of providers are available for ado.net entity framework provider for postgresql mysql esql oracle and many other check

657235
python	java
where would erlang fall on the spectrum of conciseness between say java .net on the less concise end and ruby python on the more concise end of the spectrum

657246
value	field
are you by any chance passing in a value to the selected side in a variables or are you returning the same field more than once

657259
json	xml
in the second and third solutions the backend would only send json or xml messages to the client

657261

draw a textbox and a button

657261
textbox	button
add a click handler to the button which takes the contents of the textbox and launches a process

657274
installation	building
building and test the installation package

657285
environment	building
doing so explicitly will reduce the chance that different building environment might have a different assumption

657299
arrays	loops
we can search using perform loops also but is there a better way of utilizing search for 2-d arrays

657300
json	xml
xml is to slow json is fast

657308
duplicates	contains
a set is a collection that contains no duplicates elements and whose elements are in no particular order

657310
perl	php
i do write other projects in php python and perl depending on the gig so it would have to be platform agnostic

657311
duplicates	sorted
a hashset of t collection is not sorted and cannot contain duplicates elements

657349
callback	methods
the other approach is to use a callback at the end of the threaded methods

657352

wicket and apache tapestry are both component oriented web framework s - contrary to action based frameworks like stripes - by the apache foundation

657352
spring	guice
how do they integrate with guice spring jsr 299

657384
space	input
regarding your second question if my program took input like a 5 i would allocate space for a or re-allocate the same space on a subsequent a foo

657394
hosts-file	hosts
check your hosts it should be redirecting localhost to 127.0.0.1 and nothing else

657394
hosts-file	hosts
note that the hosts is a popular victim of viruses so if is has been modified you might run a check on viruses

657397
hosts-file	hosts
there will be a hosts somewhere probably in somewhere like c windows system32 drivers etc hosts which should usually contains only that definition for localhost

657413

attributes	properties
just let javascript extend it s class attributes to match .removed don t mess around with style properties

657468
document	element
please note the start_here element could be anywhere inside the document

657503
extends	sealed
i was reading somewhere about how to handle the issue of wanting to extends a sealed class in the .net library

657503
methods	extend
i believe there was a methods demonstrated to extend a sealed class in the article i read but i cannot remember now it wasn t extension methodss

657504
multiple-inheritance	polymorphism
we can say that cascading style sheets are somewhat object-oriented because they allow classes to be defined instances objects created by assigning a class to an element inheritance of classes even multiple-inheritance abstraction by defining styles for the plain elements and polymorphism by defining the same class name for different elements

657513
bison	yacc
lex yacc or flex bison

extends	sealed
no you can t extends a sealed class in any legitimate way

657527
methods	extend
the only way i know to extend a sealed class without extension methods is by wrapping it

657533
extends	sealed
whereby you write a class that delegates some calls to the sealed one you want to extends and adds others

657541
getter	setter
1 where do we call a bean in struts what is the exact line through which we call the bean and from which file and how the getter and setter methods are called

657542
selected	button
the form action button are ignored if the listindex remains at zero so these values can never be selected

657560
python	ruby
in the ruby rails world you d turn first to capistrano or vlad the deployer and in the python django world you d turn to the equivalent except afaik there isn t one

657574
put	get
http over tcp has the verbs get put post amongst others

657576
host	dns
you can do a reverse dns lookup with host too

657583
python	perl
if you want to do it via a scripting language python perl you could use the gethostbyaddr api

657601
apache-mina	mina
may be mina will help you.have a look

657609
children	nodes
b-tree are rarely binary tree the number of children a nodes can have is typically a large number

657609
children	nodes
b-tree can have multiple children per nodes so on each nodes you have to scan the nodes to look for the appropriate child

657614
contains	any
however the source text must not contains any artificial brackets and also i m not sure what to do about potential infix mixins like # a b - if value1 value2 c - d

in this model objects are mapped to instruction and described in a mapping file generally an xml file as ibatis.net or ibatis java does

657672
keyboard	mouse
i want to selected or highlight a block in emacs without mouse but from the keyboard

657701
contains	any
the documentation for these functions does not seem to contains any means of getting that information so i m assuming i have to go ask windows for each device i find whether it is removable in some way

657704
ghostscript	imagemagick
even imagemagick relies on ghostscript for its pdf reading functions

657705
attributes	properties
if you want to be explicit you can decorate the indexer properties with an indexername attributes

657709
scons	jam
if your project is made of several files then you will have to write a makefile or any equivalent for scons aap b jam ant ... tune your in consequence and finally call make from vim

657713
associations	model
i specify an order in the activerecord finder or in the model associations because sorting using sql is faster

657716
configuration	installation
user name text field type in the account info you have used during sharepoint post installation configuration

657732
selection	highlight
the transient-mark-mode will highlight selection for you

657769
value	field
you can override the validate methods for your field type and query the list for items with the same value and set the isvalid property accordingly

657785
allocation	deep
that alone can produce some fun debugging sessions when you have a call-stack 15 lines deep with a few small allocation in each function

657789
perl	ruby
any hints appreciated any language is fine although java perl or ruby preferred

657792
internationalization	localization
i realize that the methods to do these conversions is quite simple however when you factors in internationalization and localization support this becomes less trivial

657806
contact	submit
in flash as3 iam creating a contact form in that i have taken one submit button one reset button four input text fields

657815
google-chrome	firefox
here is the bug report for google-chrome which has the same problem as firefox

657818
buffering	streaming
they are both typically buffering which means that the i o you do on a streaming does not match 1 1 the i o done on the underlying system object a file

657818
fread	eof
for instances a fread call to read 2 bytes could attempt to read 1 024 bytes from the file which might in turn only return 57 if you were that close to eof

657818
buffering	streaming
the difference is all hidden by the streaming implementation which will return 2 bytes and remember that is has a further 55 in its buffering

657818
buffering	streaming
edit it s worth pointing out that the default error streaming in both languages stderr and cerr respectively are not buffering

657820
parentheses	operators
however it seems to me that the advantages of the prefix postfix notations that you need neither parentheses nor a precedence-aware parsing stem from the fact that you know the number of arguments every time you encounter an operators therefore you know exactly how many elements to read for prefix notation or to pop from the stack for postfix notation

657840
xsd	xml
we have xsd files that we use to validate the xml documents but the overall client developer experience is poor and slow

657918
groovy	java
the company i work for embeds groovy into a java spring website which is deployed on a number of sites

657918
groovy	java
a particularly nice feature of groovy is that it can closely resemble java code which makes it very easy to port existing java classes to it

657923
put	get
you can put garbage inside to see if the default execution get executed and if it does make one of the executions a default

657955
rtsp	rtp
jmf 2.1.1 provides rtp rtsp

657966
safari	opera
in ie safari opera on a windows machine the images on this page are only loaded once monitored with freemeter when the show and hide button are toggled

657966
hide	show
looking into about cache most of the images loaded appear to be listed there although inspector the cache between hide show click there appears to be missing images

657979
value	field
the initial value is only used in a unbound form if it s bound and a value for that field is not include nothing will be selected

657987
modifiers	final
however joshua bloch in his famous book effective-java gives the following advice design and document for inherited or else prohibit it and encourages programmers to use the final modifiers to prohibit subclassing

657987
modifiers	final
or use the final modifiers whenever possible

657991
hide	show
instead of building the html string over and over again and completely removing these img elements from the dom why not just build it once with an outer containers div and show hide the div

658001
textbox	button
how to add text to a c# datagrid from a textbox using a button click

658007
perl	php
but if your client base is a mixed bag of perl php asp python etc then i d keep life simple and accessible for these folks

658008
modifiers	final
in open-closed principle open for extension closed for modification you can still use the final modifiers

658008
implements	final
since the extension is an interface it can t be final but its implements class can be

658011
textbox	button
in the button s click event handler add a row assuming you want to add a row to the datagrid with the contents from the textbox

658020
checkbox	button
in swing you have ridiculous inheritance where iirc button extends checkbox or the other way around giving one of them behaviour that isn t used i think it s its the setdisabled call on checkbox

658024
global-variables	call
from main there is a function call to a function func1 in file2.c which sets the value of this global-variables to 1

658032
highlight	selected
wherever your cursor is afterwards the text between the last mark and the current positioning is selected you can highlight this by activating transient-mark-mode but this will also mean that marks have to be deleted when you don t want highlight

658034
keyboard	mouse
you could hook the changed event and set the value back to your desired value if different -- this way you ll cover any cause for change via mouse or keyboard

658063
out-of-memory	memory-leaks
i could imagine a situation where you were keeping some information about the contents of the xml file and your own data-structures either because the data was so large or because of memory-leaks in your code caused the out-of-memory condition

658069
modifiers	final
nowadays i use the final modifiers by default almost reflexively as part of the boilerplate

658069
dependency-injection	strategy-pattern
you can call this dependency-injection or strategy-pattern or visitor pattern or whatever but what it boils down to is using composition instead of inheritance to avoid repetition

658083
buffering	streaming
that said note that this doesn t preclude streaming to deal with large message payloads without buffering the entire message in memory

658083
buffering	streaming
in either case if you re dealing with large messages you ll want to make sure you use the messageencoder overloads that handle streaming instead of buffering as they are the ones that give you the option of doing coordinated streaming with the service implementation

658117
command-line	cmd
..but as pax said - the cmd-line isn t particularly good for editing absurdly long lines - why not make the cmd into a script

658122
video-streaming	streaming
i m using wowza media for live video-streaming and the server has implemented several mechanisms to protect your files streaming acl based authentication streamnamealias .

658136
linux	osx
not nearly as good as the ones on linux osx though

658159
pointers	stack
use pointers when you don t want your object to be destroyed when stack frame is emptied

658165
linked-list	tree
you need a data structure that can rearrange objects quickly - like a linked-list tree ar similar

658165
linked-list	tree
you need a data structure that allows for direct navigation from object to object - like a linked-list tree or any other graph

658177
tapestry	wicket
wicket forces markup code separation tapestry 5 just give you this ability

658177
tapestry	wicket
wicket s core is easier to debug user components are based on inheritance while tapestry 5 user components are based on annotations

658177
tapestry	wicket
from the other side that could make transitions to the future versions easier for tapestry then for wicket

658182
hash	md5
tip if you are going to store the hash in the database a md5 hash is always 16 bytes so can be saved in a uniqueidentifier column and system.guid in .net

658193
assign	add
i could set helpkeyword set an application.onhelp handler to convert helpkeyword requests to helpjump requests so that i can assign help by topic id instead of keyword lookup and add code such as my own help viewer based on helpscribble s code that fixes the vcl bugs and lets helpjump work with anchor

658211
modifiers	final
i don t think that bloch states that you should prefer to prohibit inherited by using the final modifiers just that you should explicitly choose to allow or disallow inherited in each class you create

658229
contains	elements
these can be elements contains other elements and attributes

658239
json	xml
well if you are looking at standard mark-up such as json or xml then you can use ready-to-use low level parsers that are available in most of the programming languages such as .net c# java ruby c++ etc

658239
abstract-factory	singleton
the patterns that such parsing use are combination of abstract-factory composite singleton and builder pattern

658252
put	get
i think it s easy to get heated about something like this but when you put emotion aside i don t believe it is a complicated issue

658286
one-to-many	entity
i have a entity named person referenced with members entity with one-to-many 1 n relationship

658300
copy-constructor	constructor
before that i used reference members initialized from the constructor but the compiler has a problem creating copy-constructor assignment operators and the lot

658301
mta	sta
i have read about this several places on the .net but i have no experience in multithreading programming and the terms like sta and mta means nothing to me

derived-class	base-class
a pointers to a base-class may actually point to a derived-class

658316
reflection	runtime
at runtime using reflection

658322
put	get
get another server of identical specs 1x quadcore 4gig and put the new vms on there

658343
pointers	stack
first off the question is wrong the dilemma is not between pointers and stack but between heap and stack

658343
pointers	stack
you can have an object on stack and pass the pointers to that object

658347
vmware	esx
that said it may be worth your time to upgrade from vmware server to vmware esx or the more competitively priced vmware esxi free

658350
uielement	adorner
but i ve been reading about uielement classes and adorner and want to make sure i m doing things the right way

658350
highlight	selected
if i could see the right way to create a custom drawn object of any complexity a simple rectangle would be fine have the user selected it highlight it somehow to show that it s selecteded and then have the user drag it around the wpf windows i would be well on my way

658361
attributes	properties
as you can see in the example the data-members attributes is not set for the internaluser properties

658362
subtract	time
read backtrack one day at a time until we re at the start of this week and then subtract seven to get to the start of last week

658383
mersenne-twister	generator
it uses a random number generator with known characteristics using the â mersenne-twister which will produce random numbers four times faster than what the average libc rand provides

658384
put	get
perhaps this has improved since sql-server 2000 and someone with more familiarity with the newer versions can tell you whether it is now safe to get in the water but until i had confirmation of this and had checked it out myself with a test i wouldn t put it on my production system

658389
deployment	install
i have a visual-studio deployment project which install an app - some assemblies each compiled to target .net 2.0

658403
python	c++
answers are appreciated in python and or c++

658425
firefox	opera
fails for me in firefox 3 opera and safari

658480
specifications	w3c
edit specifications from w3c

658488
arrays	map
to be more specific i have an arrays of hash maps where each hash map contains all that node s neighbors as edges

658513
textbox	button
recently it was brought to my attention that when an event occurs button submits in particular on the page and then the other asp controls are moused over textbox radio button regular button they appear to shift down all the while you can see the control in its original position underneath this gives the effect of having duplicate controls one overlapping the other

658531
arrays	map
internally it keeps track of 1 the current index into the arrays of maps and 2 the iterator in the current map

658567
buffering	streaming
groupjoin same as join but buffering instead of streaming by outer

658567
buffering	streaming
the exact characteristics depend on whether the operator buffering or streaming too

658571
integer	numeric
edit employee number should be stored at the very least as varchar 10 assuming that it can accept non numeric characters or as an integer if it is an actual number as it is assumed to be

658574
order	add
i use the function points above in order to add dat2 to the existing plot

658585
build-system	jam
as you state boost jam is a build-system and can be used independently of any other boost libraries

658587
methods	extend
you might want to consider an extension methods that would extend the assumed to be integer type of your employee id

658609
instrumentation	debugging
debugging using instrumentation - objectalloc and leaks gives me no clues

658614
sql-server	oracle
but i did not like it at all using it since i got used to oracle programming and sql-server management studio works a real slow in my computer not like oracle

658627
assign	add
if you want to add two child-parent rows to the database you must assign the entity instead of the id column the id will be autogenerated and will be available only after the submit changes

658630
qmake	cmake
there are better build systems out there - cmake scons for c++ qmake for qt ant for java nant and msbuild for .net and so on

658634
host	root
i have a joomla installation with search-friendly-urls at the root level of the domain but my host is giving me access to my website stats which requires authentication in domain.com stats and i cannot see it just a joomla generated 404 error

658636
entity-framework	nhibernate
nhibernate does and i believe the entity-framework does it certainly should - working with multiple databases is one of the selling points of ef over linq to sql

658642
dump	temp
since this appears to be language-agnostic you could create a temp file with the raw output of the page and then when the same page is loaded again dump the contents of the temp file directly into the http response of the current page

658654
udp	tcp
why does the udp protocol not support streams like tcp protocol does

658663
revision	updates
i m looking adding subversion s revision number to the name of each .js file we include so whenever the .js file is updates the browsers will automatically fetch the new version

658670
duplicates	elements
one slight problem here you can have duplicates elements in a list

658672
udp	tcp
many applications end up re-implementing parts of tcp on udp to get the particular mixture of latency order independence error handling and bandwidth that they need

658684
vb.net	vb6
copy and paste and fix the compiler errors works fairly well between vb6 and vb.net

658689
radio-button	selected
the only thing i m missing is that you can t click the label to selected the radio-button

658702
keyboard	mouse
so this is a cryptographically secure random source based on unpredictable input from such things as the arbitrary timings of ethernet packets keyboard and mouse input etc

658712
contains	any
but in any case in order to map wordforms to their lemmas and synthesize wordforms from lemmas take a look at morpha and morphg and also the java version of or front-end to morphg contains in the simplenlg package

658720
spring	guice
with instance methods it s easy to inject your service in java with an ioc di container like guice or spring

658737
order	add
i remember watching a programmer add a huge number of system calls into his c code in order to avoid having to learn the bourne shell

658768
button	popup
after that i press a button in 1.mxml and it creates 2.mxml popup without the init

658775
constructor	object
the modified constructor approach seems a bit opaque and runs into trouble with nested object

658802
type-parameter	return-type
one reason when generics are very useful is when the generic type-parameter is used as the type of a parameter or as the return-type of the methods

658803
udp	tcp
making udp work as a stream would mean adding almost every feature that tcp has

658804
javassist	cglib
1 of either javassist or cglib jars

658808
dictionary	arrays
needs to be able to handle a dictionary associative arrays of size |uniq lines in all files|

658808
python	java
if people a fuller python implementation it s pretty easy to write i don t know java though

658815
configuration	logging
if it still doesn t work and if you are able to change to server virtual host configuration try logging the rewrite process

658817
required	checked
a site i need required a checked on the user when they click links which will take them to external websites don t ask why it just does..

658817
thickbox	jquery
i ve been experimenting with thickbox and some jquery sliders but as soon as you disable javascript

658821
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
there are different data providers for combining .net and oracle odp.net devart s provider and a provider from microsoft system.data.oracleclient

658824
entity-framework	ado.net
apart from the fact that itâ s open source and mature what are the differentiating factors that separate nhibernate from rest of the .net orm frameworks like subsonic ado.net entity-framework etc

658843
hashmap	arrays
i presume the node number would normally be the index into the arrays of hashmaps and the neighbour node the key to the current hashmap

658848
assign	add
if there is a business reason for having null as a foreign key then i would suggest you do as others have mentioned and add a joining record that has a value of something along the lines of n a or not assign

658851
rollback	commit
there are four methods you can override on the install base-class to allow you to specify custom actions depending on whether you re in the install commit uninstaller or rollback phases when the install is running

658864
type-safety	generics
i d say the best reason is type-safety using the where keyword to ensure that the generics type is of a certain type or sub-class implementor

658879
python	c++
i have a c++ application that has embedded python

658885
.when	ready
.when i was again ready to pull i found that i had to set my branch back to master

658932
select	union
you need to select more than one property in your union

658936
json	xml
i have an object graph that i would like to convert to and from json and xml for the purposes of creating a rest-style api

658939
python	php
does anyone know of something equivalent to php - s for python

658946
selected	button
they can default the merged record to a or b by clicking a header button and can selected each field by clicking against them as well

658950
order	add
lots of stories in priority order you can add more later infact you will always as requirements change

658950
put	get
take off as much work in the priority order the business pm has put them in as you think you can for sure get done

658952
xargs	zcat
this says to find files that end in .gz and write their names with a nul terminator the 0 in -print0 pipe that output through xargs which will pick the list apart based on nul chacracters the -0 arg and run zcat on the files

658968
line-endings	newline
additionally it s possible your php source file is encoded with unix style line-endings which means a string separated over several lines is actually split up by n newline and your program is behaving correctly

658984
required	checked
i checked my gac and it still lists office 12 and won t let me remove it - says it s required by windows-installer

659011
methods	extend
to extend on the answers above adding where t new constraint to a generic methods will require t to have a public parameterless constructor

659011
constructor	private
and keep the default constructor private

659013
sftp	ftps
they re open to the third option but the remote network admins insist on sftp rather than ftps and ftpwebrequest only supports ftps

659035
json	xml
it can also transform json objects to xml but you d need to convert your pojos to json through it first

659036
scheme	let
it comes as of last versions with nppexport plugins that let s one to convert source code to highlighted html and rtf according to your colouring scheme

659041
json	xml
use xstream for xml and json for json

659046
order	add
what i had to do in order to make the decryption work is add header randomiv to my perl scripting s cipher creation since pear s crypt_cbc class uses a random iv when encrypting

659062
specifications	w3c
the short answer is because not everyone cares about whether they follow good practices with their code or whether it meets the official specifications provided by the w3c ie can validate

659064
for-loop	arrays
i can print the contents using a for-loop and using an arrays

659066
sql-server	oracle
he hits on a number of the things you mention needing and he illustrates how the big three elephants sql-server oracle and db2 will never be able to suite the needs of tick stores which it looks like you are building

659078
python	java
if i understand what your question is then you want to use javascript to write data like a server side script would php python java etc.. but in browser

659089
sql-server	oracle
sql-server and oracle have commercial products like idera sql safe and quest litespeed that dramatically speed up backup and restores

659101
arrays	loops
however your loops termination check won t work in that case as there is no element in the arrays at the moment for which str 0 holds true

659101
order	add
in order to get that to work you ll need to add a fourth element to the arrays that is 0

659103
firefox	opera
the pages look fine in firefox opera safari and ie 8 but my client who is using ie7 is complaining of layout problems in ie 7

659124
double-pointer	pointers
since the elements are the pointers to them would be - a double-pointers

659128
json	xml
and to convert json - xml via json - pojo - xml

659128
json	xml
i would actually not use any of xml libs to produce json xstream and jaxb jettison can produce kind of json but it uses ugly conventions that are rather non-intuitive

659128
json	xml
so it can be used for both json and xml to from pojos

659138
sftp	scp
most sftp servers support scp as well which can be a lot easier to find libraries for

659138
putty	pscp
you could even just call an existing client from your code like pscp include with putty

659138
client-server	web-services
if the type of file you re working with is something simple like a text or xml file you could even go so far as to write your own client-server implementation to manipulate the file using something like .net remoting or web-services

659140
margins	padding
ie7 has different defaults and behaviour for margins and padding than the other browsers

659141
icmp	udp
since you are using udp which uses ports it is possible the network stack is routing the icmp message back to the original socket

659141
icmp	udp
i imagine udp eats the icmp message

659141
icmp	udp
if i am correct one solution to this is to open a raw socket and manually create your udp packets listen for the anything coming back and handle udp and icmp messages as appropriate

659148
contains	lookup
to facilitate the lookup the class contains a member variables that is an in-memory dictionary which stores the words and their associated definitions

659164
any	set
fwiw they already have any number of log in pages set up for .net apps that are currently in use

659188
execution	exit
is there a way to immediately stop execution of a sql scripting in sql-server like a break or exit command

659188
lookup	any
i have a scripting that does some validation and lookup before it starts doing inserts and i want it to stop if any of the validations or lookup fail

659199
button	popup
i would like to add a popup message like the one that appears on stackoverflow when i am not logged in and i try to use voting button

659215
margins	padding
if default margins and padding are indeed your problem as ryan so helpfully suggested you can force every element to have the same base margin and padding with the following statement

659248
udp	tcp
take a look at this app that uses windows ipfiltdrv.sys to trap packets icmp tcp udp etc and read play with them with managed code c#

659256
cursor	row
this is because correlated subqueries often basically turn your query into a cursor and run one row at a time

659258
randomaccessfile	seek
i d use randomaccessfile seek to the position i wanted to change and write the change

659259
randomaccessfile	seek
i d use a randomaccessfile seek to the byte in question write it and close the file

659266
put	get
i know cout and printf have buffer today and it is said that the buffer is some like a stack and get the output of cout and printf from right to left then put them out to the console or file from top to bottem

659266
g++	gcc
under g++ gcc 3.4.2 mingw-special the output is

659270
malloc	free
why would it be different from malloc and free

659276
restructuredtext	textile
i know of three main languages used commonly in the greater programming and tech community textile markdown and restructuredtext

659278
malloc	free
with malloc and free you have a more simple situation

659281
fflush	stdout
what it looks like you re doing is sleeping for the sake of something being fflush to stdout so that some other thread won t write to stdout before you

659290
sql-server	oracle
after long experience with oracle sql-server informix and other dbms products i very seldom expected to concern myself with such issues

659293
dependency-injection	inject
if you use dependency-injection you can have it inject singleton instances instead of making all the classes have code that gets you the instance

659294
ftp	ssh
email ftp ssh ftp

659298
shutdown	logging
however even with rethrowing the exceptions i was unable to get the desired behavior ie logging the exception while still allowing android to shutdown the component it had happened it so i gave up on it after a while

659304
any	set
if you are using an xmldatasource you can set the data property to any block of xml

startup	launch
if the machine is busy or if the implementation of threada changes it could easily take longer than 100 ms for the thread to launch run its startup code and get to it s main loop if it is that kind of thread

659337
for-loop	loops
it is created dynamically which is accessible within a loops block much like c# for-loops

659356

to do this concurrently we ve elected to make the document using latex and to store the tex files in subverison

659356
environment	building
bonus points for a spelling grammar checker that we can executive via command-line so we can put it into an ant-script and automate our document building environment

659358
malloc	free
new and delete are different from malloc and free in that malloc and free only allocate and free memory

659370
command-line	cmd
aspell check -t spellchecks text on the command-line filtering out latex cmd

659372
codedom	.net
in .net you can use the class for managing a set of temporary files to be cleaned up by your application note that it is rather hidden in the codedom namespace

659382
google-chrome	firefox
in mozilla firefox and google-chrome it looks all right

659382
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome look

659399
margins	padding
since you are using no reset css i would recommend a shortcut would be to change the margins to padding instead on the wrapper divs which will be consistent between browsers

659422
continuous-integration	build-server
use case is to run a continuous-integration build-server for an asp.net-mvc site project

659433
any	set
i generally try to use unit tests for any code that has easily defined correct behavior given some reasonably small well-defined set of inputs

659434
perl	c++
i m a newbie when it comes to perl and understanding the way yahoo generates the pages i only know some basic c++

659444
webforms	asp.net
i ve built asp.net webforms projects in the past and when generating subsonic classes the teams i have been on have put our business layer dal objects into a project.framework project

659455
python	java
i ve found a lot of distributed queue managers for ruby java and python but i don t know nearly enough of any of those languages to be able to use them

659467
revision	svn
say i make a change to svn repository producing revision 125

659473
malloc	free
the reason malloc free do not have this problem is that they simply deal with blocks of memory and do not have to worry about calling constructor destructors

659482
vbscript	jscript
how to debug windows script host vbscript and jscript files

659484
sql-server	oracle
since you are coming from an oracle background where cursors are used frequently you may not be aware that in sql-server cursors are performance killers

659486
revision	svn
see svn help diff if you want to export a specific revision s diff

659489
bug-tracking	workitem
once the workitem is worked it is gone from the system aside from some auditing reporting somewhat like a bug-tracking system

659502
value	field
the form shows the default value as defined in the dataset and i can edit all the field

659506
windows-vista	windows
when our app is started programatically either through custom action in msi installer or when starting a new instance in windows-vista also happens in windows 7 beta it won t appear in the taskbar and isn t focused

659508
selected	checkbox
in gmail the user can click on one checkbox in the email list hold down the shift key and selected a second checkbox

659508
selected	checkbox
the javascript will then selected unselected the checkbox that are between the two checkbox

659530
any	set
consider whether you want the client to send the same set of info for any document or if you really need to be able to send different info for different documents

659552
naming-conventions	conventions
the naming-conventions for fields page at msdn says i shouldn t but it does not say why the way google s conventions generally tend to rationalize their prescriptions

659568
message	alert
if you do not see the alert message then your jquery scripting is not loaded which means the relative path in the src attributes is incorrect

659575
required	checked
other locations required me to checked a mix as in this example

659583
children	nodes
however what i do this is cheating is i combined the nested set with adjacency lists -- i embed a parent_id in the table so i can easily ask for the children of a nodes

659591
selected	textbox
i found the issue - i had accidentially selected the same column in the bindingsource for both the tag and the text property of the textbox

659602
cocoa	uikit
is there any methods in cocoa touch uikit to do this

659613
click	mouse
i do want this content to be off-screen and i want the mouse to be able to move over it and click on elements if the mouse is positioninged over an element at that positioning

659657
firefox	safari
this triggers the browsers download windows at least in firefox and safari but is it safe to assume the file won t be run on the server using this method

659658
superclass	subclass
on each subclass the setup methods registers itself with the superclass dictionary

659665
contact	submit
like say you want a form that submit contact information

659693
fwrite	fread
currently i m saving and loading some data in c++ struct to files by using fread fwrite

659693
fwrite	fread
this works just fine when working within this one c app i can recompile whenever the structure changes to updates the sizeof arguments to fread fwrite but how can i load this file in other programs without knowing in advance the sizeof s of the c struct

659707
versioning	upgrade
the production and test servers were upgrade and run a newer versioning of iis 6.0

659723
defined	declare
the for expression implicitly defined its iteration variables that s why you didn t need to declare i in your second example

659725
sql-server	oracle
the db needs to be fast and does not need all the logging and other overhead found in typical databases sql-server oracle db2 etc.

659725

659735
boolean	int
like boolean don t convert to int

659737
m2crypto	pycrypto
i ve been looking at most python crypto libraries i ve decided to use either pycrypto or m2crypto

659737
m2crypto	pycrypto
neither pycrypto or m2crypto mention anything about this and google didn t find anything relevant

659740
xlsx	docx
we mostly use office 2007 docx xlsx files

659757
javascript	dom
i think i m leaning toward a cut-and-paste approach since the javascript frameworks make moving pieces of dom around relatively easy

659769
dialog	pop-up
consider using pop-up dialog to show that a payment has completed or that the order has sat idle for more than 10-30 minutes without complete payment

659784
required	checked
also comparing the title for checked the current item is not the best approach because changing the menu title will required you to rewrite your code which is just very rigid design

659787
contains	any
the following will catch any error contains the text must be an instance of

659840
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
if i am using eventwaithandle or autoresetevent manualresetevent to synchronized between threads then do i need to call the close or dispose methods on that event handle .when i am done with it

659840
contains	any
and fxcop complains if i don t implement idisposable on any class that contains an eventwaithandle

659842
png	gif
i m trying to use a .net fileupload control along with a regex validator to limit filename to jpg gif or png extensions

659889
malloc	free
allocate a buffer with malloc and remember to free it afterward in the caller

659897
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
so using a char 1 column with y or n values in the oracle table how do i bind to a checkbox or checkboxlist or radiobutton or radiobuttonlist control on an asp.net 2.0 web form

659905
json	xml
it supports xml and json as serialization targets

659914
valgrind	gprof
gdb valgrind gprof

659919
ftp	ssh
if you can get away with it don t even give them ssh access -- just give them a ftp login make sure they can t access variables www and maybe a mysql account or something

659937
mockito	junit
junit and mockito are probably used most in my daily work though not limited to debugging

659938
malloc	free
malloc is an option but forcing the caller to free the memory that a callee allocated can leave open issues of ownership and removes the possibility of using anything but heap memory for the buffer

659939
contains	any
thus you can pass any number of different integer instances of new integer 5 as the parameter to getcachesyncobject and you will always get back only the very first instance that was passed in that contains that value

659953
switching	screens
the only thing they mention is that if you do try to switching to full screens mode and it is disallowed then you ll get an exception-handling which you can catch

659953
hide	show
this won t easily allow you to hide or show a full screen mode button

659967
peer	p2p
i would like to do this because it would make peer location much more effective in my p2p network as i would know that all the addresses would be part of this network

659984
margins	padding
the problem must be that ie is not applying the margins to the span tag but for some reason does apply the padding

659997
webserver	security
the security concern is that if the single machine is compromised both webserver and database are vulnerable

659997
web-applications	scalability
also there are some scalability benefits since you may only have to maintain a few database servers that are used by a bunch of different web-applications

660014
binary	octal
for clarification what i was looking for which does not appear to be possible was how to assign a literal binary number to a variables in a similar manner in which you can assign a hex or octal number

660042
scrollable	panels
maybe refresh a panels linked to a backing bean so it always shows the last x lines or pull in some javascript that when executed append new lines of text to scrollable div on your page

660044
udp	tcp
protocols such as udp tcp and sctp already work on top of it

660080
hash	md5
but none of this is relevant to validate the data for database insertion because you aren t going to store plain-text passwords - you re going to store a hash of them in some way md5 md5 + salt whatever

660080
hash	md5
instead you might make sure that you have a 32 character hexadecimal string so that it is very likely to be a properly created md5 hash

660088
oracle	mysql
i had to do this recently on oracle but the steps would have been the same on mysql

660088
any	set
i wanted to keep the most recently updated of any duplicates set

660104
file-comparison	diff
tortoisesvn is somewhat able to diff office files -- it just calls into the file-comparison features of office

660127
csv	xml
the only reason i d probably use these in production code is to output some kind of automatic string representation xml html csv of an object

660131
freebsd	linux
i imagine that a tool like this must exist for linux or freebsd too

660134
emacs	vim
perhaps someone has already done this for the hyper-programmable editors like vim and emacs

660135
windows-server	windows
this is running on a windows-server with .net-framework-version 2.0 so making it a windows service would be possible if necessary

660149
readline	ncurses
it might be simpler to use an interface like readline rather than resorting to full-blown ncurses

660167
httpwebrequest	webrequest
here request is of type ftpwebrequest but it s confusing because it looks like it was created from an httpwebrequest a sibling class even though the create methods is actually defined on webrequest the base class

660176
downcasting	upcasting
it also did cool things like generating vtables and macros for upcasting and downcasting

660181
32-bit	64bit
looks like i was trying to link a 64bit python library to a 32-bit application

660216
octal	hex
and you can also use these methods for hex 16 and octal 8

660239
configuration	upgrade
we have a similar configuration as to what you d be looking to upgrade to

660252
shutdown	restart
if you decide to write it as a service instead it will probably be ok as long as you handle the shutdown restart events etc

660279
return-type	arguments
supposing you wanted to know the size of the return-type of a function-like type f if it was passed a reference to a type t as an arguments both of those being templates parameters

660284
filtering	grouping
most operations that you call on u.grouping will affect the entire grouping table with the possibility that it first filtering down to objects related to u

660304
paint.net	photoshop
any code that can run on windows c# vb.net preferably even help how to use scriptable programs like paint.net or photoshop would be accepted

660317
protected	public
my best guess is that you have to map your subclasses to the data they need and make public protected setter s on your base-class to map these too

660317
subclassing	base-class
this would ofc mean a lot of copy-pasting since youd map your base-class the same way for all in a perfect world subclassing

660318
databound	gridview
i ve got a databound wpf gridview displaying the results of an sql query

660320
command-line	cmd
loading via inserts seems to be far too slow so i m trying to use the sqlite3 cmd-line tool and the .import cmd

660320
command-line	cmd
the cmd i issue at the command-line are these

660333
defined	declare
as written the output functions are declare but not defined

660341
revision	svn
so for us that number is the svn revision number

660354
any	set
if memory is of any concern i set expiration policy

660358
entity-relationship	diagram
is there any way to take an exisiting codebase and create object relationship diagram or entity-relationship diagram erd s

660366
configuration	environment
so it is using my development database configuration instead of the production environment which is the config that i want

660366
configuration	environment
it seems like when i load the environment.rb file it just defaults to the development environment and loads development.rb and the development database configuration from database.yml

660367
temporary	copy
keep doing that or if it s a huge search form create a temporary copy of it in a database that gets purged after a few days or on a lru basis when a space limit is used

660379
32-bit	64bit
on both 32-bit and 64bit machines

660396
arrays	loops
then loops through diag for every element of it test the three corresponding fields use as index of your field arrays

660401
network-protocols	tcp-ip
a bit of a guess but sql have different options for network-protocols including shared memory tcp-ip named pipes and via

660401
sqlcmd	ssms
so if ssms tries to connect via named pipes it may not be able to resolve the server name whereas if sqlcmd uses tcp-ip it will be able to

660416
getter	setter
trivial getter and setter sometimes don t have unit tests written for them

660425
fpdf	fpdi
i am trying to add an existing pdf created otherwise to a pdf created with fpdf using fpdi

660428
triggers	insert
starting with mysql 5.0.2 you can write a stored procedure linked to a triggers which can examine the new column each time a row is insert and automatically copy the other column s value into the new column if no value was supplied for the new column

660441
click	mouse
suddenly the uielement detected under the mouse click is no longer the playingcard but the surface

660452
package-management	packaging
as a rule of thumb it s better to have one package-management in the system so you ll be better off packaging everything in rpms and managing it via yum

660452
required	checked
regerding your question you could try to override dependency checked by downloading rpm of the required package an doing rpm -i --force file.rpm since yum does not have any option for forced installation

660467
arguments	default
by default the sun jvms will not run garbage-collection in permgen but this can be enabled with optional java command arguments

660474
dsa	rsa
the other will give an error with the text expecting an rsa key or expecting a dsa key

660480
fields-for	ancestry
understanding that an event is like a hidden private field i ve navigated through the debugger to the non-public fields-for the windows.forms.form ancestry of my form but to no avail

660482
logout	login
if the user comes back to the login page later and the request is unauthenticated we check for the existence of the session cookie - if it exists we know that the user has previously had a session so we explicitly log them out exactly as we do for the user-initiated logout

660482
logout	login
the custom session cookie is deleted for each explicit logout and re-populated for each successful login

660486
z-index	overlap
then your content z-index 1 and padding-bottom footer height - desired overlap

660487
implements	extends
the createresponse methods is implements in a subclass that extends request

660498
selected	button
then you selected which objects you want to generate mappings for and click a button which generates mappings and or classes with a templates engine

660508
implements	abstract
since the response class is abstract you are forced to implements createresponse before you can call sendrequest

660528
order	add
the obvious solution would be to have a row number property on a modelview element but the drawback is that you have to re-generate those when you add records or change sort order

660533
xsd	xml
i really don t want it to have to be an arrays of its own type that only holds a string but i also really don t want to leave it called items without xml comments does anyone know how to add those to an xsd

660535
copy-constructor	constructor
in fact here you have a templates class that will generate as many copy-constructor as types used as parameter of the constructor

660535
copy-constructor	constructor
because in you example it s not copy-constructor but constructor that take type u as parameter a convertion constructor.

660554
selected	button
when you click in the middle of the text text gets unselecteded when you release the mouse allowing you to start editing instantly and if you still want to selected all just press the button again and this time it will not unselected on release

660557
xsd	xml
you can get custom results in the other direction class xml xsd but that doesn t help you much

660559
pointers	stack
pointers to data on stack passing methods by address etc

660559
pointers	stack
so to summarize it depends a lot on your audience and on the language s you ll tackle pointerss will be meaningless in the context of lisp or java as well as on how deep you are willing to go in the direction of what is heap what is stack how scope is translated into stack why never to return a pointers to a local variables etc

660559
pointers	stack
when i taught pointers to an engineering class i ultimately fired up a debugger on a simple hello world program and showed the students the actual machine code register values and corresponding memory dumps with stack manipulation and parameter passing etc. but they were ready for it

660562
wamp	php
basically what i run now on my home pc is one of these wamp in a box applications so i can write my php code and use a mysql database

660566
gethashcode	equals
why is it important to override gethashcode when equals methods is overridden

660566
gethashcode	equals
in c# what specifically can go wrong if one fails to override gethashcode when overriding equals

660584
gethashcode	equals
the reason being is that the implementation uses both gethashcode and equals to properly find a value in the table

660584
gethashcode	equals
failing to keep gethashcode and equals in sync will completely break this algorithm and numerous others

660587
gethashcode	equals
as it is documented that gethashcode must return the same value if two instances are equals then it is the prerogative of any code which wishes to test them for equalsity to use gethashcode as a first pass to grouping objects which may be equals as it knows that objects with different hash codes cannot be equals

660587
gethashcode	equals
if your gethashcode methods returns different value for equals objects then they may get into different grouping in the first pass and never be compared using their equalss methods

660587
gethashcode	equals
in short always override gethashcode when you override equals and ensure their implementations are consistent

660591
gethashcode	equals
if you always put things in the bucket corresponding to their gethashcode then you only have to search one bucket using equals to see if something is there

660591
gethashcode	equals
so the rule is if equalss says two objects are equals they must have the same gethashcode

660596
put	get
if we would put everything into one clause that clear semantic could be broken - not to mention that when we put the definition into the class again all of a sudden the templates would get its own clause

660602
hosts-file	hosts
you ll need to setup virtual hosts with apache and combine that with hardcode s answer setting your hosts

660609
oracle	mysql
if possible it should be customizable or flexible enough to also be able to parse or at least ignore vendor-specific syntax such as oracle tablespace definitions or mysql s limit clause

660613
glut	sdl
i would like to use the built in libraries in order to do this and not something like sdl sdl_showcursor 0 or glut glutsetcursor glut_cursor_none

660632
reflection	runtime
do they all use reflection at runtime

660639
.when	ready
.when you re ready to start favour designs that use thread-safe queue to transfer workitem between threads and take care to ensure that those workitem are accessed only by one thread at a time

660644
directory	folder
i m trying to find all the files and folder under a specified directory

660648
radio-button	selected
i d like to also log their currently selected radio-button to the database

660649
constructor	object
it does not call a magical copy constructor to replace the object reference in the caller

660656
base-class	subclass
if i create an abstract property in my c# base-class and then a subclass implements it is it possible to then reference and use that property in one of my base-class s methods later on once the subclass sets that property

660656
base-class	subclass
i want to sort of pass a value from my subclass to base-class so that in my base-class i can perform some logic using it in that base-class methods

660656
base-class	subclass
i don t really need a property if i can set some sort of flag in my subclass via an abstract field so that the base-class can use that flag for some logic that my subclass is going to depend on such as sending an httprequest

660656
any	set
basically i want to be able to set a flag in any subclasses using this base to say true or false so that the base class s sendrequest methods knows whether to chose from a couple of uris that i have set in my base class

660656
base-class	subclass
that flag will determine which format to use in the base-class s sendrequest methods since each subclass will vary in terms of what uri format the base-class should use for that subclass in order to send the httprequest on behalf of the subclass

660661
yacc	cup
i can recommend a few java implementation of lex yacc byacc j java cup that you can use an existing sql grammar with

660679
windows-vista	windows
in windows-vista and windows server 2008 an atomic move function has been added - movefiletransacted

660683
contains	any
however how i could prove that any non regular context free language could not contains any regular infinite sublanguages

660684
alignment	layout
see my question here android layout - alignment issue with imageview

660697
delphi	c++
there are apis available database drivers for .net delphi and generic odbc dao as well as libraries for c c++ and other languages

660697
oracle	mysql
there s a dbexpress driver included out of the box for ms sql server oracle mysql db2 and others

660704
debugging	trace
a crash dump with an exception that says you violated threading rules by doing this along with stack trace is much easier to debugging then a report from a customer on the other side of the world that says every now and then the app just freezes on me or it spits out gobbly gook

660725
diagram	erd
for example urs srs erd db diagram class diagram use case test scripting user manual and training materials usually are separated document

660726
python	php
when most bindings for a specific programming language are compiled php python delphi .net etc they link against libmysql and libmysql contains no reference to the mysqldump program

660740
contains	any
it s possible that you could prove that any language that contains an regular infinite sublanguage is regular by using some of these rules

660752
solaris	linux
on solaris cygwin and linux with gcc versions 2.95.3 3.4.4

660753
fseek	ftell
you don t have to worry about the 2gb limit as long as you don t need attempt to fseek or ftell you just read from or write to the stream.

660762
put	get
it was very easy to get people to want to help but very hard to get them to actually put the effort required into the project in order to be useful

660780
profiling	debugging
i believe the only time you need this file is for debugging or profiling

660782
linux	unix
different cpu types different numbers of cores and chips windows linux unix etc

660791
value	field
that set command can accept a structure input where each field name is a property name and each field value is the new value for that property

660797
shutdown	restart
if you can incur a shutdown restart then close the socket in the servlet s destroy method

660798
profiling	debugging
what we re hoping to be able to do is that i can log in with my profiling and developer debugging etc my iphone application and her do the same under her own profiling not seeing mine and vice-versa

660799
sql-server	oracle
i created a basic crystal viewer that attaches to data in sql-server access and oracle

660813
activerecord	datamapper
if it is object oriented then are you using an activerecord pattern gateway pattern or datamapper pattern to handle your database mapping

660827
document	element
you have to read every node attributes element ... in the document

660850
callback	methods
you need to create callback to pass into each begin methods that then run the continuation of the methods

660858
any	set
from this point that function takes over and creates a popup windows giving it a name and some features by all means add any surplus ones you d like and then attention comes back to the form where we now set the target attributes to the name of the windows we just created

660864
unsigned	integer
when you convert a signed type to an unsigned type if the number is negative the result of the conversion must be the 2 s complement representation of the integer

660883
myspace	twitter
having a standard api to send updates and post pictures to myspace facebook flickr picassa blogger twitter and other services would be very useful

660895
synonym	term
knuth rejects the term heap used as a synonym for the free memory store

660905
handler	service
if i try to use the same service client then i have to de-register the event handler to every request once the request is furnished which somehow does not look like an elegant way to achieve this

660930
graphviz	doxygen
for actually creating quick statecharts or similar rough diagrams i do a lot of work with the textual dot language in graphviz and often then include those diagrams directly into documentation generated with doxygen

660961
constructor	object
the standard run method invokes the callable object passed to the objectâ s constructor as the target argument if any with sequential and keyword arguments taken from the args and kwargs arguments respectively

661018
git-repo	repo
i ve found tons of documentation and tutorials about to pull down an existing svn repo into git but nothing about pushing a git-repo to a fresh svn repo

661028
double	int
how do i divide two int to get a double

661036
double	int
cast the int to double

661049
dictionary	arrays
make sure the data source arrays or dictionary or wherever you ve saved the values is changed before you call reloaddata

661056
compact-framework	.net
the minimum you need is the .net compact-framework sdk

661065
json	xml
on the php side you need to serialize the arrays to a format like json or xml rather than just print ing it

661073
directory	folder
so if your files are in the directory c mylib src main java org syntax jedit then you need to point the compiler folder at c mylib src main java

if you want to keep on working with git as your main repository and just need to export the revision to svn from time to time you could use tailor to keep the svn repository in sync

661074
revision	svn
it can copy revision between different source control systems and would update the svn with the changes you make in git

661083
compact-framework	.net
using this sdk from a .net managed application was initially a pain because of limitations in the interop abilities of the .net compact-framework

661085
filesystems	fileinfo
i suspect that fileinfo actually touches the filesystems to get it s info where as i d expect that getfilenamewithoutextension is only string operations - so performance of one over the other might be better

661090
nsarray	plist
you should serialization the data into a xml type plist format if you can then it can be natively interpreter by cocoa classes like nsarray and nsdictionary

661090
dictionary	arrays
nspropertylistserializer is capable of producing mutable or immutable arrays and dictionary from a file or from an nsdata object containing serialized data in plist format

661099
value	field
i have a column which is a number field with value ranging from 0 to 100

661104
safari	opera
my specific browser requirements are ff3+ ie7+ safari 3+ and opera 9+

661105
windows-vista	windows
and windows-vista is the first decent version since windows came to light

661115
directory	folder
a .class file in the appropriate folder depending on its package under the bin directory should do it

661126
controller	routes
the routes will match by default left-to-right so domain home index will match first to lang domain controller index action default to index id default to 0 null

661129
capacity	storage
some time ago in the msdn forms i responded to a few questions on how to detect the storage cards in the filesystems and how does one get the storage card s capacity

661143
buildpath	libs
you can set this in the project properties by visiting java buildpath - libs - add class folder

661143
directory	folder
therefore if you wish to have the compiler access com.stackoverflow.example.class present in the classes directory under project a but not in the buildpath of project a then you should add classes as a class folder and not classes com stackoverflow as a class folder

661145
for-loop	loops
however i have noticed that the results being written to the table seem to overlap or get mixed up i.e say i call the api at loops counter 10 the result for-loops counter 10 may appear in the table beside the value for-loops counter 15

661177
directory	folder
say i want to install something to the directory c pony but the folder pony does not exist how can i get installshield to inform the user that the folder pony does not exist and ask the user if he or she wants to create the directory

661179
implements	abstract
i would try having your abstract-class implements the interface and have the methods as abstract

661179
abstract-class	subclassing
then each implementation just subclassing the abstract-class

661191
keyboard	mouse
the system os keeps pumping messages like keyboard or mouse click etc to the message q of the application

661194
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i ll start off by saying that it is a common misconception that asp.net-mvc is meant to replace webforms like you had suggested

661196
expression	evaluation
for example if you are wanting to let the user enter an algebraic expression for evaluation consider limiting them to one letter variables names numbers and a specific set of operators and functions

661203
callback	methods
for example if a callback methods on your class is called by another thread the asynccallback delegate to the tcplistener.beginaccepttcpclient methods understand that the callback executes on that other thread

661203
callback	methods
so even though the callback occurs on the same object you still have to synchronize access to the members of the object within the callback methods

661205
webforms	asp.net
asp.net mvc uses a different design pattern than webforms

661205
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you can of course do this with webforms but asp.net-mvc does it out of the box for you which is nice

661205
webforms	asp.net
that said you also lose some of the things that make asp.net webforms easy to work with like viewstate

661205
asp.net-mvc	webforms
also i d like to add that you can mix and match webforms and asp.net-mvc so its not a all or nothing situation

661213
mouseover	mouseout
in my case some jquery code makes a tooltip appear and disappear with an animation on mouseover and mouseout

661223
http	ssl
mantis is installed on an ssl webserver that requires http authentication

661223
windows-xp	windows
in other words it seems that the soap request does not include the username if it is run on windows vista 64-bit whereas on windows-xp everything works perfectly

661226
pthreads	fork
i have come across so much code lately that uses threads which really should not its obvious that someone just wanted to profess their undying love of pthreads threads when a single yes just one fork would have done the job

661229
selected	button
if no javascript is supported a selected go open button should be displayed allowing the user to still work with the application

661236
margins	padding
however the server may ont have the same fonts install and you have to calculate padding and margins on the server side

661247
buildpath	libs
project - properties - java buildpath - libs - add external class folder

661248
windows-xp	windows
this is not too big of an issue though as unlike windows server 2003 windows-xp will automatically mount the virtual hard disk when it is plugged in

661261
ruby-on-rails	rspec
my setup was with ruby-on-rails 2.2.2 and rspec 1.1.12

661264
global-asax	web-config
changing to the asp.net web site model won t have any effect as the recycle will also happen some of changes that triggers it for sure web-config global-asax app_code

661267
base-class	inherited
using new here documents the fact that the inherited methods is intended as a replacement for the base-class version of do

661288
directory	folder
i am doing a file transfer application so as soon as a new file folder is added to the monitored directory i will execute my c# code to other some other operations

661289
integer	modulus
the methods that i thought was to convert the string to integer using parsing and splitting each character using modulus or something and performing operations on them

661356
output	mode
when i execute my c++ code which uses the cgal library under debugging mode i see a lot of debugging messages in the output windows about a first-chance exception-handling cgal uncertain_conversion_exception-handling

661371
fopen	fread
and the functions that work with it fopen fread etc. is a good example of how encapsulation can be applied in c to establish interfaces

661372
implements	abstract
you can t have classes with c but you can easily implements abstract data types

661377
stream	send
tcp-ip is stream protocols without flow control built-in so different messages sent using separate send calls can be received in one recv

661382
dialog	pop-up
when you click on a product in the carousel a dialog modal needs to pop-up

661432
.net	wcf
i m involved in a project that uses wcf rest on iis but of course i d recommend having a look at the framework i built openrasta is a .net open-source stack that makes implementing rest much easier

661459
meta-inf	jar
the dlls must be in the root of the jar the jar must be signed and the dll must appear with checksum in the meta-inf manifest.mf for the vm to pick them up

661466
publishing	release
tfs is full fledged software development management system which contains version-control release management requirements tracking document publishing and other things

661475
traffic	wan
if you are searching for a list of valid wan nodes ie not just one segment then you will potentially be sending a lot of unwanted traffic

661493
sql-server	firebird
this is different to databases like interbase and firebird and threw me when i first started using sql-server

661493
triggers	insert
this is a reasonable introduction to triggers and the concepts required to make sense of the insert and deleted tables with an explanation of why you will be missing events in your own example

661515
version-control	git
from my experience with distributed version-control systems dvcs like git and mercurial in open source projects most setup models use a centralized setup for their project think github

661534
windows-server	windows
im not sure if this would affect the issue but the local server is running windows-server 2003 and the remote server is running windows 2000

661556
bug-tracking	trac
also many project-management bug-tracking packages integrate with svn like trac for instances

661562
decimal-point	digits
in javascript when converting from a float to a string how can i get just 2 digits after the decimal-point

661568
common-lisp	scheme
emacs lisp uses dynamic binding and languages like scheme and common-lisp are using lexical binding

661591
getter	setter
the preferred thing to do is often to add methods called getter and setter to the class owning the arrays or make it available by some other more structural means which depend on the exact semantics and usage of the arrays

661595
environment	building
when you start using team building for example or using stuff like workitem then you ll see that tfs can really manage your whole development life cycle providing a rich environment in which reporting ease of use slick vs integration and solid source control are all rolled in to one

661595
deployment	install
a major con is the install process on the server side which is tedious non-flexible and in my mind i come from a field in which packaging up apps and deployment are very important a bad example of how sql-server reporting services sharepoint and web-services could be installed

661599
authentication	login
i m trying to determine the most secure method for an ajax based login form to authentication and set a client side cookie

661599
any	set
4 would using a hidden iframe be any more secure calling a web page to set the cookies

661608
any	set
it looks like you should be able to set to true before calling any of the ruby-aaws methods classes and see what urls are being requested

661620
attributes	properties
i m creating a usercontrol and i just can t remember the name of the attributes which you use to decorate the properties which you want to act as the default content properties

661620
attributes	properties
i know there is an attributes which i need to add to the title properties with to enable this support but i ve forgotten what it is and can t find it anywhere

661645
macros	vba
when you record a macros of the reset to quick styles from xxx template word generates the vba code

661647
callback	methods
a good use of a protocol would be to define a set of callback methods for a delegate where the delegate must respond to all methods

661647
methods	extend
categories provide the ability to extend a current object by adding methods to it class or instance methods

661652
any	set
to the server and the network an ajax call is simply an http call and any http response by the server can set a cookie

661652
http	ssl
you mentioned using https http over ssl - that prevents others from being able to read information in transit or impersonate the server so it s very handy for preventing plain text transmission of the password or other important information

661656
64bit	x86
i got the same error when trying to run a 64bit dll with nunit that was set to work as an x86 assembly using corflags

661661
children	nodes
when clicking a nodes the parent and children are updated

661678
selected	cell
this means you leak all your model objects custom cell objects etc from each of the other tabs that were not selected

661688
switching	screens
and when i switching to another resolution which is 1280 1024 ideally the listbox should fit to the screens resolution

661694
contains	set
the mutable arrays contains a set of strings

661721
xsd	xml
in our company we have discussion going on whether to allow xml xsd strucutures used in webservices that contain parts that are loosly-typed in order to make changes to them easier

661749
oracle	mysql
it provides all the features that i need and save me tons of time for managing and developing mysql and oracle

661826
python	c++
the writer application is c++ and the reader is currently python on win32 xp

661827
richfaces	icefaces
there are few jsf implementations apache myfaces sun reference implementation and some jsf component libraries icefaces richfaces woodstock etc.

661830
disposable	dispose
but this methods must be called somehow so exactly as in your example the classes that encapsulate or contains idisposable have to dispose these so they have to be disposable as well etc

661831
itemtemplate	itemscontrol
the control consists of a single itemscontrol with it s itempaneltemplate switched for a horizontal stackpanel its itemssource bound to a dependencyproperty exposed by the usercontrol and its itemtemplate set in the usercontrol.resources

661840
defined	declare
if you want to declare a set of struct with this ability you can make them implements and defined getenumerator as

661844
textbox	button
if i first click on the button to createtext the textbox is shown and the other elements are also created correctly

661844
textarea	textbox
i think textarea is only displayed after it gets a textbox there to append.

661860
subtract	time
lookup the +x hrs or -x hrs then subtract the offset from the date time you have stored

661862
buffering	streaming
in game we continuously load and unload streaming targets so we d like to use the maximum amount of our buffering 64 megabytes

661863
python	php
developing sites that handle unicode correctly in php isn t too much fun right now its unicode support is very poor compared to languages like python and .net

661864
handler	service
so when i disabled the led matrix isr and the timer tick isr needed service the processor would be stuck in the low isr to handle the timer tick but the timer tick handler was not there

661874
attributes	properties
remember to declare the properties with the copy attributes so that the receivers don t hold on to your private mutable arrays

661874
getter	setter
the login controllers s property should have at least a getter and setter which you can synthesize but you can implements more specific accessor methods for efficiency

661874
instance-variables	accessor
if you insert or store the object somewhere other than in an arrays in an instance-variables or if you do something else in the same methods such as tell a view that it needs to display then your accessor methods is fancy

661935
linux	unix
on linux unix i can rely on lang but it is not always set

661945
put	get
if you re really persistent you can get it down to where you have to put it in the hot sun to get the last few molecules of time out of it

661959
value	field
beyond that you might want to think about how you could simplify your code by refactoring to smaller reusable functions say for creating a label creating a field using parameters to provide the attributes value

661964
richfaces	tomahawk
other libraries exist such as richfaces myfaces tomahawk and so on

661965
asp.net-mvc	webforms
one thing that i d like to add to previous answers is that if you do not want to embrace asp.net-mvc at all you can use the mvp pattern to separate concerns using webforms

661965
silverlight	wpf
the good thing about the mvp pattern is that you can work in a way that you can switch the presentation logic from asp.net to silverlight winforms or even wpf

661987
implements	abstract
edit just so you know examplefilefilter implements the abstract class filefilter

662009
sql-server	oracle
sql-server has implemented the sequence similar to the oracle

662010
triggers	insert
having read around and tested this myself i realise now that a triggers fires per command and not per row insert deleted or updated

662010
triggers	insert
my insert triggers written to work with a single record then graps the data off the inserted table and sends it off to the stored procedure

662010
triggers	insert
the update triggers does the same as a delete + an insert

662010
procedure	records
the stored procedure is rather big and intense and i do not think there s a way of having to avoid looping through the records of the inserted table in one way or another ok maybe there is but i d like to be able to read the code too p so i m not gonna bore you with that one unless you like to think otherwise

662015
value	field
the field will get its value automatically

662037
environment	building
for example to open a document c foo bar.xml you could do something like untested no convenient building environment at the moment

662072
menuitem	button
how do i decouple the processed method from talking specifically to a button so that it could also talk to a menuitem or a listview which fires the event in the view and so that it doesn t even have to be an element at all that calls it a unit test class

662090
selected	button
then after the page loads javascript would hide that button add change functionality to the selected box and send an ajax request to log the activity

662094
command-line	cmd
if you don t want to change the script itself then open a cmd windows and execute the script from the cmd-line

662102
triggers	insert
writing a cursor based triggers could potentially just be moving your problem from the report query to your table insert instead

662129
profiling	trace
in addition to extended sql trace and tkprof you can profiling pl sql code with the oracle supplied package dbms_profilingr

662138
submitchanges	datacontext
however this doesn t seem to get around the problem of the datacontext not realising that it has had new stuff added to it until you submitchanges

662148
compression	streaming
i think the compression is mpeg-2 and the streaming is around 3.5 4 mbs

662150
asp.net-mvc	wcf
it all seems very good i m just concerned that the new project i m working on is using all the newer technologies - wcf asp.net-mvc etc - and that if i add one more infant technology i m going to end up with lots of problems and not enough technical skill or community support to figure them out.

662151
arrays	loops
windows has a paint message and when you receive it you can loops through the arrays doing lineto functions scaling the data as you go to convert it to pixel coordinates

662157
value	field
it isn t a common practice if you did it someone looking at your code would assume the length field was some special value and not just the arrays size

662178
contains	set
does this scripting set the content-type to something contains xml

662179
stored-procedures	ado.net
i am confused about if i use ado.net at the client side to call stored-procedures in the database server

662193
triggers	insert
to insert records to an audit table from an insert you would do something like this in the triggers

662193
triggers	insert
personally i would have a separate triggers for insert updates and deletes as you want differnt code for each

662218
value	field
if the user changes the search field value for a brand new value not selected no afterupdateelement is used and our hidden value is still set to true

662231
entity-framework	nhibernate
what or m would you recommend for a large asp.net application entity-framework or nhibernate

662250
powerpc	arm
more general than just sse covers powerpc and arm extensions too

662254
updating	updates
let s look at your updates statements first from what i can tell you are updating the same table with the same where-clause the only difference is the columns

662269
grouping	sorting
you could perform a sphinx search sorting by your grouping by attribute and then loop over those items in php summing as you go

662272
sendmessage	message
.net doesn t provide a built-in way to get the handle for it you can p invoke sendmessage and send the cb_getcomboboxinfo message

662277
selected	textbox
i also need to have additional related string values from the same table row in the db table available on the client so when the user selected from the dropdown this related data gets populated in a textbox on the form

662279
managed-code	native-code
i ve seen this working in native-code but i suspect you are in managed-code and the runtime is being smart enough to catch your behaviour and deliver a metaphorical slap to the hindquarters -

662281
click	mouse
since the button does something with your mouse click it absorbs your mouse event and turns it into a clickevent

662284
procedure	records
this single statement can then be transformed into a versioning that can be applied to all inserted records at once eliminating the need for a stored procedure and thereby the need for a cursor

662289
value	field
under sources selected an encoding value from the encoding drop-down field

662295
ports	dmz
your web service sitting in the dmz should be allowed to do what it needs via appropriately secured ports on the firewall

662295
web-services	security
without more detail on the security reasons for not allowing two machines to talk directly or more detail on why these two web-services need to pass calls for identical functionality between one another it seems like it will be hard to help

662316
entity-framework	ado.net
i put together a fairly lengthy answer to a similar question ado.net entity-framework decision making between orm solutions

662323
margins	padding
set margins padding positioning of elements

662324
put	get
put value annotations on your .net types add a couple of simple things to your aspx and you get jquery validation for free

662341
google-chrome	opera
the following piece of html gives a centered button in ff3 opera safari google-chrome ie7 and ie8 compat but not in ie8 standard

662341
display	width
my thinking is that all the browsers are incorrect - shouldn t the button be 100 width if it s display block

662341
contains	elements
since input isn t a block-level elements i should have just contains it within a div with text-align center

662359
display	width
shouldn t the button be 100 width if it s display block

662405
.net	wcf
ps i m using wcf c# 3 and the server has .net 3.5 installed

662417
associations	model
i ve got a model with a has_many through associations that i m trying to create

662426
cobertura	emma
after we got emma working we switched to cobertura and our final ant scripting slightly abridged and anonymized looks like

662445
shell	tcsh
if you re already within a graphical environment try export display 0 for bash like shells bash sh etc or setenv display 0 for c shell based shells csh tcsh etc

662452
decompression	on-the-fly
compress data that can t be generated on-the-fly - then decompression into ram at startup for fast access

662454
pointers	stack
the only state information you need is a single pointers to the end of stack

662454
decrement	increment
to allocate and de-allocate you just increment and decrement that single pointers

662454
implements	extends
note a stack can sometimes be implements to start at the top of a section of memory and extends downwards rather than growing upwards

662454
pointers	stack
computer programs typically have a stack called a call stack which stores information relevant to the current function such as a pointers to whichever function it was called from and any local variables

662454
pointers	stack
if you disassemble some code you ll see relative pointers style references to portions of stack but as far as a higher level language is concerned the language imposes its own rules of scope

662454
pointers	stack
no list needs to be maintained of all the segments of free memory just a single pointers to the current top of stack

662461
installation	environment
i ve got a teamcity 4 installation where tomcat has bit the dust with the following error the apr based apache tomcat native library which allows for optimal performance in production environment was not found in java.library path

662500
command-line	cmd
from inside visual-studio project properties c++ cmd-line or by disabling suppress banner option there you can find the cmd that visual-studio runs

662500
build-system	cmake
alternatively you can use cmake or some other build-system

662502
arguments	undefined
undefined function or methods numrecords for input arguments of type org.apache.derby.impl.jdbc.embedresultset40

662514
order	add
there is a hierarchy 1-4 level deep of categories and end nodes add specialized variables - they accumulate in the order of 1000 so it would be a bit unpractical to add specialized tables to join with

662521
hide	show
i want to be able to check this django-templates variables in all of my templatess to hide show new features

662527
sql-server	mysql
if you switch from sql-server 2008 to mysql for example the persistence layer changes of course

662532
automake	cmake
to be honest i always do my spare time coding inside an ide code blocks monodevelop anjuta or an editor virtually always scite and the compiling i do in a terminal via a makefile handwritten cmake automake

662535
cassini	iis
how can i ensure iis and cassini send css and javascript files with the content-type header ie text css

662536
charsequence	spannable
sets the text that this textview is to display see settext charsequence and also sets whether it is stored in a styleable spannable buffering and whether it is editable

662541
hosts-file	hosts
it can be solved by removing the following line from your hosts

662543
environment	building
win32 is defined by the sdk or the building environment so it does not use the implementation reserved namespace

662543
any	set
you ll find a similar set of dual defines with nearly identical names and similar uses such as _unicode unicode _debugging debugging or maybe _dll dll i think that only the unicode ones get much of any use in their different versions

662544
spaces	output
there should have been 4 spaces in the resulting output

662546
environment	execution
if you environment variables are going to contains code that perl should be execution then you should look into the safe module

662548
approximation	integral
the avgpower methods uses a rectangle approximation to the integral to

662558
selected	button
i only have one requirement right now each option has a value attribute indicating the stock number for the selected item so when the submit button is clicked my processing page receives the stock number of the item they want

662565
order	add
once i have generated the huffman codes and stored them in order i can just add the symbols that they refer to in order as they come along in 2

662570
pointers	stack
also every time you call a subroutine the program counter pointers to the next machine instruction and any important registers and sometimes the parameters get pushed on stack

662570
pointers	stack
in classic systems ram was laid out such that stack pointers started out at the bottom of memory the heap pointers started out at the top and they grew towards each other

662581
convention	standards
i d use a different file naming convention than standards jquery plugins though ie not jquery.xxxxxx.js

662598
protected	public
it says if you have a public protected methods which is not abstract nor final nor empty it is not designed for extension

662620
assign	add
if you re maintaining an arrays you could still add the new object to the arrays and assign the object to the new view controllers before your put it on screen

662621
zend-amf	amfphp
and just so you know some of the developers from amfphp moved to work on zend-amf

662621
zend-amf	amfphp
so in a sense zend-amf is the continuation of amfphp

662630
radio-button	selected
what i want is to get the value of which radio-button is selected sent back to the javascript method

662636
value	field
when i leave that field i wnat the value of the selecbox to be the amount typed in the input box

662637
webforms	asp.net
i m planning on using asp.net webforms for this project

662639
push	pull
i don t necessarily need to do any form of validation on the messages themselves i just need to pull push data

662674
mouseleave	mouseenter
if the radius is anything less than 100 when mouseleave happens the from property will make it jump up to 100 and likely cause a mouseenter

662684
webforms	asp.net
simple integration with asp.net webforms - mvc is another story

662716
value	field
if that s the case then you ought to have an manufacturerid field that you can bind the value of the selected to

662737
selection	cells
you might also consider not using with a true radio-button setup as you ve described and instead going with a more iphone-like approach--for instance using a uitableview with cells corresponding to your radio selection and that toggle checked unchecked on a touch

662739
value	field
but if you can access request objects in the controllers you can insert that value to your model field when you pull the model objects from db

662762
lighttpd	apache
can i write web application that i can host on windows iis web server and linux apache or lighttpd without any changes

662764
benchmarking	profiling
the obvious answer is of course to first write it in the most readable plain understandable way then compile it with as much optimization as you can get and then benchmarking and profiling that

662783
alloca	malloc
for instance you have functions like alloca assuming you can get past the copious warnings concerning its use which is a form of malloc that specifically uses the stack not the heap for memory

662791
configuration	environment
the difference will be the configuration of the os-specific servers and also your python environment on each os

662797
32-bit	16-bit
while changing from the arm 32-bit per instruction instruction set to the thumb 16-bit per instruction instruction set can be useful on some arm processors it reduces the size of the immediate field

662806
tree	trie
usually with huffman tree the trie will be unbalanced

662823
gedit	gnome
is is possible in gedit the gnome text editor to indent a wrapped line of text

662836
attributes	properties
you can do a generalized model called the entity attributes value model but it has a lot of pitfalls when you re trying to deal with specific properties of a product

662836
any	set
so one set of tables would tell you for any given product what properties it can have possibly along with valid value ranges and another set of tables would tell you for any individual product what the values are

662838
getter	setter
they re simply generated getter and setter

662853
value	field
if i create a dib using createdibsection i can specify wether it should be top-down or bottom-up by setting the biheight field of the bitmapinfoheader struct to a negative or positive value

entity-framework	ado.net
i m using ado.net entity-framework

662892

662911
children	tree
annotate the tree with the number of unfinished children

662942
difference	zero
moreover with use of apc performance difference is zero null nada

662949
any	set
when i come to save the form data with a function in my model which extends zend_db_table any blank integers fields are set to 0 and any blank date fields are set to 0000-00-00 - in both cases they should be null

662959
attributes	properties
the attributes properties of the webcontrol base class is what you re looking for

662977
execute	prepare
i d rather have a web service prepare to execute longer than needed than throw an exception-handling

662982
temporary	copy
the copy of the underlying string returned by str is a temporary object that will be destructed at the end of the expression so directly calling c_str on the result of str for example in results in a dangling pointer.

663003
triggers	insert
then an on insert or on update triggers to set that value to the current time

663003
value	field
if you index this new field it should be a lot faster than comparing all the data field value

663028
python	java
there are no tuples in java but you could use a map or two parallel arrays to specify input output pairs and then do a loop just like your python example

663032
scala	java
the difference is obviously something to do with the fact that in java generics are never covariant in t whereas in scala they can be either covariant or not

663039
show	next
but once you touch the next uitabbaritem and go back to the previous one the uitableviewcontroller doesn t show you can only see a uiwindow in it s place

663045
persistence	hibernate
hibernate is a persistence api which is intented not to care about how data is stored in no matter what dbms engine or xml files

663045
xquery	xslt
if storing your data in xml format is important for you since you work with xml maybe it has more sense to use a xml native database such as exist which lets you access and transform your xml data in a xml-friendly way xslt xquery xpath

663054
stderr	stdout
close_fds is supported on windows search for close_fds after that link starting with python 2.6 if stdin stdout stderr are not redirected

663054
stderr	stdout
redirect the standard handles by setting stdin stdout or stderr

663054
stderr	stdout
so you can either subprocess.call with and not setting stdin stdout or stderr the default or setting them to none

663057
value	field
most browsers keep a value cache that is based on the name of the field this is the value that is being suggested as autocomplete by your browser even though you may never have visited the site before

663062
malloc	free
i think that using a separate thread is probably not the best safest or fastest way -- my guess is you d be better off using a type of incremental copying allocator where on each malloc or free you compact copy forwards or backwards in memory some number of allocated blocks with the number of bytes that you copy depleting a budget that is periodically reset to its initial value on each screen refresh

663062
malloc	free
if there s enough time in the budget a call to malloc or free will completely defragment memory otherwise it will defragment it as much as possible in the given the time constraints

663062
malloc	free
the important thing is to avoid oscillations the same block being moved forwards then backwards on successive calls to malloc or free

663064
pointers	stack
i have some code that stack dumps when using sprintf to copy a a pointers to strings

663077
value	field
type to enter the value in the text field

663080
json	xml
as json is easier to read and write then xml

663080
json	csv
it follows that csv comma seperated values is easier to read and write then json

663080
json	csv
so if you ever want to create a config or data file for your next app here is some code to convert csv to json to poco objects

663096
arrays	loops
therefore the test passes and your loops continues forever well it continues until you run far enough past the end of the animals arrays that it causes a segfault

663102
spaces	output
you haven t allocated any spaces in your output arrays to put the copy into

663108
selected	cell
then you would right-click on an empty cell and selected paste special then selected transpose

663111
contains	any
usually you should link a program contains any c++ code with the c++ compiler adding the fortran and c libraries to the link line

663125
gridview	listview
the previous data option only works with a listview and only if you don t have a gridview associated with it

my hosts contains

663146
htmlspecialchars	echo
or define a function that does echo htmlspecialchars arg with a shorter name to avoid all that typing

663150
hashtable	set
i have the hashtable set up and am loading the values but am not sure what to test

663199
host	dns
we host our own dns servers and instruct the client to point the domain at them

663208
profiling	trace
i would set up a trace in sql-server profiling to see what set options settings the connection is using when connecting from .net code and what settings are being used in ssms

663210
versioning	upgrade
of course if you are using an old versioning of oracle they will probably just tell you to upgrade

663224
richtextbox	picturebox
i have made a custom control which consists of a richtextbox and a picturebox

663224
richtextbox	picturebox
but now problem is if i right click on the picturebox i get the menu stripes but when i rightclick on the richtextbox i don t get contextmenustripes any reasons or suggestions

663252
contains	any
basically add the image as attachment and the src attributes contains just the image file name no any path is needed

663253
code-coverage	ncover
ncover both the commercial one and the open source one with the same name and the code-coverage tool in visual-studio are pretty much your main tools in the ms world

663258
driver	kernel
also it integrates with kernel mode http.sys driver in windows-server 2003 and should offer better performance

663262
code-coverage	ncover
some areas you just can t or is pointless to have test coverage thats where nocoverage attributes for ncover come in handy you can mark classes to be excluded by code-coverage

663282
any	set
write a triggers before delete on table1 to delete or set null any reference in table2

663290

i m using firefox 3.0.1 google-chrome 1.0.154.48 internet-explorer 7 and safari 3

663297
httplistener	http
unless there is a very good reason to avoid iis using iis will be easier as it is designed to support large scale client request loads with rich functionality whereas httplistener provides a simple programmatically controlled http protocol listener.

663305
mouseleave	mouseenter
try to call stoppropagation on your events or use an alternative event that stops propagation by default like mouseenter mouseleave or hover over out

663334
virtual-functions	base-class
a base-class can implement a generic algorithm and present it to the world while its subclasses can implement the details of the algorithm through virtual-functions

663336
text-editor	editor
in my opinion it s the wrong way of writing a completely new editor based on text-editor because you will then loose the cool features the standard javaeditor gives you for free such as organize imports refactor menu ...

663344
mouseover	mouseout
finally just for simplicity use hover rather than mouseover mouseout

663344
mouseover	mouseout
the first function you pass to hover gets applied on mouseover the second gets applied on mouseout

663354
contains	elements
assume that the call has already been broken down into a structure contains an ordered string arrays for the path elements a string for the methods property and an object arrays for the parameters

663366
methods	extend
it just doesn t feel right copyign code from one spot but i don t know of another way to extend the methods without changing code in the base class

663372
web-applications	webserver
when developping python web-applications you will often use frameworks that provide their own webserver

turbogears	cherrypy
some of the most popular frameworks for web python are plone zope cherrypy and turbogears only to name a few

663374
key-value	key
in java is there an object that acts like a map for storing and accessing key-value pairs but can return an order list of keys and an order list of values such that the key and value lists are in the same order

663386
oncreate	onstart
note that there won t be any flicker or anything either android handles the case of calling finish in oncreate i believe onstart and onresume as well so that the user never knows it happened

663388
key-value	key
is there an object that acts like a map for storing and accessing key-value pairs but can return an order list of keys and an order list of values such that the key and value lists are in the same order

663392

663489
click	mouse
i m having trouble within a block of code that i believe is related to a mouse click event but i cannot seem to capture the exact event within my code

663497
sorted	lookup
to get similarly quick lookup using an arrays you would need to keep the arrays sorted and then used a binary-search

663521
forwarding	port
i know that haproxy can not handle ssl requests so i am trying to set up apache to accept the clients requests on port 443 and forwarding it to haproxy which will then pick up and forwarding the requests to the right apache back end webserver

663526
implements	abstract
another java-ish way to do this is probably to have the parent class to define an abstract getter and have the children implements it

663529
superclass	subclass
declare a constructor in the superclass that s called by the subclass

663561
callback	methods
kick off the first methods to do something and show an alert and then hook into the alert s delegate methods and when you get the callback from the alertview run the other methods

663568
background-color	transparency
i can animate from transparency to color but when i tell jquery to animate the background-color transparency it just changes to white

663570
document	editing
it s not clear whether you mean actual ole embedded linked document with in-place editing or just automation calling into the programming models of office applications

663582
javascript	dom
but what you could do would be to use some javascript to inject the html for the button into the page s dom after the gridview is rendered

663602
json	xml
use a platform-neutral data format such as json xml protocol buffers thrift etc

663609
udp	tcp
tcp sockets or udp messages

663633
google-chrome	firefox
this worked fine on firefox and google-chrome but not ie

executable	jar
in windows java_home must point to the jdk installation folder so that java_home bin contains all executable and java_home libs contains all default jar libraries

663658
debian-based	linux
so what is the correct way of handling the java_home variable in a debian-based linux

663686
ruby	php
i guess java would be slightly beneficial as its similar to c# but php ruby etc are all acceptable

663692
versioning	upgrade
a simple way to do this is to have the java home exist as a softlink so that if you want to upgrade or switch versioning you only have to change the directory that this points to -

663698
.when	ready
i have to radically migrate one key model in my design to a completely new design but i want to cache all of the existing data for that model and migrate them to the new recording in production .when ready to deploy

663698
json	xml
1 dump all of the existing data into some format such as sql json xml

663700
host	root
i found a bug whereby hosting wcf services in the root spent a lot of time on the phone with msft support thus host them in an application

663700
netmsmqbinding	was
for example i have a netmsmqbinding service hosted in iis7 it is configure for was and it is hosted in the default site as

663712
linux	unix
a reason agains using the version without the .h is that you will get tempted to use includes which are camelcase or pascalnotation and if you move the code from windows to unix linux or mac you will usually get into problems

663713
joomla	drupal
set up a cms like joomla or drupal and let her explore on her own

663727
checkbox	listbox
the source listbox is a list of checkbox

663728
mediawiki	bugzilla
we are considering using a wiki mediawiki and also using bugzilla for issues and some documenting of code

663733
joomla	drupal
i can t say that i think joomla or drupal is a wise choice for a non-techie

663742
default-value	arguments
can you lose the default-value for the first constructor - it may be that since this is making it the default constructor for myclass then it is also the default if it can t match the arguments

663743
textbox	button
i have a page which has a control on it with 2 textbox username and password and an asp button

663743
button	popup
if the user s membership is going to expire within 30 days and the button is clicked i want the jquery-dialog to popup

663743
button	popup
what should happen is that when the user clicks the sign-in button it should popup up the dialog only if the days they have left to expire is 30 and if they do they have the option of clicking the link in the dialog and going to a renew page where i want to pass it a session variables with a profiling but that is not being called so i guess i would like to know is how can i add the event handler of the button to the dialog and is there a way to set it so that it only comes up once for example adding a cookie to the users browser and only showing it if they don t have a cookie set

663754
hide	show
however when i navigate to other views the toolbar stays up which is ok but how do i access it to hide show it

663758
json	xml
experiments we ve run with json xml and oldmodel - newmodel style dumps have scaled pretty poorly

663775
order	add
there s no way to control the preferred order of conversions but you could add a second constructor that took a const char

663791
json	xml
if i have the datatype as just json the content is still xml and jquery also will not call my callback function

663794
internet-explorer	firefox
for example you can see how your page looks in internet-explorer 6 internet-explorer 7 internet-explorer 8 firefox and safari even if you don t have those browsers installed

triggers	insert
i have a table with a lot of rows and i have changed the function associated with the triggers in insert or update events

663941
document-ready	.when
your pageload function is called .when the document is ready everything s loaded and you are good to muck around with the dom to your hearts content it s a bit like jquery s document-ready function but actually fires slightly later

663945
delegatecommand	mvvm
in a mvvm scenario a relaycommand delegatecommand in prism is probably the better choice all around

663947

rather than have a lot of global state you instead pass around what you need to the constructor of your various object

663971
stderr	stdout
i have set up pipe to redirect stderr and stdout

663971
stream	send
when i use printf does it send data to stdout or to stream 1

664104
order	add
in order to debugging you have to open the server view in eclipse add a new server and choose the correct tomcat version

664144
hide	show
you re just giving yourself more work if you were to keep references to forms and show hide them instead of opening closing them

664144
hide	show
also you ll find it hard to implement any sort of modal-dialog if you were to show hide

664151
bufferedoutputstream	dataoutputstream
to answer the question in your title i would wrap the socketoutputstream in a bufferedoutputstream in a dataoutputstream and use the latter s writeint methods repeatedly

664160
lgpl	gpl
be careful if your license to the code in question is not gpl but for example lgpl different rules apply. basically gpl boils down to this

664185

margins	padding
if you inspect the page with firebug and set padding and margins to 0 on the header then the bump disappears

664272
show	next
also a number of styles appear to be calculated next to the ul when it is show or hidden

664285
attributes	properties
the arraylist does not give this information but you can give it by using a xmlinclude attributes on the properties that returns the arraylist

664286
implements	abstract
the presentation tier is implements as pages and user-controls in the example i have given the logic tier commonly called bll or business logic layer is concrete c# classes defining specific behaviour and the data tier commonly called dal or data-access layer is abstract c# classes defining the storage mechanism with concrete c# classes for using sql-server as the storage medium

664304
having	select
having to select both chunks of text and invoking the macros twice seems too much like hard work to me

664312
bmp	png
if your texture isn t a bmp or png though you may have to use the texture2d.save command to convert it into a format you can use in the image class

664319
arrays	loops
generate an arrays of some thousend instances in a loops start them and look what happens

664332
shell	bash

664450
onclick	onload
b do a postback handle the server-side onclick then attach javascript for the page that runs in the body onload event

664466
dictionary	map
you might use a dictionary to map from the drop downs to your data

664469
implements	abstract
come up with a format that can represent the business logic in the abstract a micro language store strings of that in your tables and implements an interpreter for it in code

664471
delphi	c++
tjvpluginmanager requires that the plug-in dlls export a special self-registration function that the manager will call when it loads the dll and the function must return an instance of the tjvplugin class so the plug-in dll must be written in delphi or c++ builder

664471
pascal	delphi
maybe codegear didn t see much demand for it since delphi and turbo pascal had already gone for so long without it

664473
where-clause	sql
oracle will take your where-clause and merge it into the view sql and then come up with a plan for that

664480
union-all	union
it is also advantageous to use union-all instead of simply union

664485
boolean	int
gm_setvalue normally only stores 32-bit int strings and boolean but you can take advantage of the uneval methods and a later eval on retrieval to store any object

664490

664832
abstract-class	subclassing
i m leaning towards the bag as i think it may just be treating the collection as a bunch of the abstract-class instead of the subclassing userinrole

664835

665006
contains	elements
if you did this assuming that the inner elements is defined an a schema or dtd as contains a string and not xml then your xml-parsing will complain

665006

it would probably be simplest to hide all the rows then show a range of them every second with something like

665135
for-loop	arrays
in java it s very easy to detect the last element of an arrays from inside the for-loop by just checking the current arrays position with the arrays length

665135

i have once used izpack together with launch4j to make a windows exe that would install a jre with my application

665182
decrement	increment
the issue is that function arguments can be evaluated in any order so if your function arguments have any side-effects such as the increment and decrement operations you can t guarantee that they will operate in the order you expect

665191
show	next
the getpwd.vbs simply uses the password object to input the password from the user and then print it to standard output the next paragraph will explain why that doesn t show up in the terminal

665191
shell	bash
the effect of the command is to output the prompt with no trailing newline character - it s a sneaky way to emulate the echo -n command from the bash shell

665209
linux	unix
it runs java it runs websphere it runs db2 proper db2 not that little linux unix windows one it runs mq etc etc

665209
processor	cpu
the power of the mainframe lies not in it s cpu grunt the individual processor aren t that powerful but they come in books of 54 cpus with hot backups and you can run many books in a single system z box but in the fact that all the cpu does is process instructions

665210
value	field
in general it s going to prefer a single index with you providing value for the left most field from the point of view of getting the filtering done quickly

665225
logging	trace
i would like to get stack trace file name and line number information for logging exceptions etc

665246

665252
swing	awt
the swing graphical user interface library was created to address the problems with the awt

665252
swing	awt
almost all swing components are derived from a single parent called jcomponent which extends the awt container class

665252
swing	awt
thus swing is best described as a layer on top of awt rather than a replacement for it

665252
swing	awt
if you compare it with the awt component hierarchy you will notice that for each awt component there is a swing equivalent with prefix â œ j â

665252
swing	awt
many swing classes have no awt counterparts

665264
python	java
solution is to send request to your domain and fetch cross domain content via some server language java php python etc.

665375
tapestry	wicket
component-oriented jsf tapestry wicket etc

665382
registration	login
if you are worried about urls being nicely displayed to users then i would consider asp.net-mvc or load the same xap from both pages and pass in a parameter to the sl app to tell it whether is should show the login or registration form

665383
mousemove	mousedown
i had it working with it automatically changing on selection by binding mousemove after mousedown fired but it ended up being very slow so i decided it was best to focus on my goal of changing what was copy-paste

if you look at the source to the enumerator class system.core.dll where a lot of the default extension methods are defined for ienumerators classes you can see that they all check for null references with arguments

665519
stderr	stdout
try wrapping the execution of the binary with a suitable scripting that just reads stdout and stderr and send any data read from them on using syslog

665524

665548
elementtree	lxml
the second most commonly used hierarchy is xml messages for which i have elementtree usually via lxml

665562
conditional	operators
c# 6 has such an operators - the null conditional operators

665562

noting of course that providing a default this way works only if it s okay to use that default-value even when the final property value is available but set to null for some reason

665572
ref	out
it doesn t solve all problems because func and action can t have out or ref parameters but those are less commonly used

because of the nature of the beast and condemning lifecycle and req s from many of these types of project they need stronger project-management than some high risk short duration external project

665609
methods	extend
i have seen examples of how you can use the groovy ast transformations to extend the language to log before and after a methods call as shown here

665632
selected	button
in short i want to define what xml buttonsettings element to use for a xaml-button and to use the childs of the selected buttonsettings-element in a style applied to that button

665632
selected	button
for each button i want to selected which buttonsettings to use specifying it s id

665632
selected	button
selected and defining the content of a button works perfectly as long as i define it directly at the button and not in a style

665642
decrement	increment
at the beginning of each calculation either increment the counter or add a unique string to the arrays and at the end of each calculation decrement the counter or remove the unique string and call a function that either checks for counter 0 or arrays.length 0 at which point you hide your dialog

665645
value	field
dr version - is it better to use a text field to save arrayss as comma separated value or have each item in the arrays in a separate tablerow

665648
positioning	slider
you can easily calculate remaining time and divs positioning depending on the slider s positioning

665648
positioning	slider
if the user clicks again over the slider call the .stop methods on all divs that way they will stop animation and you ll be able to set them statically calculate the positioning the divs should be at and move them statically to that point

665673

in lisp-1 lisp like scheme and clojure they do

665673
common-lisp	lisp

665682
directory	folder
my scripting was writing to what i thought was the current working directory the directory i specified for the task as the start in folder

665682
directory	folder
in my case it looked like the scheduler re-assigned the working directory to be the directory specified in the temp environment variables for the user account used to run the job not the directory i specified for the task the start in folder

665693
contains	set
perform whatever type checking and casting you need to do and then if you can cast the control to textbox or some other control that contains the backcolor property cast it and set the backcolor

665712
revision	updates
you should be still able to do updates and revert the changes from that revision after that

665745
unsigned	zero
this fails because in unsigned arithmetic i is guaranteed to be always greater or equal than zero hence the loop condition will always be true

665752
contains	any
the size of the new library should be minimal i.e it should not contains any symbols in librgb.a which is not used by libcolor.a etc

665781
constructor	object
if copy constructor is called when an object value is returned shouldn t it create problems if object is declared locally in the function

665781
constructor	object
i mean the copy constructor is a deep copy one and takes reference of an object as parameter

665783
qplaintextedit	qtextedit
for a text-editor in general have a look at qplaintextedit and qtextedit

665789

665867
sftp	ftp
aptana can also connect to remote site via ftp sftp in the pro edition and to svn and cvs repositories

665893
debugging	exit
one symptom of such issues is that you don t get the memory-leak detection dumpon exit from debugging

665896
urlclassloader	classpath
this example assumes you re using a urlclassloader which allows you to retrieve the classpath but you could insert your own classpath if you wanted to

665903
sql-server	oracle
i need to create a new db in sql server and move some data from an oracle to this sql-server db

665903
sql-server	oracle
i read that this function can be implemented by using ssis or the sql-server migration assistant for oracle

665907
callback	methods
customvalidator gives you a callback methods

665916
constructor	object
according to an answer to my question the copy constructor may be called even twice once to copy a local object onto the return object and once to copy the return object onto the variables it was assigned to

665920
for-loop	loops
since this is not a standard for-loops i would probably use a while loops instead

665922
sql-server	oracle
have you looked at the sql-server migration assistant for oracle

665928
scala	java
i don t think you can have the same thing in java unless of course you use a dynamic language that runs in the jvm jruby scala groovy

665928
python	java
in fact there are many things you can do with a java ide that are simply impossible to do with a ruby or python ide

665928
spring	guice
a dependency injection framework like spring or guice can help

665938
komodo	emacs
i ve tried emacs because that s my favorite editor and komodo and they don t come close

665938
required	checked
personally i think that superior parsing and navigation abilties of idea are only required when you re working with crappy undocumented code otherwise i d happily write the code in emacs using js2-mode but i m working with huge poorly documented and buggy framework and it really helps to be able to jump to the source of the function or superclass to checked how they work

665949
profiling	trace
you can check for more detailed analysis of profiling trace

665973
output	mode
to my understanding binding errors are displayed only during debugging mode in visual-studio s output windows

665984
scriptaculous	jquery
jquery is very popular and well integrated in many frameworks while the only framework in which scriptaculous is integrated is ruby on rails

665996
domdocument	domxpath
use phps domdocument -class in combination with the domxpath -class to navigate to the elements you need like this

665997
twitter	tweets
since twitter added a limit for api calls app should may use some cache then it should periodically check if tweets was not deleted etc

666006
groovy	java
i am trying to build groovy from source on rh linux using ant but for some reason it thinks that my java version is 1.4 and not 1.6 and thus it won t compile

since roughly 1500 bytes can fit in an ethernet packets after tcp-ip overhead i d use chunks at least that large.

666042
any	set
if i can set up an http account the tasks will be delivered to her without any trouble on her part

666044
postgresql	mysql
bobince re foreign key support referential integrity transactions views subselects innodb may have them but they are not as standards-compliant or real world tested than postgresql s seeing as mysql devs claimed for years that those features were unneeded

666057
tree	trie
depending on how similar the entries within one file is it might be possible to create a trie not tree from it

666058
silverlight	wpf
two features of the new beta are 3d-graphics and the ability to run applications outside of the browser which to me seemed to be two of the major features that wpf windows presentation foundation previously offered over silverlight

666058
silverlight	wpf
i am currently evaluating wpf and silverlight for possible use in our companies future development activity and this announcement has left me confused as to the intended direction of these two ui technologies and why i would choose one over the other

666076
silverlight	wpf
everything i have seen heard indicates that porting between wpf and silverlight is quite easy

666081
silverlight	wpf
there are also some differences between silverlight code and wpf

666081
silverlight	wpf
but from what i ve heard the ultimate goal is to get a silverlight to run inside of wpf with minimal code changes

666084
silverlight	wpf
also the ability to use directx parts in wpf will still give another optimisation area which silverlight and it s 3d won t be able to use

666086
push	pull
if you must have the pull model as opposed to a push model why not put up an asp page with a send me the assignment button

666088

.net 3.5 .net 4.0 wpf silverlight asp.net-mvc - there s really a lot of new microsoft technology released on the horizon to try out these days

666090
entity-framework	ado.net
for example framework version classic asp.net vs asp.net-mvc ado.net entity-framework vs linq2sql or nhibernate

666092
profiling	trace
if you think the issues may be performance related and want to see what your hardware bottleneck is then you should gather some cpu disk and memory stats using perfmon and then co-relate them with your profiling trace to see if the slow response is related

666094
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is basically a stripped down version of wpf in order to make the runtime libary download as small as possible

666094
silverlight	wpf
as a result wpf simply has a lot more functionality available in it and tasks that are simple in wpf often become not so simple in silverlight

666112
silverlight	wpf
i have just worked on a wpf project that in hindsight we feel we might have chosen silverlight for

666117
contains	elements
a stackpanel on the other hand will up front create the controls for all elements contains within the stackpanel

i stumbled across something explaining how to use flex profiling in flex builder and it was a huge help to me in debugging memory leaks

666163
margins	padding
this has to do with the fact that ie6 what i looked at it with does not support the min-width tag which i noticed you ve used ie6 also counts margins and padding as width so to speak

666164
silverlight	wpf
i would recommend silverlight over wpf when

666195
value	field
if you need to change the type of a field add a new field that inherits the value from the current one first

666206
revision	svn
svn diff accepts revision numbers so you can generate a patch file that would include everything from a certain set onward

666211
value	field
alternatively you might have a sql injection issue where if the user puts something wrong in one of the field it loads a zero value for price

666212
selected	textbox
when the user selects a node s child in the tree i want to load the file from the path of the selected node s child and then show the text in a textbox

the methods have flags and callback so i can control how deep a copy should be

666238
display	width
can be display by the width of the

666250
contains	any
if the final price is 0 perhaps check the order again to see if it actually contains any items

666269

666372
conditional	operators
the conditional operators is the subject of controversy on this front

666372
conditional	operators
well if condition y and z are all fairly simple the conditional operators wins

666380
contains	set
the easiest way to get this done without o n 2 complexity is going to be using a data structure that efficiently implements set operations specifically a contains operation

666384
environment	execution
query execution depends on more factors it s possible to fully customize the engine environment to take advantages of various features like deffered execution future queries queries executed in a future moment multiple queries and last but not least session management involves in this area

666384
reflection	runtime
it s clear that frameworks like nhibernate most of the time use reflection at runtime but it s needed to mention the multiple reflection optimization are used see for example dynamic proxies .

666457
quirks-mode	doctype
quirks-mode has a very good overview of doctype and their comparison charts are first rate

666473
margins	padding
i have set the web page to have a style of height and width 100 and no padding or margins for the html and body tags

666508
contains	elements
as for the confusion about whether vector can be treated as a c arrays it definitely can by getting the address of the first elements ie. - if the vector contains elementss

666519
scriptmanager	updatepanel
i also read that if you are using an updatepanel you need to use scriptmanager but if i have a masterpage would i use scriptmanagerproxy

666521
silverlight	wpf
silverlight 3 looks great but for this application i would still have chosen wpf

666522

your probably going to need to spend some time in the debugger or using some form of trace tool like dottrace profiling there are a couple more out on visual-studio gallery like

666587
increment	reset
grab packetsfilled and increment your index variables before packetsfilled is reset to 0

666651

the idea is to go through each row and put the maximum value into the max_idval field for that row

666700
jquery	.post
see this .post recommendations for jquery tooltips

666705
silverlight	wpf
it s worth noting that silverlight s 3d is not the full 3d support of wpf but only projection of 2d into 3d - take the 2d plane and allow rotation in x y z directions

666721
command-prompt	command-line
you can see the full set of command-line arguments by entering the following at a command-prompt

666772
ruby-on-rails	django
obviously there are a million ways to build an application like this both in the java frameworks world and with things like ruby-on-rails or django

666782
value	field
but then your value field would have to contains both the keys and the value

666792
gethashcode	equals
i think what you really want to do is a mix of 1 and 3 you can override equals and gethashcode to use the string s that uniquely identify the object just make sure they are immutable

666810
double	int
at a quick guess perhaps you have a formatting problem with printf -- you re passing a double when it expects a short int or something like that

666812
sql-server	mysql
i am migrating our current site from php mysql to asp.net 3.5 sql-server

666829
display	width
you could also try editing your navigation list the ul not the li-s by putting a width or setting its display to inline

666844
gethashcode	equals
you could use option 3 if you can override gethashcode and equals appropriately something like this

666864
ethernet	packets
now tell me what the first packets to appear on the ethernet is

666864
ethernet	packets
i d like to know whether the packets i see arp dns vrrp are the same in each ethernet configuration is it dependent on the os

666937
hosts-file	hosts
if the hostname is not in dns cache nor in hosts first packets will go to dns

666941
mbunit	nunit
according to professional asp.net-mvc 1.0 page 8 if you are using vs 2008 standard edition or visual web developer 2008 express you will need to download and install the nunit mbunit or xunit extensions for asp.net-mvc in order for the create unit test project dialog to be shown.

666952

667020
value	field
the first link will swap the value of the text field

667030
postgresql	mysql
postgresql mysql oracle differences

667033
sql-server	mysql
if its zero then mysql is probably good enough for you if its 10k then sql-server is probably good enough for you

667038
vbscript	autoit
in windows environments you can easily use group policy to distribute most software and or patches and for the ones that you can t you can usually script these changes through any of the popular scripting languages such as jscript vbscript kixtart autoit powershell etc

667050
defined	declare
i m developing a class-library to be used for other developers and will be allowing them to either declare an instances of my class using withevents or similar in other languages as well as allow them to use delegation defined in the class

667101
onmousedown	mousedown
for example instead of providing delegates and events the base windows forms controls use a protected methods ie onmousedown and an event that s triggers by default mousedown

667105

667108
python	c++
i am more of c++ than python programmer so i can t give you a code sample

667117

assuming each nodes can have up to 10 children the code looks a bit like so

667118
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox the speed is fine and in google-chrome even faster

667124
.when	ready
i know that a prefered solution would be to not use pthread_cancel but instead set a flag in the thread and it would cancel itself .when it is ready in a clean way

667129
disposable	dispose
disposing an object that wraps another disposable object should call dispose on the interior object

667147
web-applications	security
as my knowledge on this field has expanded by testing on own applications reading zero day exploits and by reading the book the web application hacker s handbook discovering and exploiting security flaws i ve come to realize that a majority of online web-applications are really exposed to a lot of security holes

667147
web-applications	security
i wonder why there s not more focus on this these days and i would think there would be plenty of business opportunities in actually offering to test web-applications for security flaws

667150
ruby	php
i m thinking about the singleton pattern in php right now and have decided that although the singleton pattern can be coded in php it is not really implemented since the instance is not shared across requests or stored in the process memory which is the case for web server environments like asp.net java and ruby on rails

667159
mocking	tdd
in some cases i can see where ioc and di help with mocking but if you re not using mocking or tdd then what s the value

667161
consistency	rdbms
having said that it mostly a matter of performance and if performance isn t a huge concern in a project and stability consistency and reliability for example are then i don t see much point in delving into these technologies when rdbms is a much more mature and well developed scheme with support in all languages and platforms and a huge set of solutions to choose from

667169
onmouseover	mousemove
attach an onmouseover or mousemove i think both of these bubble can t remember event to the body and when you hover over your actual elements you can handle what you need to do as it will bubble up to the body where you can handle the element you actually moused over

667169
attributes	properties
you can use custom attributes or expando properties of that element to handle what ever you need to do in the mouseover for the specific element

667203
python	java
i would run a cursor with mysql sp programming language java python .net on this query

667203
cursor	row
for each row on the cursor you can open a different cursor with

667207
preserve	copying
here s a solution it s not neat since it has to be done for every instances of a tab but it makes the tabs take up less spaces and preserve the formatting for copying out of the browser obviously replace a single tab here with a real tab this blog software automatically removes tabs from entries it seems

667229
telnet	ssh
i m writing an ssh telnet client for the blackberry and for other hand-held devices

667229
telnet	ssh
for those ssh telnet users out there how would you like your rows columns set by default for a terminal client on a handheld device

667248
linked-list	heap
it basically comes down to heap managers having linked-lists that could be overrun and you can use the linked-list pointers to overwrite random parts of the process s memory

667248
pointers	stack
suppose i override these links to point to a pointers to code probably just in the buffer i overran and to the return address of the function on stack

667248
pointers	stack
when the heap manager tries to link the block back into a freed list it will actually overwrite the return address on stack with a pointers to code i control

667252
any	set
for added points you can return the result set to a xpathdocument pass it through an xsl transformation and send the results out in any format you choose html vs xml at the click of a button perhaps

667258
relational-database	schema
when in sql 2005 2008 schema refers to a namespace while in a relational-database discussion schema would refer to the logical structure of the tables views procs functions etc

the svn revision number and timestamp as well as the machine it was built on and by whom also burned into the build binaries

667286
google-chrome	firefox
i had already tested this site in the normal browsers ie7 firefox and google-chrome

667309
javadoc	doxygen
if you ve used javadoc and then come to doxygen you may know what i mean when i say i miss the hierarchical frame-based view that made jumping from class to class and methods to methods easy

667319
arrays	loops
do i have to loops though my arrays to see if any others have signaled

667330
instances	private
instances methods in struct can access struct s private fields but apart from that they behave a lot like auxilirary helper functions for immutable struct they sometimes don t even need to access private data

667333
calling-convention	dllimport
you need the marshalas - byvalarray as well as the new your mstrackdatas are already references so you do not need to pass them by ref and you must check what calling-convention iceapi represents if it is stdcall you don t need to change anything but if it is cdecl you will need to add the callingconvention to your dllimport attributes

667340
contains	elements
based on your description it sounds like your .rightcolumn elements either is or contains a table and you d like the cells in that table to have extra spacing

667342
click	mouse
by moving your mouse back to the surface of the div it picks up the div again and starts moving even if you ve released the click on your mouse

667372

667390
runas	cmd
try executing the runas cmd

667396
temporary	copy
note that if a function accepts a parameter by non-const reference for example f string s returning a copy of this reference parameter is safe because a temporary cannot be passed by non-const reference.

667402
integer	short
if you are really short on space use 2 bits instead of an integer with the following interpretations

667412
button	popup
when the login button is clicked i would like for a jquery-dialog to popup if the user s membership is about to expire within 30 days else it will just log them in as normal

667415
temporary	copy
when you pass a temporary object to a function you can only take it by const reference or as a copy

667417
strawberry-perl	activeperl
additionally distributions such as strawberry-perl and activeperl come with many bonus modules

667444
sequences	unique
a sequences number unique to the system generating it

667466
elementtree	lxml
this is pretty easily handled with lxml note this particular feature isn t in elementtree

667475
aggregate	grouping
if you re just checking of there is something in the second table that goes with the items in the first table you can use an outer join with a grouping by clause and an aggregate

667476
json-rpc	xml-rpc
somewhat related are django xml-rpc and json-rpc

667505
contains	set
i set the datacontext for the grid contains the uiklokke instance in code

667517
javascript	dom
have you tried using javascript to kill the dom element that your activex control lives in

667520
python	perl
its in perl not python but here is some code to illustrate

667523
value	field
have you labelled the detail s value field or the summary field with the same name as the data source

667524
sftp	scp
is this something to do with reconfiguring the sshd_config params on the linux box to allow more connections or do i have to make some adjustments on the windows client which is making the scp sftp calls to transfer files

667559
administration	account
the browser service is running and i have tried it with several different account including domain administration which is a bad practice but i tried anyway for troubleshooting purposes

667559

this is running on a hyper-v windows-server 2008 32-bit guest which is on a windows-server 2008 64bit host

667563
anchor	iframe
you might consider includind a copy of the referer header as the href of an anchor in the outer page holding the iframe

667571
selection	cell
the grid may also throw exception-handling if you use the arrow keys to move the current cell selection off the bottom end of the grid because the underlying datasource has more rows but the grid has not created grid rows to display them

667588
restart	exit
one of the third-party resources it uses occasionally gets corrupted and the only way i ve found to fix the situation is to exit and restart the program

667633
any	set
it should be set to wss_minimal if you haven t deployed any cas policies yet or wss_custom if you have already deployed something

667634
double	int
the most important is the memory cost on the instances especially if the instances are small for example if they are just meant to contain an int in this case having a virtual pointer in every instance might double the size of the instances

667635
driver	kernel
in order to cause a bsod a driver running in kernel mode needs to cause it

667646
base-class	inherited
and most classesare not designed to be inherited from - to create a good base-class requires more than making its functions virtual

667680
function-pointers	virtual-functions
the big cost of virtual-functions isn t really the lookup of a function-pointers in the vtable that s usually just a single cycle but that the indirect jump usually cannot be branch-predicted

667683
protected	public
if all functions are virtual everything can be replaced by base classes - public protected private - everything becomes fair game

667695
function-call	inline
further since the function to call is determined at runtime the compiler can typically not inline the function-call as it could anywhere else

667695
function-pointers	function-call
as such function-pointers may in some cases add up to be significantly slower than a regular function-call

667695
function-call	inline
and this means the compiler can inline the function-call

667718
output	mode
in asp.net 1.1 when you compile in batch mode set to true the output of the source files is compiled into single assemblies according to the directory the type of file etc

667718
output	mode
when batch mode is turned off the output is a single assembly for the entire project

667730
user-controls	tabcontrol
i ve created a user-controls to grouping together a number of controls that were being duplicated on individual pages of a tabcontrol

667761

ideally we would have a single label show hide if your response is not sufficient

667762
execute	prepare
you can prepare a query and execute it with different value

667787
oxygene	delphi
just paste or import your c# and you have oxygene aka delphi prism code

667805
required	checked
if so what you want is a custom require rule with a dependency checked that allows you to make the inputs required iff the user does not choose to opt out

667836
put	get
if you want to make sure that a templates is being re-loaded then put something error prone in it and see if you get the exception-handling screen something like nil.fail

667838
convention	standards
i too wish directx shipped w tlbs following the standards out return-value convention

667848

667850
put	get
if some could put up some heavily commented code ruby preferred but not essential to help me get there

667857
python	java
they are not english words they are keywords or concepts in c++ java c# python or any other programming language

667862
sql-server	mysql
i am not super familiar with mysql but the way i would approach what you are try to achieve in sql-server would be to remove the constraint definitions from the create table statements and then add the constraints at the end of the script along the lines of the below

667870
profiling	trace
i do not have direct access to the server to run sql profiling so i would need to create the trace templates file and submit it to my dba and have them run it over x time and get back to me with the results

667870
profiling	trace
edit maybe there are some recommended tools out there that can work on the trace file that profiling creates to give me the stats i want

667875
mouseover	mouseup
possible event values click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout keydown keypress keyup

667875
mouseleave	mouseenter
currently not supported blur focus mouseenter mouseleave change submit

667885
configuration	environment
oh and be sure to share any custom configuration in the environment files

667888
mechanize	hpricot
mechanize will use hpricot internally it s mechanize s default parser

667889
shell	tcsh
in a few cases you might be able to find a history file for the shell - bash but not tcsh and get the user s typing from that

667903
any	set
turns out that the original old tfs environment did not have any custom reports set up and encryption for the report server was unnecessary

667917
principles	srp
am i violating the single responsibility principles srp if i put data-access methods on the business object

667923
any	set
once you re certain that mysql will grouping your data properly the following query will set the duplicates flag so that the first fingerprint record has duplicates set to false 0 and any subsequent fingerprint records have duplicates set to true 1

667988
duplicates	contains
i m trying to find duplicates dcu and bpl files based on an aswer i received to another question here and it seems that the lib and lib debugging folders sometimes contains the same or similar .dcu files

667989
updating	updates
i suggest updating the record whenever the action you are taking is conceptually an updates

667997

this will only work if you don t required concurrency checked you re the only one updating the table

668010
python	php
see fetching attachments from gmail via either python or php

668023
value	field
since you re putting the value in a textarea later you will definitely be subject to for example cross site scripting attacks unless you verify and or sanitize your multiline_data field contents before you write it back out

668044
filesystems	fat
i ve seen that problem when i m writing to a filesystems which doesn t properly handle times -- i think smb shares or fat or something

668077
dialog	pop-up
have the timer pop-up a dialog indicating that the session is about to expire and let the user have the opportunity to renew it send back an ajax request to refresh the session timer

668129
nested-loops	loops
as you have nested-loopss you have to increase the counter in the loops instead of assigning the loops variable too it otherwise you will only get the number of items in the last file

668147
output	mode
i can either have it generate a parsing tree and generate say 3 different kinds of code from that or i can just have it generate code on the fly either using a mode variables with 3 values or just simultaneously write code to 3 different output files

668148
value	field
another thread might affect the value of the field in a race conditional

668156
g++	gcc
gcc supports so there is a good bet that g++ will as well

668157
convention	standards
is there any standards naming convention for vb.net

668173
quicksort	heapsort
if you re worried about performance you could use one of the sorting algorithms that works well with data that s almost already sorted not quicksort - merge or heapsort come to mind

668226
python	ruby
i will be using python ruby for it

668226
python	ruby
the documentation at ruby gtk2 seems way too unintuitive and so is the python one since it s the same only written for python could you shed some light

668249
contains	elements
if you need a single arrays represented by a single xml elements contains base-64 text the easiest way would probably be to use a binaryformatter to turn your data arrays of any number of dimensions list whatever into a byte arrays and then simply base-64 encode that and stick it in your xml file

668252
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsstring objects are immutable they can t be changed but there is a mutable subclass nsmutablestring that gives you several methods for replacing characters within a string

668270
decrement	increment
so every amount of time you have 255 increment red by 1 and decrement green by 1

668281
nsmutablearray	nsarray
either use an nsarray nsmutablearray or an nsdictionary nsmutabledictionary with keys for specific elements you are trying to store

668295
pascal	delphi
in c it will be a #pragma and in delphi pascal it s o- o+ around the code in question

668311
nsurlconnection	nsurlcache
for anyone interested in seeing an example of this the apple sample application nsurlcache implements a simple delegate around an nsurlconnection in nsurlcacheconnection.m

668322
directory-structure	filesystems
i want to use gnumake to run a rule-based makefile which builds a set of c files in a directory-structure on a windows filesystems

668325

call stack - is stack pointers

668328
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

668328
object-reference	instances
exception-handling details system.nullreferenceexception-handling object-reference not set to an instances of an object

668328
value	field
i watch it go through debugger and it seems to correctly step through the details section putting value into my field

668340
contains	set
what you described about log4j seems great for me once you have the errors logged into the db a simple web-app would let you take a look at them filtering and set up patterns to fire email such as errors from a specific app error level threshold message contains some regex etc

668356
value	field
at the moment my code successfully sets the value of fields properties arrays of an object using reflection given a path to the field property from the root object

668356
value	field
i m unable to use reflection to set a value of a field in a struct which is part of an arrays of struct because the struct is a value type within an arrays

668356
value	field
below is how i successfully set the value of normal properties field and props field in lists.

668364
cryptography	security
the rule of thumb when it comes to security and cryptography stuff

668380
directory	folder
does anyone know how to natively get the max allowed file size for a given drive folder directory

668433
filesystems	fat
how about using system.info.driveinfo.driveformat to retrieve the drive s filesystems ntfs fat ect.

668440
base-class	subclass
the subclass and the base-class both need to be able to track the state of disposal

668440
duplicates	contains
1 this smells to me since it contains duplicates boolean but seems to work fine

668440
base-class	subclass
ie the base-class could return the base-class s name not the concrete subclass

668445
stretch	styles
last set the horizontalcontentalignment property of your item to stretch either on the item or through the styles if you need to apply that to several nodes

668447
exception-handling	error-handling
i have my error-handling setup to track all exception-handling and write the information we need to a database and email out the developers who need to know about the error in order to fix it

668456
constructor	object
but when i try to create an object for the class it gives me an error because the constructor is not visible

668479
buildpath	libs
if so you can go to the project properties - java buildpath - libs - add external jars - search for your jars and add them

668482
base-class	subclass
if you implemented the processing in a base-class you could subclass it with 2 alternatives that would be nearly interchangable

668493
sigkill	sigsegv
if i recall correctly windows implements at least some subset of pthreads and so must have the signals interface things like sigkill sigsegv sigquit etc.

668494
licensing	gpl
this means we can t integrate decoding capabilities into a playback application without licensing the whole thing as gpl so we can t use either

668497
nsstring	nsdata
my best guess is that you re accidentally passing in the raw nsdata instead of an nsstring â but failing that the above code should either work correctly or show exactly where things are breaking down

668509
32-bit	64bit
this might work for both 32-bit and 64bit processors

668510
libavcodec	ffmpeg
i ve done some work with ffmpeg though it was limited to libavformat the codec part is called libavcodec

668515
subclassing	superclass
if you look at the second mapping document i posted it show the superclass and the subclassing

668539
windows-vista	windows
for windows 2008 server and windows-vista and windows 7 you can use the win32 api registerapplicationrestart

668548
contains	any
if you contains double-quote characters inside a double-quoted string in php or just about any other language you need to escape those literal double-quote characters

668553
innodb	myisam
this may not be such a hardship since fulltext only works on myisam tables and you don t typically want your canonical data in myisam tables you can keep the definitive copy of your data in properly normalised innodb tables with an additional myisam table contains only stripped and stemmed search-bait

668562
constructor	object
the c# specification or at least microsoft s implementation of it allows you to omit the when using the default constructor no parameters as long as you re using curly brackets the syntax for object initialisers

668562
constructor	object
note that the object initializer makes no difference to the constructor here - the new myclass bit still gets interpreted separately as a call to the default constructor

668564
perl	php
as for coords i can t help with php but i have a good perl solution for this

668571
integer	short
store tag names as a short string not an integer id

668572
g++	gcc
edit from your recent edits to your question you appear to be trying to link the sun compiler s f77 with the gcc g++

668576
ubuntu	linux
i m a kid on a linux pc ubuntu in case your wondering

668576
g++	gcc
so my question is using the gcc g++ compiler is objective-c garbage collected

668588
implements	extends
i believe you can extends the simplexml class and implements the arrayaccess in that

668604
build-system	qmake
it seems like it would be easier to simply use qmake as my build-system

668604
build-system	qmake
essentially is qmake or a meta-build in general a valid substitute for a normal build-system such that i don t need to tweak the resulting build-system generated by qmake

668606
constructor	object
i guess they retain the form for object initializers because some users like the clarity of for invoking the constructor but iirc c++ or the first versions allow invoking constructor without the parentheses

668611
windows-xp	windows
it builds and runs on os x 10.5 intel ubuntu 8.10 32-bit and windows-xp 32-bit and has been run on windows 2000 as well

668630
plugins	add-on
all sorts of available plugins and add-on will be listed to support all manner of programming projects

668632
font-size	width
the second thing i tried was to just scale the font-size in the grid but this failed because on shrinking the font-size the columns stay at the original width and do not shrink

668639
protected	public
if the error you get is saying that the onstructor is not visible then it s talking about visibility in java public provate protected and package

668658
boolean	int
the bitwise version is deterministic and as a bonus can do 32 times as much work in a 32-bit int than the boolean version

668660
assign	add
everything i ve seem so far with assign and addstrings is that they eventually end up in add with the sendmessage call

668675
python	ruby
i feel that the mvc pattern as a framework for dynamic data driving web applications does seems to require less verbosity and hence less code with dynamic languages like python and ruby which is a good thing

668677
streamreader	writer
or is it possible to manipulate the stream sent to a streamreader writer

668695
any	set
therefore the page could possibly be retrieved by the user before any values are set

668707
.net	wcf
you would be far better to expose the method via a wcf or .net remoting i d favour the earlier

668720
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome safari trying to use the input element s setselectionrange sets the cursor in the right position but the text is not shifted so that i see its end but instead the beginning

668727
hidden-markov-models	markov-chains
i m not very well versed in this type of mathematics but i have read somewhere that people sometimes use markov-chains or hidden-markov-models to do gesture recognition

668757
export	csv
if its a once off or rare thing and you can export to csv then the application express or sql loader facilities would work fine

668770
updating	updates
updates courtesy darryl s comments calls to phpinfo indicate that php is updating the max_execution_time and memory_limit variables correctly

668771
post-increment	pre-increment
as to why it s doing what it does you re really overriding the pre-increment operators and then using it as if it were the post-increment operators

668788
put	get
i usually get around this by taking the source of the library and adding it to my project but i am trying to put the gdata client library

668800
worksheet	excel
i create another worksheet within the same excel

668805
contains	elements
the actual xml document might not contains those elements but that xpath could still be considered potentially valid for the schema

668817
google-chrome	firefox
a lot of browsers ie firefox safari maybe google-chrome will handle it just fine

668843
linux	unix
keep in mind that on linux and other unix systems often an administrator installs the software but different people actually use it

668851
value	field
but in this particular case all the value for the field of the rss feed are already formatted as well-formed properly escaped xhtml.

668874
arrays	loops
the code that calls this function then loops through this arrays and does what it needs to do with each object

668898
primitive	boolean
you can read up on deriving boolean expressions from truth tables also see canonical form on how you can express any truth table as a combination of boolean primitive or functions

668913
sftp	ftp
if you can get away from ftp and use sftp instead then you can use public key authentication and store your public key found at .ssh id_rsa.pub on the server in .ssh authorized_keys

668916
telnet	ftp
i m not sure i understand your comment on using ftp to log in and monitor log files - surely you d be logging in with telnet and its brethren rather than using ftp for that purpose

668936
hide	show
the submit button btnexpand has then an event-handler on the control which hide show the panels pnlcontent

668952
python	java
and also solutions in languages other than java i think python ruby have an intersperse function - how is that implemented

668953
attributes	properties
you will need to guide the xmlserializer during the serialization process and you can do this by specifying the xmlnamespacedeclarations attributes to a properties that returns an object of type xmlserializernamespaces

668957
cruisecontrol.net	mbunit
i assume you are looking to run mbunit tests from cruisecontrol.net

668957
msbuild	nant
if you are already using nant or msbuild to compile your code then i would recommend that you just use the mbunit or gallio tasks from those same scripting

668960
put	get
i m thinking of getting each candidate to put together a short pitch based on our ideas so i know they get what we re trying to acheive

668976
build-process	msbuild
i use msbuild to build and part of the build-process runs wix to create an installer msi which is used to deploy to production

668990
expression-blend	silverlight
you can perform the steps suggested above but be ready to get vs crashes after you will install silverlight 2.0 tools for visual-studio or sometimes expression-blend

668993
constructor	object
now it happened several times that for some modification some code needed to talk to an object which was only available three constructor away

668993
constructor	object
adding another dependency was easy just add it to the factory and the object constructor or add a setter to avoid loops

669000
nsdata	nsurl

669059
sql-server	mysql
example mysql in case of multiple databases with few tables sql-server for single database with lots of tables because..

669070
postgresql	mysql
however i d then still prefer a solid acid compliant database so i d go for any real database before going for mysql if you want to use free db s postgresql is a good alternative to mysql

669081
getter	setter
to increase reliability i have introduced a data class named costcountingdata with readable getter and setter to all this properties

669083
player	movie
my problem was that the movie player object was not getting release and so i could not see the next video only hear the audio playing

669084
authentication	login
if your controller returns the login view instead of the requested page have you considered setting the response code to 401 not authentication instead of 200 ok

669084
authentication	login
you d then need to modify your ajax callback to inspect the status code of the ajax response and if it s a 401 not authentication you can respond accordingly - redirect to the login page show a pop-up login box or just an error message saying sorry you need to login again

669085
superclass	inherited
classes can inherited state and behaviour from superclass

669109
contains	set
a class contains a set of variables which tell you the state of a object from this class

669109
contains	set
a class contains a set of methods which tell you the behavior of the objects

669120
implementation	instantiation
the implementation will be compiled in one compilation unit where the explicit templates instantiation occurs

669120
defined	declare
with templates it is trickier as they are usually declare and defined in header-files

669137
compact-framework	.net
is there anyone who knows a way to resize images on the .net 2.0 compact-framework

669139
constructor	object
if i needed the data object and classes called data are themselves a smell i d set its values in its constructor

669156
lighttpd	apache
php use when you might switch vendors i had instances when the development was done in apache and the live system was running lighttpd

669161
rewrite	rule
ie. the rewrite rule will fail if the pattern evaluates to an existing file

669161
rewrite	rule
so when the pattern is the same as the substitution but minus the extension the rewrite rule will fail

669171
webserver	security
it may indeed be necessary to put the applet and the html page that contains it in a webserver in order for it to be able to connect to the database due to the security restriction that applets are only allowed to connect to the server they re loaded from

669175
authentication	login
the redirectresult i m looking for is some kind of indication that the user is being redirected to the login form but instead a viewresult is always returned and when debugging i can see that the index method is successfully hit even though the user is not authentication

669175
authentication	login
i know that the authentication attribute is working because when i spin up the page the login screen is indeed forced upon me - but how do i verify this in a test

669176
cursor	row
if you know the user s task is to enter records the table is empty you can pre-position the cursor in the blank row to save the user the trouble of finding and click the insert button

669193
export	report
you ll have to run the report and export it in some file format as pdf

669212

669265
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox 2 3 and google-chrome

669266
append	input
manage the buffer manually by retaining the last n characters of the input where n is the index of the end of the final match found and append the new incoming input to it

669271
abstract-class	base-class
as far as i can tell they are 99 the same - the only difference being that the templates methods pattern has an abstract-class as the base-class whereas the strategy class uses an interface that is implemented by each concrete strategy class

669278
servicecontract	datacontract
on the server side i ve recently seen an asmx service that was turned into a wcf service simply by placing servicecontract on the webservice class and operationcontract on the webmethods methods and by turning the non-primitive types it returned into datacontract and data-members

669308
selected	button
then there s a button for copy all selected messages

669316
any	set
how hard can it be when i found set of values i thought i was home safe but that was more of enums .grateful for any suggestion

669323
groovy	scala
i ve seen it mentioned in several places in contexts like erlang actor model groovy actors scala actor model etc

669342
data-access	ado.net
ado.net data service is the next generation of data-access layer within applications

669342
entity-framework	ado.net
perhaps you re confusing ado.net data services with ado.net entity-framework

669342
stored-procedures	ado.net
in my opinion ado.net data services is a quick way to create crud services which maybe have a few other operations defined on the entity but the operations are all stored-procedures

669349
display	width
if i don t specify width height on the user-controls it will be display as intended at runtime

669374
memcached	apc
i d go with option 6 only store userid and session specific stuff search criteria in his session and put the rest into apc xcache memcached if you re using multiple servers

669381
tcp-ip	udp
despite client protocol name of tcp-ip mssql uses udp for bitbanging

669382
tunnel	vpn
this is probably blocked either by the vpn tunnel or by a firewall on the server

669383
contains	set
i guess what i need to do is find my uiview s cgcontextref and set that as my current context but the documentation contains no info regarding cgcontextref

669385
forwarding	port
when connecting to vpn every message goes through vpn server and it could not be forwarding your messages to that port sql-server is working on

669465
windows-xp	windows
how to create and use ntfs mounted drives in windows-xp and in windows server 2003

669478
sftp	ftp
avoid ftp sftp whenever possible because of reliability and especially with sftp they are not universal implementations

669478
sftp	ftp
also most firewalls will allow port 80 but you can run into blocked ports for ftp sftp

669486
shell	bash
but it is not portable - posix doesn t specify what it does and only some shell support it beside bash i heard ksh supports it too

669500
driver	kernel
also maybe your driver is screwed and you should check you actually can access the memory from within the kernel

669512
jms	jta
this way you may find yourself rejecting technologies such as jsf jsp web-services jms ejb jta osgi mda

669512
scala	java
being used to super-cool java ides it doesnâ t make much sense to switch to scala unless thereâ s an ide support that is stable and reliable

669553
.net	wcf
rss syndication is now in fact built into the .net framework 3.5 as part of wcf

669559
sql-server	mysql

669565
switching	screens
honestly i would ditch the sprite rendering object and switching to screens spaces quads

669591
databound	formview
i thought about using the databinding or databound event of the formview but the eventargs parameter provided does not seem to give me access to the current values

669595
installation	uninstall
uninstall every asp.net-mvc installation in control panel and reinstall the final 1.0 release

669603
sql-server	mysql
if primarily .net then this would lean in sql-server s favor because there are far more examples etc. about how to use .net code with sql-server than .net code with mysql

669603
sql-server	mysql
for instance sql-server 2008 enterprise has change data capture audit objects ddl and logon triggers for assisting with etl and security that are features that mysql obviously doesn t have yet

669610
authentication	login
if at all possible you want to use windows authentication not a sql-server based login which is what you are doing when you use user pwd in this manner

669619
registration	login
for instance for almost every site i develop there must be user registration process and i don t want to reinvent the wheel and spend a week for login profiling forms

669625
arguments	default
because the test is by default eql and eql compares the character in the string with your item arguments

669627
stream	send
for example how about a native vnc server for the end-user which is just a small download and then they click run. and that native server is programmed to capture the screen and send it straight to your webserver which has a client like vnc2swf or other means of converting the vnc stream to a video or .fbs file

669629
redgate	ssms
i use redgate sql refactor within ssms but another tool that does reformating and is a replacement for ssms is apex s sql edit

669635
sql-server	firebird
if you need a file-based in-process mini-database there are a number of options available including sql-server ce microsoft proprietary firebird free-open-source sqlite free-open-source

669640
versioning	packaging
compiling dcus for delphi 5 6 7 2006 2007 and 2009 is possible if the delphi licenses are there but managing so many different code versioning requires a lot of work for automatic build and packaging systems .

669698

version-control	cvs
version-control software like cvs or svn which use delta coding for storing the changes made to files use variants of the string edit distance algorithms to calculate the deltas

669843
hide	show
i would probably modify the current form and add div tags that show or hide through javascript based on a click somewhere

669846
sql-server	mysql
that said if you just use your sql-server as a storage entity which unfortunately many developers do you are just as well off with mysql as ms sql

669857
selected	button
the values of textarea selected input and button fields are returned in the post

669857
key-value	key

scriptaculous	jquery
jquery is light weight especially in compare with scriptaculous

669927
rewrite	rule
ie. the rewrite rule will fail if the pattern evaluates to an existing file

669927
rewrite	rule
so when the pattern is the same as the substitution but minus the extension the rewrite rule will fail

669936
common-lisp	lisp
in fact it happens to map onto common-lisp constructs and free lisp libraries almost perfectly and is actually a fairly short program

we use cc.net msbuilding to building and then also to publishing to our dev and stage environment however we do not have the push live on cruisecontrol.net we run that msbuilding by hand

669965
latex	tex
i can t help with vim but for latex i recommend you check out xetex which is an extension of tex that is designed to support unicode input

one possible implementation of f would be similar to that given in the last example under the addition section any constant number of bit shifts left followed by a multiplication by a prime - you could even use successive primes on each iteration at no extra cost since they only need be generated once

670069
exception-handling	try-catch
try wrapping the print operation in a try-catch block and see if there are any exception-handling being thrown that are preventing the files from being printed

670078
oracle	mysql
as there is a future for informix oracle and mysql

670092
macros	vba
i am trying to write a vba macros in outlook that will allow me to display a custom ui for entering information on outlook appointments

670092
having	select
i have this working for existing appointments but i would like to be able to create new appointments by having the user click and drag to select a time range and then trigger the macros

670098
attributes	properties
also this won t affect kvc but your attributes properties declarations should be copy rather than retain since they re value classes that conform to the nscopying protocol and may have mutable subclasses

670124
data-structures	linked-list
most functional languages include an immutable linked-list type as one of their fundamental data-structures and these types are used all over the place

670139
ref	out
with c# it is obvious since you have to prefix types of arguments with ref out but references are potentially confusing in c++

670186
push	pull
publish your pu feature_name either ask people to pull or just push to a public server like github.

670190
myspace	twitter
it could be used to enable data access against hundreds of oauth-enabled data apis all over the web including those of google myspace twitter yahoo flickr etc

670192
contains	set
this gives every developer a standard api to call when they want to get or set single configuration values and allows a single developer to control the where of storage and the how of retrieval which may be a flat file xml file memory cache mysql database xml file stored in a mysql database xml file stored in a mysql database that contains a node which points to a file that contains the value etc.

670192
configuration	environment
the where and how of retrieval is going to depend on your application environment although by using a configuration object you can create some efficiencies up front storing already retrieved values in a property cache pre-fetching certain values on instantiation etc.

670193
queue	fifo
a real-world example would be a fifo queue

670205
httpserver	webserver
get a camera that has an httpserver allowing you to download images from it like any webserver

670238
default	reset
an alternative one i currently use because i personally don t use most of the xhtml tags include in eric s reset anyway would be tim wright s reseting browser default reset.css

670244
wordpress	mediawiki
thanks to stuff like semantic mediawiki and sioc turning up in both wordpress and drupal you basically have a pre-built architecture for doing this

670250
put	get
i have been trying to figure out how to get redirect_to to use a put request but to no success

670278
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your framework versioning to .net 3.5 sp1

670278
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you don t need to completely switch over to asp.net-mvc from webforms

670284
asp.net-mvc	webforms
when your deploying the site drop the webforms application first and then make a folder in that webforms application and put your asp.net-mvc application into that folder

670284
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you insit on having webforms and asp.net-mvc framework in the same project then don t drop your webforms into the view folder

670287
least-squares	regression
least-squares regression

670304
value	field
i m not intending any offense but the way you asked your question makes me think that you re not trying to figure out different formats to transfer the data to the receiving page as other posters discuss and figuring out how to parsing cookie value or iterate through your form field to create a query string would be really challenging

670313
json	xml
in the above the divs with class gridtags are added using jquery through xml or json and by binding events on this divs we can make phototagging similar in orkut

670331
base-class	inherited
let s say i have a collection of objects that all inherited from a base-class

670333
json	xml
i think i have the option of requesting json instead of xml if it makes thins simpler

670348
synology	nas
i use the software on my synology rackstation to recording streams on the nas

670406
function-calls	main
also stack spaces is very dynamic for most function-calls since with the exception-handling of a few functions those nearer main and thread-entry functions with long-lived event loops or so they tend to complete quickly

670421
www-mechanize	lwp
i do most everything either with lwp simple lwp user-agent mojo user-agent or www-mechanize

670421
json	xml
once you get the response there are plenty of modules on cpan to handle xml or json

670442
webserver	upload
it takes quite a long time to upload because the file must first be upload from client to webserver and then webserver to amazon s3 before a response is returned to the client

670450
postgresql	mysql
is there an application to reverse engineer an existing database in mysql and or postgresql

670456
sql-server	mysql
10g sql-server mysql access

670466
callback	methods
callback is a methods that needs to be provided as an input parameter to begingetaccount

670466
callback	methods
in the answer it doesn t specify the callback methods so there is no way to know if it makes use of a new thread or not and therefore it does make sense to put the callback methods on a seperate thread in complete

670466
callback	methods
if you could guarantee callback created its own thread then you wouldn t need to create one in the complete methods

670472
postgresql	mysql
for both mysql and postgresql try toad data modeler

670472
postgresql	mysql
if you use the open-source diagram app dia there are several tools to generate dia diagrams from sql databases including mysql and postgresql

670474
selected	checkbox
browsers generally try to remember the contents of text fields the states of checkbox and the selected items in dropdowns over events like page reload and back forwards

670474
value	field
for this reason you should not assume during scripting initialisation that the value of your form field will match the content you served up in the html

670475
shell	bash
if you use bash and have the extglob shell option set which is usually the case

670477
jeditorpane	jtextpane
note jtextpane inherited its settext methods from jeditorpane and its setcaretposition methods from jtextcomponent which explains the links in the previous paragraph not going to the jtextpane javadoc page

670485
sql-server	oracle
generally oracle pl sql is far more powerful than sql-server scripts

670508
buffering	streaming
each function parameter is a non-const reference if the corresponding templates argument is a streaming or streaming buffering type and a const reference otherwise

670508
iostream	boost
i ve not worked with boost iostream so i can t help with that

670510
progress-bar	progress
get a callback on progress so i can show a progress-bar on the gui thread

670524
32-bit	x86
b. i m assuming they put 32-bit applications into an x86 folder because it s not a 32 bit os that is old stuff goes here

670528
installation	upgrade
installation directory or upgrade

670537
contains	any
works with any filenames including with those that contains embedded newlines

670544
json	xml
i would recommend just parsing the xml directly instead of converting to json for parsing

670547
lookup	any
for searchability across multiple keys store the data in any convenient form and provides fast lookup indexes on the key s

670547
linked-list	arrays
this could be as simple as keeping the data in an arrays or linked-list or ... in the order of creation and keeping a bunch of hashtables|sorted arrayss|btrees of maps for all the interesting keys ssn name ...

670547
sorted	lookup
and maintain skey sorted on the key so that i can do fast lookup

670548
forms-authentication	credentials
i noticed that a forms-authentication element has an option child element called credentials

670556
thread-sleep	synchronized
if thread-sleep is not what you want then you should use the synchronized block as mentioned by the other posters

670575
oracle	mysql
i easily swapped to oracle from the initial implementation in mysql so that proves that hibernate handles abstraction nicely

670584
hide	show
although if you are doing the hide show with client side scripting they will not be persisted through the viewstate anyways

670585
memory-management	memory-leaks
the code performs manual memory-management in a few places and therefore there is the possibility that it could introduce memory-leaks into your code

670590
ref	out
as kenny pointed out c# addressed this from the opposite end requiring specific passing by reference but that s not an option for c++ unless for example you wrote your functions to take a reference wrapper as their parameter like boost ref param eg

670654
python	ruby
to avoid writing lots of converters simple transformations you can use the dynamic language runtime and write expressions in your favourite dlr scripting language such as python ruby etc

670663
wmv	asf
i have tried to play wmv asf file in html page but always windows-media-player is embedded in browser but flash media player is not embedded

670663
wmv	asf
i suspect it is because flash media player does not support wmv asf format so even if i explicitly assign application x-shockwave-flash value flash media player is not display

670663
wmv	asf
does flash media player support wmv asf file

670668
32-bit	64bit
64bit platforms usually have a maximum value of about 9e18 except on windows prior to php 7 where it was always 32-bit

670675
traveling-salesman	knapsack-problem
this reminds me of the knapsack-problem more than the traveling-salesman

670681
midl	idl
microsoft does use idl i think they have a midl compiler for com stuff

670695
any	set
add and set any .aspx markup pages to embedded resources in the properties panels

670697
triggers	insert
instead of calling the executable directly from mysql i would use triggers to simply record the fact that a row got insert or updated record that information in the database either with new columns in your existing tables or with a brand new table called say database_changes

670697
triggers	insert
if your external program needs to know which row was insert then your solution could be like this make a new table called database_changes with fields date table_name and row_id and for all the other tables make a triggers like this

670706
wireless-connection	lan
i only have one wired lan point so my laptop needed a wireless-connection for internet access to download my install

670713
localization	translation
so to answer your question generate the meta tags .resx files using visual-studio and do the translation using some localization tool

670716
wmv	asf
it s not so much that flash doesn t support wmv asf

670716
wmv	asf
it s more the fact that wmv asf is not a flash movie so you can t pretend that it s one by putting it in the src attributes when you re using the application x-shockwave-flash type

670716
player	movie
try putting a media player flash movie instead

670721
wmv	flv
flash doesn t accept wmv but uses flv mpeg-4

670727
visualworks	squeak
i m a smalltalk newbie and i m using cincom s visualworks at the moment but i d like to give squeak a try

670733
boolean	int
this is i believe the main reason that boolean are implemented using int instead of chars

670738
put	get
there is a lot of discussion on this topic related to silverlight but as i understand it voice and camera inputs from the client side are not supported as of silverlight 2 though it may get put into silverlight 3

670744
parentheses	operators
the parentheses around are necessary because the operators has lower precedence than the function call operators

670770
lighttpd	apache
also running services like web servers apache lighttpd or mail servers exim sendmail ... could end up in different needs

670780
internet-explorer	firefox
check if the file correctly loads using firefox firebug network tab or fiddlertool if you re using internet-explorer

670782
command-line	cmd
this might be something simple i just haven t picked up but what is the function where you can send cmd directly to the command-line eg command ls

670784
stderr	stdout
is it possible to redirect stdout and stderr to both the terminal output and to a program

670802
stderr	stdout
is it possible to redirect stdout and stderr to both the terminal output and to a program

670802
stderr	stdout
i m not sure how useful it is to combine stdout and stderr on the input to an editor but does omething like this do what you need

670818
document	element
if you can control the xml document structure if they are not used by other applications why not define a root element named food and specify the possible attributes foodtype having value such as desert and indian

670832
document	element
the difference is that you then have a unique id for a specific element within the document which is handy when scripting or in fact even for css when you need to style specifically only one element

670838
change-password	authentication
this example will verify the presence of the authentication attribute on the change-password post method in the new asp.net-mvc 2 project demo that s installed with mvc2

670842
profiling	trace
use sql-server profiling with the sqlprofiling tsql_replay templates to trace open connections

670860
display	width
every div would have the same class to display a common style width

670897
pthreads	fork
under linux or pthreads type os using fork will cause the forked child to have copies of all the parent s file descriptors

670919
any	set
still working my way around this but is there any function command i can use to set some simple variables

670922
contains	set
sexcludecategories will contains a set of integers separated by comma

670928
sql-server	oracle
i don t know oracle but in sql-server it is fairly common to obtain a split udf like so - just one of many many versions available that turns the csv into a column of values and join etc to it

670937
document	element
but my personal approach to markup is that when you re creating a web app that involves some app user-interface element like a toolbar you shouldn t necessarily have to buser-interfaceld everything according to html web standards since they weren t created for marking up applications but for document

670943
stderr	stdout
i suspect you would want to send the stdout stderr to a file and edit it there in which case you need

670943
stderr	stdout
the redirects stderr file handle 2 to go to the same place as stdout file handle 1 so that both of them end up in a single stream

670974
data-members	private
using get set methods for private protected data-members is a bad design

670975
boost	stl
more common usage would be binding std pair first and second when using in stl algorithms and boost on a map

670980
cross-join	inner-join
the effect of issuing an inner-join is the same as stating a cross-join with the join conditional in the where-clause

670986
swing	awt
my language of preference for gui graphics programming is java so i tried making a prototype with awt because it s synchronous unlike swing

670988
scala	java
scala is also very stable and it s extremely easy to call java code from your scala code

670988
scala	java
for some examples you should refer to 5 things a java developer needs to know about scala

670988
scala	java
scala is of course statically typed and has a performance that is similar to java

670988
wicket	lift
wicket s designer-friendly templating style see lift view

670993
getter	setter
the whole reason to have accessors getter and modifiers setter is to provide yourself with an extra level of indirection

670993
getter	setter
the extra level of indirection for getter setter also allow you to be able to change the data-members that they encapsulate

670993
getter	setter
this is not the reason to use them but a nice side effect of using getter and setter is that you can set a breakpoints inside your modifier for example to see exactly when it is changed

670993
getter	setter
you could even provide getter setter for an object for the whole struct at once

671023
cross-join	inner-join
if a where-clause is added to a cross-join it behaves as an inner-join as the where imposes a limiting factors

671038
order	join
the order in which you join tables or you put your on where conditions should not matter

671045
h.323	rtp
voip protocols are good for streaming applications rtp and h.323

671062
g++	gcc
once i realised i was using sun rather than gcc i switched to compiling with cc gcc cc g++ and f95 f77

671070
administration	account
if you go into control panels administration tools services and go to the sql-server service you ll see the account that the service is running under

671078
push	pull
you would need to run a sql-server database on the webserver and then push the data from access to sql-server or pull it from sql-server

671103
silverlight	wpf
silverlight and silverlight on the desktop are more like winforms wpf applications that just happen to run on the web

671107
children	nodes
then i want to append children to this nodes

671119
google-chrome	firefox
also two browsers google-chrome ie firefox etc might work well too

671123
exception-handling	try-catch
wrap the exception-handling in try-catch and ignore it - not good practice

671129
put	get
i would rather not put it in the application_start methods since it does not always get called when debugging

671132
put	get
notice that we are using different http verbs get put post delete etc. to manipulate these resources and that the only knowledge we presume on the clients part is our media definition

671135
debugging	trace
they went crazy with the interfaces each new object to the model needed 16 interfaces abused the aop so transactions and logging were almost impossible to follow and stack trace were meaningless used tools to map the hibernate files without fully understanding what was being done in some cases joining 4 tables for what could ve been a simple entity and a variety of issues that made the resulting application much harder to enhance debugging fix even setup the developer s environment....

671136
nstextview	nsbutton
maybe my best alternative is to have an nsbutton followed by an nstextview with the mousedown delegate function on it triggers the nsbutton state

671141
administration	account
this windows account has to be a member of the local administration grouping for the operating system on every server that makes up the cluster

671141
administration	sysadmin
and prior to sql-server 2008 the administration grouping was automatically added to sql-server and granted sysadmin level rights meaning when you install sql-server you didn t have to worry about it

671142
directory	folder
immediately i observed that a random directory was generated inside that folder

671144
directory	folder
your binary files will be on project folder build there you will have one directory for each of the possible options release debugging and iphoneos iphonesimulator

671159
put	get
rest is using the various http methods mainly get put delete to manipulate data

671186
data-access	ado.net
ado.net is the underlying data-access api for .net much like jdbc in java

671186
data-access	ado.net
linq to sql is a data-access framework built on ado.net and new language features that makes sql-server data available natively in the object oriented style of programming

671188
960.gs	fluid
emastic is only 4kb fixed and fluid columns and em based malo is very very small 8 lines of code and the golden grid is 1kb is similar to blueprint or 960.gs

671223
mouseleave	mouseenter
to do so i handle the mouseenter and mouseleave events of the user-controls hiding and display the picturebox

671247
contains	any
note that these shell variables must not contains any pipe | symbols since the suggestion uses them as delimiters

671260
directory	folder
so my question is what are some tips or best practice methods in creating folder for these static files or if i shouldn t go the virtual directory route at all

671284
put	get
the best way to learn about this and also get put and delete is to use a rest client to make your http requests and see the responses

671310
ip-address	hostname
the applet runs in the client browser so it needs to connect to the server url using the ip-address or hostname which is visible from the client

671320
data-access	ado.net
ado.net is a set of class libraries that provide basic data-access infrastructure on top of .net basic class libraries

671320
data-access	ado.net
ado.net can be assumed as a data-access framework but this can be misleading since ado.net is not a standalone product

671322
nsstring	nsobject
when adding items to nsmutabledictionary using the setvalue forkey methods i suppose this generalizes to any nsobject does the dictionary retain the second parameter the nsstring

671325
python	ruby
both ruby and python are great languages if you can make a small shift in your thought process to grasp the basics

671329
value	field
it will surely be of extreme value to get a job in the software field

671357
linux	osx
on windows linux this is ok but on osx all logging seems to be passed to syslogd which then decides what to log and not log this means handling thousands and thousands of finest log messages this makes syslogd use 140 cpu and gobble up memory

671358
selected	button
in 3.1 there is a selected required button in the updates windows which is supposed to locate and selected for you all the dependencies

671371
value	field
the tells me that in the database this field has a null value

671372
beautifulsoup	lxml
another alternative to beautifulsoup is lxml

671378
put	get
now to get the files from section1 to extend section1 base.html you just have to put at the top of them

671393
sniffing	packets
i ve tried fiddler and packets sniffing and it looks like server doesn t send anything back

671396
logging	daemon
once you figure out which facility it is logging to you should be able to turn it off by editing etc syslog.conf and sending the syslog daemon a hup signal

671398
python	c++
preferred languages would be python php c c++ haskell or erlang whichever might get the job done

671410
any	set
what you need for this is xpath which is a query language for dom tree it lets you retrieve any set of nodes satisfying the conditions you specify html attributes are nodes in the dom

671443
command-prompt	cmd
run the following at a command-prompt cmd as opposed to the run open

671448
javadoc	doxygen
automatic doc generation a la javadoc doxygen etc has its place but that place is not usually for communicating with support -- it s developer to developer communication usually

671451
restart	reload
after the configuration changes all you need to do is make sure you restart your service so it can reload it s new settings

671464
persistence	hibernate
there is no limitation to fall back to hibernate features when using jpa but by using hibernate instead of jpa you are locked in into single persistence provider with no cheap way out

671464
compatibility	legacy
main obstacles to java ee productivity are in its enterprise focus offers a lot more than than needed for majority of projects and in its legacy backward compatibility

671481
syntax-highlighting	textmate
if you re on windows give e text editor a shot b c it s a textmate windows port and has bundles designed for css and markup that give you much better syntax-highlighting and autocomplete

671508
put	get
resources being manipulated using a common set of verbs http methods are the commonly seen case - the venerable create retrieve update delete becomes post get put and delete

671533
shallow-copy	deep-copy
when i was taught java i was first show arrays and the pointers as the last part of arrays to demonstrate the difference between a deep-copy and a shallow-copy

671552

a i realize display gridview field are of type string but does gridview also know of what type the underlying data source value are for particular gridview column

671552
sqldatasource	gridview
which control will perform the conversion gridview or objectdatasource sqldatasource control

671581
any	set
by using a less restrictive contract set you gain more freedom in what you can use you may load the set in any order for example and no one using your class should care if this ordering is not consistent

671581
duplicates	contains
i have here glossed over the fact that the set further ensures than it cannot contains duplicates which is a constrain on implementers

671582
document	element
where selector is what element in the document you want to look for

671599
textpad	jedit
for non-unicode editing on windows i m a textpad user--my staff and i have probably spent about 200 000 hours in textpad with only occasional forays into notepad2 madedit jedit xml copy editor and epcedit

671603
value	field
the key name is used to describe the name of the field that each value conveys similar to original proposal

671612
aes	rsa
the code basically uses aes for encryption of binary data and then rsa encrypts the key and the iv using an x509certificate

671615
emacs	vim
the lisp community in particular has tried to reproduce emacs slime an interactive lisp prompt in vim

671619
updating	updates
do you need to share updating data between the instances where the updates are frequent and ipc would be too expensive

671630
archive	backup
i found an .egg file in the backup archive of old system of mine

671640
filtering	sorting
collectionview encapsulates sorting and filtering

671673
silverlight	wpf
but you can probably put a wpf web browser on your windows and navigate to the silverlight app inside it

671686
restart	reload
first of all you say reload but assuming you mean reload or restart

671689
windows-xp	windows
turns out it was the .ncb file included with the project - it was copied from a windows-xp setup and after deleting that .ncb file the project built fine under windows 7 - no problems since

671690
value	field
having a value being nullable means there are two or three states three states with bit field

671690
value	field
if i had a bit field which was called isapproved and the value is set at a later stage than insertion

671694
default	reset
parameters are reset to default or null value

671699
reflection	runtime
you could use reflection which is a java runtime metadata analysis tool

671707
margins	padding
you can then inspect the individual elements and check if there are hidden padding or margins being applied

671710
implements	extends
if you design and implements the protocols with these principles in mind it will make your life a lot easier when you have to support and extends

671717
attributes	properties
the onchange attributes is a dom properties

671730
arrays	loops
once you read the input file sort based on the keys of the associative arrays loops through and spit out the results

671738
interpreter	runtime
this could be interpreter into a ut framework where you have a runtime system triggers a given test on a certain condition

671740
web-applications	security
using for cross-domain communication requires guarding against several types of security vulnerability that can be used to exploit web-applications

671756
administration	credentials
i m assuming that you do not want the user to be required to know administration credentials

671762
any	set
we need to copy the personalkey from any record in a dup set that has it to any record that doesn t have it for all non-fin records

671779
data-structures	priority-queue
immutable data-structures become efficient when the new version can share data with the old version in clever ways and i can t really see how this can be done without access to the internals of priority-queue

671782
constructor	object
instead of the syntactic sugar of .net 3.5 you can also use constructor arguments to create a person object

671789
sql-server	oracle
what is known as a clustered index in sql-server world is in oracle world called an index organized table

671815
32-bit	64bit

rollback	commit
commit or rollback

671838
perforce	cvs
xcode has built-in support for svn cvs and perforce

671843

671844
.net	wcf
you will need .net 3.5 sp1 to do wcf rest services

671851
firefox	opera
i actually know how the browsers tend to render the following examples results based on opera 9.5 and firefox 3.0 but i don t understand the reason behind them

671852
udp	tcp
sql doesn t listen on tcp 1434 it listens on udp 1434

671869
constructor	object
2 problem is that it would have to take a generic list of object into the constructor

671881
double	int
int double and so on

671883
credentials	security
this solution requires you to store the credentials used in logonuser in your application somehow so there might be security risks

671887
player	movie
if i understand your question properly you are not asking how to load an .mp4 into the player you re asking how to put a link into the html that gets rendering in the web view such that when that link is click your code to create the movie player gets run

671895
vb.net	vb6
some years ago i used to program in vb6 i really liked it because it was very simply and fast when vb.net came out i abandoned it because they changed a lot of things

671895
vb.net	vb6
well i must admit that i didn t try vb.net too much i was a little disappointed because i would had to learn a lot of new things and i ve had learned vb6 not so long before in that moment

671898
contains	any
a solution would be to make both mybusinesslayer and mywrapperproject depend on a third project myabstractdefinitions which contains idatabaseobject.cs and any other interface types derived from idatabaseobject

671899
perl	c++
fwiw i do java c++ c vb4 6 asp jsp perl php css dhtml javascript pascal fortran kenemy and kurtz basic bal unix shell scripting oracle mysql rpg iii cobol some proprietary stuff various macros various distributed technology job control language cpl etc

671901
vb.net	vb6
vb.net is the natural progression of vb6 and has a lot of free tools and resources online to get started

671904
contains	elements
this doesn t matter if the node only ever containss at most one text node but can be useful if the tree can get denormalised or contains entityreferences or nested elements

671910
zend-framework	drupal
actually i run a nginx with a drupal site that work like zend-framework one index.php as bootstrap

671910
zend-framework	drupal
this is the rule not tested on zend-framework just on drupal but should be similar

671925
defined	declare
i tend to use the words defined declare and assign interchangeably but this seems to cause offense to some people

671931
defined	declare
defined and declare are similar but assign is very different

671932
defined	declare
a function may be defined only once when you say what it does but it may also be declare before that when you say what arguments it takes and what type it returns

671938
selected	textbox
the first thing i d check would be to see if more than one page is calling selected on the same textbox

671938
selected	textbox
that would mean that one of them is trying to selected a textbox that s on some other page not the page being shown

671938
selected	textbox
does it selected its textbox correctly

671943
python	ruby
python or ruby

671943
python	ruby
i would recommend python or ruby bindings of a high level toolkit as a perfect environment

671948
serialization	marshalling
the serialization or marshalling of data built into rpc handles binary conversions such as machine byte order differences

671948
16-bit	8bit
another approach is to use 8bit encoding and translate all the 16-bit characters to markup as in non-breaking-space

671952
delphi	vb6
my first language was pascal and i think it s also one of the easiest languages and with delphi getting popular again i think it s a very good alternative to vb6

671965
double-quotes	spaces
i need to be able to add tabs and spaces characters as you can see from the code above i ve just done this by physically adding tabs and spacess in between double-quotes but i m sure this will cause problems down the line

671969
document	element
you already know about the semantic meaning of id an class so i just talk about one case - excluding javascript - when to use an id makes difference you can refer to elements with an id to navigate inside the page with anchor or from external links you can link a specific element of an html document with if you want to go directly to the element with id news

671969
document	element
so for this and other reasons is important to have an attributes that identifies an element inside a document

671977
contains	elements
without a dtd that allows a one elements to contains an empty two elements you will have to parsing and fiddle the text of your xml to get a document out of it

671980
contains	elements
now each of these elements will contains several instances of a certain type of object

671991
ruby	php
the four i ve narrowed it down to have been c# python ruby and php

672001
webforms	asp.net
other than that i don t think there is a compelling reason not to particularly with asp.net mvc which lets you move away from the webforms model

672003
hide	show
first in your viewwillappear subscribe to the keyboard notifications so you know when the keyboard will show and hide and the system will tell you the size of the keyboard but dont forget to unregister in your viewwilldisappear

672005
treeview	listview
i want to drag data from a listview and drop it in a treeview the draging works fine

672005
itemtemplate	treeview
i use databinding and itemtemplate to fill the treeview

672005
treeview	listview
a participant is dragged from the listview to the treeview

672006
access-vba	basic
you don t have to use access-vba visual basic for applications is built right into excel

672015
configuration	environment
you can put a line like this in configuration environment.rb or one of the specific environment files

672024
python	ruby
i have not used c# enough to debate it s technical merits with respect to ruby or python

672025
webforms	asp.net
if you go with c# for web development depending on your experience with web technology i d heartily recommend starting with asp.net mvc before asp.net webforms

672025
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms is the original style of building asp.net applications and tries to abstract a lot of the details

672033
web-config	app-config
in your console app those db connection settings need to go into app-config however you clearly don t want to have them stored in both app-config and web-config so you can use the following technique

672051
numeric	digits
this doesn t mean that a numeric string has to start with a digits 0-9 - for example -1 is a numeric string because the minus sign is part of a number in that case

672051
contains	any
this ensures that what you are comparing is a string that contains the digit zero only and prevents any type-conversion

672052
python	ruby
python is a great language but to me ruby is all that python is and a bit more

672070
contains	any
float if it contains any of the

672076
centering	fixed
for a three-column left right fixed centering liquid layout try

672084
centering	fixed
its a three colum fixed left right liquid centering layout

672087
datagrid	listbox
if you are not binding to a datagrid icollectionview will not give you much because it is not used by the basic controls such as listbox as far as i can tell since it is defined in the data controls assembly and not in the core

672090
linux	bsd
your goal to identify the differing parameters for the different bsd vs gnu linux versions of the various programs is going to be somewhat tedious

672094
arrays	map
another option however is to explicitly map the enum values to its base type and use the base type to index into your arrays

672113
sql-server	mysql
i ve managed with some tweaking to get the same dal code working with access for cd delivery sql-server for corporate and mysql for the laugh of it

672138
installation	environment
installshield - commercial development environment for installation packaging

672138
installation	environment
wise - commercial development environment for installation packaging

672138
installation	environment
install aware - commercial development environment for installation

672138
installation	environment
they are mostly concerned with packing installation and providing a framework for developers to access the run time environment

672138
web-deployment	web
with the growing requirement for web-deployment and automatic software updates i expected to find more of a consensus among developers on a framework for web delivery of software and subsequent updates i haven t really found that consensus

672149
put	get
i always get a classnotfoundexception for the domain classes regardless in which package i put them in

672159
ruby-on-rails	django
you re a java developer who s been asked to develop an app in c# or you re a asp.net developer asked to do something in asp.net mvc or a php developer with the opportunity to do a ruby-on-rails or django site

672165
installation	building
ie part of your business is to provide a smooth and user-friendly deployment installation and you feel that none of the available deployment libraries can let you achieve this then certainly go ahead and building your own

672165
installation	building
ie the end user will not typically be expecting or needing a smooth installation procedure or will never need to do that themselves ie they pass that step onto their it department then the need to building your own just for your own specific requirements is likely to be outweighed by the extra effort that would involve

672174
python	java
yes it s not exactly like jumping from java to .net or from php to python since i already knew javascript

672177
put	get
you put values you want into tempdata immediately redirect and get them out

672207
arrays	loops
if physentityphysicalleftentityids is an arrays you ll need to initialize an index variable and increment it each time through the foreach loops

672207
arrays	loops
to make sure there s enough space in the arrays you can allocate it before the loops above

672210
thickbox	jquery
i m building a online shop and i m using jquery plugin thickbox

672230
tuples	any
sequences is any number of sequences which are usually lists or tuples

672252
export	csv
i am export data from a database using php to convert it into a csv

672257
swing	awt
this also explains why awt was pretty limited compared to swing

672257
swing	swt
take a look at this page from ibm for an in-depth comparison of awt swing and swt

672273
value	field
we ll also swap the keys and value to indicate the new primary field but this isn t strictly necessary as the parts lower down do not depend on order

672273
value	field
we use a tab or spaces spaces as the field separator so we split on the tab between the key and value and between the value

672308
value	field
by calculated field i mean a field that is computed from other fields versus raw entered value

672309
launchd	daemons
you need to launchd your own thread and make it a daemons thread

672319
bonjour	avahi
you might like using zeroconf aka bonjour rendevous or sometimes avahi

672345
callback	methods
basically you need to pass an object and the methods in that object to callback when its done

672347
highlight	cells
the code below should cycle through each sheet highlight every cells that starts with an and colors it the desired color currently colour 36 which is light yellow

672350
linux	unix
sorry actually i m not expecting answers about thread-safe but answers about implementing a timer on unix or linux which is thread-safe

672368
automated-tests	selenium
if you have portions of your javascript layer that can only be tested in a browser think about using selenium or a similar tool to create a kind of automated-tests that drive the browser through various scenarios

672370
python	java
for what it s worth if you re totally unfamiliar with multithreaded programming it might be a little easier to learn it in java or python if you know either of those than in c

672394
constructor	object
it keeps the steps of allocating memory and constructing object into that memory apart so it can preallocate memory but not yet call constructor

672394
contains	elements
you can treat v 0 as a buffer contains as many elements you have currently in your vector

672400
arrays	loops
if your input is a 1x1 arrays then height-2 -1 so the loops will never execute since the condition count3 0 will never be true

672423
selected	textbox
by selected the two textbox and validating the username and password for two different users and take the list boxes for seeing the messages in code open a socket connection to chat between the users

672441
udp	tcp
for basic client-server application with tcp udp winsock should be sufficient

672444
wicket	spring
wicket has excellent integration with spring - just use springbean annotation in you code to inject any spring bean to your classes

672449
ruby-on-rails	django
you can actually use jruby and ruby-on-rails similar to the previous comment about django and jython

672456
required	checked
if you were really paranoid you could checked every number passed in to your routines and act accordingly return null but that would required relatively expensive checkeds that aren t necessary

672457
radio-button	selected
you could have a radio-button for each slider as well of which only zero or one can be selected at a time

672457
radio-button	selected
if the radio-button for a given slider is selected that slider is locked and increasing one of the other sliders by x reduces the remaining slider by x

672482
16-bit	8bit
due to downward compatibility and other issues the 8bit byte was kept and the 16-bit word was introduced

672491
pointers	stack
so if you are using a 16-bit stack alignment each variables on stack is going to start from a byte that is a multiple of 2 bytes from the current stack pointers within a function

672493
arguments	default
the default constructor calls a specific constructor with an arguments on the same type

672493
arguments	default
for default constructor with no arguments you don t have to do anything

672494
tasklist	cmd
you can launch the cmd tasklist and parsing the output to determine if a process is running

672499
required	checked
in standard mode x86 doesn t required this for the basic data types but can suffer performance penalties checked www.agner.org for low-level optimization tips

672533
compact-framework	.net
i have an application written in c# targeting .net compact-framework 3.5 running on windows ce

672533
compact-framework	.net
what is the best way to ignore queued mouse messages on the .net compact-framework platform

672534
click	mouse
i ve customized my external tools in vs.net so that i can get the public key of the assembly of the current project with just one click of the mouse

672538
required	checked
to checked if a build is required we keep the last pull from the server in a clean directory and use stcmd list to compare for changes

672579
inherited	subclass
make all testcase subclasses for your package inherited from a phony subclass so that you can say on gst-sunit s command-line when you add more tests

672597
webforms	asp.net
now microsoft are being careful to tout this as being an alternative not a replacement for asp.net webforms but given the advantages mentioned above i m wondering

672597
webforms	asp.net
how long will it be until classic asp.net webforms is considered to be a legacy framework

672597
webforms	asp.net
if you were kicking off the development of a new .net web project today why would you choose to use webforms instead of the asp.net mvc offering

672633
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms is so heavily used that it likely isn t going away anytime soon

672633
reliability	scalability
however once that team has more experience with creating larger websites with much higher demands in terms of scalability reliability and test-ability then they will look towards other solutions for that

672633
asp.net-mvc	webforms
as i saw recently there isn t a reason you can t create a site using asp.net-mvc and webforms together

672647
jdbctemplate	jdbc
alternatively think about using springs jdbctemplate which can take out alot of your boilerplate jdbc coding and help avoid these kind of mistakes

672657
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i ve been using webforms at work in business applications and asp.net-mvc at home for some private things

672663
asp.net-mvc	webforms
keep in mind that asp.net-mvc still uses webforms for it s default view engine

672665
background-color	width
using the table part of the cl-who example provided minus roman numerals and s background-color color to squeeze code into screen width here

672680
iteration	elements
i would be inclined to approach this problem by having a step before this which prepared the mdictmergefields collection so that it only contained elements that were not null or empty this will mean you won t have to check for that on each iteration

672689
data-access	nhibernate
use nhibernate for data-access so that you don t have to write crud operations for each domain object and instead just specify how they re mapped to db tables

672695
happy	yacc
my experiences with yacc for c and happy for haskell have both been pleasant

672704
vcard	vcf
i need a java library to read vcard files vcf

672707
value	field
that wouldn t be able to have a final field for the cached value either but at least it would only be in one place

672732
javascript	dom
i have javascript which performs a whole lot of calculations as well as reading writing values from to the dom

672733
pure-virtual	subclassing
the second two classes ingamearea and mainmenu subclassing gamelevelabstract and implements it s pure-virtual methods

672733
singleton	facade
i do believe that some things should not be used in the name such as singleton however flyweight factory or facade are examples of design names i think fit well in the name of a class that implements those patterns

672735
stderr	stdout
if you start eclipse through eclipse.app from the desktop its console stdout stderr will be redirected to the syslog so any output by eclipse itself or plugins using printf will end up there

672736
order	add
i would like to run some sort of post commit hook scripting on a visualsvn server in order to either add a file or simply edit a file to the repository which will include the revision number and other revision information

672763
any	set
one set validate the temp table data that we re not going to violate any constraints by attempting to make the database resemble the temp table

672770
put	get
you have to put more effort to get it working but code blocks take advantage here

672780
ip-address	hostname
so regardless which ip-address your workstation is being assigned to it is accessible under the same hostname

672781
python	java
i m a somewhat advanced c++ java developer who recently became interested in python and i enjoy its dynamic typing and efficient coding style very much

672781
python	java
feel free to compare the use of python in the project vs java or etc

672787
tabcontrol	panels
containers placed on windows for example panels tabcontrol

672787
user-controls	tabcontrol
next place on your windows tabcontrol nad on one of it s tabpages put this newly created user-controls

672799
emacs	vim
if you are going to be doing serious work on linux you need to learn one of vim or emacs

672803
emacs	vim
vim and emacs on the other hand have been present for much longer

672814
emacs	vim
with vim or emacs you can do it remotely and fill ok

672819
exception-handling	try-catch
the only exception-handling i know of is wcf proxy classes which should be accessed with a try-catch finally and not a using statement

672830
contains	any
just replace the question mark in the string with a string contains a question mark i haven t found any other way either

672857
python	java
is python slower than java c#

672864
aggregate	grouping
you trying to aggregate using min column by which you grouping

672879
python	java
i can do simple program in python faster than in java

672883
emacs	vim
lots of developers use emacs and vim because they re excellent and powerful editing tools that once learned can make everyday editing tasks much simpler

672883
emacs	vim
emacs and vim are just editors but because of their usefulness and their longevity they ve accumulated a number of plugins and extensions to simulate many of the tasks of an ide

672883
emacs	vim
if you just want an ide that lets you jump right in you re probably not looking for emacs and vim but if you want a very powerful editor that while taking a while to learn will make your life easier in the end go for emacs or vim

672888
checkbox	textarea
when i check each checkbox i have to display mailid in corresponding row in a textarea which is outside gridview like abc gmail.com sdf gmail.com

672901
environment	building
what you need to do is to building an environment conductive to innovation

672914
filtering	sorting
you can then use this view to perform your queries there could be a performance hit for filteringing and sorting based on the age and if you regularly sort filtering based upon the age field then you may want to create an indexed view

672924
emacs	vim
code blocks is less used because it isn t extensible as emacs vim

672928
webserver	upload
here is vb6 code from microsoft support site which saves upload file into file on webserver

672938
audio-streaming	streaming
there are lot of streaming solutions are available for audio-streaming

672953
selected	button
if you re using expression-blend you can use it to edit your button templates to your heart s content selected your button in design view - just above the design windows will be a grey button called newappointmentbutton

672968
void	main
public static void main string argv throws exception-handling

672975
web-services	api
we can spike a web-services api in an afternoon

672979
debugging	trace
i recently found the trace function which has been helpful by allowing debugging printouts from otherwise hard places

673011
any	set
your build machine can then checkout any trunk or branch locally to wherever it wants for your interlinking projects you ll have to set it up so that the relative directory paths work

673019
python	c++
some python run-times cpython for example will be slower than native-code c++

673032
directory	folder
when im naming a variables for a directory should i end the variables name with path folder or directory

673033
ruby	php
java developer talking here... but windows hosting is expensive vs lamp which include ruby python and php

673043
python	java
it is not really correct to ask why python is slower than java c#

673043
difference	factors
to develop more efficient algorithms which can easily wipe out constant factors performance difference

673046
directory	folder
i d recommend folder directory or even dir

673050
any	set
it won t really help finding out the font used as any given user might have a different default font set up on their web browser and different web browsers will probably have different default fonts too

673053
directory	folder
the only caveat i d say is that path could be a web location or a file where folder and directory won t be if that helps your decision

673057
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms does a lot of magic for you

673077
mousedown	mouseup
dblclick mousedown mouseup

673077
mouseover	mouseout
mousemove mouseover mouseout

673077
keydown	keyup
keydown keypress keyup

673077
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter mouseleave change submit

673090
python	java
what you got there is clear example of writing java in python

673094
value	field
if you want to show the user when a record was last modified or first created you will have to maintain separate field of type datetime and update the value in either your application or within sql using sprocs or triggers

673123
sql-server	oracle
oracle does not have the concept of clustered indexes as sql-server does

673123
sql-server	oracle
however in oracle most tables would not be index organized - whereas my understanding is that most tables in sql-server do have a clustered index

673123
sql-server	oracle
do not be tempted to declare all your oracle tables as index organized in an attempt to emulate sql-server

673142
vb.net	vb6
today for new projects i feel that everything that made vb6 so easy to use is available with vb.net plus you get new language constructs and the .net

673142
vb.net	vb6
if you have to maintain or transfer an older project then the differences between vb6 and vb.net are much more serious

673145
shell	bash
if i run this within a bash shell i ll see something like this

673156
constructor	object
obj.prototype isn t returning as that is the object s constructor

673159
pixels	line
the last line of pixels is black and some programs photoshop refuse to open it altogether

673173
lookup	any
since a python or any other dynamically typed language compiler does not know what type the object foo belongs to it has to do a type check at runtime and then lookup the address of the bar methods and then invoke it

673193
ref	out
there are other restrictions leading you back to anonymous methods or plain delegation like out or ref arguments passing

673206
google-docs	spreadsheet
a simple spreadsheet google-docs with risk name status assign to and mitigation plan is sufficient

673209
methods	extend
to force immutability you can either implement it in clojure or extend java class and throw exceptions in all mutable methods implementations

673219
data-structures	dictionary
i am wondering how to search an item from the list as i want the cost of the search for comparing various data-structures in erlang like dictionary orddictionary list tuples tree queue etc to use for cache program

673224
subdirectories	multiple-files
a directory can contains multiple-files and subdirectories

673227
expression	evaluation
technically these are equal but how could it be determined without evaluation the ienuemrable returned in each expression

673245
authentication	login
i ve implemented the authentication service profiling service and role service successfully able to login and get profiling information for the logged in user and role information

673253
cucumber	webrat
look at for a pretty thorough walkthrough plus the examples which come with cucumber native examples and selenium through webrat

673261
order	add
if you require order preservation that s not too hard to add

673274
webforms	asp.net
i m a c# .net developer and i think it s great but i ll highlight a danger in the asp.net webforms

673274
asp.net-mvc	webforms
so yes c# is great but i d start with asp.net-mvc and then look at webforms possibly

673279
preprocessor	lexer
it could definitely be considered a poor mans lexer as he seems to still have some issues with his implementation such as no preprocessor issues with a dangling else case etc

673294
absolute-path	symlink
you need to give an absolute-path when making the symlink

673319
design-time	designer
i am using visual inherited and was wondering if there is a way to change the properties of inherited controls at design-time preferably in the form designer

673335
checkbox	textbox
ex i want this common stuff to be applicable to buttons textbox checkbox listbox etc user controls

673341
any	set
it doesn t have any amazing tricks that haven t been documented here this is an amazing set of responses btw .

673352
python	java
now i program in php python java and c#

673361
selected	checkbox
on cell click i check the datagridview column for a checkbox it shows true if the cell is selected too that is the checkbox is unchecked and only the the datagrid view cell is selected and the checkbox is not selected .i tried for the column gettype and found out the type it shows datagridviewcheckbox but wrong checked values

673367
jquery	.post
rich strahl has an excellent .post on how to do client templating with jquery

673382
user-controls	ascx
ascx is the extension for a user-controls where as aspx is an asp.net page

673382
textbox	button
so i put the logic to enable a calender button and a textbox that when clicked on opens up the calender in a user control

673387
click	mouse
the cell click event just means that the user clicked with the mouse button on the data gridview what you re looking for is probably the cellvaluechanged

673419
web-services	api
there is a service implementation that handles the workflows used to build these indices as well as being able to signal completion a custom management api exposed via wcf web-services

673419
asp.net-mvc	wcf
while a lot of it just works out of the box we have some bench time to explore this path as a learning exercise - learning things like lucene.net improving our wf and wcf skills and implementing asp.net-mvc for a management front-end

673422
any	set
that of course assumes that isbusy will not be set to false at any point during page loading

673434
cairo	gtk
the library can be based on opengl gtk or cairo

673453
restart	reload
note that in some circumstances restart visual-studio not just reload the project may be required for these changes to take effect

673456
selected	button
the association is working fine and ultimately i managed to get it working with a selected menu but for some reason it seems radio button are simply not meant for that

673456
having	select
i really don t like using a select menu for that because i only have 4 categories and having to click twice to select a single one is 1 click too many

673460
jflex	cup
jflex is a scanner generator which according to the manual is designed to work with the parsing generator cup

673460
jflex	cup
one of the main design goals of jflex was to make integration with the free java parsing generator cup as easy as possibly sic

673466
javascript	dom
i didn t test it and it s been a while since i ve used raw dom in javascript so let me know if it does not work

673471
children	nodes
they should be children of the first body tag in the output at the end of the child nodes of the first body tag

673479
logging	trace
lean on the logging framework to trace out each method call with it s parameters which again is really boilerplate-y and is far more logging than appropriate for production

673506
linux	unix
i don t know java specifically if there is anyway to set file permissions for unix linux with it to set the execute bit or how to escape quotes

673509
value	field
run this code in both documents before trying to read the value of the field

673515
reportlab	pypdf
i m currently using pypdf to read write and combine existing pdf s and reportlab to generate new content

673521
rabbitmq	activemq
having an mom instance whether activemq rabbitmq or any other mom broker on a one-per-consumer case doesn t really make sense conceptually

673539
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is a .net-space framework based on wpf

673545
environment	execution
if there s anything non-mainstream about the compilation or execution environment give us a few details

673565
contains	elements
solution directly reference the elements contains the text you are trying to copy over

673604
digital-certificate	pkcs#12
i ve created a pkcs#12 file contains a private-key as well as the associated digital-certificate it s currently self signed

673615
configuration	logging
you should also be able to modify the level of logging low through verbose through configuration without having to shut down or restart any services

673625
exception-handling	try-catch
your try-catch blocks should only be around pieces of code that are capable of throwing exception-handling anything involving user-input anything involving an external datasource

673627
any	set
what roborg says is true and specifically answers your first question but it s a pain to have to do that for every site plus it means the routing on dev and deployed sites is not the same when what you d really like is to be able to have all your project urls set up with their own subdomains so they can run at the top-level without you having to touch any configuration or routing

673639
getter	setter
i have seen this in framework or macros generated getter and setter before

673654
required	checked
even though exception-handling are slow checked the existence of a file required an extra trip to disk and disk access is much slower

673655
loading	gif
we are working on a website and noticed that the gif images 100kb - 200kb are loading very slowly

673660
any	set
the style you set directly on the element will overrid any attributes set in the css class

673684
linked-list	arrays
i would probably do it by simply having some kind of data structure arrays linked-list whatever holding the current scene

673695
.when	ready
additionally another time to check for attributes such as size is .when your waiting for a file operation to finish yes you never know for sure but with a good algorithim and depending on the systemd writting the file you might be able to handle a good deal of cases had a systemd running for five years which watched for small files coming over ftp and it uses a the same api as the filesystemds watcher and then starts polling waiting for the file to stop changing before raising an event that the file is ready to be consumed

673748
callback	methods
note that unlike xmlserializer it is not a requirement for collection members to have setters - although you might need to add an ondeserializing callback methods to initialize the list if you do that wcf doesn t call constructor

673749
webforms	asp.net
your application for the most part has to be completely stateless and for some asp.net webforms windows winforms developers that it s a bit hard to wrap their mind around

673754
derived-class	base-class
shadowing if treated as derived-class it used derived methods if as base-class it uses base methods

673769
instances	private
a solution could be maybe to make the destructor private and letting updates return a flag stating if the instances should be deleted or not

673809
stderr	stdout
you might also want to use ipc run and it s callback for data on stdout stderr

673828
32-bit	64bit
be careful using a type such as long since it is not always the same size on different platforms 32-bit versus 64bit

673876
short	zero
this is so grievous that some versioning are recast so as not to make a second test at all thus not determining equality until the span has been reduced to zero and thereby foregoing the possibility of early termination â remember that about half the time the search will happen on a matching value one iteration short of the limit

673877
firefox	safari
when i go to baldwinbrothersinc.com in firefox or safari i am redirected to www.baldwinbrothersinc.com

673877
google-chrome	opera
when i do the same thing in opera ie7 or google-chrome i am redirected to a page not found message or a dns not found message depending on the browser

673882
dictionary	hashmap
python dictionary is a hashmap so it has no order

673891
selected	listbox
bind currentgroupid to the productgroups listbox s selected value

673891
selected	listbox
when currentgroupid changes or parameters collection changes you should filtering this inner listbox items using linq or whatever - basically refill the listbox with groupparameter-s where currentgroupid matches selected productgroupid

673899
observer-pattern	singleton
imho it s an observer-pattern cfr the update call to every subscriber in which the subject happens to be a singleton

673906
google-chrome	firefox
according to the ecma spec an object s prototype link isn t visible but most modern browsers firefox safari google-chrome let you see it via the __proto__ property so try

673906
constructor	object
an object also has the constructor property set on construction so you can try

673914
selected	textbox
i wanted to be able to double click on the text block and have it turn into a textbox then focus on it and selected all the text so the user could just start typing the new name akin to adobe layers

673921
meta-inf	jar
in the richfaces-impl jar the folder meta-inf skins contains all the skin files .skin.properties

673923
grouping	sorting
set sorting in the grouping and sorting properties to sort by this expression

673930
pointers	stack
we have a third-party stack and one of the calls takes a pointers pbuffer to a memory location

673930
pointers	stack
within stack they are free to move around the pointers passed and access it as they wish

673956
contains	set
now this is all well in that it throws an exception-handling appropriately contains the win32 error code that was set as well as a generally human-readable description of the error as the message property of the exception-handling object

673973
input-field	fieldset
i don t think there is a legitimate case to semantically have a fieldset outside a form element since a fieldset is a set of input-field - the clue s in the name

673994
derived-class	inherited
the key point is that provided state inherited from derived is a derived-class of so the downcasting in compiles and works correctly

674015
authentication	login
they require no login or authentication

674018
enumerator	any
just use the appropriate filemode enumerator value in your open methods and handle any exception-handling as simple as that

674029
ruby	php
php currently doesn t have an array_pluck function like ruby

674034
google-account	google-apps
note openid authentication is currently supported for google-account only not google-apps hosted account

674071
aggregate	grouping
the user would like to grouping together these dated fields in aggregate groupinging and be able to collapse or expand the columns as you can the rows

674071
show	next
so we d be able to show the next year s value subtotal or expand it to break it out by month

674077
attributes	properties
this is correct the transactionscope class uses the transaction.current properties that stores its value in the field which is marked with the threadstatic attributes

674077
value	field
the threadstatic attributes makes sure that the field value gets thread affinity it has unique value in each thread

674092
arrays	loops
the simple way assuming no .net 3.5 is to dump the strings from one arrays in a hashtable and then loops through the other arrays checking against the hashtable

674100
arrays	loops
if one of the arrays is sorted you can do a binary search on it in the inner loops this will decrease the time to o n log n

674105
error-logging	logging
turn the error-logging statement logging and server status logging on postgresql way up to see if you can catch any particular messages

674110
debian	linux
and i already disabled all time consuming stuff i anyways don t use frequently like code completion that is on my debian gnu linux installation

674110
notepad++	scite
to get a glimpse on it look at notepad++ win or scite linux

674122
arrays	map
edit 2 it s been a while but changed the code to use the actual length of the languages arrays when initializing the map

674145
.when	ready
.when they re ready to commit to the company s scm server then they just merge and commit upstream

674146
webforms	asp.net
i would like to mention that in the new dyanmic data preview 3 there is a new feature domainservice which supports roles based security please see david ebbo s serssion from mix09 here microsoft asp.net 4.0 data access patterns for success with webforms mix09-t47f

674147
vb.net	vb6
this is in vb6 may also apply to vb.net

674147
variables	boolean
but i m using them to set boolean variables mutesound etc. this is definitely a value that has only two states

674153
webforms	asp.net
i would like to mention that in the new dyanmic data preview 3 there is a new feature domainservice which supports roles based security please see david ebbo s serssion from mix09 here microsoft asp.net 4.0 data access patterns for success with webforms mix09-t47f

674158
actionscript	mxml
i want to do this inside my mxml not actionscript

674159
variables	boolean
does the boolean variables have a default value

674179
hosts-file	hosts
in summary edit your hosts to include

674180
actionscript	mxml
you can write it like actionscript but include it inside the mxml file with the script tag

674186
required	checked
the program is efficient and correct but required an arrays up to the x i want to checked for it checkeds all numbers from 2 x

674195
widget	button
basically it s a windows containing a button and a notebook widget

674195
widget	button
i want to be able to add a new page tab to the notebook widget when i press the button

674221
canvas	pixel
i m not familiar with the options in that area but a quick google search turned this up which uses the canvas element to store the pixel data

674227
export	report
i am not sure what you mean by user-interface here but if it is for the data presentation as not data input you could e.g use sql-server report services and export the results to excel format

674231
webforms	asp.net
i am building a site in asp.net 2.0 webforms

674243
listboxitem	selected
to change the background color of selected listboxitem do something like

674314
google-chrome	opera
these styles work in ff3 google-chrome safari and i think opera 9

674323
managed-code	unmanaged
if you want to use an unmanaged class from managed-code you can

674323
unmanaged	c++-cli
the second option which in my opinion is better is to write a c++-cli wrapper class you mentioned that you re familiar with this that is a simple proxy to the unmanaged class

674342
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome don t have this problem so that s an additional symptom

674345
instances	self
until you create instances there is no self

674355
firefox	safari
everything works find in firefox but in safari i noticed immediately that when i click on an html button the annotation button the current user text selection goes away as if clicking on the button repositioned the text caret

674355
firefox	safari
this google docs solution works for both firefox and safari the two browsers that i m interested in

674355
selected	button
as soon as i click a button or make text selection in the root page outside of the iframe the current iframe selected text goes away

674361
arrays	loops
the for..in loops iterates through the properties of an object or the elements of an arrays

674390
margins	padding
set that as the parent margins then the children can have one-third of that width as padding between them

674392
export	csv
yes by all means have your application export to csv html pdf excel etc

674401
aes	des
i have experience in cryptography as i have taken several courses and written my own implementation of some algorithms des aes schnorr but i have never used any complete library for it

674402
execute	declare
you can use attributes to declare that you want certain code to be execute around the normal methods

674402
attributes	properties
you ll be able to add properties to your attributes to specify any arguments to be skipped etc

674408
getter	setter
is there any point to creating a unit test for pojos if all they consist of is getter and setter

674408
getter	setter
is there a java unit-test framework that auto-tests getter and setter

674413
python	c++
now in python i would solve that problem by catching eoferror but in c++ no exception is raised i could catch and there doesn t seem to be a setting on cin to ignore eof

674414
keyboard	mouse
so you will need a client application that runs in the user s desktop and hooks into the keyboard and mouse activity

674414
keyboard	mouse
you would do that via two calls to the windows api setwindowshookex for low level keyboard and mouse hooks using jni

674414
keyboard	mouse
to monitor activity the application would then need to process the keyboard and mouse hooks for messages

674423
compareto	equals
pojos may also contains other functions such as equals hashcode compareto and various other functions

674425
getter	setter
i don t think there s a point to testing simple property getter and setter

674425
getter	setter
however as soon as you add a conditional null-check or other non-trivial behavior to your getter and setter or other methods i think it s appropriate to add unit tests

674434
any	set
if any of the errorbits are set it will cause the extraction function to immediately return

674435
event-listener	listener
so if we register a click event-listener on the stage for the capturing phase with priority int.max_value we would get the event before any other listerne except perhaps another identical listener

674435
click	mouse
so when you capture it the second time you can check if its a normal mouse click or your duplicates

674437
getter	setter
my answer is that trivial getter and setter do not merit their own tests

674437
getter	setter
of course this is all boilerplate so you could easily write a scripting that generates unit tests for your getter and setter if you think there s any value there

674440
getter	setter
in my experience creating unit tests for pojos with only getter and setter is just overkill

674447
order	join
then join the result set to this temp table order by the numeric key

674456
atoi	atof
i have a c++ application where i m replacing a number of sscanf functions with atoi atof etc.

674466
javacc	yacc
i ve tried to read more but i m bit confused ll lr ast bnf javacc yacc etc

674476
modifiers	final
although you should be coding to avoid that by putting a final modifiers on the methods parameter or similar

674476
getter	setter
my main concern with classes contains lots of setter getter however is what is the class doing

674476
getter	setter
if these are data entity objects then the setter getter pattern may be correct

674478
bison	yacc
the standard tools are bison or yacc for the grammar and flex for the syntax

674481
bison	yacc
if you can stretch to other languages then lex yacc or flex bison is the standard for c although i wouldn t particularly recommend either of those combinations steep learning curve showing their age a little now

674481
python	ruby
python has about a million parsers available simpleparse yapps or there is treetop for ruby - the developer even has a demo that does simple calculations as in your question - but note that this won t do everything that a lalr parser can accomplish

674493
javacc	yacc
javacc yacc are sablecc are more traditional lexer parsing generators and you ll find that they re a little more primitive and have steeper learning curves

674494
python	perl
i m trying to wrap the patricia tries perl s net patricia to be exposed in python

674494
value	field
from what i understand that data field should be able to contains anything for some reasonable value of anything that i don t really know

674521
contains	any
i actually would prefer doing this with linq but i couldn t find any examples that used csv files that had quoted values for values that contains commas in the value itself

674526
bison	yacc
bison c lr gnu versioning of the venerable yacc

674534
arrays	loops
this loops doesnot get executed since the pointer to arrays of long s is 0 most always

674535
iteration	tuples
for iteration iteritems is preferable since it uses a generator to produce the key value tuples rather than having to keep the entire list in memory

674538
webforms	asp.net
what you need to be doing is creating your own very simple workflow system for such a task and also try to separate out some of the back-end logic from the ui handling asp.net mvc framework would be ideal for this though i see you are using webforms which nonetheless isn t a big problem

674540
revision	svn
we want the integration between the two systems to be seamless -- all of our development has been in git so far so we need to copy that over into svn with complete revision history

674545
scala	java
what is the equivalent scala constructor to create an immutable hashset to the java

674551
tuples	sorted
the items methods gives you a list of key value tuples which can be sorted using sorted and a custom sort key

674568
double	int
the only other thing i could think of would be that you re multiplying distance an int by the result of math.sin double but that shouldn t really be an issue

674587
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms will get you

674588
stream	send
there is nothing to guarantee how tcp will packets up the data you send to a stream - it only guarantees that it will end up in the correct order at the application level

674619
instances	self
generally all instances methods will use self unless they have specific decorators like classmethod that say otherwise

674636
duplicates	elements
sets are specifically for storing collections of elements where you want to filtering out duplicates

674639
scala	java
obviously i could turn the above into a simple library utility as i would in java but i suspect that in scala there is no need

674643
google-chrome	firefox
however this doesn t work in firefox or google-chrome

674645
json	xml
is there a method similar to or that generates me a xml json or similar with all the structure

674654
show	next
the down-side is that it s a little more difficult determining whether to show the checkbox already checked next time they view that screen in your program

674708
conditional	operators
stop conditional is a single test here it s just i and incrementer is an expression to be executed each time after body the comma operators lets you have multiple sub-expressions which all get executed

674713
scala	java
related to stack overflow question scala equivalent of new hashset collection how do i convert a java collection java.util.list say into a scala collection list

674713
scala	java
i am actually trying to convert a java api call to spring s simplejdbctemplate which returns a into a scala immutable hashset

674730
scala	java
you could convert the java collection to an array and then create a scala list from that

674739
python	php
which is faster python webpages or php webpages

674747
arrays	loops
second you cannot decide inside the inner loops if a value should be printed the way your code works you write a value arrays i for each value arrays j that is different from arrays i

674759
checkbox	button
another will be a menu still another will be a button or a checkbox

674768
arrays	loops
but be careful because this will also loops through the properties of an object including if you pass in an arrays object

674769
for-loop	loops
you can re-write the for-loops as a while loops to get some idea of what it is doing

674815
appdata	temp
i also know that there is a temp directory c users username appdata local temp that has the files that i am looking for but everything i modify them when i load the profiling they are overwrite

674817
zend-framework	codeigniter
in its current incarnation running on my machine i loaded the zend-framework inside codeigniter and generated an index like this

674837
children	nodes
c create new nodes from a list of existing nodes the children and other data

674837
children	nodes
d find any nodess structurally equivalent to nodes they have the same number of children corresponding children belong to the same equivalence class and their other data is equal so that new or newly modified nodess may be put in the right equivalence class via a merge

674837
children	nodes
a parfait where the children are references to collections of nodes instead of to nodes

674837
linked-list	nodes
string the nodes together into a circular linked-list

674845
contains	any
and can contains any number of closely-related classes

674848
defined	declare
methods bodies should go into the .c file and private methodss should be only defined in the .c file and also declare static so their symbols do not collide with symbols defined in other files

674848
malloc	free
you also need to make it clear if the caller or the library is responsible for calling malloc and free

674849
beautifulsoup	lxml
i strongly recommend using html5lib + lxml instead of beautifulsoup

674865
openfiledialog	winforms
for instance using default parameters the openfiledialog in winforms will change this value to the directory where the file was selected from

674885
disposable	dispose
if you have an disposable object on your class you implements idisposable with a dispose methods that dispose wrapped disposables

674896
constructor	object
in some cases you may want to be able to pass in the object for instance in the constructor without your class taking responsibility for cleaning it up

674897
space	input
input a given text file containing email addresses delimited by a space tab

674913
managed-code	native-code
the currently released d compilers compile to native-code not managed-code

674918
deployment	install
clickonce deployment is a website exposing your application and clickonce will install a new version of the application if needed

674919
python	php
so the biggest factor is your database speed comparing php vs python vs asp.net purely on speed is pointless as all 3 of them will execute in less than 1 second but yet you can easily wait 2-3 seconds on your database query depending on your hardware and what you are doing

674921
firefox	opera
it looks as if it works fine in firefox safari opera and ie 6 and 7 but not in 8

674946
gridview	listview
i would suggest maybe a listview gridview with a gridviewcolumn with a custom celltemplate containing an itemscontrol with its own datatemplate...simple really

674955
launchd	daemons
here s a bare-bones example of an init scripting for launchd an rsync daemons

674980
dictionary	hashmap
assuming you have to have support for unicode the hashmap dictionary lookup is probably your best bet as a 64k entry array in each node won t really work very well

674980
tree	trie
about the only hack up i could think of on this is to store entire strings suffixes or possibly in-fixes on branches that do not yet split depending on how sparse the tree er trie is

675003
put	get
you may need to clear out your session store to get rid of the token that you already put in there

675005
qpushbutton	qobject
when i am writing code intellisense seems to die - it does not show any methodss or data-members in qt objects such as qpushbutton does not see the qobject connect static methods etc

675023
sql-server	oracle
sql-server calls this parameterize queries and oracle calls it bind variables

675059
constructor	private
the version and cid variables are private and within the container constructor scope so you do not need the this scope reference and it would not work at all

675060
document	element
whenever i try to manipulate an asp element using javascript i get a element is null or document is undefined etc

675066
disposable	dispose
if you can avoid exposing your disposable instances the problem of who will handle the call to dispose goes away as well

675070
innodb	myisam
if you have enough memory allocated for mysql s use - in the innodb buffering pool or for use by myisam you can read the database into memory just a selected from tablename and if there s no reason to remove it it stays there

675077
python	c++
gamera has a python interface and the possibility to write c++ toolkits

675090
contains	any
if i want to grep for any file that contains a regular expression perhaps bounded by the typical how would i do it

675091
any	set
hook the navigation events of the frame and set an attached dependency property to the frame on any dependencyobject that s navigated to

675098
bellman-ford	dijkstra
dijkstra s and bellman-ford reduces to a breadth-first search when the weights are 1 so this isn t too useful

675102
bellman-ford	dijkstra
there are lots of solutions including dijkstra s algorithm and bellman-ford

675106
disposable	dispose
system.data.sqlclient.sqldatareader exposes a disposable connection property but the caller decides if the reader owns and therefore dispose the underlying connection using the commandbehavior arguments of sqlcommand.executereader

675117
database-table	mysql
i have a mysql database-table with this structure

675128
directory	folder
i am trying to first list all the iis websites and the folder virtual web directory in each in a treeview

675128
directory	folder
i can create a virtual web directory if i know the path i plan to use but i cannot get a list of the folder virtual web directories in a website i can get the website list

675144
virtualbox	vmware
personally and i have no hard data to back this up virtualbox seems to be faster and a lot more responsive to me than vmware workstation

675147
progress-bar	progress
i have a listbox that contains a bunch of file downloads i want to add a progress-bar to the current download to let the user know the progress of the download

675159
configuration	installation
i m pretty sure this is a configuration installation issue but i m so lost when it comes to linux and would so appreciate any help

675161
python	php
the question is can i recreate properties in other languages which i use more often like javascript python php

675172
implements	final
i m in the final stages of implements a codeigniter site which requires a really simple login system

675172
any	set
are there any glaring holes in a set up like this

675175
any	set
it is possible to create field get set accessor methods in pretty much any language which simulate properties

675184
oracle	mysql
some brands of database oracle microsoft sql server support extra sql syntax to run recursive queries but mysql does not support any such solution

675189
apache	vhosts
of course you would have to configure your apache vhosts accordingly - this is not something that symfony does for you out of the box

675190
children	nodes
evalutes to the count of the elements that a re children of the elements that are children of the top nodes of the xml document -- exactly what is wanted in this case

675193
strdup	free
the macros strdup and free are error-checking versioning of strdup and free declared in emalloc.h and implements in emalloc.c and estrdup.c

675197
getter	setter
delphi has a property pattern with setter and getter methods which also can be used in interfaces

675197
getter	setter
or without setter getter

675200
duplicates	elements
using them methods to remove duplicates elements from an integer arrays looks something like this

675214
triggers	insert
i think the insert triggers is obsolete

675219
configuration	environment
the default configuration is not good from a securtiy point of view and it s not secure enough for a production environment - please don t use xampp in such environment

675220
apache-mina	mina
mina wraps the complexity and adds a few protocols but not as much as twister

675226
http	ssl
we deal with ssl connection at our load balancer level and hence all the connection from our load balancer to our webserver are http

675238
http	ssl
a third option could be to have ssl connections redirect to a different port say 8080 so on the back end you know that port 80 connections were http to begin with and port 8080 connections were 443 to begin with even though they re both http at that point

675239
contains	any
as you can imagine this returns xml that contains information about the logged in user if any

675239
python	ruby
recently we ve been discussing adding support for yaml since it s popular with some ruby and python developers

675239
json	xml
i do understand that we can use one of our existing formats to communicate with a flex app but if we decide to add support for these additional formats just because we can is there something that would make using amf especially difficult or different from outputting xml or json

675257
getter	setter
will make a getter and a setter for length_inches

675257
getter	setter
if you later on want to put some logic in the getter setter you can simply manually implements the same methods

675270
perl	c++
finally while i do use perl whenever i can with a program and data set such as you describe it might be the simplest route to simply use c++ with its iostreams which make parsing easy enough for this task

675293
for-loop	loops
the generalized format of a for-loops not a for-in loops is

675293
decrement	increment
the first expression_1 is usually used to initialize the loop variables expression_2 is the looping conditional and expression_3 is usually an increment or decrement operation but there are no rules that say they have to behave like that

675294
hide	show
it works in firefox too - except - when we toggle ie show hide from one div to the other the page moves in firefox

675318
ref	out
useful alternative to out ref parameters when you need to return more than one value from a function

675318
haskell	python
many languages like ocaml python haskell f# and so on have a special concise syntax for defining tuples

675327
credentials	security
easy to forget that you ve let the browser save your credentials which is another potential security risk

675337
directory	folder
use 7-zip to extract it to a folder directory outside your windows python installation folder

675349
attributes	properties
i removed the protomember attributes from the readonly properties

675366
any	set
this allows them to have access to all of my variables that i set up in the controllers after any of my database transactions and business logic

675385
hide	show
in the end what worked was that i would hide show the datagridview control after i inserted a row

675389
oracle	mysql
i don t know the features of mysql but something like this would work with oracle

675389
oracle	mysql
actually with oracle one could use analytic functions but i do not think they are available in mysql

675394
vbscript	vb.net
out of the box in vb that s vb 6.0 not vb.net and vbscript

675397
command-line	cmd
you could try getting into single user mode by using the -m switch on the cmd-line as opposed to your sp_dboption cmd

675400
.when	ready
.when the lock becomes available one thread from the ready queue will acquire it

675400
.when	ready
they are waiting for a pulse to move them back to the ready queue so that they can acquire the lock .when it becomes available

675417
python	java
if you ve ever learnt java self in python is very similar to this in java

675426
having	select
edit if your having trouble coming up with a you ll need to have the select operate on the results of a query that adds linenumbers to your table somehow

675426
sql-server	oracle
in oracle you d use the rownum psuedocolumn but that doesn t exist in sql-server

675449
scala	java
scala allows import aliases so it s always less verbose than java in this regard see for example java.util.date and java.sql.date - using both forces one to be fully qualified

675461
animation	rotation
in the view controllers corresponding to views the user should be able to rotate i am allowing the rotation but preventing animation

675466
silverlight	wpf
i don t use .net 3.5 and am currently only using vs2005 so i m not sure exactly what the index s filter by list contains when wpf silverlight etc

675472
firefox	safari
i have tested my code in firefox 3.0.7 and in safari 3.2.1

675477
google-chrome	firefox
this is true for all browsers i ve tried it in ie firefox google-chrome

675498
function-pointers	member-functions
member-functions can be implemented as function-pointers in a structure

675500
environment	building
it had a few include at the top of the file that setup the environment including database handler and other abstractions but also defined functions for building the common elements of a page

675504
sql-server	oracle
i ve working with oracle for years a like it so much and will a lot of years more and i want to know about sql-server

675516
sql-server	oracle
the language is a lot like oracle the biggest difference i found is the join syntax - if you use the + syntax lose it and get with the ansi right outer join style instead its the only one sql-server understands

675532
windows-xp	windows
the asp.net application run under the network service in windows server and aspnet under windows-xp

675542
button	popup
inside the popup in the templates put whatever you want to have in the popup like button or something

675542
button	popup
next to the toggle button in the templates put whatever visualization you want to demonstrate the value of the popup when it s closed

675550
constructor	object
no the object initializer can only be used on a call to new with the constructor

675568
atoi	atof
if the data you want to convert is guaranteed to be only in the ascii charset you can always transform it to ascii and cat atof atol atoi friends

675576
any	set
you can set documentroot to any directory though i ve not tried it for windows on c

675614
fflush	stdout
it indeed seems to be blocking at connect forgot to fflush stdout

675615
sftp	ftp
edit i realize that i should fight the man a bit on this but it has been weeks and the ftp presumably sftp is not even in place yet

675635
getter	setter
of course the setter and getter are often methods themselves

675636
imagemagick	magick++
you could duplicate the functionality of imagemagick s import command using magickwand c api or magick++ c++ api but calling import directly via system as suggested by justinhj is likely the simplest approach if you don t mind distributing import with your software

675644
protected	public
public value should always be accessed as properties rather than variabless in classes a private protected backing variables to a property but that is slightly unrelated to your question

675656
httphandler	pagemethods
the way you worded your question i believe you re considering the difference between an asmx scriptservice an ashx httphandler and an asp.net-ajax pagemethods not an actual aspx page

675663
ftp	ssh
why are you allowed an ftp server and no http or ssh access

675663
version-control	git
if you re concerned about security plain ftp certainly isn t providing it and sftp requires ssh anyway so you could use ssh scp to synchronize with repositories this works much better with git than svn as most version-control tasks do

675666
contains	any
when the request hits my asp.net endpoint a class implementing ihttphandler the httprequest headers property doesn t contains any values if the web browser running my flex app is google-chrome

675666
stream	send
i know that typically parameters are sent over by setting the urlrequest s data property to a urlvariables dictionary but i am already using the data field in this case to send an xml stream

675669
magento	cart
it s not that much more risk since all you need to do is buy an ssl cert and use a reputable cart system like magento ubercart for drupal etc

675671
checkbox	listbox
as a learning experience i wanted to build a listbox whose listboxitem s display a checkbox instead of just text

675693
any	set
set values in here you want any new db to inherit

675699
contains	any
the lists contains class objects and we would like to iterate through one list looking for the same item in a second list and report any difference

675706
external	root
if you want absolute url s to gain the session id it should be trivial to create a special anchor control that verifies that the the target url is in the root of your application so you don t pass along that session id to an external application which wouldn t know what to do with it

675708
pbkdf2	hash
moreover password hashing algorithms like pbkdf compose their hash function multiple times it is recommended to iterate pbkdf2 a minimum of 1000 times each iteration applying sha-1 twice making this attack doubly impractical

675719
png	gif
with either technique you can optimise your image by creating a gif or png with enough transparency between the segments to exceed the maximum bounds of width and height your button will experience

675743
lisp	let
i am trying to initialize an xmldocument in f# without polluting the global namespace - my only functional background comes from lisp where one can create a new scope using let

675766
arguments	default
as you see first b0 is created as the default arguments of the vector constructor

675766
constructor	object
then that object is copied into 3 b s and after that b0 is destroyed again as the constructor comes back

675766
copy-constructor	constructor
checks that the copy-constructor constructor and destructor work correctly and that they don t delete things twice if you use dynamic-memory-allocation

675770
hashtable	sorted
i am quite sure that hashtable cannot be sorted .

675788
hashtable	sorted
i won t reiterate what you claim to understand already but you need to rethink whatever part of your design requires you to return sorted objects in a hashtable

675799
methods	extend
what i usually do in this case is to define an option class inspired by f# and extend ienumerable with a tryfind methods that returns the option class

675805
pass-by-value	return-value
remember that the return-value is pass-by-value so a new temporary variables is created for it at return time thus the finally block does nothing to affect the actual return-value

675835
sftp	ftp
i was in a similar situation and we ended up using bazaar instead of subversion because it supported being able to read write remote repositories using nothing but ftp or sftp no need for a client program on the other end

675855
rendering	redraw
in a web application i m hitting some troubles with dynamic content - where by a form being hidden or shown above a jquery user-interface tab control causes rendering issues until the user hovers there mouse over the tabs which then causes the tab header to redraw in the correct location

675867
latex	tex
see the always-useful uk tex faq specifically defining a new log-like function in latex

675887
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller where the default view controller is a uinavigationcontroller

675887
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i want to be able to hide the uitabbar of the uitabbarcontroller when i push a certain view in the uinavigationcontroller

675895
hashtable	set
another option is to construct the hashtable as you re already doing and then simply construct a sorted set from the keys

675895
hashtable	set
you can iterate through that sorted key set fetching the corresponding value from the hashtable as needed

675896
data-structures	trie
other data-structures can be used to have the space savings and fast lookups of using a trie or you may need to store a lot of data with fast lookup by using a btree

675901
python	ruby
in my experience with python superficially similar to ruby i ve never had to implement a binary tree or a hashmap or anything like that

675901
dictionary	hashmap
there are implementations of the most useful structures like dictionary hashmap and lists in the standard library

675902
hashtable	sorted
of course hashtables can be sorted but you need to first define what it means to sort a hashtable

675902
hashtable	sorted
once you have done that however you ve invariably removed all the advantages that a hashtable can give you and you might as well use a sorted arrays with binary searching or use a red-black tree instead

675921
wmv	3gp
i currenting compression wmv to 3gp with avs software

675927
.net	wcf
another option might be to avoid wcf all-together and just use a .net httphandler

675929
data-structures	tree
i program professionally in ruby and i ve found that a thorough knowledge of data-structures has been thoroughly helpful though i ve never had to implement a tree with any particular performance characteristics outside of school though i have had to implement tree-like structures.

675934
webserver	security
for a production situation our webserver uses spring security to deflect any unauthorized access to a login web page this is the case for normal development qa build deployments as well

675934
any	set
the air html control though it works with spring-security well enough is a no-go because any .swf or .pdf content loaded will not show up if transparency is set to true on the air native windows

675959
buffering	streaming
they work on the underlying unformatted streaming buffering so they won t skip whitespace or convert newlines or anything

675968
shell	bash
in the bash shell does not set an environment variable

675975
wmv	3gp
i would like to compress a wmv 2mb or larger file to 3gp 250kb file for mobile-devices

675976
output	mode
if i compile in debugging mode no optimizations i get no output expected.

675982
installation	environment
is something wrong with my installation or environment

675986
qt-creator	cdt
does qt-creator have the same capabilities as eclipse cdt

675992
installation	environment
is something wrong with my installation or environment

675992
silverlight	wpf
you ll find you need to do that a lot for both silverlight and wpf if you want to make full use of the ui controls

675993
unsigned	zero
because i is unsigned it will always be greater than or equal to zero

675994
silverlight	wpf
vs 2010 is suppose to have better support for xaml editing in wpf and silverlight

676007
dictionary	hashmap
for example a dictionary could typically be implemented internally as a combination of hashmap and binary trees

676008
expression	evaluation
if during the evaluation of an expression the result is not mathematically defined or not in the range of representable values for its type the behavior is undefined unless such an expression is a constant expression 5.19 in which case the program is ill-formed

676008
unsigned	integer
unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer

676008
unsigned-integer	int
2 if the destination type is unsigned the resulting value is the least unsigned-int congruent to the source int modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits used to represent the unsigned type

676032
python	java
although keep in mind eclipse satisfies a myriad of developers from java to c++ to python among many others

676032
qt-creator	cdt
if you re comfortable with eclipse cdt i think you will feel right at home with qt-creator better yet pampered

676038
data-access	nhibernate
i am using the membership provider in asp.net-mvc and for most data-access i use nhibernate and a repository pattern

676038
repository	entity
do you recommend using a facade over the membership provider so i can create a repository and make it operate a bit more inline with the rest of my entity model

676043
error-handling	try-catch
add try-catch error-handling

676052
signals	sigint
my solution is to reset the signals handler to sigint after sdl has been initialised

676055
udp	tcp
from the old version of our engine to our new one we switched from udp to tcp

676064
ready	live
then live would also rsync back every hour to backup in a second location so that there is a as live copy ready to fail to

676075
display	width
i had a similar issue to this once it turned out to be an issue with the width not being set on the display div

676079
web-config	app-config
one thing not mentioned to the answers give so far is that any assembly running in the asp.net or winforms app will recognize the application s web-config app-config via the configurationmanager

676079
document	element
the only thing you have to do and document as good practice is make sure the app web configuration has a named element that the .dll expects

676095
contains	set
have your person object only contains one set of data

676107
shell	bash
from your question i am assuming you re using the bash shell

676153
put	get
that means among other things that it does not take advantage of certain aspects of http mostly restful usage of urls and methods put customers 1234 or get customers 1234

676158
order	join
i would suggest to inverse join and selected order - it s semantically the same but structurally different from your desired result though

676159
png	gif
i d like to create a graphic image on the fly based on user-input and then present that image as a png file or jpg or gif if necessary but png is preferred

676159
python	ruby
python or ruby is fine

676161
json	xml
besides xml-rpc there are other techniques that can also be much more simple and lightweight such as plain xml or json over http frequently referred to as rest though that implies certain other design considerations

676161
json	xml
the advantage of something like xml or json over http is that it s easy to use from javascript or even just a dumb web page with a form submission

676161
json	xml
it works with just about any language as http libraries xml libraries and json libraries are available almost everywhere and even if a json parser is not available it is very easy to write your own

676162
json	xml
if i had to guess some smart web developer thinks he is being oh so smart by talking about how think xml technologies are and how super json is

676164
graphicsmagick	imagemagick
look at ruby-gd2 or an imagemagick or graphicsmagick binding

676170
jar	war
not about jar or war files

676171
populate	row
i m using a wpf datagrid in this manner and when a user selected a row i think populate an editor control above the grid with the row item plus additional details

676175
archive	bzip
one interesting concept i ve found was a way to use wikipedia s bzip archive s offline ttsiod buildwikipediaoffline.html

676180
python	ruby
for example if the images are all alike you could create a svg base image with inkscape then edit it programmaticaly from python or ruby either by editing the text or using a xml library and finally export it to png

676216
python	java
such a post must be handled by your server code in java php python etc which can process the stream into a temporary file some languages frameworks such as php can do this automatically

676221
webserver	upload
i m working on an iphone app that will upload images to a webserver

676231
comet	chat
comet described by brian is a nice technique but requires session support on the server which is probably more advanced than you care to implement for a simple chat box

676260
comet	chat
honestly if you are implementing a â œ basic little ajax shoutbox chat â things like jabber comet etc are overkill for you

676277
parsing	comma
you have a pretty simple parsing job - use comma as separators unless they are inside quotes

676282
double	int
i am doing this generating values for functional testing i am actually passing this values to nunit partner max amd min are applicable to int float double etc. these values are test data

676282
double	int
initially i generated for basic data types like int float double string etc

676289
shutdown	restart
some classes of log4j are not unloaded on app s shutdown and next restart will cause the situation with twice entry look at eddie s post if log4j loaded in webapp

676340
selected	cell
i need to selected a single item cell in a listview

676346
user-controls	tabcontrol
the problem was when i bind a user-controls to a tabcontrol itâ s only the contentpaneâ s datacontext that is set to the user-controls and the datacontext for the headerpane is still null

676348
progress-bar	progress
so i need to notify the user that the download is in progress and maybe even give them a progress-bar

676352
println	output
you may create your own output stream there are several different kinds of output stream classes to write to a file or to a string and use the print and println methods of these as well

676384
double	int
i am generating these values for functional testing i am actually passing these values to nunit partner max and min are applicable to int float double etc

676384
double	int
initially i generated them for basic data types like int float double string etc

676386
required	checked
casting to a string is cheaper since that doesn t required an external function-call just internal type checked

676398
precompiled-headers	stdafx.h
however it s quite typical to have a file like stdafx.h exactly for precompiled-headers to work and to not include all the stuff manually in each source file

676408
directory	folder
most probably the swf is not at the right path or is not getting copied to an assets folder in the debug-build release-build directory

676413
contains	elements
returns the path to the jar file contains the current class or the classpath elements path that yielded the current class if you re running directly from the filesystems

676417
detailsview	formview
in this case i would suggest a formview instead of a detailsview which will allow you greater control over the details display since it requires user defined templates instead of preconfigured row based display

676436
filtering	sorting
now you want some kind of filtering aggregation sorting operation so that you don t have to use the db to do all that how will you do it

676437
filtering	sorting
i think in general if you have a database it s always best to do as much filtering and sorting in the db as possible and use linq to objects sparingly especially on large collections of data

676437
filtering	sorting
linq-to-objects is useful for doing database-like sorting and filtering on in-memory collections

676453
precompiled-headers	stdafx.h
as others have mentioned if you don t need precompiled-headers you don t really need stdafx.h

676453
precompiled-headers	stdafx.h
in fact even when using precompiled-headers it s good practice to include the headers your process actually needs after stdafx.h or precompiled.h or whatever you want to call it - along with #ifdef magic in your precompiled header to turn off the usage of pch

676459
git-stage	git-add
also git-stage is an alias for git-add

676462
selected	cells
if you want to be able to selected cells you ll have to use a gridview

676470
selected	textbox
selected the textbox in the designer

676475
firefox	opera
ie even the brand new version 8 is years behind the other 3 firefox safari opera ..

676482
children	nodes
when x nodes to delete has two children replace x with the successor of x and follow case #1 or case #2

676508
twitter	tweets
i dont think twitter keeps histrory of tweets which are more than 1 year old

676512
interpreter	runtime
casting doesn t modify the individual bits when casting between reference-type it just instructs the compiler runtime to interpreter the bits in a specific way if possible

676518
contains	any
1 how would i check if e contains any modifier keys

676520
authentication	login
basically i want to build a web app that will try windows authentication and if authentication fails then will provide the user with a login form

676530
nsurlconnection	nsdata
if you are using nsurlconnection then you can keep track of the data sent inside the - void connection nsurlconnection connection didreceivedata nsdata data delegate methods

676534
double	int
casting down big type - smaller type like double - float - int - byte will cut off information which can t be represented so double- float will lose precision - int will lose all decimal places + no rounding

676535
latex	tex
the 2009 way of dealing with this is to type x to quit fix the source document and run latex again - but you can actually enter other commands at the prompt to edit the input that tex sees

676551
png	gif
not ony will it render your pdf to a variety of formats eg jpeg gif png tiff jpeg 2000

676596
malloc	free
as a result there are now two classes that believe they own the memory from the original malloc call and when the second is deleted it will try to free memory deleted by the first

676601
checkbox	button
is it really painting all the button edit boxes combo-boxes checkbox tabs etc on its own using qpainter or is it somehow using the native widgets

676601
widget	button
if it were using the native widget shouldn t these be button static etc

676602
malloc	free
apart from the fixes given you should avoid using malloc free in c++

676603
hashmap	arrays
this can get tricky since the usual implementation arraylist and hashmap uses arrays internally

676604
required	checked
otherwise either the cast can be proven correct at compile time or a runtime validity checked is required

676610
interpreter	runtime
since it s interpreter at runtime i d have to turn over the source and it s not immediately apparent that i can protect it in any way

676617
reflection	runtime
as frederik says below you could use reflection but again the type-safety argument comes up and you may find you get runtime errors you couldn t legislate for at design time

676644
contains	set
also make sure that the html element contains the swf is either big enough to show the entire flash or doesn t have it s overflow css property set to hidden

676650
switching	screens
if i switching to 800 by 600 pixels i want my html windows changed automatically to fix the screens

676659
any	set
this is not set in any cascading style sheet inline or not nor is it set in a javascript

676659
google-chrome	firefox
i have verified in both google-chrome and firefox firebug that the actual contents of the div are nowhere near 633 pixels high

676678
compression	streaming
you could use any compression algorithm to compress bytes or a streaming if you use indy

676678
compression	streaming
compression a streaming to send with indy is roughly the same

676730
arrays	loops
generally the cheapest way to do convolution in c is to set up a loops that moves a pointer over the arrays summing the convolved values at each point and writing the data to a new arrays

676750
aac	amr
i just cannot figure out how to tweak the sample code to be used with for example aac mp3 or amr instead

676750
recording	playing
you can recording audio in any of the formats listed in â œpreferred audio formats in iphone osâ page 140 and as preferred audio formats on page 140 are for compressed audio when playing one sound at a time and when you donâ t need to play audio simultaneously with the ipod application use the aac format packaged in a caf or m4a file.

676768
decimal	hex
the decimal hex doesn t matter if you have the value in a variables

676768
decimal	hex
decimal and hex are just notation when printing numbers so humans can read them

676768
primitive	int
for a c or c++ or java or any of a number of languages where these types are primitive with semantics closely matching those of machine registers int variables the value it holds can never be said to be in hex

676770
sql-server	mysql
i use sql-server though not mysql so i don t know if you get the same results

676773
trojan	virus
jeez not even my virus trojan scanner will complain when i start a python program which hooks into the keyboard events.

676783
database-table	northwind
i was able to set up a wpf datagrid display a northwind database-table via linq-to-sql and handle the thedatagrid_roweditending event so that it saves back the the database

676928
profiling	trace
run sql profiling and start a new trace

676947
constructor	private
constructor is declared private then

676957
private-members	instances
and it also makes it easier to answer your original question -- which is that private-members are not limited in scope to just the instances in question

676960
loading	gif
it would be nice if the image became clearly as it loaded but thats not necessary its not 1997 anymore remember gif loading

676962
callback	methods
in your methods you start by calling beginwrite with all the data you want to write and also pass in a callback

676969
windows-xp	windows
i wonder whether the windows-xp bootloader ntldr actually makes use of the windows kernel ntoskrnl.exe import declarations

676973
private-members	private
private access is scoped to the enclosing top-level class so you can access private-members of different class in the same top-level class

676977
linux	unix
if you are on unix linux which is likely then just redirect the output to a file

676985
low-level	hardware
these languages have special statements that allow integration with hardware at a low-level

676991
png	gif
seriously though the two main lossless formats are gif and png both in browser and out of and the biggest by far lossy format is jpg

676991
png	gif
png tends to be better compression ratios than gif

676999
sql-server	ms-access
i am trying to link an ms-access mdb to my sql-server 2005 the problem is that the mdb is located on a shared network drive which will require login password

677021
expression	brackets
do a regular expression replace of all things inside angle brackets with its lowercase equivalent

677021
expression	brackets
bonus points for anything that is generic enough to take a full regular expression and doesn t just handle the angle brackets example

677022
pixels	line
use the average colour of some pixels near the line on both sides to determine which is the case

677023
silverlight	wpf
setting styles generically automatically by setting the targettype and omitting a resourcekey only works in wpf not silverlight

677032
cos	sin
sin cos tan functions allow you to convert from triangle edge ratio to degrees

677066
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
this could be events in windows in c# i don t know in python the manualresetevent autoresetevent or a mutex if you want to sacrifice a waiter-thread in each process or signals in linux

677073
show	next
then the next time the button is click show the form instead of recreating it

677076

subclassing	inherited
it is not inherited by subclassing

677096
click	mouse
full-screen mode is initiated in response to a mouse click or key press by the user

677098
instances	private
keep the instances private

677113
credentials	account
rather than embedding credentials it would seem more sensible to use existing nt authentication and run the sql-server service under an account which has access to the network drive

677131
jquery	.post
one difference i see in reviewing the two is that stephen walther s blog .post describes a library which does only validation in the web server where as xval works with jquery validators to do in-browser validation as well

677157
inherited	subclass
personally i would look at allowing extensibility through inherited allowing third parties to subclass your code without giving them the source and very carefully specified access modifiers

677230
directory	folder
recreate folder and copy all the files from original directory to the new one

677234
authentication	login
asp.net authentication control is used for login

677234
authentication	login
or is there a way to login by overcoming authentication control

677255
python	java
spring python seems to be the gold-standard for how to define good quality apis in python - it s based on spring which also seems to be the gold-standard for java apis

677259
scite	kate
personally i use a variety of editors from good old vi to scite kate eclipse and even just the python console for testing snippets quickly

677266
supervisor	worker
overseeing the worker processes are supervisor processor - and overseeing the supervisor processes are supervisor processes turtles all the way up except for the top one who s the daddy

677274
file-descriptor	filehandle
nor is there an open methods or constructor that takes such a file-descriptor as a parameter which would allow you to open the file using a different mechanism and record the filehandle

677274
fflush	stdio
there is basic_ostream fflush however i suspect that this does not in fact call fsync -- i expect that like ffflush in stdio it only makes sure that the user-space runtime library buffering are fflushed meaning that the os could still be buffering the data

677278
contains	any
i am trying to limit the size of my generic list so that after it contains a certain amount of values it won t add any more

677285
silverlight	wpf
silverlight does not support implicit styling via generic styles with a targettype but without a static resource key - x key but wpf does

677292
implements	extends
it was a cms for a university completely implements by extends django admin

677310
json	xml
which format the data is stored in xml json key pair doesn t matter - it s i o operations that are performance heavy

677315
return-type	arguments
all the compiler does is check that uses of t as an arguments or return-type in the methods of dummy are subclass

677345
binaries	install
the old windows binaries page at tigris.org contains an install for python bindings for svn

677357
python	java
in python while the underlying patterns like inversion of control are still apposite depending on your use case the implementation chosen by spring looks like a classic case of something produced by a java programmer who doesn t want to learn python

677357
python	java
see the oft-referenced article python is not java

677368
erlang	prolog
in prolog or erlang is written and is a unification rather than an assignment you re asserting that the values are equal rather then testing that they are equal or forcing them to be equal so you can use it for an assertion if the left hand side is a constant as explained here

677377
reset-password	login
you could do this and login based on the reset-password

677379
callback	methods
move all code out of the callback into the application layer where your unit tests can execute them just like any other methods

677383
any	set
since this is just html with the contenttype set to application ms-word i can t see any reason why you would want to use code-behind

677393
versioning	upgrade
that i now want to upgrade my versioning in trunk to v1.3

677420
google-chrome	firefox
not in safari firefox opera google-chrome have i left any out

search-engine	web-crawler
if you want to -say- log the number of visits of most common search-engine web-crawler you could use

677436
revision	svn
i d like to get the number of commits of my git repository a bit like svn revision numbers

677437
internet-explorer	firefox
firefox handles letter-spacing differently than internet-explorer and the rest of the browsers it seems

677437
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this solution in google-chrome build 1.0.154.53 firefox 3.0.7 and internext explorer 8.0.6001

677447
png	gif
i prefer png for any internet image work i m doing as gif has a limited palette and jpg doesn t handle transparency

677458
string.format	stringbuilder
i d change it to use something like string.concat or the stringbuilder class or string.format for that matter

677463
updatepanel	formview
it s a simple aspx page with a table formview to show data all within an updatepanel

677468
arrays	loops
i need to loops through an arrays and for each element create a textfield

677477
contains	elements
this xpath expression selected exactly all item elements that have a 3 as one of the list of values contains in their intvalues child

677480
browser-cache	caching
to clarify my question by caching i mean client-side caching where the server issues freshness information in the form of a caching-control max-age directive or an expires header and the browser stores a copy of the response in its caching along with an expiry date so that future requests for the same resource issued from subsequent pages can be satisfied from the browser-caching without the need for any contact with the server at all

677510
packaging	building
the applicative number is part of the commit but the applicationâ s info file is generated during the packaging process effectively linking an applicative building number to a technical revision id

677511
python	java
to me it seems that spring python is more of a way to allow python apps to interact with java apps using spring

677523
hide	show
on a number of pages i use a multiview to show and hide the content based on different view modes view edit add

677524
ref	out
for a standard c++ class hierarchy the c++ compiler generates code that contains hard-coded logic for traversal the vtable whereas for a ref class it leaves it to the jit to figure out the optimal implementation

677542
value	field
is there a way with mysql 5.0 specifically to have an auto_increment field who s value is based on a grouping column

677557
easyhook	detours
apart from detours library you might also take a look at easyhook library

677561
capitalize	uppercase
what i needed this methods for was to capitalize names of hotels that sometimes came in all uppercase

677561
capitalize	uppercase
i only wanted to capitalize them if they were all lower or uppercase

677571
arrays	loops
outside of this loops you should be able to look inside the textinputs arrays for references to each of your new textinputs

677578
triggers	insert
you can achieve that with triggers on insert setting max id from table grouping by grouping_field having grouping_fileld inserted_grouping

677585
constructor	object
i could be wrong on this but if it returns an object i could see how a copy constructor can get called on garbage if the method isn t actually returning an object

677602
put	get
you can use bit shift to put together a 64 bit random number from 31 bit random numbers but you have to use three 31 bit numbers to get enough bits

677603
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
otherwise you run the risk of catching any runtimeexception including nullpointerexception arrayindexoutofboundsexception etc. which your client code probably can t handle

677613
required	checked
the checked for skills.none is required because if no bits are on the string returns skills.none which results in a count of 1

677613
unsigned	integer
this would work the same for integer long and their unsigned relatives

677616
integer	digits
mathematically you can convert 2 a to 10 f a where f a is a simple logarithmic conversion and the number of digits you need is the next higher integer from that power of 10

677616
digits	base
well 9 digitss equals a billion so you can use a 32-bit int signed or unsigned as basically a base one billion digits

677625
highlight	selected
selected the projects tab highlight the projects you want to reference from the current project and click ok

677629
textbox	button
when a user enters something in a textbox and presses a button the whole page refreshes to populate the gridview and make it visible

677629
updatepanel	gridview
how would i go about using the updatepanel to make the gridview visible and populate it

677629
selected	button
theres another button on the page called createbutton obviously that will populate the gridview and make it visible so a user can selected from it

677634
arrays	loops
now when you loops through the arrays

677644
updatepanel	gridview
since your update panel s update mode is set to conditional in your code behind after your call to databind on the gridview you will need to call update on the name of your update panel named updatepanel in this instance

677653
constructor	object
and finally the memory block storing said instance of b is returned to the heap - when new was used it first allocated a block of memory on heap then invoked constructor to initialize it now after all destructors have been invoked to finalize the object the block where the object resided is returned to the heap

677682
domain-object	repository
the framework responsibility is to determine which controllers repository domain-object should be loaded for a specific customer

677715
malloc	free
nsapi supplies a malloc macros that gets memory from a pool that will be free for you when the request ends but it doesn t say what happens if you call this malloc function in an initialization function when there is no request

677732
web-services	security
you can also configure security settings for the web-services using the same configuration file

677737
fflush	gets
the readline gets stuck because you forgot to fflush the output stream of the sender the other process

677739
response	timeout
my current thought is that the server timeout on the response because upon first call it has to load all the libraries required for the request

677742
constructor	private
now one attempt to force the user to initialize the class with the required information would be to make the default parameterless constructor private and provide one which takes a logdirectory parameter

677743
value	field
this is not correct field are evaluated first otherwise you couldn t access any default value of members in your constructor since they would not be initialized

677746
sqldatasource	gridview
in the asp.net page i use a repeater to loop over the sqldatasource stored procedure that returns a course s prerequisite sets and a gridview inside that repeater that reads the individual prerequisite information from a second sqldatasource stored procedure

677753
versioning	staging
i m using git-svn to store a staging versioning of some svn repo where other users are allowed to pull from this staging repo and commit there changes back to it then the commits on the staging repo are periodically committed the upstream svn repo

677771
selected	button
to view more than 100 warnings go to the problem view s drop down menu use the little arrow next to the minimize button on the view selected preferences and you will have the option to change this limit from 100 to another number

677795
puts	gets
after this little client gets a result or callback then it puts the server into an accessible by the outside world state

677801
iprincipal	iidentity
my mockidentity and mockprincipal classes are mocks conforming to iidentity and iprincipal respectively

677801
getter	setter
i understand that the httpcontextbase has a getter and setter that aren t implements but i thought that rhino would handle this when mocking

677811
openssl	zlib
it requires too much gcc zlib and openssl

677812
pointers	stack
in my c++ main function for example if i had a pointers to a variables which uses heap memory as opposed to stack memory - is this automatically deallocated after my application exits

677834
switching	router
all these servers are on the same subnet and share the same router path switching etc

677839
integer	short
unless your strings are very short an integer key will take up less space on the page as well db page

677851
installation	building
there s no two ways about it though if you re just looking to building something for demo or for a very small deployment you might be able to get away with the developer s installation

677858
development-environment	build-process
i have 4g of ram and adding more will do nothing i m running vista 32 so i m investigating other options to speed up the responsiveness of the development-environment and the build-process

677864
contains	any
if your table contains any of these it s normal behaviour

677872
integer	digits
one alternative to representing the digits as a sequence of integers is to represent the number base 2 32 as a list of 32-bit integers which is what many big integer libraries do

677872
integer	digits
calculating the product of 2 8 32 64 128 256 512 using repeated squaring 2 8 2 2 2 2 which requires more space and a multiplication methods but is far fewer operations - is closer to normal big integer use so you may find it more useful in later problems if you try to calculate the last ten digits of 28433ã 2 7830457 +1 using the digit-per int methods and repeated addition it may take some time though in that case you could use modulo arthimetic rather than adding strings of millions of digits

677876
contains	elements
the result string arrays contains elements which are empty

677876
contains	any
i would like to run the regular expression without yielding any empty strings contains in the result

677884
project-management	scrum
note that scrum is for project-management it is not a development methodology

677902
json	xml
i assumed that it is complaining because the plain json file is not a well formed xml document so i tried overriding the mime type before the send call to force it to load as plain text but that didn t work

677902
json	xml
i am going to continue with wrapping my json data in an xml document to get around whatever validation the xmlhttprequest is performing but i d like to know if there is any way i can force it to just load plain text uncritically and not try to validate it

677904
shell	bash
check the etc passwd file look for your user and check that the final field on that line is pointing to a valid shell something like bin bash instead of bin nologin or bin false

677907
python	ruby
there s a move in symbian os towards using more common languages for development including c ruby python etc

677930
base-class	inherited
i got this error when i created a base-class web part and then inherited a derived class from it

677930
derived-class	base-class
the base-class was fine but the derived-class failed when i tried to add it to a web page with the same error as the original post

677930
derived-class	base-class
also i added a constructor in the derived-class to call the base-class one - although i think you shouldn t need this really

677950
put	get
the documentation i ve found says to get a devmode structure change a couple of fields and put it back in

677958
ubuntu	debian
they are packaged with the easy name smstools in ubuntu debian and other distros

677968
push	pull
the command-line is git s primary interface and if you aren t comfortable with the different concepts such as index push pull rebase etc. then using git from eclipse will probably confuse you even more

677969
contains	any
actually i have an old iphone which does not contains any gps

677973
perl	php
my blog uses blosxom written in perl but a similar thing could be done for php where each individual entry is a separate text file

677974
updating	updates
i m thinking that maybe the reason it s not working is that i m updating one form and then asking the asp.net-mvc view engine to update refresh the other form but keep in mind that when i step thru the loop on the view that builds the page the data is updates but the page in the browser is not ...how can i cause the view to display the correct html

677976
any	set
is there any easy way to set the jquery user-interface datepicker to disallow selection of specific predetermined days

677987
arrays	map
what i have read is that we can map characteristics of a person in a n-dimensional arrays with a point system for each characteristic

677989
buffering	streaming
reading the streaming into a buffering results in 0 bytes read

677998
widget	button
on windows-xp and vista except when the display settings set to classic the widget painting via qwindowsxpstyle and qwindowsvistastyle actually use the low-level theme-specific drawing uxtheme.dll so that a push button looks like a native one

677998
motif	x11
for x11 usually qt uses its own style painting and has certain styles which emulate some windows system qmotifstyle has similar look-and-like to motif without actually loads and depends on motif environment

678002
versioning	upgrade
for the case where the user has already install an older versioning of our application we do a major upgrade with the majorupgrade xml element

678002
versioning	upgrade
this is all working as desired if an older versioning is install it is upgrade transparently

678006
margins	padding
ie uses margins on the 30 points while firefox uses padding 40 pixels so you ll have to reset both of these value to achieve cross-browser happiness

678022
configuration	environment
edit i haven t used git but the documentation reads the editor used to edit the commit log message will be chosen from the git_editor environment variables the core.editor configuration variables the visual environment variables or the editor environment variables in that order .

678032
ruby-on-rails	django
django or ruby-on-rails

678032
oracle	mysql
oracle or mysql

678033
c-preprocessor	macros
i have thought of writing a templates from which to generate the two isrs using a higher level scripting language but i d prefer a solution using only c or c-preprocessor macros

678036
python	c++
as long as there is some concept of array and potentially a matrix library you should be fine. i ve implemented many of these in c c++ and c# before but seen implementations in python vb.net etc

678039
action-filter	controller
if you want to perform operations outside of the controller then action-filter etc are a good bet

678055
put	get
i set the console app as startup project and put a break point in the workflow designer for the workflow being invoked this way but i get the dreaded breakpoint won t be hit symbol and indeed it s not hit

678070
any	set
and anyway even if that worked it would simply silently fail to do anything if no proxy is set which isn t really any more helpful either.

678079
filesystems	fat
since perl runs just fine on multiple platforms let me warn you that fat and fat32 etc filesystems will ignore renames that only change the case of the file name

678079
filesystems	fat
this is true under windows and linux and is probably true for other platforms that support the fat filesystems

678079
linux	unix
if you will only rename files on ntfs filesystems or only on ext2 3 4 filesystems or other unix linux filesystems then you probably don t need to worry about this

678096
build-process	nant
my intention is to automate this as part of the nant build-process

678113
response	timeout
a response methods that will watch the readbuffer until it contains what i m expecting or until the timeout expires

678125
configuration	environment
the way i tackle this is i have seperate configuration files for each deployment environment

678138
mac-address	packets
hence in most circumstances the first packets sent out will be an arp request to find the mac-address of the default gateway if it s not already in the arp cache

678138
mac-address	ethernet
in this case the packets is sent with the dns server s ip-address in the ip destination field but with the gateway s mac-address on the ethernet packets

678143
constructor	object
the constructor accepted a target object and an operation name

678147
vbscript	delphi
here is an example in vbscript that you could convert to delphi

678149
configuration	environment
i would suggest using entirely different configuration files for each environment prod test staging in our case

678172
rollback	commit
then move your ddl before or after your commit and or rollback statement s as appropriate

678198
any	set
but if i export to pdf i ve noticed any wingdings with character values above 127 do not display inside the pdf correctly just an empty little box. inside acrobat i go to file-properties look at the fonts tab and i see that wingdings is successfully embedded but the encoding is set to ansi

678200
enumerator	any
you should never rely on any order of enumerator

678202
xsd	xml
when i use an xml example file to generate an xsd using both visual-studio and oxygen it generates a file using tons of where elementname is an actual element name

678202
contains	elements
however since my file is huge and contains thousands of elements this isn t really feasable

678216
hash	md5
i presume cryptography strength is not an actual requirement so that flawed but widely used hash schemes like md5 would be adequate - and readily available in many libraries

678222
order	join
if you want to generalize it you can create a new table with two columns - user_id and order_by_val join to it and order by order_by_val

678222
value	field
edit per tim mysql has a proprietary function - field - as noted in his post if you aren t concerned about portability or the issue that function return value are unoptimizable

678223
internationalization	localization
check out the localization internationalization samples here

678228
contains	elements
this methods of course assumes that each contains as an elements of the parent list is of the same length

678239
internationalization	localization
the process of making a program ready for new languages is normally called internationalization or i18n and the process of taking that and actually making it run is localization or l10n

678259
abstract	extends
the fc figures out what page you want loads the specific page controllers edit which extends an abstract controllers object edit which gets anything it needs from models and then calls the appropriate view

678292
flash-media-server	wowza
i know i may sound totally off-topic but you should make sure you ve properly considered video-streaming thru flash-media-server wowza or red5 before you put that much effort in downloading a file in chunks

678295
webserver	upload
you would need to download and install this program on your webserver allow the user to upload the file to a temp directory and then call the command line application from php with shell_exec

678304
value	field
users are allowed edit the value in each textinput field now i need to retrieve the newly udpated value however how can i access these fields

678309
dlopen	dlsym
i didn t try but a solution may be with dlopen dlsym and dlclose which allow you to programmatically handle dynamic libraries

678319
denied	root
requests 2-8 user refreshes login page sending calls to root or res en-us s.js - no cookie is sent to server or received back and access is denied

678326
dlopen	dlsym
i ve never used dlsym dlopen dlerror dlclose dlvsym etc. but i m looking at the manpage and it gives an example of opening libm.so and extraction the cos function

678340
any	set
you can set the order of whatever id s or whatever youwant to appear and any others will follow after that

678364
nested	order
the important thing is that the second lookaround has to be nested within the first one in order to achieve the not x and y semantics

678372
internet-explorer	opera
in internet-explorer 7 and opera 9.6 the text is running outside the box

678373
click	mouse
i do this by getting the node that is click on by calling getnodeat with the mouse coordinates like this

678378
data-access	nhibernate
consider to use something that helps you with the data-access like linq2sql or nhibernate

678383
reliability	scalability
even with the limits a database of 10gb that supports high scalability and reliability is a useful and cost-effective resource

678383
capacity	storage
it does not necessarily mean optimal performance nor does it mean very high capacity data storage

678411
disposable	dispose
disposable fields should be dispose

678414
nsoutputstream	nsdata
you can do something similar with an nsoutputstream writing to an nsdata

678416
verilog	vhdl
i m surprised no one s mentioned register transfer language or any of the hardware description languages such as verilog or vhdl

678416
verilog	vhdl
vhdl and verilog are most commonly used for programmable logic which i think qualifies as talking straight to the hardware

678434
jquery	.post
i d like to retrieve both of those values and .post them to the server using jquery

678445
solaris	linux
in windows i m using gettimezoneinformation to get timezoneinfo but i can t find a similar function for linux solaris mac

678446
value	field
if result of retrieved field value are include in such a concatenation then there is a danger of injection

678449
credentials	security
to get around this you must first retrieve the security descriptors associated with the windows station and desktop and add the appropriate permissions to the dacl for your user then launch your process under the new credentials

678454
webforms	asp.net
when using webforms authentication with the asp.net membership provider we are defaulted to some decently strict password rules

web-applications	webserver
is there any way for a web application to programmatically toggle this value -- at least for itself if not for all web-applications -- so this can be temporarily changed on a running webserver without having to stop and restart tomcat

678495
worksheet	excel
i currently have a vb6 program that essential reads data from an excel worksheet and spits it out into a msflexgrid

678518
controller	routes
asp.net-mvc always routes to my controller action without validating

678525
python	php
what other frameworks are there for other programming languages such as php or python

678542
checkout	payment
checkout the core package as well as some extensions for different payment methods

678551
machine-code	disassembly
vb6 compiles to machine-code so all you would be able to do is disassembly it

678552
arrays	loops
so basically if i was coding this in c# i would create an arrays of previously inserted prqt keys and during my loops i would perform a look up on this when i came across to see if i ve already created a record

678565
queue	fifo
consider a system where jobs are queue and processed in fifo order

678578
any	set
i don t think there s any way of guaranteeing that a given file or any set of bytes necessarily represents an image other than trying to load and display it

678589
configuration	environment
to set perl5lib for a cgi environment figure out how to set environment variables in the server configuration

678589
httpd.conf	.htaccess
in apache i can do that in httpd.conf or in .htaccess using mod_env

678627
basic	vba
extract a substring beggining where the sought string was found all the way to x amount of chars in visual basic 6 vba i would use the mid function

678632
json	csv
csv format or json format or something simple

678653
webserver	host
you may have the perl scripting engine embedded in a host application for example a webserver or any complex application requiring scripting and have a whole lot of restrictions in that embedded context like not being able to load files

678664
processor	cpu
though i have high capacity servers since squid is able to use only processor core the cpu usage seems to be really high

678666
any	set
to filtering out articles that don t have any content assigned to them you ll have to expand the content id attributes and set the optional directive to false

678682
png	gif
built in encoders on my machine vista ultimate x64 are bmp jpeg gif tiff and png. if i save an image using the imageformat.exif property i simply get the default png format

678689
contains	any
if you re sure the code to test does not contains any harmful injections you can eval it

678698
contains	any
now when i use the regex class in the code behind and give it the same regular expression it matches all strings that contains a match and any other characters

678715
thickbox	jquery
let s do it with thickbox and jquery that s what i m familiar with but this will give you the general idea to reproduce it with lightview

678734
queue	fifo
a fifo buffer queue

678734
queue	fifo
first of all you should have an instance of a thread-safe queue a fifo buffer for each instance of your class

678734
queue	fifo
fifo queue would enable you to simultaneously process the data in the worker thread while filling it from the communication thread

678736
worksheet	excel
i m trying to delete a worksheet from a excel document from a .net c# 3.5 application with the interop excel class for excel 2003

678775
webmail	gmail
i know this is possible because when i download word documents sent to me as attachments from in our company webmail or in gmail site using the same ie browser the attachments are always downloaded and opened in word instead of word embedded in ie

678784
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
while probably unrelated to the issue at hand note that uinavigationcontroller doesn t support pushing a uitabbarcontroller

678792
disposable	dispose
the using statement provides a scope for the disposable instances of the class and calls the dispose methods on the object when the scope is exited

678805
tablelayoutpanel	user-controls
i have a user-controls that contains a 2-column tablelayoutpanel and accepts commands to dynamically add rows to display details of an item selected in a separate control

678834
publishing	licensing
if you re using publishing .net software make sure that any licensing package you use is paired with an obfuscation encryption tool

678842
subtyping	generics
a thing sometimes misunderstood in java s generics is that is not a subtyping of

678842
subtyping	generics
but is in fact a subtyping of that s one of the reasons why generics and arrays don t mix well

678846
boolean-expression	operators
they do not evaluate to the same result as the latter is a boolean-expression not using a ternary operators

678861
background-color	border-color
i thought about trying to render the input-field s foreground color background-color and border-color to be all white

678862
value	field
pointer- intx negates the field intx so the logical and returns a true value not 0 when intx has every bit except for the ith bit from the right isn t set

678869
gethashcode	icomparable
ok yeah i know we have here different reference this class doesn t implement icomparable and even gethashcode is returning the different results

678881
integer	digits
so this will turn a digits character code into the integer value of the digits

678881
integer	digits
if it was a 32-bit integer i d have to write 32 digits of 1s and 0s

678891
rhino-mocks	typemock
other mocking frameworks for .net include typemock rhino-mocks nmock .etc

678892
mocking	tdd
moq is a mocking engine for doing .net tdd

678910
value	field
possible if field value is set to spaces.

678923
jaxp	jdom
note that many java xml solutions including jaxb 2.0 stax and jdom iirc integrate nicely with jaxp and can easily be passed to and from jaxp processor

678931
jdom	xom
also try xom which is a modern alternative to jdom

678935
conditional	operators
you should never use the boolean operatorss in place of the conditional operators

678935
conditional	operators
like other answerers i also am of the opinion that the conditional operators does not lack readability for simple expression

678949
build-process	build-system
it only makes sense to extend this feature to your build-process by using qmake and allowing users developers generate whichever build-system they want to use make visual-studio xcode

678950
order-of-operations	parentheses
the code could make better use of parentheses to make the intended order-of-operations clearer

679005
contains	any
i haven t really seen any examples but i assume that they are saved inside the contains entity table within the database

679009
put	get
this would get triggers every time i do a build because i d put it into the msbuild file for the vs.net solution

679017
children	nodes
to find all texts that contain a given sequence of n characters you have to inspect at most n nodess and perform a search on the list of children for every nodes

679017
binary-tree	skip-lists
depending on the implementation arrays list binary-tree skip-lists of the child node collection you might be able to identify the required child node with as few as 5 search steps assuming case insensitive latin letters only

679020
put	get
then you can simply extend cookiehandler implement put get and make it work pretty much automatically

679028
any	set
so that s just a simple extentension where i set the groupname to be sure that all the radiobuttons created by that radiobuttonlist have the same groupname so that now if anyone selected a value from radiobuttonlist1 it deselected any value they have selected in radiobutton2 and vice versa so they are mutually exclusive sets of radiobuttons

679028
selected	button
here in my code-behind i m checking for the selectedvalue from the rblemail within an onclick even of a button on my page..but it always returns empty string even if i have selected an item in the list

679029
json	xml
you keep the items on the server side perhaps in a db if the dataset is really large and complex and you send ajax calls from the client s browser that return the results using json xml

679051
constructor	object
if proxymetadata doesn t have an appropriate constructor and you are using c# 3 you can use an object initializer

679056
.net	wcf
additionally if you are using .net 3.5 it means you can use wcf as well which is what you should be using to generate the proxy

679057
contains	any
if one of the parameters contains an apostrophe your sqlstatement will break and any rogue sql in the parameter name would be executed

679059
binary-tree	nodes
this sounds exactly like a binary-tree each root nodes has at most two child nodess

679072
profiling	trace
what i d recommend is loading sql profiling you may need to install it from your sql disk and creating a new trace

679081
conditional	operators
it s always far better to parenthesize your conditional expression to clarify what you really want to happen than it is to rely on the language s operators precedence to do it for you

679093
data-structures	tree
note that mcas which is created using cas permits arbitrary data-structures and a proof of concept red-black tree had been created using mcas

679109
queue	fifo
they don t have to actually use a queue or other fifo structure

679110
updatepanel	gridview
i have tried just putting my textbox and the gridview with the search result in an updatepanel it s working but it s really slow can i make it faster and how

679130
webforms	asp.net
i won t comment on the parent child portion of what you re asking but rather on the webforms vs asp.net mvc you asked about at the end

679147
click	mouse
the problem is when i click outside of the form or loosing the focus of the mouse to the form contains that timer printscreen the timer stops

679148
perl	awk
backquotes are used a lot in shell awk perl programming and when doing documents in tex

679156
perl	ruby
other scripting languages such as perl and ruby have similar rules though there may be slight differences

679159
prototype	strict
the reason you want to follow this best practice is that flex uses the compiler s strict setting by default and trying to access non-standard functions added to the prototype of a sealed class will throw compiler-errors

679161
user-controls	ascx
i might add that user-controls within the wizard are bound to datasource in code not as part of the ascx markup

679173
children	nodes
when you delete a nodes you have to do something about its children

679173
children	nodes
the problem comes when you want to delete a nodes which has both left and right children

679173
children	nodes
you copy the user data in the next largest nodes into the nodes being deleted and you delete that next largest nodes it has no children or just a right child so it s easy to unlink and delete

679192
variables	boolean
i am displaying a table of data using gridview...one of the columns is dedicated to displaying the status of a boolean variables

679196
contains	elements
you need two elements to do nested background joining aka sliding doors an outer background one and an inner foreground contains the end-piece of the background image

679196
selected	button
if you can find a way to selected the div you mentioned you could use that as the outer element with the button with its natural background colour removed as the inner

679196
margins	padding
you would also need to account for the top margins on the button and any padding on it

679204
webserver	host
does anybody know of a commercially supported distributable webserver that can host asp.net applications

679206
protected	public
it is also a compile-time error if any methods declared in an annotations type has a signature that is override-equivalent to that of any public or protected methods declared in class object or in the interface annotations.annotations

679208
order	join
i going to assume that you ve skipped a where-clause which involved the order table or otherwise the join would be pointless

679226
icomparable	equals
once you ve figured that out you can go about writing your comparison in hashcode or icomparable icomparer equals equatable and so on

679227
value	field
if it prints the value 4 then the monitor field must be at the end of the object because 4 only account for the size of the vmt pointers

679227
value	field
if it prints the value 8 then the monitor field must be at the start adjacent to the vmt pointers

679227
value	field
the field contains pointers to the object s interface-reference value

679232
document	element
only one top level element is allowed in an xml document

679246
put	get
when i put it outside i get the following warning

679251
value	field
i would increment a lasttrackingtoken integer field and simply add that value to the users cookie and track his voting activity with it

679260
contains	any
if the exe changes every now and then then you could grab the command-line from your process find the parameter which contains the filepath to the r15_a.bat file then use the filesystemobject to open this bat file look for any executable which it calls which could possibly be still running and then kill those....but really that may be overkill for what your trying to accomplish

679263
ms-access	mysql
i have a linked table in ms-access that pulls data from a mysql database

679263
value	field
in it is a field titled job that should have three possible value chairperson vice-chair and null

679263
value	field
it looks like setting a lookup box display control in the design view of the linked table to should provide a solution but i cannot seem to be able to set the rows in the title field as what shows up in the dropdown and the corresponding value in the values table to be what the field is set to

679273
decrement	increment
the only way i can see to do lock-free balanced tree is to use a modified mcas where you can also do increment decrement so you can maintain a reference count

679286
unmanaged	c++-cli
i ve done something similar with an unmanaged server hosting the clr and asp.net and it provides for very easy interop using c++-cli between managed world and the unmanaged

679293
derived-class	base-class
i have a simple base-class and derived-class

679300
difference	factors
just keeping track of the balance factors difference between left and right subtrees is i found easier from a programming pov except that sorting out the balance factors after a rotation is a pita.

679324
arguments	default
i think that best place for extension methodss is helper methodss or shortcuts that make existing api easier and cleanier by providing default value to arguments of existing methodss or hiding repeating chains of methods calls

679331
reflection	runtime
i don t like this approach as bugs for example typos in the methods names only pop up during runtime and the reflection api is somewhat chatty

679349
smalltalk	lisp
for example on the burroughs b5000 the cpu was programmed in a variant of algol on the lisp machine the cpu executed lisp code directly on the early smalltalk workstations the cpu executed smalltalk bytecode directly

679357
value	field
normally i would add a rating field with int value in that same table which references another rating table that holds actual rating data

679358
selected	textbox
i ve already addressed styling the gray on gray default style of disabled readonly textbox html input now i m trying to tackle dropdownlists html selected

679363
document	element
the xml error is because an xml document must have a single root element

679373
base-class	inherited
changes to a base-class that don t break an inherited class should

679378
scriptaculous	jquery
a very nice canvas api for programatically generating html jquery scriptaculous

679402
sortedlist	hashtable
i have a the need for key-value pair that i wish to sort so i decided to use a sortedlist instead of a hashtable

679408
value	field
if you make the value readonly instead of disabling it the field s name value will be sent with the rest of the non-disabled fields

679408
value	field
some browsers let you focus and selected readonly fields and some even let you paste into a readonly field though they revert to the original value onblur and onchange

679415
constructor	object
create a sortedlist of string list of object but pass in an icomparer of string to the constructor where the implementation will compare the keys according to the ordering you want

679471
value	field
picklist value for standard field cannot be edited in spring 09

679471
contains	set
so it s easier to grab a full set of metadata contains all its dependencies

679482
entity-framework	ado.net
1 yes at this time ado.net only has an implementation of iupdateable for entity-framework

679485
png	gif
funny thing they re now all png images instead of gif

679507
sql-server	oracle
if your getfromdb is reading from say an oracle sequence or a sql-server autoincrement field then the db is taking care of synchronization in most scenarios excluding replication distributed dbs so you can probably safely return the result to any calling thread

679514
nested	order
nested sets stores a numerical order of a recursive walk over the tree

679514
nested	order
i usually end up with nested sets so that i get an explicit first-to-last order as well.

679532
postback	ajax
i know how to make the autosuggest-textbox since there is a control for that in the ajax control toolkit from asp.net but i am not sure how to approach creating the list of tags and how to add remove from it without postback

679544
contains	elements
if your vector can contains negative values and you re not taking the absolute value of the elements before summing it s wrong to use terms like distance length or norm

679569
methods	extend
i can t see why you need to extend vector with those methods

679571
constructor	object
about constructor destructors and new delete operators in c++ for custom object

679576
buffering	streaming
well tcp works in streaming so in order to detect anything you are going to have to anticipate the case that a r n is not the only thing that is in your buffering

679593
calling-convention	dllimport
you could try using the unmangled name while specifying a calling-convention in the dllimport

679597
methods	extend
so if you don t override methods and don t need polymorphic behaviour but just extend the class â it s ok to inherit stl containers

679611
assign	add
std vector is assignable but if you add your own fields they won t get copied on assignment if you assign from a vector pointers or vector reference

679649
value	field
also don t add a record for null as the principle of a foreign key field states that the value must exist in the table where it is a primary key or it must be null

679652
delphi	basic
if it can be a windows based app you can try using the browser component of any programming language like c# visual basic delphi etc to load the page and then peek into the content and save it

679654
ref	out
if one thread sets fills out the definition and calls our definition.register ref riskyreference

679734
javascript	dom
it runs in the browser so it can capture output html after javascript has modified the dom

679764
authentication	login
it would be ideal if somehow i could catch this exception during the authentication process and retry the login since ado.net seems to clear the connection pool after a failure like this occurs i think the retry would work

679768
scheme	prolog
i only caught that because i created a prolog color scheme for notepad++ if anyone is interested i can post it online

679792
postgresql	mysql
they have created an open system for others to plug-in providers - postgresql and sqlite have it - mysql is just laggin.

679797
contains	any
this will take a string contains ten digits formatted in any way for example 246 1377801 or even and format it as 246 137-7801

679802
perl	php
sadly you can only compete with perl php python ruby and i would love to see this problem solved in other not so traditional languages

679810
compact-framework	.net
is this even possible in the .net compact-framework

679818
set	bag
instead of the set mapping you can use the bag mapping to give you an ilist

679838
perl	c++
i had learned using c++ in school but had spent most of my career with perl python c# bash and had forgotten my basics

679853
bison	yacc
programming language grammars are commonly represented in bnf form which can be used by tools like yacc or bison to parsing source code

679859
emacs	vim
although you use emacs instead of vim so i guess you re into overkill.

679861
webserver	host
assuming as dragonmantank mentioned above that the fqdn is in your hosts file i d look at whether the webserver software itself is configured to accept requests with the fqdn in the host field

679866
any	set
when any methods other than a very small set like release and retain is called lazya loads all the data from disk finishes filling in the ivars switches the isa pointer back to a and forwards the call to the real class

679867
factors	primes
just the function - returns a list of primes factors 49 significant characters

679888
realloc	malloc
it is very tedious to realloc malloc the arrays and insert strings

679888
lookup	any
is there any standard way that i can add strings to or do lookup in a

679894
boost	stl
sounds like you want to use something like an stl list or boost arrays of char

679913
code-generation	mygeneration
code-generation can fill that gap really well i started using codesmith but then they made that a pay item so i moved to mygeneration

679926
linux	unix
downloaded the unix linux distribution camellialib-2.7.0.tar.gz

679941
url-rewriting	query-string
added the framework i am building on has url-rewriting so i can create routes and generate query-string params which are hidden from the user

679947
meta-inf	jar
if you don t care about the manifest and other meta information which you probably don t since you just want to extract resources you can just extract the files with jar -xvf myjar.jar delete the meta-inf directory and create a new unsigned jar

679947
meta-inf	jar
you should be able to un-sign the jar by editing the manifest and deleting the signature file in the jar s meta-inf directory

679952
web-services	security
even when my http form is located under the services subfolder and that i am correctly loading the crossdomain.xml file i can do either http requests and web-services requests everytime i try to do a file upload i get the infamous security sandbox violation

679963
postgresql	mysql
any orm like sqlalchemy sqlobject or the django orm are implemented on top of db-api and i recommend using any of these over direct db-api because it can give gramps the flexibility to run sqlite in embedded mode for local desktop users and then also share sometime down the road a postgresql mysql database connection with a web based version of gramps

679994
javascript	dom
how to find event listeners on a dom node when debugging or from the javascript code

679994
javascript-events	onclick
how to trace javascript-events like onclick onblur

679997
.when	ready
knowing .when the dom is ready for scripting access is different in just about every browser

679997
javascript	dom
the core javascript features string date regexp array functions seem to be pretty reliable and consistent across browsers especially relative to the dom css window functions

680034
versioning	upgrade
we ve recently jumped from vc++ 6 to visual-studio 2005 and have since upgrade to 2008 for the latest versioning of the project that we re working on

680041
children	nodes
i understand that the degree of a nodes is the number of children it has

680067
height	frame
i ve tried quite a bit already resizing the cell s frame on creation using different identifiers for cells with different height changing properties in interface builder.

680081
grouping	sorting
it looks like you re doing unnecessary casts for grouping and sorting

680090
value	field
i read your question to say that there is a single field name with field value something like 1 spaces company 2 spa resort etc

680092
triggers	insert
if its sql-server you could make triggers for insert and delete to increment decrement the value

680118
triggers	insert
you may have to requery the count after each triggers invocation since it may not always be possible to know how many rows were inserted or deleted depending on rdbms and you may need multiple queries if there s a chance that more than one of your counts could be affected by a single insert or delete statement

680118
triggers	insert
so the trigger or triggers you may be able to package it all into a single insert update delete trigger could get pretty complicated

680133
32-bit	64bit
consider incrementing a 64bit integer on a 32-bit system

680141
associations	model
the problem i have is in querying based on the polymorphic associations and joining from the comment model back to it s owner

680149
sftp	ftp
if you re referring to preventing access to other directories when using ftp sftp you can set up an account to login into a chroot environment with no access to other areas

680167
virtualization	parallels
virtualized windows will nearly always work better through parallels or some similar virtualization software

680169
environment	building
icedtea6 1.4 fedora-11.b14.fc10-i386 runtime environment building 1.6.0_0-b14

680174
radio-button	button
for most controls label button radio-button etc this would cause alt + a to become the designated keyboard shortcut to trigger the default event clicked

680176
command-line	cmd
try the where or which cmd on the cmd-line - this will tell you where the shell os is locating each of these executables

680183
virtualbox	vmware
besides wine you can get virtualbox free parallels or vmware

680199
export	report
i m planning to export it to excel to enable me to generate report from the datagridview

680204
windows-server	windows
i am wondering whether on windows-server 2003 in windows media service we could setup configure throttling settings for any file types even the file types not supported by streaming by windows media service for example setup .flv file download streaming throttling bit rate to 100k or setup the bitrate throttling control to the same as encoded bit rate

680207
ironpython	cpython
how can i tell whether it is cpython or ironpython or jython

680218
.net	wcf
i d recommend wcf on .net 3.5 if possible though

680222
python	java
that s the â œnormalâ version of python the one you get when you use the command â œpythonâ and the one you ll have unless you specifically went looking for the projects targeting java cil

680241
value	field
trouble is said form is of the multi-stage sort so if a user fills out a stage then returns later the remembered value for the various field won t reset when the clear button is click

680246
associations	model
i m looking for guidelines on when to know when a restful approach to a model and it s associations is proper and when it s not

680246
associations	model
perhaps it s the nature of my current application but i m finding that simple model with no associations work well with rest but complex model with many has_many assocations really seem to complicate the view and the setup required in the controller

680250
triggers	insert
create an insert triggers to increment a product count

680251
instrumentation	trace
you could probably use this to instrumentation the routines that access your data structures and trace when the values you re interested in are created or modified

680254
checkbox	button
of course if you have checkbox radio button you ll need to modify this to include them as well and set

680256
filesystemwatcher	backgroundworker
you should also keep the processing in the filesystemwatcher event to a minimum for instance just add the file path to a queue and then have one of your timers or backgroundworker process the queue

680262
exception-handling	try-catch
you will also see output in the debugging windows about first chance exception-handling when you implement your own try-catch blocks

680268
webserver	host
i checked with my host and corrected the mailserver to localhost that s how the webserver sees the mail server and that cleared up some

680277
configuration	environment
if you need to have one environment one view or workspace with a variables content depending on a different branch you need to define a symbolic link or a windows subst pointing to different views each with their own configuration spec

680282
button	popup
bind content to the dictionary controller s arrangedobjects.value don t include description â the popup button will do that for you and contentobjects to the dictionary controller s arrangedobjects.key

680282
dictionary	arrays
dictionary controllers are arrays controllers so that shouldn t be a problem but binding to a property of the controller may be

680289
put	get
rest and roi treats the urls as series of nouns and it uses http methods like get post put and delete as the verbs

680289
associations	model
this model works for crud and even for model with multiple associations

32-bit	64bit
the 32-bit dlls are special and can talk to the 64bit kernel including drivers in that kernel

681553
32-bit	64bit
in general the 32-bit dlls do not talk to 64bit dlls as there is no 64bit process in which the latter dlls could be loaded

however in my opinion the java naming-conventionss is a better choice than the ibm naming conventions and not only in java for c# as well and any oo programming language

682075
reflection	runtime
it is just a code generated wrapper that completely compiled and does no reflection in runtime

682083
bazaar	git
when a command that takes 30 seconds or 4 minutes in svn instead takes 1 or 2 seconds in git or mercurial or bazaar it is a huge difference to a developer

682088
required	checked
project euler is mentioned in the tags and many of the problems in it required checked numbers 2 64

682131
persistence	stateless
you must implement your ejb stateless in that it doesn t hold any instance variables which itself holds a stateful value like persistence context

682156
json	xml
serializer also deals with datatypes unlike json xml like amf

682171
time-complexity	in-place
the algorithm should be stable and the time-complexity should be o n with constant spaces for additional variables which means sorting should be done in-place

682172
postgresql	oracle
the index keeps not only the indexed value but also some kind of a pointer to the row rowid in oracle lcid in postgresql primary key in innodb etc

682215
queue	fifo
it appears that what you have here is a fifo queue implemented in a file and you re depending on the consumer s ability to process data faster than the producer can create it

682225
delphi	basic
according to delphi basic the in is only applicable to programs and libraries and not units

682256
mp3	m3u
if all else fails you could create m3u files mp3 playlists from your song sources and start winamp via process.start passing the newly created playlist

682257
hide	show
you ll have to control the tooltip yourself using the show and hide methods if you want any control over how and where it is positioning using the 2.0 framework unless you want to get into windows s api calls

682257
hide	show
and the msdn documentation on using the tooltip s show and hide methods is actually fairly decent

682269
textbox	button
i.e the custom control does a loadcontrol in the user control is a button and a textbox

682269
textbox	button
however the click event of the button is never fired and my textbox has also lost the value that i typed in

682274
http	ssl
i have a wss 3.0 system using ssl where every page is supposed to be served as http

682274
put	get
in those cases i have to put the s in by hand to get the page to load

682274
javascript	dom
to fix this i have tried adding some javascript to the dom that searches for instances of http and replaces them with https

682280
implements	abstract
i thought of making the methods that contains os.writeobject abstract so that objectstreamconnect could implements it differently but then i realized that datastreamconnect would also have to implements it which it does not need to

682300
any	set
once complete set any movie which still has a status of checking to deleted since they weren t found in the autoimport

682305
semantics	keyword
i added const keyword thanks to phresnel for bringing up the topic in order to make the solution semantics equivalent to a solution only presenting a public matrix2d -pointer

682317
exception-handling	try-catch
could you add a toplevel try-catch or use the unhandledexception-handling handler to see what kinf of exception-handling is thrown

682321
put	get
couple this knowledge with the get and put principle in section 2.4 from java generics and collections

682321
put	get
the get and put principle use an

682321
put	get
when you both get and put

682323
superclass	inherited
what you seem to be saying is my two objects use some shared methods and i m sharing them through inherited of a superclass

682336
constructor	object
through a regexp object constructor

682343
ref	out
it turns out that this is because the head ref branch

682344
execute	prepare
basically i use a prepare statement and create and execute some dynamic sql in this search sp

682351
gethashcode	equals
to circumvent this override equals and gethashcode in your mixed in type

682352
contains	elements
myhashtable.add throws argumentexception if hashtable already contains elements with your key

682357
environment	building
from what i have found on microsoft s site comctl32.dll is the library you need to locate and add its path to your building environment

682383
.when	ready
.when the data is ready to be read p1 notifies p2 about that by the event

682386
attributes	properties
if you wish you could also use the straight xmlserializer instead which will not decorate your properties with an order x attributes

682416
filesystems	fat
keep in mind that on case-remembering filesystems fat ntfs you ll need to rename the file to something else first then to the case change

682426
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m currently in the process of converting some small personal web sites from webforms to asp.net-mvc

682450
pointers	stack
the the second example the object is allocated in the heap and a pointers to that memory is stored on stack

682458
ienumerator	ienumerable
i can reach both ienumerable and ienumerator interfaces in delphi 6

682468
ubuntu	linux
on linux ubuntu operating system controls the maximum size

682484
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in all browsers that i ve checked it in google-chrome firefox safari but ie8 adds a bunch of extra white space after the image which causes a horizontal scroll bar

682484
contains	elements
ie8 s developer tool layout tab confirmed that the width of the div contains the img elements was something like 1039px so through inline css i was able to get it to the right size but all other elementss in the description field still have a width of 1039px

682487
linux	unix
psi provides process information on linux and other unix variants

682488
entity-framework	nhibernate
i d look at nhibernate linq2sql entity-framework or one of the other billion or so out there

682505
any	set
if you recently installed any add-ins they re known to set sometimes unwanted keyboard shortcuts

682527
command-line	cmd
in equinox this boils down to the -console command-line argument and the ss followed by diag cmd in the osgi shell

682531
project-management	project
qa isn t the place where you throw away any missing responsibility in the project project-management should care about budget risks etc

682558
export	csv
you can upload a csv which gets automatically converted to a spreadsheet then you can query or edit it programmatically or manipulate it online then if you need to get it as csv you can export it

682559
internet-explorer	firefox
is there any way to test a website in internet-explorer 6 on a computer that already has firefox and internet-explorer7 installed without either

682572
hash	md5
hash is an md5 hash that is static for each rule

682591
hide	show
it s faster and more readable if you just do this again after you show hide the inner table

682602
hide	show
why don t you just always include the review comment form and use client side code to show or hide it

682611
dictionary	map
i have written a erlang code to find the timings for inserting fetching date into various data structures like list dictionary queue set and parallel map of the data structures

682616
logout	login
so far i ve used the account controller for actions related to a user s account -- login logout activation like register but i use register for other actions in the site so i ve renamed it add update contact information

682616
administration	account
my feeling is that since this is for ordinary users it should be a separate controllers since account would apply to both ordinary and administration users

682616
administration	account
do you consider the account controllers to be for administration actions related to the user s account or for all actions on the user s account

682621
hide	show
the easiest way to do this i think is to create a simple html file and use javascript to show hide different bits of it

682666
sql-server	oracle
this is what is called a range scan oracle or an index seek sql-server

682670
defined	declare
but even if you had a default-constructor for x it of course is still wrong because neither a is a static member of x nor a static of x can be defined declare at block scope

682691
puts	gets
obviously git gets confused and puts invalid from linux s perspective filenames

682713
administration	account
on the other hand it might be the case that the users perceive account functions and administration functions as part of the same family of actions except that some users have additional features

682713
administration	account
updates regarding your updatess question i would say that it is fairly natural to put an action for changing a user s password on the account controllers and that action could be invoked by the user herself not just an administration

682713
administration	account
so i wouldn t presume that the account controllers is strictly for administration tasks

682739
lighttpd	apache
finally comparing apache to other popular open-source servers such as lighttpd would show you what tasks are approached in a similar way by different programs and where there are trade-offs speed vs

682764
display	width
some of the items in the selected require more than the specified width of 145px in order to display fully

682769
authentication	login
typically you would set up your production servers so that only authentication adminstrators can login to the server or write to its filesystem

682783
stderr	stdout
how can a process intercept stdout and stderr of another process on linux

682788
authentication	login
since security needs on my site are very low i would like to authentication once and then keep the login persisted indefinitely without giving the user the choice

682795
xsd	xml
i would really like not to have to build up the xml by hand but i only know how to use xsd files .net

682799
directory	folder
i tried changing the directory with os.chdir to reduce the folder trail lengths but when i try using os.system with .. folder filename it apparently can t handle relative path names

682801
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
further interlocked methods force cache coherency and all of the synchronized concepts monitor readerwriterlock mutex semaphore autoresetevent manualresetevent etc. call interlocked methods internally and thus ensure cache coherency

682814
attributes	properties
i do the reverse part by assigning custom attributes to the properties of the class that are the actual names of the database fields

682814
attributes	properties
so i am populating my attributes for my ldap search with the properties s directoryattributeattribute name value

682814
attributes	properties
i am working on a foreach that gets the custom attributes for each properties but then i have to run that foreach for every field in the result set kind of cumbersome

682816
tree	trie
if you are trying to optimize looking up a list of strings with a given prefix you might want to take a look at implementing a trie not to be mistaken with a regular tree data structure in c#

682817
radio-button	selected
to do this i d wanted to setup the script but trigger it to only be used when the user selected the second radio-button which i ve achieved albeit questionably by binding a portion to a click even eg

682817
selected	button
obviously the way it works now once the second radio is selected the autocomplete script is setup and anything typed into the search box will be presented with the suggestions no matter which button is eventually selected

682823
project-management	project
the early approach to software project-management usually referred to as â œ waterfall model â implies a sequences of clearly defined steps necessary to complete any project define plan organise execute and then close

682823
project-management	scrum
the chronic problems with the waterfall abstraction gave birth to a number of â œ agile â project-management methods agile scrum xp programming etc that despite many difference at the more detailed level use the same fundamental principles to tackle product development complexity

682826
selected	textbox
so it should set the textbox to visible when i selected pickme but this does not work

682828
xsd	xml
you should just be able to load your dtd into the xml designer choose create schema and have visual-studio infer the xsd from it

682829
gtk	gdk
the simplest combination would be cairo + pango + gdk the windows part of gtk

682857
binaries	install
and also won t install for you any 3rd party binaries into gac like system.data.sqlite.dll if you wish to use sqlite for example

682859
hardware	monitor
i know that windows activation mecanism is monitor hardware to detect changes and that it can tolerates some minor changes to the hardware

682863
nofollow	noindex
currently i use the html meta tag robots - noindex nofollow to solve the problem

682863
nofollow	noindex
is there a robots.txt solution that works at least for some search bots or do i need to continue with noindex nofollow and live with the additional traffic

682866
implements	final
for the methods that require different behavior depending on the type simply have the base-class final methods call protected methods in the children and have each child type implements that behavior

682878
udp	tcp
that function reinitializes all the sub-modules tcp udp smtp etc.

682878
udp	tcp
it will also clobber all of the tcp and udp socket you have open so you will have to re-open the sockets you want to use

682934
32-bit	64bit
the variables d being of the type intptr_t needs d format specifier on 32-bit machines and format specifier ld on 64bit machines

682934
32-bit	64bit
i am looking a solution to be able to compile the code on both 32-bit machines and 64bit machines without making changes to the gcc command-line or the source code

682938
build-process	ant
the build-process is based on ant scripts and not maven

682948
any	set
make sure you pay attention to any cookies getting set

682979
pointers	stack
if you don t know when to use pointers read pukku s summary in this stack overflow question

682989
required	checked
the applications in the suite don t all required the same set of prerequisites therefore it is not easy for the msi to checked for the prerequisites until it knows which applications in the suite the user wants to install

682994
joomla	drupal
joomla and drupal are your most common and popular php based cms solutions

682995
perl	c++
use xapian python perl c++ ... to build a full-text index over all your documents

683022
joomla	drupal
two out of the three criticisms of drupal on wikipedia are that it s too complicated which is really a subjective matter as compared to the shortcomings of joomla

683045
hide	show
just remember that cells are reused if you call tableview dequeuereusablecellwithidentifier which you should do so you ll have to explicitly show hide control whose visibility may have been changed

683068
exception-handling	error-handling
for the special case of error-handling my idea is using exception-handling

683073
any	set
in this loop i ve arbitrarily set the number of elements to 20 and i try to bail out when the entry becomes null but the web service on the receiving end of this does not like any null elements passed to it

683078
value	field
my question is what value do people typically use for their title field

683081
for-loop	loops
another thing i d like to point out in c# you can delcare your int variable use in a for-loops right inside the loops

683086
bug-tracking	bugzilla
for bug-tracking we use bugzilla

683091
cvs	git
about 40 minutes ago i committed a particularly complicated change involving several file renames mergers and deletes from git into cvs using git-cvsexportcommit

683091
cvs	git
however the changes are not appearing when i run git-cvsimport to update my git mirror of the cvs repository

683091
cvs	git
i know that git-cvsimport delays importing very new changes to try to avoid making a git commit out of a multi-file cvs commit that isn t completed yet but i m pretty sure that delay is only ten minutes

683095
versioning	upgrade
this file contains one or more xsl transformations that upgrade documents targeting earlier schema versioning

683098
triggers	insert
how do i prevent it from triggers the edit event while i m trying to insert

683111
pointers	stack
1 the function is returning a pointers to stack

683132
click	mouse
question is how do i show a menu when the mouse is right click

683133
xsd	xml
i ve been working with a lot of semi-complicated xsd s lately and am wondering what are some of the better tools for working with xml schema

683141
xsd	xml
liquid technologies xml xsd editor

683150
protected	public
well now foo can t be protected so it s public

683158
variables	boolean
my understanding is that volatile prevents code memory optimizations from moving the accesses to my result variables and the completed boolean such that the the thread that reads the result will see upt-to-date data

683158
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
autoresetevent manualresetevent

683162
directory	folder
if this doesn t work you have to install iis and set a virtual directory directly on your development folder

683168
sql-server	ms-access
i have several ms-access queries in views and stored procedures that i am converting to sql-server 2000 t-sql

683180
defined	declare
in the main.c module the arrays is defined and declare

683204
stringbuilder	stringwriter
if you really want to write into memory pass in a stringwriter or a stringbuilder like this

683206
any	set
any other value indicates that three is more than one set of distinct-values in the table

683215
versioning	upgrade
how do you upgrade the default for an up-to-date versioning

683243
environment	building
when you are using team foundation building to building a project for multiple environments do you do one building for all environments or keep a separate building scripting for each environment

683243
environment	building
one caveat might be that we might want the building to be automatically copy-paste to the server for one environment and not the other

683248
any	set
but this is easily set by any application to mimic a browser you re not guaranteed that this is going to work

683255
deployment	install
i am currently making changes to my company s enterprise library and i am looking into creating a deployment project that will allows developer to set up the library through the msi install or some type of set up executable

683260
background-color	transparency
be sure to set background-color to transparency on each of them

683306
python	ruby
other programming languages such as python and ruby may allow this i don t know for sure but i know they can add methods at runtime

683311
methods	extend
one option to look at is to extend the page class using extension methods

683362
getter	setter
setter and getter are forbidden

683362
.when	ready
.when you re ready - checkout list comprehensions generators and lambda functions

683368
tcp-ip	tcp
to open a socket the client s tcp-ip stack sends a tcp syn packet to the server

683382
perl	php
this will be the case in any engine that supports perl-style regular expressions including perl s php etc.

683388
expression	brackets
a brackets expression is a list of

683405
dynamic-cast	base-class
you need to use an extension methods with a dynamic-cast if the base-class you re working with doesn t have a visit methods

683419
webforms	asp.net
we had a classic asp app and wanted to move it to asp.net using webforms

683440
hide	show
setting the class to twocolumn hide the middle column and setting the class to threecolumn show the middle column

683444
abstract	sealed
if whatever assembly you are referencing were designed well then all the types members that you might ever want to access would be marked appropiately abstract virtual sealed but indeed this is unfortunately not the case sometimes you can even experienced this issue with the base-class library

683472
lookup	any
not that i am familiar with c# but typically any type of crawling of a graph for some sort of processing will require a lookup table to stop processing an object due to cyclic references

683473
dictionary	hashmap
its not an elegant solution for sure but it isn t uncommon to use a dictionary or hashmap

683500
python	java
it is not as safe to do this as it would be in objective-c python or java

683524
linkedhashmap	treemap
i suggest a linkedhashmap or a treemap

683524
linkedhashmap	treemap
a linkedhashmap keeps the keys in the order they were inserted while a treemap is kept sorted via a comparator or the natural comparable ordering of the elements

683524
linkedhashmap	treemap
treemap has o log n performance for containskey get put and remove according to the javadocs while linkedhashmap is o 1 for each

683528
show	next
in a different php page i want to be able to delete this record and show the next one in the list

683534
selected	button
document.aye whichthing will provide you direct access to the selected value but document.aye.whichthing gets you access to the collection of radio button which you then need to check

683538
xml-serialization	xml
another alternative is xml whether using .net s built-in xml-serialization or not

683549
order	join
i don t want to do all those join and i also don t want to store the user id everywhere in order to limit the number of join

683552
checkbox	textbox
put the textbox and checkbox in seperate update panels

683552
callback	methods
this is easy with the jquery get methods or client callback

683569
pointers	stack
if it s ansi c then there s no such thing as a reference so you might want to rephrase your question to talk about pointers to heap allocated or pointers to stack allocated objects

683577
button	popup
the windows is popup initiated through a button click on the parent page

683582
stderr	stdout
you are accumulating open file handles see ulimit -n setrlimit rlimit_nofile rlimit_ofile and you ultimately hit a 2048 open file descriptors limit 2045 + stdin + stdout + stderr .

683610
stderr	stdout
this will increase the number of files each process can have open to 10003 remember that you always start with three open stdin stdout and stderr

683614
linkbutton	onclick
why do asp.net linkbutton controls with onclientclick attributes and disabled by setting still render onclick event handler in html while button controls don t

683627
value	field
voidedindicator is a nullable bit field so it can have the following value null 0 or 1

683627
where-clause	sql
when a sql statement is created with a where-clause such as voidedindicator 1 we only get records returned that have voidedindicator 0 but we were expecting both voidedindicator 0 and voidedindicator is null

683642
wxpython	gtk
check pyqt gtk or wxpython libraries

683642
gedit	kate
notepad++ idle kate gedit ..

683682
rich-internet-application	ria
pyjs is a rich-internet-application ria development platform for both web and desktop

683698
formatting	printing
it s simply not very good at keeping the formatting and doesn t provide really good-looking printing

683716
revision	updates
i understand that due to the nature of externals a single updates couldn t work with a revision number but why doesn t it work with a date

683734
driver	kernel
it makes possibly not too much sense because the kernel has to start a jvm to execute the driver

683740
stderr	stdout
also the allocconsole attachconsole methods are funny in that if you run your program from the command-line or a batch file and try to redirect the output stdout and or stderr to a file it wil not work - it will not go to the file

683767
constructor	object
the only thing i would change in noldorin s code is the fact that the constructor should receive an instance of the object you are decorating

683774
raw-sockets	packets
you can t have a single sendto generate more than one packets you would have to iterate over all interfaces and either use raw-sockets or bind the socket to a device using setsockopt ... sol_socket so_bindtodevice ethx to send each packets bypassing the os router table this requires root privileges

683788
instances	private
absolutely - my company hosts a public open source svn repository and our private repository on an amazon-ec2 instances

683788
svnadmin	dump
we store the repository data on an elastic block store volume for resilience svnsync the repositories to another ec2 instances and ebs volume so that we can quickly bring up a new svn server if the main one goes down and also do an offsite backup via svnadmin dump to one of our physical servers just in case the whole cloud goes offline hey our source code is our crown jewels after all

683802
contains	elements
testarray contains 8 elements

683804
revision	updates
the revision date etc you re updating the main wc to does not get passed through to the externals when they are being updates

683813
asp.net-mvc	webforms
does anybody know of a scoring system of questions that would aid in choosing between a webforms and asp.net-mvc application at the start of a project

683813
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if yes score 1 for asp.net-mvc and 0 for webforms

683823
webforms	asp.net
you could also strip the web form part of asp.net and just use non-server-form web controls while you d do it in a standard webforms project i can hardly call this style asp.net webforms

683845
asp.net-mvc	webforms
usually the decision to use webforms or asp.net-mvc boils down to controls

683848
arrays	loops
another bug inside your loops was that you were looking at the first member of the arrays and adding i to that value rather than incrementing the pointer by i

683854
realloc	malloc
c implementations discussed in the context of character arrays as c dynamic string-length used malloc realloc and free but these should be avoided in c++ code

683856
arrays	loops
this is not to say that you can t use a similar convention for other types but it s rather unusual and for good reasons in particular relying on a terminator symbol requires you to loops through an arrays to find its size

683858
textbox	button
hey i m having problems creating a simple button for a programme which finds the largest word in an arrays and puts it into a textbox

683863
entity-framework	ado.net
when i try to populate the listview with a linq-to-entities queried collection of ado.net entity-framework objects i get the following exception

683865
web-services	security
i ve been doing a lot of studying and work recently related to wcf web-services and distributed computing in general but most of the security concepts go over my head

683866
put	get
- when the user click on the bookmarklet it will send to my server the url then my server will get back to the client page with the scrapping javascript files which will load with the iframe load the javascript will scrap the data on the current page and put on the iframe

683867
arrays	loops
loops through all the values in the arrays perhaps with a for or for each loops

683867
arrays	loops
when the loops finishes the will be the longest value in the arrays

683867
for-loop	loops
you can use msdn as a reference on how to use a for-loops or a for each loops if you haven t learned for-loopss yet you can also use a do loops

683867
if-statement	loops
your if-statement needs to be inside of some sort of loops for for each do etc i think this is the key concept that you are missing

683884
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you have a large team that aren t going to pick up asp.net-mvc quickly but are comfortable with webforms i d stick with webforms

683884
asp.net-mvc	webforms
there isn t a whole lot of 3rd party control support for asp.net-mvc however there is a ton of support for webforms

683884
asp.net-mvc	webforms
getting a nice grid in webforms is simple however you ll be writing a lot of your own code in asp.net-mvc to solve that problem

683888
if-statement	loops
what you are missing is a loops that checks each member and putting the if-statement inside it and make it compare the length of the name to the longest name that you have found so far

683899
user-controls	ascx
namely if we donâ t use code behind class then ascx class will derive directly from user-controls class

683908
placeholder	required
the .net built-in serialization is an option but it does required you to add placeholder on the specific pieces that you want to extend in the future

683908
attributes	properties
by adding the above in the involved classes you can effectively read a information saved that has extra elements attributes modify the normal properties that the software knows how to handle and save it

683909
javascript	dom
it s relatively easy to parse through the dom with javascript

683917
jface	swt
implemented in java gui is made with jface and swt

683920
silverlight	wpf
no you can not embed out-of-browser silverlight into wpf

683921
classname	inherited
first of all you can write everything including c# code in a single .ascx file and inherited from whatever class you want to that ultimately inheriteded from user-controls by specifying inheriteded attributes or you might want to omit it and without a classname attributes

683923
hide	show
anyhow you probably don t want to do a show hide widget like this

683930
realloc	free
if the address of a local variables is passed to realloc it may attempt to free its memory and allocate it elsewhere

683942
defined	declare
it seems like foo.h isn t getting include because moo.h can t find anything defined declare in it

683944
double	int
i created a subroutine one using a double float it returns 2 int values

683946
asp.net-mvc	webforms
once this has been agreed by the stake holders develop a prototype system to test your assumptions with where you can try out c# vrs vb.net or asp.net-mvc vrs webforms

683970
put	get
if you put the point on the first line and hit m-q you get this

683984
revision	svn
when using svn externals it is generally a bad idea to use an external without a revision number

683984
revision	updates
i know this the hard way from trying to track down some history in a project that contained externals and i would have to guess which revision corresponded to the revision in the containing project sometimes it was earlier because someone had updates the external project and then updates the containing project sometimes it was later because someone had edited files directly in the external checkout and then committed it

683984
revision	svn
it does mean a little more work as you have to update the revision number in the svn externals property every time we wrote a script to do it automatically but in the long run it is a much better solution

683995
having	select
i m having trouble getting a linq compound select to compile

684000
attributes	properties
ships then use the effectstack to determine the actual result of the effects on them by adding modifiers to their existing attributes and properties

684005
contains	any
this will break badly if any of your patterns contains the or operator

684006
perl	php
if you want to use commandline grep or a perl ruby python php one-liner any other tool you can filter the current buffer s text through that tool and update the buffer to reflect the results

684017
command-line	cmd
you executed two cmd in a single command-line

684043
command-line	cmd
that means that it executes the cmd in the file as if you had run them from the command-line right in the current file

684043
shell	bash
but if you source a bash script into the current shell then it does change the value

684055
contains	any
they re in the build order but they re not dependencies and they aren t dependencies of any contains project

684079
sql-server	mysql
a solution that i ve seen work for something like this technically we were connecting to a sql-server database in c# but having used the mysql connector briefly i believe they work mostly the same what we had was a single location where the connection was created and opened

684097
groovy	java
there are a couple of more groovy ways to do what you re asking though if you don t want to use stringutils in the java idiomatic way as vladimir suggests

684105
value	field
the value of the table_id field could be customer vendor contact and whatever other tables would link to the addresses table

684106
numeric	zero
they all have a numeric id called document number but they weren t assign sequentially for reasons that no longer apply meaning from now on when my web site records a new record it needs to assign it the smallest possible document number greater than zero that has not already been taken

684107
arrays	map
if it s a tile based map like at civilization or it s displayed as pixmap you could save the ownership of each tile pixel in a two-dimensional arrays

684133
managed-code	unmanaged
following the example calling managed-code from unmanaged-code and vice-versa i wrote a managed wrapper in c++ to access the unmanages class in the unmanaged c++ dll

684183
callback	methods
it simply defines an externalinterface callback listening to a methods call named flashlog that will handled by the private methods setmessage ...params

684199
void	main
the error is actually in the following line at the for-loop your code needs to be contains in a function of some sort most likely int main void

684201
any	set
if i have a text and href on the navitem and ensurechildcontrols is called when either of them are set then how will the other s value be placed into any sub control

684202
getter	setter
you can automate the generation of javadoc comments for getter setter from eclipse via the code templates to save on the amount of documentation you have to write

684219
webserver	host
using a jetty webserver started from maven which includes ibatis spring jersey a little of this and a little of that i get logging output with a host of formats

684220
firefox	opera
tested on safari firefox and opera osx

684225
export	csv
then use something like phpmyadmin to export the data from the view as csv

684233
parentheses	braces
avoid extraneous whitespace immediately inside parentheses brackets or braces

684250
default	reset
however from an asp.net website using the reportviewer component the parameters are reset to the default each time you choose view report

684257
constructor	object
the concrete dao instance respects this but the constructor of these seperate worker components want the implementation of their seperate interfaces and i desire castle.windsor to pass the same object instance through to these worker containers via the respective service requests

684288
hashmap	arrays
try adding that to your arrays it ll probably considering it an arrays instead of hashmap

684290
silverlight	wpf
this was actually a bug with the charting controls that only manifested itself on the wpf side works fine in silverlight

684331
swing	awt
jfc swing architecture is different from awt architecture

684331
swing	swt
there are several differences but the most significant is awt uses native code to render widgets so does swt while swing is light weight because all the is painted using java

684337
background-color	transparency
use the format that loses the transparency and set the transparency key to that background-color

684352
any	set
how can i avoid having to set any environment variables

684358
constructor	object
i m not sure if i m understanding the whole scope of this but this seems like you should be able to create some object that represents the shared properties of the different types of graphs and expose that object as a property of the abstract creator accessible by the concrete creators and maybe even passed as a parameter to the individual xmlfactory constructor

684358
implements	abstract
you have properties implements on the abstract creator but you said you also duplicates these properties in the factory

684358
base-class	inherited
i don t see why -- you are referring to base.caption so why would you need to duplicates anything in fusiongraphs if it s all inherited from graphcreator and you re using the base-class implementation of it

684380
having	select
this saves you from having to do a select before doing the insert greatly simplifying your code

684410
any	set
we give each developer their own git repository and have the buildbot set to build any time pushes to one of those repositories

684421
textbox	button
i go to an edit mode of the textbox and change the content and hit a save button

684425
put	get
the problem is that the list doesn t get ordered and the distance methods doesn t get fired i put a breakpoint in there but doesn t get hit

684427
any	set
if you re in an iframe any cookies you set are â œthird-party cookiesâ

684432
json	xml
besides that the pattern of twitter facebook or any of the more successful public api s is a custom data structure in json and or xml and not wrapped in a soap envelope though i could be wrong...this is just my impression

684438
button	popup
i would like to add a button which popup when selected text is right clicked

684438
selected	button
currently the user has to selected the text and then click a button on a custom control

684438
button	popup
it would be a lot easier if after selecting the text s he could right click it and press the relevant button in the popup

684443
contains	set
i currently have a file contains a set of primary keys approx

684449
configuration	environment
so i need some help in getting started with the configuration and development environment setup so that all developers from multiple platforms can develop easily

684456
emacs	vim
i was using vim so there may be other dependencies gotchas that are emacs specific but i m pretty sure a terminal that supports 256 colours is important

684483
g++	gcc
gcc g++ is indeed the compiler of choice

684483
build-system	autotools
the most widely adopted build-system is autotools

684497
checkbox	button
if the user clicks the button i must recolect the checkbox selected inside the checklistbox and do some processing

684515
json	xml
according to google trends xml has a x43 lead but is declining - while json grows

684515
json	xml
edited will json replace xml as a data format

684515
json	xml
xml being based on sgml is better than json as a document format

684515
json	xml
xml has an established ecosystem that json lacks especially ways of defining formats xml schema and transforming them xslt

684522
expression	brackets
the square brackets in the regular expression make sure that this command does not find itself in the process listing

684523
ado	jet
i believe that michael kaplan reported that the jet ado oledb provider was thread-safe while dao is not

684528
json	xml
i think json has already largely replaced xml for client-side communications with a web server but that will likely be the extent of its dominance

684537
put	get
put the grid and a get string rowname string colname methods in a class if you want a cleaner api

684538
installation	uninstall
my goal is to create a lightweight and possibly portable installation package that could encapsulate the data and provide users with quick install uninstall procedure

684540
32-bit	16-bit
our new 32-bit software won t be ready for 3 years so unless someone knows where we can buy lots of win98 retail boxes i m stuck trying to figure out how to get 16-bit software with direct system access to run in 2000 xp

684544
swing	awt
i suggest looking at swingtimer set a swing timer to notify you every few ms and that notification will come in on the awt thread so that you can use it to click your button then just exit and wait for the next timer event

684573
base-class	subclass
you cannot convert a base-class into a subclass

684578
constructor	object
or you need a constructor for accountxtra that takes an account object and makes a new derived-class version of it

684578
derived-class	base-class
explanation you can t cast a base-class to a derived-class unless it is of the derived-class type

684583
compact-framework	.net
i want to write unit tests for an app running on windows ce .net compact-framework 3.5

684584
lookup	any
if your clients are connecting directly to the site and not going though any sort of nat or proxy then you could do a lookup on it here is a pretty good article on getting the mac-address

684590
archive	backup
i have copies of all datafile all backup sets all redo log files with all archive logs on different media

684607
compact-framework	.net
unit testing .net compact-framework applications with visual studio 2008

684608
shell	bash
unfortunately for you the rest of the world has moved on and prefers to use any number of alternative shell heck even bash on cygwin or as chris suggested to use another language instead

684608
perl	ruby
ruby python and perl are good choices

684611
windows-xp	windows
customers licensed for use of windows vista enterprise are licensed for windows vista business and it can be downgraded to the windows-xp professional windows 2000 professional windows ntâ 4.0 windows nt 3.51 windows 98 or windows 95 operating system

684625
push	pull
i added logging into the functions used for push pull operations during transfer - they are not ever called for any of the calls that fail this way

684629
python	ruby
i need to do a fairly extensive project involving web scraping and am considering using hpricot or beautiful soup ruby or python

684630
compact-framework	.net
sql-server compact edition is the smart choice for .net compact-framework

684632
hashmap	arrays
hashmap for example uses an arrays of buckets and the buckets can overflow using a linked list

684642
default-value	arguments
also remove the default-value for sep or re-order the arguments since you cannot have a default argument in the middle of the argument list with non-defaults following

684647
deployment	install
if i understand the question correctly let me describe your scenario the clickonce app will be install for all users and therefore must initially be run through a deployment mechanism that has admin privileges in order to write keys to hklm

684649
xml-serialization	xml
for the simplest cases you could just use an xml file with a list of elements one element per user and you can use xml-serialization to slurp it in and save it

684656
binary	hex
it is actually stored as 0x000f in hex which is the same as 0000 0000 0000 1111 in binary

684656
value	field
rather than store a boolean field for each one of those value you could store just a single bit for each one

684657
integer	numeric
| is a bitwise or operator numeric integer

684661
boolean	double
the double pipe || is a logical or operator that takes two boolean values and results in a third

684677
buffering	streaming
i want to buffering the video and streaming it on user s browser don t want him to wait and download the whole video before playing

684678
remote-desktop	rdp
the game is streamed from a monster server via internet just like a hifi terminal session rdp remote-desktop but with hd graphics

684680
constructor	object
you can override this by passing in a comparison functor to the constructor of the container which allows you to decouple the sorting ordering from the container object

684694
environment	building
for cross-platform building environment this may depend on what toolkit you use

684694
freebsd	linux
get your code to compile on linux on freebsd and on windows

684710
backgroundworker	winforms
for winforms apps consider using the backgroundworker instead of using a thread or the threadpool

684718
contains	elements
there are maybe a few exceptions-- certain classes such as biginteger and collections calculate their hash code every time by cycling through every single elements they contains which is pretty spurious in some cases-- but how often do you key on instances of those classes

684735
hash	md5
in other words there is a technique for constructing multiple byte sequences with the same md5 hash without having to use the brute force methods of trial and error where on average you d expect to have to try about 2 64 or 16 billion billion files before hitting on a collision

684735
hash	md5
if you re not concerned about the case where somebody might deliberately try to fool your duplicate identification and you re just worried about the chances of a duplicate hash by chance then md5 is absolutely fine

684744
expression	evaluation
for any two expression a and b evaluation to boolean a || b and a | b do almost the same thing

684745
value	field
how do i write a validation that checks the value of this field

684752
tokenize	parsing
the man page for token_get_all and googleing for creative combinations of tokenize token_get_all and the parsing token names might help

684754
value	field
i want t0 delete a row with minimum value of a particular field from a table if number of records less than 5

684756
show	next
i m watching a tv show on hulu.com which is btw the absolute best streaming-video site around and whether i close my browser disconnect from the internet and even if i restart my computer in the middle of watching a show the next time i go to their site i can resume the tv from exactly the time where i left off in the show

684760
push	pull
ssh+ease of pull push in windows

684769
compatibility	licensing
fckeditor was the only other editor i felt had the same features and browser compatibility but it didn t look like it was going to be any easier in terms of integration into my caching scheme which sounds similar to yours and i think the licensing made it a non-choice for me

684789
logical-operators	operands
when used with boolean operands the | operators is a logical-operators just as || but the difference is that the || operators does short-circuiting evaluation and the | operators does not

684789
expression	evaluation
the result of the expression is always the same for both operatrors but if the evaluation of the second operand causes something else to change that is only guaranteed to happen if you use the | operator

684807
solaris	linux
but for java development i would choose linux windows or solaris

684816
unix	bsd
also the bsd platform is not easiest of the unix family to begin from zero

684816
linux	unix
any unix linux resource you can get your hands on

684838
output	mode
the file has to be opened in output and binary mode using the flags ios out output mode and ios binary binary mode

684838
output	mode
the file is opened in output and binary mode with ios out and ios binary

684838
any	set
this means any new set of data will be append to the end of file

684844
contains	any
if you noticed any vista specific details not contains in the list please send a note to the editors

684882
wait	hang
if you re creating your own threads it makes sense to start them on first use and then let them hang around for a while in case you need them again - you make an idle thread wait on an event so you can reactivate it by signals the event and after a long enough time elapses the thread will wake itself and exit reclaiming the unused resources

684905
configuration	environment
i wanted to have several instances of the same biztalk application running together but with different configuration not just different bindings to simulate different environment but using the same biztalk instance

684923
constructor	object
this is an assembly module often named something like crt0.s that is responsible initializing the initialized data clearing the bss calling constructor for global object if c++ modules with global object are included etc

684923
processor	cpu
in some processor the hardware team might only have connected a chip selected from the cpu to a device and leave it up to you to decide what address triggers that selected pin

684923
binary	hex
but you still need a raw binary image often in a hex format suitable for a prom programmer of some form so you will need to use the objcopy utility from binutil to transform the linker output to a suitable format

684928
doskey	alias
ct stands for cleartool it is an alias unix or a doskey windows versioning of an alias

684932

artinsoft wrote the built in vb.net upgrade wizard this is their improved versioning

684932
vb.net	vb6
and codearchitects was founded by francesco balena who wrote some of the classic books on vb6 and vb.net

684965
firefox	opera
everything seems to work for most of the popular browsers opera firefox safari all work fine

684971
order	add
i guess your may need to add this column to your schema in order for sql-server to recognize it and take in under consideration in his optimizations

684972
google-chrome	firefox
from what i saw in firefox and google-chrome the color of the text cursor in an input field changes to the value of the color css property

684983
keydown	keyup
i m using keyboard events keydown and keyup to detect exactly when the user presses or release the shift key

684998
hosts-file	hosts
strictly speaking it s not possible to do that in the hosts at least on os x

685006
any	set
to get the first frozen or visible column getfirstcolumn must handle bitmasks different way getfirstcolumn could get the first column that matches any of the flags set but this is not the case

685017
selected	button
in the second project choose add existing file selected the file click on the arrow on the add button and selected add as link

685042
triggers	insert
create a regular column + add before insert triggers which will updated it s value with a calculated one on each insert operation

685062

for example there are silverlight applications using ironpython ironruby

685083
arguments	default
we are using an inhouse developed solution that is basicly a procedure with arguments of what you want include in the comparision sp s full sp code table structure default indices triggers

685106
sql-server	oracle
how do i translate this sql-server statement to work on oracle

685124
32-bit	64bit
i am about to port a windows 32-bit application to 64bit but might decide to port the whole thing to linux later

685124
32-bit	64bit
the code contains sections which are dependent on the amount of memory available to the application which depends on whether i m creating a 32 or 64bit build while the ability to compile a 32-bit version of the code should be preserved for backward compatibility

685140
jar	war
make sure you program project is divided into modules under a common umbrella module so that each module produces a single binary artifact jar war ... possibly accompanied by the javadoc of the source code behind that artifact a zip with the source code etc

685140
contains	set
you can do this with mvn idea idea eclipse eclipse if you create a separate maven project file called workspace.xml or whatever in the same directory as parent module set up as a multi-module project contains modules . and .. otherproject only one-way reference here no parent ref back

685153
triggers	insert
you don t need to use triggers for this if you manage the insert

685158
document	element
on each document complete event i run over all the html element and check all frames available i know it can be optimized

685184
c++	lua
in particular my project spans c++ lua and javascript so i d love to be able to unify the i18n with a single tool but i m also not having luck finding gettext good support for lua or javascript are they supported has anybody used gettext with these

take a look at appfuse it s a quick-starter for java web application provided with different frameworks tapestry spring asp.net-mvc struts2 jsf + hibernate hibatis

685226
webforms	asp.net
using asp.net mvc gave nice perf improvement for me but good written webforms app can perform well also

685239
defined	declare
research show that the standard doesn t really defined forwarding declaration nor does it explicit state that enums can or can t be forwarding declare

685239
defined	declare
a class that has been declare but not defined or an arrays of unknown size or of

685239
defined	declare
since the storage size is implementation defined many compilers may just choose to use 32-bit value for the underlying type of every enum at which point it becomes possible to forwarding declare them

685240
put	get
if you re trying to do normal c++ development put as little as you can get away with in the header as it means client code doesn t depend on too many implementation details

685253

i have tried buffering these streaming and also tried using channels from java.nio none of which seems to make any bit of difference to my memory issues

685279
contains	set
say if i have a set of objects contains in set

685291
anonymous-inner-class	local-class
if you don t care if your code stops working at an entirely random point you might want to consider a plain local-class instead or in addition to and anonymous-inner-class

685298
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
i know frameworks like asp.net ruby-on-rails codeigniter etc.

685319

hide	show
and just in case you insist on an answer show a windows with the image in it then hide the windows when you feel the user has waited long enough.

685374
logout	login
i wouldn t use any of the following log on logon login logout

685374
registration	login
sign up for registration link is also a good option but it does t look good near sign in you should use it wether with login or seporatly

685384
hashtable	set
there s the hashset which is designed for set operations and the keyedcollection which is an easily serialization hashtable

685412
gtk	x11
are you using gtk with the x11 or quartz backend

685414

685421
macports	fink
build your own python or use fink or macports if you want completion

685422
versioning	upgrade
and did you try to upgrade to the latest versioning of git

685432
firefox	safari
all is well in firefox pc mac but safari pc mac and 3 versions of ie 6 7 8 are not playing ball - please read on.

685432
hide	show
i m using simple jquery show and hide and the first content is set to show as default

685442
boolean	int
in c# like in java i think boolean and numbers are two different things you can only use boolean in if-statement there is not implicit conversion if you use an int it won t compile

685451
specifications	w3c
according to the w3c xpath 1.0 specifications there is functions support in xpath 1.0 but with a rather limited set of available functions

685485
command-line	cmd
well obviously cc.net does not think there are any modifications so one thing you could do is from the cmd-line issue the svn log cmd that cc.net does

685493
silverlight	wpf
the applications generated by pb12 will be modern looking using wpf and later silverlight for post pb12 so i am quite excited

685497
debugging	trace
then either you will get full source code for debugging or at least a complete stack trace

685522
instances	private
personally i prefer using a static private methods to non-static as long as it does not require access to any instances fields

685526
inlining	inline
but if draw_line et al are defined in a header file rather than in a source cpp file you may have methods which are supposedly declared as inline in the header file which aren t actually properly inlining

685529
radio	click
i want to use jquery to detect click on a bunch of radio button

685532
binary-tree	tree
i need to find an algorithm for generating every possible permutation of a binary-tree and need to do so without using lists this is because the tree itself carries semantics and restraints that cannot be translated into lists

685539
alpha	rgba
you re using alpha as if it was the last entry rgba not argb use it as such in the creation of your context or adapt the alphaatx code

685555
radio	click
click on the radios show the alert box with the radio s id

685591
dataview	datarow
use dataview and selected wherever you find yourself looping through datarow objects

685592
instances	private
private or public doesn t make a difference - static-methods are ok but if you find you re using them all the time and of course instances methods that don t access any instances fields are basically static-methods for this purpose then you probably need to rethink the design

685595
configuration	installation
installation folders are typically stored in many places such as configuration files and the registry

685596
libcurl	curb
- curb libcurl for ruby

685598

malloc	free
does stack allocation call malloc free functions implicitly

685612
.when	ready
all user-interface objects in flex broadcast a creationcomplete event that lets you know .when everything is done and it is ready to go

685614
malloc	free
no stack allocation does not call malloc free

685614
pointers	stack
on entry to each function stack pointers is advanced sufficiently to allow space on stack for a stack frame which will be where your stack allocated variables reside

685615
instances	private
a private static methods by itself does not violate oop per se but when you have a lot of these methodss on a class that don t need and cannot access instances fields you are not programming in an oo way because object implies state + operations on that state defined together

685616
malloc	free
stack allocation doesn t use anything like malloc free

685617
value	field
if you have multiple constructor you might want to initialize a field to different value

685617
superclass	inherited
this may seem trivial with a single class but not so much when you have an inherited hierarchy with constructor code running at each level and accessing superclass fields

685623
value	field
the most important thing is really the ease of form design and field correlation ex two list boxes where the values of the second depends of the selected value of the first - i know most ajax libs have some support for this but i would like it out of the box

685624
alloca	free
a well-done alloca will only require a scant few instructions and there is no cost or even a need to free it when you re done

685627
testdriven.net	gallio
buy yourself a testdriven.net license - i think it is a must for gallio unit tests since resharper test runner doesn t know how to run certain tests + gallio has one of its test runners targeted for td.net

685632
constructor	object
2 with c# 3.0 i typically use automatic properties and inline initialization with a parameterless constructor to instantiate the object

685635
sql-server	oracle
for example if i have a sql-server db on one machine that stores all my customers and i have an oracle on a different machine that stores all my orders is it possible to wrap this in an entity and then use the entity in a linq expression as if they were together

685653
malloc	free
so stack allocation doesn t malloc free

685653
constructor	object
automatic object in c++ call the constructor and destructor but not new or delete as new and delete also have the code to manage dynamic memory

685657
reliability	scalability
we will developing something which performance and scalability is of more importance than reliability of codes

685658
stderr	stdout
likely that you just need to read the stdout and stderr of the process or it will hang since its output buffering is full

685658
stderr	stdout
this is easiest if you redirect stderr to stdout just to be safe

685671
contains	any
specifically i d like to be able to take the original list and produce a new list contains any repeated items

685680
naming-conventions	getter
keywords are in english naming-conventions like for example getter setters are also english same for standard names for design-patterns

685702
rewrite	rule
one possible workaround --- i m not sure i d call it a solution --- would be to make a rewrite rule in iis 7 or with a rewriter for iis 6 to put the slash back in for you

685706
development-environment	administration
since i do not like non-english languages in my development-environment i made a local administration quite angry when i refused that my pc be install with german windows german office and german visual-studio

685708
methods	extend
one other thing linq has connection to this problem as a function returning iqueryable can defer query execution you can previously define a query and in another part of the code one can extend the returned queryable based on the user s condition which then can be sticked with extension methods

685726
instances	self
it creates object instances which is then passed to __init__ as first parameter usually named self along with all the rest of __new__ s parameters

685736
having	select
having said that if you re looking for power and flexibilty i d select zend

685790
web-testing	selenium
if you do not want to mock out the httpcontext and friends then i would suggest an automated web-testing framework such as selenium or nunitasp

685796
constructor	object
i always like to think of the class as a factory for object and the constructor as the final stop on the production line

685796
constructor	object
also in some languages the constructor may be used for resetting an object to an original state which is why it will then be necessary to instatiate the object in the constructor

685798
switching	screens
it applies only when applications go to full screens and then switching back to windows or terminate

685798
switching	screens
so it does not seem to be related to resolution switching because i ve seen application games that even when they are not in the same resolution as desktop when they switching back windows on desktop are restored as they once were before the full screens application was run

685800
malloc	free
and it would make sense for those whole-stack blocks to be allocated using the same heap management as is exposed through malloc free

685800
malloc	free
a whole stack is malloc -ed all in one go when a thread starts up and then it gets suballocated from and then it gets free -d in one go

685801
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari if your stylesheet link is busted all of your links might end up red

685847
combinations	permutation
there are 40320 permutation of 8 leaves and only 32768 possible combinations of 15 bits

685850
sql-server	oracle
now i can understand that this is because of the semicolon between the statements i tried this on sql-server and it worked but in oracle no luck so far

685859
web-applications	enterprise
polling servers seems to be a theme that comes up for certain types of enterprise applications particularly social networking web-applications

685878
stress-testing	jmeter
i think for stress-testing you want to use jmeter and simulate the server calls from the flash application

685883
click	mouse
sliding the mouse over a bunch of them means i have to wait for the rollover effect to go through them all which takes a while until it gets to the one i ve actually stopped on but surely that was what you wanted given that you re using hover rather than click which would certainly remove any speed issues

685887
constructor	object
if a new object needs to be tostring d you just add another constructor

685921
sql-server	oracle
if your primary key is an always-increasing field a sql-server identity or generated from a sequence in oracle then the clustered primary key has no drawbacks anyway

685926
hash	md5
one way hash with md5 or sha1 are a way of adding a layer of security at the db level

685934
malloc	free
i would think it would be difficult for .net to free considering in c++ you need to know if it was allocated with new malloc mm_malloc before you can correctly free it

685949
webserver	security
for a website to open an exe on a different machine and permit that to run and get access to the files contained on the webserver would require a horrifically low level of security that would mean the entire system is practically completely open to attack

685950
json	xml
and to answer the other part of your question i ve found that using json results in a far smaller payload than xml while still having decent support within wcf

685966
any	set
in firefox for example you can go to tools - options - privacy and there is an option that says always clear my private data when i exit firefox. if you have this set any cookies you have will be deleted when you close your browser

685970
attributes	properties
there s are several properties of the column attributes that fire off that selected after the insert

685970
value	field
isversion which means the field will be auto-updated every time you update insert a record and linq will also fetch the actual value after updating inserting resulting in the behaviour you describe

685970
reflection	runtime
i m also not sure whether linq stuff is done at runtime through reflection or at compile time

685970
reflection	runtime
if the magic is done at runtime you may be able to remove the attributes with reflection and add it back maybe i don t really know

685979
authentication	login
but i added querystring params to this login page we also own this site and if sso true and you are authentication you are redirected to.

685990
put	get
it is only going to work with the data that you get from it meaning you should optimize your sql or the data put into it before sending it off to sql meaning you should optimize your application code

686012
cursor	row
i ve got this little snippet that i use for row highlighting on an xslt page that has to use an onclick event to postback some data but because the row isn t a link i have to make sure there s a hand cursor as well as the row being highlighted so the users understand it s clickable and what row they re on

686013
ip-address	proxy
with this methods though you may run into some proxy issues ie multiple users from the same corporate network may all come from a single ip-address so they only count as one user in your totals but that should be minimal

686014
contains	elements
i ve just checked that with firefox on windows and the p elements are contains as they should be and not outside the div

686015
margins	padding
adjoining margins no padding or

686015
margins	padding
the rationale behind this might be that if you set a vertical margins on something you just want to ensure that there is at least this much spaces left between the border or padding of this element and the border or padding of the next element two paragraphs

686015
contains	set
if you want the margin to be contains in the div making the div expand you need to set some padding or border at the top and bottom of the div

686034
exception-handling	try-catch
this is a situation that could easily happen again so it may be worth putting a try-catch block around that individual line or using a catch on the specific exception-handling it is generating

686043
entity-framework	ado.net
when i create an ado.net entity-framework entity model of that database a has a navigation property to b which has multiplicity 0..1

686053
google-chrome	firefox
i ve searched and found methods to focus and position my caret at the end of the updated input content and google-chrome and ie behave themselves and auto scroll to show the cursor in the visible area of the input box but when the text input is full and overflows firefox 3.0.7 leaves the correctly positioned caret out of view to the right though if you press right arrow on keyboard you can get to it without disturbing the position

686063
selected	button
and i d like to allow the user to selected which view to use via radio button

686073
http	ssl
how do i ensure that my users can not physically type in http to bypass my ssl and ensure that every page is https

686083
youtube	flickr
for pulling only items which match a tag that depends on the site owner enabling this ability flickr and youtube

686093
protected	public
if it s protected or public both work

686099
any	set
this way can you set or reset the selecteditem at any time and the control will update the selecteditem based on the object

686099
any	set
for instance you could set in a handler for the initialize event or creationcomplete event or in any other function

686109
silverlight	wpf
consider microsoft s patterns and practices composite application guidance for wpf and silverlight

686138
innodb	myisam
for instance myisam is widely held to be faster at selected than innodb

686138
innodb	myisam
it s better on writes than myisam and also innodb never needs to be repaired.

686166
any	set
set the value to and the expiry date to yesterday or any date in the past

686180
any	set
it sounds like whatever you are applying it to doesn t have any specific bindings set for itself so it is just inheriting its parents value which ends up being your viewmodel instance

686181
any	set
it s quite the same like with any other java process you want to debugging remotely you have to set up some arguments for the vm and then connect to the given port

686193
value	field
i don t fully understand your entity setup but if b has a primary key that include both the id value and any other field or no primary key relationship at all then the relation is correct as entity-framework display it

686213
dialog	pop-up
i have an application which has an asynchronous operation built into it that loops over a large number of items and performs lengthy calculations on each item as this occurs certain conditions will cause the application to pop-up a modal dialog for user input

686213
windows-xp	windows
the application is c# .net 3.5 with windows forms running on windows-xp by the way

686225
conditional	operators
with c# you can use the conditional operators

686257
checkbox	button
alternatively you would have to create a button or checkbox that the user selects

686265
swt	rcp
tutorials and book i ve seen always pack rcp swt design into views inside perspective within single application windows

686273
randomaccessfile	filereader
using filereader or fileinputstream won t work - you ll have to use either filechannel or randomaccessfile to loop through the file backwards from the end

686277
user-interface	flicker
the game area is fine but the user-interface area is constantly flicker with what seems like old buffer data

686281
sql-server	oracle
my product needs to support oracle sql-server and db2 v9

686290
superclass	inherited
now borrowing constructor is only another pattern to make a sort of inherited so i could not use prototype and so all the chain superclass properties are

686296
unsigned	integer
i m just wondering how to reliably generate this data and make sure i m sending it correctly that i m really sending an unsigned byte rather than say a signed integer or worse a string

686332
directory	folder
to make it accessible on the network all you have to do is go to iisâ create new virtual directoryâ point to the above folder and remove anonymous access from directory settings page

686351
webforms	asp.net
i m just beinning basic data driven asp.net webforms design

686355
delphi	c++
i want to invoke dllimport wsaasyncselect from winapi and use it much like i use it in delphi c++

686358
continuous-integration	teamcity
we are using svn and were considering using teamcity or cruisecontrol.net for continuous-integration server for our .net projects which have msunit tests

686371
mousedown	mouseup
mouseup will fire when the button is release but is there a better way than to have some sort of timer that triggers periodically between mousedown and mouseup

686386
order	add
you need to add primary key to the order by clause like this

686386
order	add
if you want clear and sane code just add the article_no into order by and enjoy the query i posted first

686402
.when	ready
so i don t know what was happening but it was some sort of race and once i picked a single mechanism for doing things .when the dom was ready everything is working fine

686410
hash	md5
just take the first 8 digits of the md5 hash

686410
hash	md5
this works because md5 is uniformly distributed over its hash address space

686410
hash	md5
this means that any consecutive sequence of md5 hash digits will itself be a uniformly distributed hash

686417
implements	final
since a final methods is only implements in the declaring class there is no need to dynamically dispatch a call to a final methods and static invocation can be used instead

686421
superclass	subclass
do i subclass the domain classes with composite keys adapting them so that nh can use a surrogate key but my domain is none-the-wiser seeing only the superclass

686437
conditional	operators
essentially these operators allow an instance of a type to be used in boolean conditional logic such as and ||

686442
base-class	inherited
via use of the clone function it s now possible to let the prototype object of the child class inherited from the prototype object of the base-class

686452
.net	wcf
edit1 i apologize for anyone who i might have confused what i was looking for was a way to call wcf service from client s where no .net framework is installed so using .net-based helper library is not an option it must be pure unmanaged c++

686454
decimal-point	digits
larger numbers will have larger distance between floating-point representations and will thus have fewer digits of precision following the decimal-point

686458
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu fix this by defining the normal actions the average user would expect in the global etc zsh zshrc file

686458
ubuntu	debian
following the relevant code it is the same on debian and ubuntu

686458
ubuntu	debian
so if you are connecting to a debian or ubuntu box you don t have to do anything

686458
ubuntu	debian
the solution is of course to add the lines from the debian ubuntu zshrc to your own .zshrc

686458
freebsd	linux
i can set my terminal type to linux in putty and connect to freebsd servers without problems

686459
postback	ajax
it does a full postback ajax aside for the moment

686482
protected	public
i have succeeded in accessing all private fields excluding those which are inherited as well as all of the public and protected inherited fields

686486
order	add
given that visual-studio only exposes c# and vb as languages to use to build wpf applications that implies that work needs to be done at the tool level in order to add support for wpf to a language

686487
syntax-error	syntax
also it s not a syntax-error but you shouldn t use the property syntax for things that aren t declared as properties

686490
ruby-on-rails	django
the idea being that flex serves as the presentation framework while the web framework django ruby-on-rails does the database lookups and sends the data to flex to present in the form of xml

686490
python	ruby
however is there ever a situation where flex and python ruby would be combined without a web framework as an intermediary

686526
short	zero
that is the sensor is will read zero and the pulse for a short time as the object passes it

686529
pathgeometry	uielement
is there some way to derive a pathgeometry from a uielement the border in this case

686550
private-members	private
i haven t tried it but you should be able to access the base type private-members through the type.basetype property and recursively accumulate all the private fields through the inheritence hierarchy

686559
cherrypy	web.py
if you want something more light-weight might i suggest cherrypy or web.py

686569
associations	model
the only thing i can come up with is a very activerecord style of model a class for each table and the obvious associations

686594
expression	evaluation
your expression is currently evaluation to see if runtimetype is an instance of runtimetype which it isn t

686595
document-ready	.when
action link .when clickon calls controllers action to return partialview the javascript called on the onsuccess fires but nothing else that previously was hooked up by the document-ready function

686604
error-code	hresult
error-code hresult 0x800706ba

686622
checkbox	button
i m designing a website for the high end mobile phones and i want to know how the different user-interface elements button checkbox list boxes textfields etc look like on different mobile browsers eg safari webkit ie etc on different devices nokia iphone etc

686630
value	field
a static field in a generic class will have a separate value for each combination of generic parameters

686633
webforms	asp.net
in my scenario i am using asp.net 3.5 webforms linq to sql and sql-server 2005

686638
arrays	loops
you know how long the direction arrays is it s direction.length if you didn t know so you can just loops through it and print out each letter

686648
value	field
then i am going to update the rest with another value for that id field

686648
value	field
so essentially i want to update half the records somefieldid with one number and the rest with another number splitting the update basically between two value for somefieldid the field i want to update

686651
compact-framework	.net
ive written an application using the .net compact-framework

686657
sql-server	mysql
i know you re asking for sql-server but in mysql you can fetch your column from

686667
switching	screens
when switching back to desktop resolution i would enumwindows again but with a different callback which sets each of the running application windows positioning and size with setwindowpos using the list of rects i ve saved before switching to full screens

686741
select	union
ok so i ve got no idea about sql but someone with knowledge must be able to knock something up with the rather appropriate keywords like select join union like etc

686756
callback	methods
you may add a callback to the show methods

686757
utility	manual
tests that aren t reproducible manual tests are of strictly limited utility

686761
environment	building
this has two benefits 1 machine reuse is easier and more importantly 2 its incredibly easy for a developer to get started - they don t need to install extra libraries or change something in etc or set something in their environment - it just building and runs

686771
display	height
typically has no special style implications other than display block whereas implies a line-break and some non-zero height linked to the current font height

686778
any	set
have you set the passive port range and opened the ports on the server and any intermediate firewall

686780
solaris	linux
if it helps i m running linux and solaris only

686793
user-interface	look-and-feel
this also explains why swing needs all those user-interface components that do the actual painting to mimic a specific look-and-feel windows gtk motif etc.

686805
python	java
for starters i d read python is not java

686825
python	c++
this is especially true in drastically different languages such as going from c++ to python

686825
defined	declare
i find it much faster and space-efficient to just declare and defined it at the same time

686828
python	java
if you re using netbeans for java there s a nice python plugin

686846
text-editor	editor
i m not against using a simple text-editor but i find edit-import-regenerate-test-export-edit is clunkier than simply using the powerbuilder editor

686852
versioning	migrate
rake db migrate down versioning 20090326173033

686852
versioning	migrate
rake db migrate up versioning 20090326173033

686882
frame	width
i want to set the height width of only that frame and i do not want to try and pixelify its children

686882
height	frame
firstly i want a panels that is inside the root frame to take up the 100 height of frame in this case 800px minus that little spaces it takes for painting the frame title

686892
rewrite	rule
i suspect that there is a url rewrite rule under the scene

686896
.net	wcf
i m now toying around with webservices using the .net framework .asmx files not wcf

686900
authentication	login
how to authenticate all depends on how you are currently authentication in your login page

686906
licensing	gpl
the point of the gpl is that the price of licensing it is that you also release your source code for your derivative work under a free software licence

686906
filtering	grouping
according the analysis in the article even if you separate out an interface by which you can communicate with gpl d software on the command line you should do that as a clean room implementation with one grouping that works with the gpl d code one grouping that implements the other software and all specs passing between them being filtering by lawyers

686908
directory	folder
so i am pretty sure this is happening because i put the files into a folder on my server instead of just on my server but i would like to keep my files organized so if anyone knows how to make it work from inside a directory

686950
32-bit	64bit
note that the object arrays size is 528 rather than 1056 because my workstation is 32-bit and the application server is 64bit

686950
deserialization	unmarshalling
in our application s case there is general code in the deserialization code path that interns entity identifiers during unmarshalling i now strongly suspect this is the culprit

686960
webforms	asp.net
i am using webforms c# asp.net

686976
binaries	install
html2ps does a decent job for relatively simple pages and it requires very little in terms of external binaries meaning it s very easy to install use

686981
javascript	dom
you can use jquery or another javascript framework to make working with the dom easier

686997
gridview	listview
return that list to the gridview or listview to display

686997
gridview	listview
this way your listview or gridview won t be tightly coupled to the method that you are retrieving your data

686997
json	xml
what happens if you decide to get your data from a json query or a xml file later on

687000
contains	any
if you only have two tables one that contains each item scanned and which store it was scanned in and one listing all the items then any item returned by your unmatched query didn t scan in any store is this what you want

687040
contains	set
replace the 0-9a-za-z expression with something that captures the full ascii set or a subset that your data contains

687079
decrement	increment
i was attempting to do something like increment decrement a value with the preprocessor but i m not sure that s possible

687084
command-prompt	cmd
today when i want to make a change to those servers i use a tedious process of opening a remote desktop connection to each of those servers then running a cmd from the cmd-prompt on each server

687084
linux	unix
i know how to do this in linux unix with ssh so please do answers that say switch to linux

687096
border-layout	gridbaglayout
there are a number of layout managers that would accomplish this--gridlayout 1x1 grid gridbaglayout perhaps border-layout

687102
sql-server	mysql
this is very similar to question 653714 but for mysql instead of sql-server

687102
put	get
if i could put them in a temp table i could use the results effectively but i can t figure out how to get them in a temp table

687132
lightbox	jquery
i am using jquery 1.3.2 and i was wondering if anyone knew of a modelbox lightbox that would work with that

687132
lightbox	jquery
i ve found a bunch of jquery powered lightbox but most of them use way older versions of jquery

687133
buffering	streaming
in iis 6 using perl i was able to send a streaming of output to the client rather than buffering the entire thing and dumping it out at all once

687154
thickbox	jqmodal
also check out jqmodal for a little newer plugin with some features thickbox lacks like callbacks

687155
instances	self
it is an implementation detail but i assume the reason for this is to avoid unnecessary garbage-collection of instances that are supposed to survive as long as the process it self

687166
decrement	increment
increment decrement a value at compile time is probably possible with meta-programming wizardry a-la loki

687177
elementtree	xml.etree
from xml.etree import elementtree as et

687183
simplemodal	fancybox
we ve used both simplemodal and fancybox and had good results

687217
selected	button
selected an icon for the new button using the change icon button otherwise it will be blank and won t show up in the toolbar

687249
environment	execution
background threads are identical to foreground threads with one exception-handling a background thread does not keep the managed execution environment running

687249
environment	execution
all threads that enter the managed execution environment from unmanaged code are marked as background threads

687286
nested-loops	loops
this will most probably use nested-loopss with a index seek over customerid on each loops

687299
distinct-values	contains
we want to have a form where we have a selected drop down that contains distinct-values of a given column in this table

687299
distinct-values	contains
to increase performance i created a little cache table that contains the distinct-values so we didn t need to do a selected distinct field from table against 10k rows

687302
boolean	double
the latter form despite requiring double parentheses is especially useful because it can generate more informative error messages if one uses boolean nullary metafunctions from boost.mpl or tr1 s as predicates

687306
document	element
an element node must be added using the document you re adding it to

687309
bubble-sort	quicksort
several different times i ve discovered that someone had hand-crafted a bubble-sort because the situation didn t require a call to the too fancy quicksort algorithm that already existed

687323
udp	tcp
quartz composer however supports opensoundcontrol which allows you to send named parameters floats ints and strings over a udp or tcp connection

687344
getter	setter
automatic getter and setter

687354
dialog	pop-up
excel 2007 will pop-up a dialog informing you that the file extension does not match the file content

687361
value	field
it is shorthand for a property that does nothing more that storing the value in a field

constructor	object
make the environment part of the parameters for the object s constructor

687366
access-levels	accessor
you can also make the accessor have different access-levels

687376
tuples	any
with the query above there isn t any data external to what is already contained in the liked_user index so i would imagine there would be less actions if the query optimizer could infer that the resulting tuples could be satisfied by the index alone

687385
reflection	runtime
for the greatest flexibility you can use reflection to match strings to classes at runtime

687394
required	checked
the contracts thing seems great when you re working in a completely isolated environment with just your own code and primitive-types but as soon as you start using bcl classes which until .net 4.0 do not have their own contracts the verifier cannot checked whether they will violate any of the required ensures invariants and so you get a lot of warnings about potentially unsatisfied constraints

687396
arguments	default
the build button compiles your website while the play button builds and fires up a browser with the default page as an arguments

687396
void	main
since an asp.net website has no true entry point like static void main in a console application the play button simulates a similar action by opening the browser to your projects start page

687433
constructor	object
you could make its constructor take a type object and then call type.isinstanceoftype on every object you add to make sure it s the right type

687434
required	checked
my problem happens when i go to checked if the file already exists in the tfs project and an updates is required or if needs to be added to the project as a new file

687653
.net	wcf
you didn t mention what version of .net you were using but if it is .net 3.0 3.5 i would suggest using wcf

687676
hash	md5
another option would be to compute a fixed-length hash from the file path using an inexpensive hash function such as md5 though md5 is not strong enough to use for passwords it s strong enough to ensure uniqueness given the input data in this case

687677
object-reference	instances
the above throws an object-reference not set to an instances when it hits this line

687690
groovy	java
that is good syntax in java bad in groovy

i compile and test most of my delphi components and libraries also with free pascal

687697
sql-server	oracle
another poster mentioned that he noted a speed improvement of about 20 in oracle and sql-server

687702
interpreter	runtime
i have never hear of such an error as the flash runtime is supposed to make the different browsers and os s interpreter the swf the same way

687704

687717
selected	button
in the add new item dialog selected the c# wcf service templates and click the add button

687739
value	field
you have three choices store the value in tempdata store the valus in the session or write the temporary value to hidden field in the view and reload them at each step

687752
children	nodes
the recursion ends when you reach a nodes that has no children so it is guaranteed to end for

687767
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried in google-chrome and firefox

687786
ironpython	ironruby
the dlr is not scripting specific so over time more scripting languages will be built on top of it but at the moment the ones i know about are ironruby ironpython and jscripting

687788
udp	tcp
it is mostly tcp but it does include a section on how to alter the code to use udp instead

687790
scala	java
i m part of the neo4j project which is written in java but has bindings to python ruby and scala as well

687850
membership	guid
the guid is a userid which actually relates to the userid used by asp.net membership

687864
overlap	margins
positioning and negative margins is the only way to get elements to overlap that i know of

687864
overlapping	z-index
also when working with z-index make sure that the overlapping elementa are at the same level with each other

687867
configuration	logging
it is frequently required that configurable levels of logging be provided such that if the configuration specifies detailed logging then everything is logged whereas if critical logging is configured then only certain information is logged along with exceptions

687883
viewwillappear	viewdidload
ok seems a little off but i added viewwillappear to viewdidload and that worked but this doesn t seem the right way to do it correct

687889
attributes	properties
it s looks like validator could not fetch attributes from entity proxy s properties

687894
deployment	install
the only downsides are that it install jruby 1.2 and i needed to install jruby 1.3 manually to get something working i can t remember what and i have been completely unable to get deployment working with either capistrano or vlad the deployer to work

687895
hide	show
if you want a lazier answer you could use javascript and hide the div when you click on the map and show it when you close the map

687902
32-bit	64bit
assuming you are using a recent gnu gcc compiler for ia-32 32-bit and amd64 the non-itanium 64bit target for amd64 x86-64 em64t intel 64 since very few people need a different compiler for linux intel and pgi

687902
ia-32	x86
at present both should both work for ia-32 x86 x86-32 and x86-64 amd64 environments correctly

687945
pointers	stack
stack which are based instead on linked-lists have other places you can borrow a bit from for example in c the least significant bit of the next pointers or in java the type of the objects in the linked-list

687953
gethashcode	equals
if you want to use a custom key type then you should consider implementing iequatable and overriding equals object and gethashcode unless the default reference or struct equality is sufficient for determining equality of keys

687955
oracle	mysql
there are usually standalone tools for basic database management - for oracle and mysql a free tool called sql developer suffices for basic database data entry

687967

687992
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but fails miserably in ie6

687995
linked-list	nodes
in the middle ware layer i loop through the recordset and create a stack of original posts each nodes on the stack points to a linked-list of comments

688020
firefox	opera
mozilla extension tutorial for firefox safari and opera

688025
contains	elements
you can only swap the stacking order on elementss that are all in the same contains elements

688029
value	field
if you have any control over the database you could convert the empty or single-space field to this xa0 value which would eliminate the conditional altogether

688031
defined	declare
my question when i validate the external javascript file it complains about the variables that are defined in the main html file because they aren t declare anywhere in the file

688031
defined	declare
how can i declare these variables in the javascript file so that it s clear the variables are expected to be defined external something similar to extern in c

688045
put	get
how much memory can i put into my machine until i get to the point where the os hits its limit

688051
environment	building
the building scripting is used for the initial setup fetching dependencies setting up environment to generate the binaries and for the continuous-integration process

688051
revision	svn
i want the binaries to have as an assemblyfileversion the month and day on build and svn revision on the revision

688053
boost	stl
can i put stl and boost headers there even though they have templates

688091
boost	stl
the quick answer the stl and boost headers do indeed belong in the precompiled header file even though these header files define templates classes

688091
boost	stl
the reason is this - the generation of the precompiled header can take a long time because the boost stl and windows libraries are very large

688118
build-server	msbuild
fwiw we drive it all from msbuild scripting using different values for properties set for each project type passed through from our build-server cruisecontrol.net

688118
revision	ignore
we let developers control major.minor the build server controls build and we leave revision for qa to link to their own system because it s ignore by wix msi anyway

688127
subtract	add
of course you ll have to add subtract one --- or just put undefined as the first element

688127
sorted	lookup
c do not need to lookup elements by id unless it is sorted by id you can do a binary-search in o log n

688138
required	checked
my thought and practice was that it should be basic sanity checked did the user enter all the required inputs

688152
defined	declare
i am trying to declare list in powershell where the person is defined using add-type

688165
python	java
c or c++ is preferred but i can work in java or python if those have better options for libraries

688216
perl	ruby
integrate perl ruby rexx python and any active scripting language

i realize borders can t be directly applied to a table row tag but i m hoping someone know some jquery voodoo magic that can find the table cells within the selected row and apply some styles to those to create the border

688232
cassini	iis
have you tried using iis for debugging rather than the built-in webserver cassini

688245
python	ruby
at this time textmate s official python bundle is really bare bones especially in comparison to the ruby bundle

688249
removeclass	addclass
your best bet would be to addclass and removeclass on the row

688254
linux	osx
i write shell scripts to do various things in osx and linux but i always have the same problem

688258
asp.net-mvc	wcf
2 of those are asp asp.net-mvc apps and the third is a wcf web service

688258
rollback	commit
re tidy up you should try and always work within a transaction and either commit or rollback the transaction at the end of your unit of work

688265
switching	screens
note if you only see half a screens worth you re character encoding is not unicode unicode characters cover several screens type set encoding utf-8 to switching to utf-8

688271
environment	execution
it s not global to your system it s a part of the specific execution environment of the scripting

688273
shell	bash
that behavior is by design - at least in bash which is what i use but i think most shell work the same way

688274
apache-poi	docx4j
you could use docx4j or indeed just apache-poi to read the docx and apache-poi to write it out as a .doc

688276
python	java
however i welcome solutions expressed in languages which i am familiar java c# python vb javascript php

688302
emacs	vim
i have gotten to know my way around a few programming languages and i d like to try my hand at making a command-line text editor -- something that runs in the terminal like vim emacs nano but is pure text no guis please

688322
any	set
the third pattern gives you the option to use any string as an id have complex person structures and get and set person records in a constant time

688327
updating	updates
user b without svn updating adds one of those things in word saves as xml then does svn updates

688333
apache-fop	docx4j
if you can work with the docx format docx4j can use apache-fop for output

688333
apache-poi	docx4j
if you must work with .doc docx4j has rudimentary conversion using apache-poi hwpf

688343
daemons	systemd
on unix operating systemd it is common practice to â œlockâ a program often a daemons by use of a special lock file the pid file

688346
any	set
be sure to set ignoreunresolvableplaceholders so that the first will ignore any placeholders that it can t resolve

688348
ncurses	urwid
i would recommend the excellent urwid toolkit - it s much easier to use than straight ncurses

688359
user-controls	tabcontrol
i am trying to get zindexing working on a custom user-controls but it clips the bottom of the control when it pops up inside a tabcontrol as shown

688368
apache-poi	docx4j
docx4j or apache-poi both of which are asl v2

688371
spring	jsf
if you are going to develop java web applications you should take a first look j2ee tutorial specially in part ii and also some asp.net-mvc frameworks struts spring web asp.net-mvc and some different asp.net-mvc approaches jsf

688385
lookup	any
needed - any page click compares the click x y coordinates to a lookup table and if coordinates are within a link region run a scripting - remember the coordinates are of the fixed content area within flash not relative to the browser

688385
contains	set
set flash wmode transparent and place a div contains links covering active area

688391
apache-fop	itext
if you can go from doc to docx then you could use docx4j to generate rtf using itext or apache-fop i haven t tested the rtf output of either itext or apache-fop so i m not sure how they ll handle tables

688391
apache-poi	docx4j
as to going from doc to docx docx4j has a basic proof of concept of this using apache-poi s hwpf

688392
native-code	unmanaged
in a nut shell c++ can be either managed compiled to mil or unmanaged compiled to native-code

688393
udp	tcp
if that s the case and you need synchronous communication you can definitely use tcp sockets or just udp

688408
toolchain	gnu
kdevelop has hooks for the gnu toolchain as well as hooks for valgrind cachegrind etc

688409
unsigned	integer
the extracts can be obtained in cpu-endianness-independent way by using the right shift operation against the integer values and casting the result by the byte type such as unsigned char

688413
children	nodes
i was having a problem with the sub-query data replicating as a child for each entry in the outer query there were multiple children under each nodes related to how many nodess there were. i m sure there s a simple explanation but i was working to a tight schedule when i did this and never went back to check.

688428
intermediate-language	cil
the .net byte-code is called either msil microsoft intermediate-language or cil common intermediate-language

688432
sorted	lookup
its tree-backed rbtree so lookup are fast and the value are sorted

688432
enumerate	next
if you enumerate over the tree the enumerator inside the tree doesnt cost logn to proceed to the next element - it just follows a pointers in the tree

688439
unmanaged	c++-cli
which to choose in your projects depends a bit on the requirements if your program needs to interact other managed modules like modules written in c# it is preferable to use c++-cli to avoid some overhead switching between managed and unmanaged code

688448
stderr	stdout
redirect the standard streams stdin stdout stderr since a daemon process no longer has a controlling terminal

688494
copy-constructor	deep-copy
im trying to do the copy part of a deep-copy with my copy-constructor

688506
constructor	object
at the point where the body of the constructor executes the object is already considered to have been built so references should already be valid so your assignment of a reference is rejected by c++

688507
constructor	object
you can simply initialize the struct object with a constructor

688509
malloc	free
if you never add a constructor destructor assignment operators or virtual functions to your structure using malloc free for allocation is safe

688509
malloc	free
unfortunately c++ does not provide a good mechanism to do this so you often end up with such malloc free hacks in real world applications

688516
vb.net	vb6
or you could go with vb.net vb6 or what have you

688524
display	width
display ok with ms office word however width is reduced not proper width

688565
document	element
if i have an xml document with the element

688624
bazaar	git
you can use a distribute version control system like bazaar git mercurial

688629
document	element
i want to know if there are any simple tools available to exactly describe an element that exists in a html document or languages that help describe specific problems for developers

688630
malloc	free
instead of malloc and free you could use and operator delete p since struct packet is a pod type and does not currently benefit from having its default constructor and its destructor called

688645
jquery-dialog	jquery
because i wanted to display a jquery-dialog after the user clicks the update button i wanted to use jquery to submit the form

688645
jquery	.post
the jquery i am using to .post the form is as follows

688669
contains	any
or are you wanting to know how you d create and parsing a file to contains different sections for the title and the contents and any other fields

688677
contains	elements
a non-floated elements will not have any height if it only contains floated elementss

688710
z-index	overlap
i d suggest using grid or canvas as containers of you want to overlap controls and then set their z-index

688726
json	csv
of course if this is just a small personal project you could just serialize the data to something like xml json csv or whatever and storing it as a file

688765
selected	button
now i realized the split button of yui doesn t behave like the standard selected html element

688765
highlight	selected
after an item is selected when display the list again it neither highlight or scroll that item into view at all

688765
highlight	selected
unlike the standard selected html element it does highlight and scroll that item into view

688766
http-post	post
for example if i want to post a new status update i am sending a http-post request to with the following parameters -

688770
python	php
you responded and said you use php and python

688771
any	set
if you need to refactor code for which no tests are available your best approach would be to set up automated-tests before you make any changes to the code

688779
setinterval	settimeout
here is some reading comparing setinterval and settimeout

688782
restart	reload
we can use an appropriate delay in milliseconds to watch the configuration file for changes and reload the log4j properties or xml without restart the server

688787
switching	screens
you can switching between screens windows with

688796
compact-framework	.net
this is an msdn article about creating an msi package that detects and updates the .net compact-framework if this is required

688804
aes	rsa
for many reasons you should normally only use rsa to encrypt a key and then use aes or a similar symmetric cipher algorithm to encrypt your actual text

688819
web-config	app-config
thanks to this website i succeed to use a connectionstring localized inside a web-config instead of the one provided in the app-config of the library

688820
while-loop	loops
that loops reading is exactly what the while-loops does - until it sees m_taken change it only reads

688824
internationalization	localization
you also gain the advantage of much easier localization internationalization of your resources

688848
value	field
the problem is that it gives the wrong impression - it makes it look like the value can t change when actually it s only the field value that can t change rather than the object

688849
arrays	map
we required a script that simulates associative arrays or map like data structure for shell scripting any body

688865
radio-button	button
these button are a grouping meaning that only one radio-button can be checked

688865
checkbox	button
the checkbox are exactly the same as the radio button with the exception that they are not a grouping

688865
put	get
when i put an alert in the javascript code above i do get the alert so i know i m good there but because i don t know javascript i m not able to troubleshoot this any further

688875
xsd	xml
well if you really don t want them - you could remove the schemas from the xsd path vsinstalldir xml schemas - and perhaps disable download options- texteditor- xml- miscellaneous

688880
radio-button	checkbox
if you want to check uncheck a radio-button checkbox after it s been sent to the browser you can use jquery to do it

688885
conditional	operators
and of course you could expand the conditional operators into an if else if you don t like them

688887
mstest	nunit
unlike nunit testdriven.net etc - mstest copied things around into a different folder for each test

688887
attributes	properties
which is imo a pain - for example you need to either attributes files to include or specify them in the testrunconfig properties - deployment - add file...

688890
blacklist	whitelist
whitelist approach to defining valid characters should be used in cleaning the input - there is simply too many problematic characters to blacklist

688896
msbuild	nant
we use a nant scripting which at the compile step calls msbuild

688896
continuous-integration	nant
you can integrate a nant build as a custom tool into the ide so that it can be used both on a build or continuous-integration server and by the developers in the same way

688926
png	gif
i want to make sure that during file upload time only the file of the format jpeg png and gif are allowed

688926
png	gif
so the file of type below in the screenshot must show jpeg png and gif

688944
arrays	loops
my understanding was that on the first call of drawview the nsmutablearrays would be set up and the instance of entity added to it then in the body the a pointer to first copy of entity stored in the arrays retrieved and this manipulated obviously i intend to add more and loops over them later

689015
puts	gets
your forgot something in the updates.php every in-place editor does an ajax request to the updates file and then puts in the edited element the things it gets in the updates.php with that request

689017
python	java
when i compare c# code comparable to java and python code i often find the python code cleaner and more elegant there is less rigid ceremony around declaring types etc

689018
attributes	properties
to set the namespace of the attributes you ll need to use the namespace properties of xmlattributesattributes

689022
javascript	dom
in the javascript dom this is converted to a true boolean

reference-type	generics
is there any way in which you can test whether an instance of a generics parameter in a generics method has been assigned to when it can be either a value or reference-type

689213
ubuntu	linux
both of the answers from devsolar work tested on linux ubuntu but the xargs version is preferable if there may be many files since it will avoid running into command line length limits

689214
linux	unix
the person should also be comfortable with using linux or bsd on the desktop since that means they have to interact with the unix system on two different levels both the server side and the desktop side

689219
subclassing	base-class
if i understand you correctly you want to have a common base-class for your enum and want to define several unrelated sets of enums for the subclassing

groovy	java
if you program in java and have a certain freedom about your libraries this would be a proper use case for embedded dsls with groovy

689268
stderr	stdout
can you wrap it in some shell scripting that captures the log files stdout stderr and the exit code which should give some indication as to how it died

689273

689528
contains	set
returns a set view of the keys contains in this map

689541
arguments	default
notice there is no constructor that takes no argument default constructor which means any class that inherits from classone must call the constructor that has 2 arguments

base-class	inherited
i would like to point out here that in c# you can only inherited from one base-class

689557

689564
malloc	free
1 malloc the memory in the driver free it in the app

689564
malloc	free
if you have access to malloc free and there are no real time concerns or memory fragmentation issues your heap is large enough then this is a fairly easy approach

689564
.when	ready
the driver completely manages a fixed size ring buffering and simply sends a message to the application .when a buffering is ready

689576

scriptaculous	jquery
is there a procedure that prototype and scriptaculous has that should not conflict with jquery

689735
sql-server	mysql
i have seen a number of examples that explain this for use with a mysql database but i have not been able to get it to work with sql-server

689772
value	field
every other column in that table that isn t of an xml datatype updates perfectly fine but when i went to make changes to the xml field the program executes seemingly correctly but the field always retains its original value after i run submitchanges

689772
value	field
when linq then generates the query it doesn t even attempt to see if the field has been updated since it has a new id it simply write the value to the database

689778
virtual-memory	paging
only when memory requirement of program grows then virtual-memory and paging are helpful

689796
administration	account
rename your built-in administration account

689799
schtasks	cmd
note if you do not like exposing the password use the psexec cmd to execute the schtasks cmd download the free and powerful tool from

689807
sql-server	oracle
i m studying sql-server but don t know much about oracle

689807
sql-server	oracle
i ve read a comparison about sql-server 2000 vs oracle 9i but it s a little out of date

689807
sql-server	oracle
have sql-server 2008 caught up oracle 11g i yet

689809
contains	any
do you have any columns contains empty strings

689817
any	set
i also don t think there s any way to set admin permissions as you re asking

689818
expression	evaluation
in particular the xpathdocument class is designed to be more efficient for evaluation xpath expression than using the dom-based xmldocument class

689819

two separate classes are being declare and defined

689843
sql-server	oracle
oracle seems to be somewhat more powerful with some nifty features that sql-server hasn t quite caught up with yet

689853
profiling	debugging
do you need to have your projects built in debugging or release to profiling them

689853
profiling	debugging
so i go back to debugging mode and i try to run it and it tells me that half of my projects need to be recompiled with the profiling switch on

689855
sql-server	oracle
the most obvious difference is that oracle uses sequences and sql-server uses auto-increment columns

689855
sql-server	oracle
from my experience doing top n queries in sql-server seems a little easier than oracle

689855
authentication	login
tcp was disabled by default windows authentication only and then you had to setup a login and a user

689857
getter	setter
not allowing properties to be declared in an interface would only force developers to create getter and setter manually

689859
progress-bar	progress
i once implemented a progress-bar which was used to report the progress of a long complicated file operation several small files were being read processed and then combined into a larger file

689860
constructor	object
constructor are a method of creating an object

689871
filtering	sorting
event1 and event2 fire and basically will change things about the serverside controls rendering sorting filtering etc so when they fire i need to call populatecontrols for sure

689894
profiling	debugging
if you re finding it difficult to use there s a really great .net profiling called nprof and if you re debugging non-clr projects amd has a really spectacular statistical profiling called code analyst

689917
sql-server	oracle
i m a sql-server person and know very little about oracle but in my view sql-server vs

689917
sql-server	oracle
both sql-server and oracle are enterprise capable databases with spectacular developer operations and it support stories

689917
sql-server	oracle
of course i d likely find oracle to be a pain because i think in the sql-server way

689917
sql-server	oracle
likewise i m sure the oracle admins dev find oracle easy to use because they think oracle and sql-server is strange to them

689917
sql-server	oracle
i think the one true difference between then is that oracle is cross platform while sql-server obviously isn t

689927
sql-server	oracle
the latest versions of sql-server and oracle are both enterprise ready and are largely similiar in what they can do

689927
sql-server	oracle
for me personally we have oracle and sql-server where i ve worked in the past and comparing the two i can t see anything in oracle which i couldn t do in sql-server one of my roles was the sql-server dba.

689927
sql-server	oracle
here s oracle s comparison against microsoft oracle r database 10g release 2 outperforms microsoft sql-server 2005 in head-to-head comparison

689955
filtering	sorting
covers domain services connecting server data to silverlight client the data grid paging sorting filtering the data form control validation and more

689964
gethashcode	equals
i would suggest that you create a small custom class exposing the bool and int properties and override its gethashcode and equals methods then use this as the key

689987
gethashcode	equals
also consider overriding gethashcode and equals methods

689998
gethashcode	equals
to make this more robust encapsulate the composite key as a type a class that contains the two fields ensuring you override the equals and gethashcode methods correctly

690002
stderr	stdout
then the java process has to read handle the process stdout stderr usually you do this in a thread per stream to prevent blocking - if you have 2 000 processes using this mechanism then you re looking at 4000 threads

690002
linux	unix
on unix linux the various proc filesystem nodes may help you

690005
value	field
dbname is the catagory field min dbstart and max dbend fields are the high low value for the series.the value are always for one day only

690011
sql-server	oracle
i ve worked with both sql-server and oracle on a variety of projects

690011
sql-server	oracle
as a developer i ve rarely needed a dba for sql-server but always seem to run into something with oracle that i need a dba to do

690011
sql-server	oracle
i greatly preferred pl sql oracle over t-sql sql-server for writing stored procedures

690011
sql-server	oracle
the default admin tools for sql-server are easier to use than the ones included with oracle

690030
lookup	any
has anyone had any good experiences with post code lookup api providers that could assist me in choosing a reliable and good source

690032
expression	evaluation
visiting the tree evaluation the expression

690039
interpreter	runtime
the string you described is valid c# code so if you can interpreter it at runtime you re done

690039
interpreter	runtime
in c# it is not but you can use a 3rd party library such as this runtime c# interpreter

690048
decrement	increment
put your increment and decrement in their own statement

690048
for-loop	loops
i would convert your while loops into a for-loops like so

690082
revision	svn
just get into the habit of using a specific revision number instead of head when referencing svn externals guilty as charged

690089
value	field
updating a value in a field use

690108
webserver	upload
my proble is to avoid that users upload some malicious file on my webserver

690108
debian	linux
im working on linux environment debian

690108
python	php
there is a way in php python or whatelse can a unix system run easly to check the truly type of a file

690112
export	report
my first guess would be to export the report as a pdf and combine it with the static pdfs and let them download that

690124
callback	methods
you supply callback methods that the parsing should call when it encounters certain kinds of things in the document

690125
sql-server	oracle
well it depends if you re using .net then sql-server even though you can use oracle with it too if you re using java then oracle you can also connect to sql-server using java

690125
postgresql	mysql
since you get pretty much the same quality and advanced technology with free database servers like mysql or postgresql and since i use python django and .net they integrate pretty well

690125
postgresql	mysql
both have advantages and both are cool we ve reach the point that it doesn t matter which dbms you pick the 4 big ones mysql postgresql mssql or oracle

690128
any	set
don t set it on any uploaded files and you should be safe from executing them

690133
push	pull
xmltextreader parsing xml using pull parsing the java equivalent of this is stax which is basically the inverse of sax push parsing

690133
.when	ready
instead of being notified .when a new entity is read you ask for the next entity in the document .when you re ready for it btw it s possible to implements a sax style parsing on top of a pull parsing but not the other way around

690160
selected	button
and selected several button

690160
textbox	button
i would like to click a button have it copy text ie the number from the field in the mortgage servicing application then paste that info to the textbox on the other browser that is our phone system and select from several different radio button hit the next button and then it will dial

690160
vbscript	vba
i ve done mild vba but not a vbscript master

690162
append	input
you could append a fixed width for all input on the current page

690177
.net	wcf
i am creating a wcf service that will be consumed by both .net and java client applications

690220
document	element
when the document is fully loaded take the first input element with type text and apply it s height and width to all input elements with type password

690297
output	cat
in answer to your comment yes nobody will stop you from using job control in your bash scripting -- there is no hard case for forcefully disabling set -m yes job control from the scripting will work if you want it to. remember that in the end especially in scriptinging there always are more than one way to skin a cat but some ways are more portable more reliable make it simpler to handle error cases parsing the output etc

690298
shell	bash
in shell script writing there is often an assumption that you can t rely on the fact that you have bash but that you have the vanilla bourne shell sh which historically did not have job control

690300
developer-tools	console.log
console.log is only available after you have opened the developer-tools f12 to toggle it open and closed

690304
document	editing
mindquarry is an open source collaborative software platform for file sharing document images media files etc. task and project-management team collaboration and wiki editing that meshes simplicity and functionality

690308
gridview	radgrid
i don t know about radgrid but you can bind that datareader to the built-in grid controls like gridview

690312
updating	updates
choosing the updates model from database is the best methods for updating your edmx

690313
web-config	app-config
however these settings must be in the calling application s app-config or web-config

690314
order	join
also i naturally tend to order the data so that left join work for getting the data i require

690322
command-line	cmd
you can however run other cmd non-interactively on the background append to the command-line and capture their pids with

690336
progress-bar	progress
so if i were doing a progress dialog for a software update i wouldn t use a single progress-bar but a task list with check marks so the user can see what task is being performed at the moment

690341
required	checked
in this case i am making sure with a javascript required field checked that money only has 2 spots after the 2

690361
dictionary	arrays
if you are simply returning something and there is no additional logic in a subset of the cases you might consider putting the somethings in an arrays or dictionary and simply addressing them by their index rather than using a switch statement.

690400
instance-variables	local-variables
returning an instance-variables takes longer than returning an local-variables vm dependent

690400
instance-variables	local-variables
the getter that you have is simple so it should be inlined so it becomes as fast as accessing a public instance-variables which again is slower than accessing a local-variables

690400
instrumentation	profiling
a tracing profiling adds code to your program a process known as instrumentation to essentially log what is going on

690400
instrumentation	profiling
tracing profiling are slower but more accurate they also require that the program be changed the instrumentation process which could potentially introduce bugs not that i have heard of it happening.

690405
associations	model
is there a way to copy the associations of one model to another.

690415
daemon	sigint
also i have seen sighup used for non-terminating reasons such as telling a daemon re-read your configuration file. and it seems to me that sigint the same interrupt you d typically get with ctrl-c right

690419
integer	short
question should a build number be short and sweet monotonically increasing integer so that it s easy to stick into file names for archival easy to refer to in communication etc.

690419
logging	trace
different forms of the version info are emitted in logging data long-term archived output products and used to trace our sometimes years-later analysis of output products to a specific build

690447
restart	reload
the reason that daemons sometimes use sighup to restart or reload configuration is that daemons detach from any controlling terminals as a daemon doesn t need those and therefore would never receive sighup so that signals was considered as freed up for general use

690452
default-value	default
and what s happening is that my code picks up the passedstring just fine but for some reason on postback it resets to the default-value - even if i put the assignment of the default in the page_init code.

690457
hotmail	gmail
mail hotmail or gmail

690461
if-statement	loops
a while back i coded a variation of this program in java and was so disgusted by the speed that i ended up replacing several of the for loops which used it with 4 if-statement

690468
populate	row
i have come to the conclusion i do admit that i may be wrong in this assumption that the rows are not being populate due to the fact that the stored procedure needs an input parameter to do it s thing and without that parameter there isn t any data to return for each row

690470
webforms	asp.net
of an asp.net webforms

690473
cassini	iis
due to security aspects that i have to write cassini can t serve as a test server anymore - i have to use iis we have security card readers here

690473
administration	account
so when i went through all the problems of getting the appropriate account added to administration on my local pc so that i could debugging in vs2008 while using iis i tried to connect to the database and i was rejected because mypc aspnet was not a trusted connection

690487
authentication	impersonation
as albert points out impersonation requires the user to be authenticated using windows authentication

690499
gnome	kde
now in kde based distros you ll have kdesu while in gnome based it ll be gksu and gksudo

690502
shell	bash
after migrating to windows i m using msysgit with its included bash shell and that s working well for me

690502
build-process	ant
but i have issues our ant build-process won t run in that shell i d like to use cygwin s xterms instead of the windowss command windows since the terminal compatibility isn t good enough to run everything else i d like in that windows and so on

690505
authentication	impersonation
use impersonation and configure your web application to use windows authentication only

690522
javascript	dom
that is would there be anything i couldn t access via the javascript dom

690524
postgresql	firebird
in case you need other db engine support zeosdb is the answer again it supports mysql postgresql interbase firebird ms sql sybase oracle and sqlite

690529
revision	svn
the version is major . minor . month day . svn revision

690529
revision	svn
the community tasks pack includes both tasks needed to get the working copy svn revision and date

690573
decompression	tar
i need to run the tar command to decompression a file within windows-xp

690579
data-members	constructor
i was curious what is the scope of variables declared inside a class constructor which are not data-members of that class

690587
httpresponse	httprequest
how would i do it using httpresponse and httprequest

690603
cygwin	gnu
if you need some of the other unix tools but don t want the vast amount of bloat that cygwin has unhappily become see minmalist gnu for windows

690614
specifications	w3c
a lots of interesting information about the dom to css interface can be read from the w3c document object model css2 specifications

690628
webrequest	webclient
what you could do is derive a class from the webclient class and then override the getwebrequest and the getwebresponse methods to alter the webrequest webresponse instances that the base implementation returns

690631
sigaction	signals
for more information on what the real meaning of the signals is see sigaction 2

690631
signals	sigint
sigint is used to signals an interactive keyboard interrupt of the process

690632
postgresql	mysql
the sql must run unmodified on sqlite postgresql and mysql if possible

690643
postgresql	mysql
most of my experience is with mysql but i ve also used oracle which is case-sensitive like postgresql

690650
sql-server	mysql
sql-server 2005 implementation of mysql replace into

690651
display	width
the map display with a width of 800px and a height around 480px on a computer screen

690656
triggers	insert
could you use an insert triggers

690667
windows-vista	windows
windows dac includes some changes to work with windows-vista but is almost entirely functionally equivalent to mdac 2.8

690681
java-3d	jogl
in the lower-level bindings for opengl like jogl but probably not so much for libraries like java-3d you do have to manage resources like textures and buffering yourself by calling the gldelete functions

690682
value	field
jquery-dialog does move the field outside of the form which why you are not seeing the value on postback

690686
value	field
remember the user might be pressing backspace or the cursor might not be at the end of the field or the user might have part of the value selected to be replaced on next keypress and so on

690686
value	field
then you get the full post-change value of the field

690686
value	field
you don t get the chance to deny the keypress but you can reset the field to the last-known-good value instead

690689
javascript	dom
you ll also discover that a lot of standard javascript libraries prototype jquery come to mind are not suitable for working with excessively large dom structures

690701
msdeploy	msbuild
have a look at msdeploy and the web-deployment tool i would use msbuild to tie them all together though

690722
postback	ajax
the reason is that the elements on the page are getting recreated during the ajax postback

690722
mouseleave	mouseenter
note that live events do not work with the following events change blur focus mouseenter mouseleave and submit

690730
firefox	safari
i m using as3 exporting for flash player 10 and testing on firefox 3 safari 4 on a mac

690742
selected	cell
the only ways to get the datagridview to show the correct values are either to selected a cell forcing that particular cell to redraw

690747
any	set
the simplest approach would be to set any git msysgit or cygwin git to ignore crlf styles

690764
selected	button
the tabitems need to use a controltemplate because they have a selected not-selected and disabled state so they need to have event triggers to switch states - the selected tab has an orange glass button and the non-selected tabs have a blue glass button

690791
contains	elements
what if your arrays contains some elements 0.2 00000000 and 0.2 00000001 which really should be considered equal but aren t because they came from different calculations

690802
jar	war
as an alternative since you are only using the ear to wrap the war and not actually sharing the jar file

690802
jar	war
put the jar in the lib directory of the war

690807
python	php
there is a way in php python or whatelse can a unix system run easly to check the truly type of a file

690809
slidedown	slideup
i want to slideup some divs then slidedown 1 div

690824
hide	show
if you want to momentarily show the hidden one and then slideup it you can just switch my original answer from hide to show and then do the slideup

690826
double-quotes	single-quotes
w quotes like single-quotes no variables interpolation fewer escape sequences while w quotes like double-quotes

690842
exception-handling	error-handling
as for exception-handling check the docs for errors and error-handling in pdo

690856
configuration	installation
1 django installation and configuration assumes you have access to a shell my target is not the programmer type

690860
revision	svn
svntask an ant task to find svn revision

690860
revision	svn
for a continuous nightly build build number is the svn revision found using svntask

690860
jar	war
the ant build script puts the build number in the manifest file of jar war files that are created during the build

690860
revision	svn
for a dev version of a jar war the developer can find the svn revision from the jar war and look up the corresponding code in svn

690860
revision	svn
for a release the svn revision is the one corresponding to the svn tag that has the release number in it

690868
shell	bash
what are changes you think are important comparing the original bourne shell to bash

690876
implements	sealed
several years ago as a school project i implements in c a write-once read-many mapping and other collections which took an existing collection and then sealed it by creating a much more memory and cache-efficient representation a graph was stored as an optimized arrays

690921
shell	bash
they are maximally portable and should run on systems that use bash ksh or even sh as their default shell

690939
any	set
interfaces give you a way to define a contract or set of expected behaviors that is independent of any implementation

690942
implements	final
in this microsoft tutorial they implements ajax in the final step step 7

690972
command-line	cmd
another thing to try reading between the lines instead of calling system ... for tasks to be run implement a my_system ... which prints out the environment before calling the external task so that you could recreate one of the tasks with an env ... cmd from the cmd-line

691003
value	field
i mean is there a way to check if ms-access application is running and if it is then check certain form is open then get the value from this form s textbox field

691017
hosts-file	hosts
there is no dns server configure for these servers so i m using the hosts to map domain names to ip addresses verified using telnet ping etc

691023
arrays	map
i think that you need to step back and think about what a map or associative arrays really is

691023
key-value	key
you may also want to be able to iterate over the key to retrieve every key-value pair or delete key and their associated values

691034
virtual-functions	derived-class
the reason the virtual function doesn t call the derived-class is because that is how c++ virtual-functions work

691034
constructor	object
conceptually until the derived class constructor completes the object s type is still the base class.

691035
attributes	properties
does any one know how i can specify the default value for a datetime properties using the system.componentmodel defaultvalue attributes

691040
ubuntu	linux
anyone have a neat trick on how to convert a number of php and html files from utf-8 to iso-8859-1 in linux ubuntu

691041
stderr	stdout
mod_wsgi can be coerced into sending stdout and stderr to a log file

691043
value	field
just add code to the constructor to initialize the date if required create a triggers and handle missing value in the database or implement the getter in a way that it returns datetime.now if the backing field is not initialized

691073
getter	setter
what i have is a property that has a public getter and an internal setter

691081
arrays	map
i m considering wrapping the byte arrays and storing in a map but i suspect there is a better way

691084
triggers	insert
wow you want to have only one insert in your triggers to avoid what

691085
networkstream	sslstream
i am migrating c# code from using a networkstream to sslstream however where i use stream.dataavailable i get the error

691111
.net	wcf
wcf rest starter kit codeplex preview 2 base on .net 3.5 and still in beta

691113
sql-server	oracle
i have two databases oracle 10g and sql-server 2000

691113
sql-server	oracle
what i need to do is extract the files from oracle and place them into sql-server

691125
peer	p2p
you re p2p so every peer must have at least one socket open to every other peer

691125
peer	p2p
however on a normal p2p network of any size you will almost never have multiple files being transferred concurrently between two peer

691128
selected	checkbox
just noticed i get these errors if i don t selected a checkbox and submit

691152
callback	methods
create a delegate for the methods that does the work then call begininvoke on the delegate passing it the arguments and a callback to handle the return values if you want .

691156
any	set
intersect builds up a hashset from the inner sequence this takes o m complexity and then loops through the outer sequence which takes o n complexity yielding any element which is in the set

691157
bash	zsh
this should work in bash 4.0 available now on most major distros though not on os x unless you install it yourself ksh and zsh

691168
exception-handling	error-handling
is the exception-handling really more expensive many say that in terms of binary output size than other error-handling strategies

691182
hide	show
display for about a second the alt attributes given in this case open folder then it hide and show the image when the image is ready

691182
quirks-mode	firefox
note that if you re using quirks-mode and the image has a fixed size specified firefox will use a â broken imageâ icon with the alt text overlaid and cropped inside instead of the plain alt text on its own

691185
toolchain	platform
i guess it d depend on the hardware and toolchain port for that specific platform

691186
asp.net-mvc	wcf
wcf is probably the way to go in the long run but asp.net-mvc should easily handle it

691186
json	xml
your actions would just need to be set up to return json or xml depending on how you want to serialize it

691187
tokenize	parsing
that s the approach used by the tokenize module for parsing python source code

691188
configuration	environment
this however will change with .net 4 and vs 2010 which they have added web.debug.configuration web.release.configuration web.staging.configuration and web.testing.configuration which will then publish the configuration you need in relation to the environment

691189
triggers	insert
regarding update and insert triggers for ms sql-server is there a way to make them atomic

691189
triggers	insert
in other words if an error occurs during the triggers is it possible to automatically roll back the original insert or update

691225
children	nodes
presuming that i don t know the name of my base nodes or its children what is the xpath syntax for all nodess exactly one below the base nodes

691226
value	field
so if the text field shows 10 00 then the value on the property would be 600

691230
tokenize	parsing
when parsing long input streams you may find it more useful to implement you tokenize as a generator function

691231
python	ruby
deployment is clearly a problem for all non-php based web apps but i think things are getting better with the dreamhost engineyard type isp s who provide ruby python etc

691231
pylons	django
the growth in popularity of django turbogears and pylons is driving demand for better deployment solutions

691231
python	php
running it that way means the python interpreter doesn t use up ram in the apache workers and vice versa the php interpreter isn t contaminating my mod_wsgi daemons

691234
user-controls	ascx
i m new to asp.net and have a form tag on an ascx user-controls

691235
document	element
if you wrote something like element it would match every element named element anywhere in the xml document no matter how deep into the hierarchy it is

691238
.net	wcf
a in .net 2.0 you should be able to build restful services using wse2.0 but if you have the option to use .net 3.5 i would strongly recommend going the route of wcf since it is much easier and is designed with rest in mind

691238
.net	wcf
although there is a lot of debate around the topic web api vs wcf rest asp.net web api is a new option for building rest services in .net

691243
value	field
if you don t have control on the page you can use javascript to inject a new form on the page with some hidden field and set the value upon click of a button

691247
solaris	linux
the main issue is boot-strapping the system across all the different environments where it is used - solaris linux misc h w hp-ux aix.

691247
shell	bash
i use korn shell - but the principles apply to bash and it works fine with bash

691259
python	ruby
in the past nine months at my job i ve been required to learn python and ruby

691259
python	ruby
ruby is the one i m actively using now and while i did nothing but python for six months that s my least favorite of the bunch

691276
json	xml
they tried getting xml and json via ajax but found it too slow

691276
callback	methods
callback methods

691279
compatibility	legacy
stringtokenizer is a legacy class that is retained for compatibility reasons although its use is discouraged in new code

691279
arrays	loops
for one thing split simply returns an arrays which makes it easy to use a foreach loops

691294
value	field
i got entire running process list and try to dump value in startinfo but all 100+ processes startinfo field are empty

691297
triggers	insert
after triggers are automatically part of the insert update delete atomic dml statement on a table

691297
execution	exit
for sql 2005 with try catch execution will go to the catch block and your batch aka stored proc etc will exit normally

691297
rollback	commit
see rollback and commit in stored-procedures and triggers

691299
throttling	throttle
if i throttle the maxconcurrentcalls down to 20 15 10 or anything lower the instances performance counter show that wcf is respecting the throttling

691302
any	set
whenever a browser fetches data from a domain it send across any cookie data that the site has set

691315
hosts-file	hosts
i had used a hosts to map mock domain names for all three servers in the form of datax.mydomain.com

691317
javascript	dom
these aren t completely unassailable technical problems you constrain the server-supported language to a sub-set of javascript that s well supported across most browsers provide an ide that knows this subset and the server-side extensions make some rules about page structure to minimize dom issues and provide some boiler-plate javascript for inclusion on the client to make the platform a little nicer to use

691323
internet-explorer	firefox
internet-explorer lets the user type anything they want into that input whereas firefox brings up a file chooser

691332
javascript	dom
javascript is good at string and dom xml manipulation being sandboxed networking extending itself etc.

691359
subtract	time
it is highly likely that calling rdtsc subtract from the previous rdtsc converting that to a fractional equivalent in seconds by dividing by your cpu spped will be slower than just calling time again

691372
specifications	w3c
turns out dateutil handles everything in the w3c date and time specifications

691373
mediawiki	geshi
also you ll probably need an extension for mediawiki to show code something like syntaxhighlight geshi

691396
itemscontrol	grid
if you want a non-interactive grid of items you can use an itemscontrol with a grid that uses shared size scope

691396
panels	grid
a more efficient approach would be to write your own panels subclass that works similarly to grid you could probably subclass grid but automatically adds rows as necessary

691425
http-post	post
i have a blog site written in php and it post new blog post to twitter and a blog ping automatically under the hood using simple http-post requests passed using php curl

691430
python	ruby
i think in a few years we will be seeing python maybe more like ironpython or ruby as a viable alternative too

691450
profiling	debugging
1.do you need to have your projects built in debugging or release to profiling them

691470
itemscontrol	textblock
that container an instance of contentpresenter for a plain old itemscontrol wraps the textblock and is a direct child of the grid

691489
default	reset
now i want to be able to use the figure toolbar s zoom in out button to reset the view so that the x-axes limits are the default ie 0 100

691493
attributes	properties
i m parsing a large fixed width file and importing the data into sql via custom entities that i have mapped to the database using properties attributes

691496
member-function-pointers	function-pointers
pay attention to difference between free function-pointers and member-function-pointers initializations

691509
braces	macros
in languages with macros-expansion facilities c++ failure to include braces will cause confusing logic errors when a macros containing multiple statements is expanded inside of an unbraced if-else

691515
gunzip	tar
or you can read the man page for tar 1 since it probably has the ability to gunzip and extract together.

691516
.net	wcf
i would recommend checking out wcf instead of .net webservices - it gives you more flexibility more options reliable sessions which will deal with short network hiccups and it gives you easy support for mtom encoding for large messages and even supports streaming if you plan on serving up video or other content

691549
ruby-on-rails	django
symfony and akelos are very similar to ruby-on-rails close to django

691562
ms-access	oracle
i m assuming that oracle is following the spec in this case and ms-access is going beyond

691569
python	ruby
it now has support for ruby and python

691581
sql-server	oracle
on at least one server i ve used probably either oracle or sql-server about six years ago select distinct was rejected if you didn t have an order by clause

691581
sql-server	oracle
it was accepted on the other server oracle or sql-server

691607
user-stories	workitem
and a product backlog should look like a nice clearly prioritized list of user-stories delivered by your product owner on which you can give high level estimates and use as a basis for creating small development workitem otherwise know as sprint backlog items

691611
base-class	inherited
this particular convention defines what is deemed as simply a base-class in your code rather than something to be considered as part of an entity inherited hierarchy

691616
implements	abstract
thus simply declaring an abstract subclass of myclass that implements myinterface is not a suitable solution

691618
hypertable	hbase
if you want something like bigtable you can t go past hbase or hypertable - they re both open-source bigtable clones

691620
export	report
how can i can i set a report or the ssrs report viewer to export csv as ascii instead of unicode

691621
cakephp	symfony
i ve also heard some saying they work with cakephp or symfony but not as many

691647
children	nodes
but it turns out that the nodes list list has 5 children including t n instead of just two

691652
command-line	cmd
i have a command-line program which uses gnu readline primarily for command history retrieving previous cmd using up-arrow and some other niceties

691652
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu hardy linux 2.6

691661
firefox	opera
i have tested this in firefox opera safari and ie 8

691667
json	xml
ideally there would be a non-html based version of the e-shop so you would know you were working with valid xml json whatever but if there is no alternative you re stuck ripping the data out yourself

691668
constructor	object
it has no constructor because it s just a wrapper class around an unmanaged object

691674
haskell	scala
the equivalent of haskell s type classes in scala is done via implicits

691684
message	alert
however the enter keypress not only causes the form to submit but also causes the alert to immediately dismiss as if both the form and the message box are processing the enter key

691692
postback	ajax
in my webforms approach i would store my main product object on the view state and i would populate it s pricing info and details while doing ajax postback

691718
restart	exit
this will pretty much take care of creating task and restart it should application exit

691721
command-prompt	cmd
a good way to test whether your cmd is going to work is to actually try it from a cmd-prompt

691721
compact-framework	.net
from msdn the maximum string length is 2 003 characters in .net applications and 488 characters in .net compact-framework applications.

691735
telnet	ssh
one option would be to move from telnet to ssh and use ssh keys instead of passwords

691737
postgresql	mysql
i have just started working on a project and i am using zend framework and postgresql normally use mysql however i am hitting a problem when i am trying to get the last inserted id when using the zend_db insert command

691739
put	get
adding this to the system.web in web.config will enable http get and put

691752
zend-framework	codeigniter
if you like to go and stripes off pieces of code from different sources you might also want to try to import some of the modules from other frameworks like codeigniter or cakephp into zend-framework and that probably would be a fun and useful thing for you and if you d like to share maybe for all the community based around zf

691770
children	nodes
when you selected configuration a b you are selecteding all children of b which includes three text nodes and two elements

691778
double	int
i think bytes int and decimals will be fairly straightforward but i m a little unsure on the best way to handle singles and double since they can be very small or large and would appreciate any suggestions from those more clever than i

691784
contains	any
since the daily show s menu doesn t contains any visible html text its size won t be affected by text zoom though you might need a line-height 0

691787
children	nodes
does not selected all nodess that are children of the top nodes

691787
children	nodes
it does not selected any text nodes processing-instructions or comments that are children of the top element

691787
children	nodes
one xpath expression that selected all nodes that arte children of the top element is

691787
children	nodes
another note is that the abbreviation is not necessary in specifying the selection of all nodes that are children of the top element

691787
document	element
if you wanted to selected all nodes in the xml document that descend from the top element then one xpath expression that selected these is

691790
attributes	properties
this is less desirable as my form and model has many properties and i don t want to have to create and maintain a command that has each and every model attributes as a text field

691819
hide	show
what i m finding is that with the show hide code sat in the appdelegate i have to create a reference of the appdelegate in the loaded controllers in order to target the hide code

691822
value	field
with microsoft sql-server database you could store that data as typed xml and still be able to sort and serach data based on one or more value in that field

691826
instances	private
you should declare a private object variables to protect data belonging to the current instances or a private shared object variables to protect data common to all instancess.

691837
hide	show
show hide code sat in the appdelegate

691847
pointers	stack
you also can get pointers to some object which is created on stack etc

691849
ruby	php
so regardless if you use asp.net php ruby on rails or cobol you can t do it directly

691853
freebsd	osx
cons if you care if apple takes your code then it s not for you webkit in safari freebsd userland in osx

691856
photoshop	layer
use an image editor like photoshop or the gimp or whatever which has multiple layer

691875
any	set
do you have any authentication set up on your vm in iis

691885
xsd	xml
post your xsd or a sample of the xml code and i ll see if i can work out what you re trying to do

691891
children	nodes
of course you get back the resulting nodes and all its children

691894
perl	awk
writes scripts in a polyglot of the bourne shell sed c awk and maybe also perl

691894
least-squares	regression
writes a suite of scripting to monitor disk usage maintain a database of historic disk usage predict future disk usage via least-squares regression analysis identify users who are more than a standard deviation over the mean and send mail to the offending parties

691917
ms-access	oracle
we use delphi ms-access and oracle

691917
ms-access	oracle
we need move same table from oracle to ms-access for performance considerations

691917
ms-access	oracle
we still need to synchronize the data from ms-access to oracle for a period of time

691938
base-class	inherited
if db.productfamilies and db.productseriesset are inherited from the same base class then when you use productcollectioneftoproductcollectiondto base-class obj bool value

691953
difference	zero
you could for example compute the euclidean distance in rgb space between old and new pixels and emit a white pixel for zero difference light gray for a small difference darker for larger differences and so on

691960
persistent	transient
for example database access in php using mysql mysqli pdo etc is transient persistent connections notwithstanding whereas .net java will nearly always use persistent connection pools and build on top of this to create orm frameworks and the like the caches for which are beyond any particular request

691960
primitive-types	type-safety
bear in mind that .net has primitive-types type-safety and these sorts of things that will make code faster than php can run it

691960
32-bit	64bit
plus php on a 32-bit os won t have a native 64bit integer so will suffer hugely for that

691963
tokenize	parsing
i have used named tuples because the tokenize s client code the parsing seems a little clearer while using names token.value instead of indexes token 0

691970
webforms	asp.net
i m in the process of adding asp.net mvc to a webforms app

691989
classname	inherited
if not how difficult would it be to write an app that at bare minimum builds a self-referencing classname table so i could at least throw it into a database treeview component to easily view inherited ancestry etc

691991
contains	elements
i have a simple target wherein i want to extract the first elements out of a property that contains one or more comma separated words like this

692000
stderr	stdout
update stdout and stderr should still both be printed to the screen regardless

692009
stderr	stdout
to redirect stderr to a file display stdout to screen and also save stdout to a file

692009
stderr	stdout
edit to display both stderr and stdout to screen and also save both to a file you can use bash s i o redirection

692021
json	xml
json to xml is trivial

692037
attributes	properties
style properties and event handler need to be carefully written and those attributes that used to be minimized in html disabled multiple readonly have browser specific valid values

692037
attributes	properties
the properties name is .classname and the proper name for a label s for attributes is htmlfor

692058
height	frame
what is the height of the frame of the view

692062
push	pull
i got a permission denied error which led me to chown the entire repo recursively to the user i expected it to be and i could then commit push pull with no problem

692068
enterprise	platform
most of the platform is designed with enterprise development in mind

692068
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc tends to allow for less nesting using the webforms based view engine others are available

692068
lighttpd	apache
apache vs lighttpd etc

692077
selected	cells
excel will selected all of the cells that match

692078
primitive-types	reference-type
there are two kinds of types in the java programming language primitive-types â 4.2 and reference-type â 4.3

692083
mips	x86
in different assembly languages mul x86 mult mips refer to multiplication

692086
integer	zero
assuming total_calories and total_cost are some sort of integer data types each most_bang_for_buck_score will be zero

692102
panels	grid
if your purpose is to create a grid-style view with few cells you might be better off drawing the data and the associated grid lines into a single panels yourself

692126
authentication	login
my past experience in web-applications used form based login and sessions for authentication and authentication but i am not sure how to do this with flex apps with blazeds backends

692128
decimal	hex
no it s not hex it s decimal

692137
decimal	hex
it s not hex the number represents characters number in decimal in ascii table

692159
data-access	ado.net
contains all the data-access logic retrieving the data from the database with either linq of standard ado.net

692171
implements	abstract
i have concluded that implements an interface does not achieve this methods are instances only and that static-methods can not be marked override virtual or abstract

692182
malloc	free
register it when you malloc it de-register it when you free it

692184
webserver	security
it works well enough but it is a huge hit on the webserver because it sends it in one big upload plus i have to set it in the web.config to allow that huge of a file which is a huge security risk

692195
base-class	subclass
this makes sure that inheritance acts as expected and will call .foo in the right subclass instead of the base-class

692210
value	field
have a sentinel value that cannot occur in your real data to represent null e.g deoxyribonucleic for a surname field and hope that the movie stars don t start giving their kids weird surnames as well as weird first names -

692215
button	popup
if you re specifically talking about microsoft s asp.net forum click the code button looks like this alt text and paste your code into the windows that popup

692223
httphandler	httpmodule
httpmodule httphandler install by

692251
selected	button
the easiest way to go about it in silverlight 2.0 is to put a contentcontrol in your page along with navigation controls a menu or some button to selected pages if you have several root pages

692262
.net	wcf
see messaging enhancements in .net 4.0 discovery part i using ws-discovery in wcf 4.0

692271
selected	listbox
then just set style for the selected item on the listbox

692276
python	java
i would advise to just learn c and try to really understand the concept of pointers then move to other languages more adapted to the web python or javascript comes to mind - or even java

692282
decrement	increment
very simply why not have a reference counted implementation so when you create an object and pass it around you increment and decrement the reference counted number remember to be atomicity if you have more than one thread

692291
webforms	asp.net
but overall their stuff is good for winforms and traditional asp.net webforms applications

692292
decimal	hex
it s a hex number and is 16 decimal

692298
fclose	fopen
the next standard pattern is exemplified by fopen and fclose

692298
fclose	fopen
however this often becomes very similar to the first case - it is usually a good idea to call fclose in the function that called fopen too

692300
put	get
consider your services to be exchanges of documents in which you put in everything you need to get things done

692310
binary	hex
it s very useful in the computer world as a single hex digit represents four bits binary digits

692310
digits	base
in base 10 which we humans are used to the digits used are 0 through 9 and the number 7304 10 is

692310
digits	base
base 10 is used as previously mentioned by we humans with 10 digits on our hands

692310
binary	octal
base 8 is used almost exclusively in unix file permissions so that each octal digit represents a 3-tuple of binary permissions read write execute

692310
digits	base
base 16 is a convenient way to represent four bits to a digits especially as most architectures nowadays have a word size which is a multiple of four bits

i m assuming you want to still see stderr and stdout on the terminal

692407
logfile	tail
you could go for josh kelley s answer but i find keeping a tail around in the background which output your logfile very hackish and cludgy

692407
stderr	stdout
only instead of just using it for your stdout have a tee for stdout and one for stderr

692407
stderr	stdout
tee output its input back on stdout but since its input is our stderr we want to redirect tee s stdout to our stderr again

692407
shell	bash
process substitution is one of those really lovely things you get as a bonus of choosing bash as your shell as opposed to sh posix or bourne

692415
mediawiki	screwturn
a wiki such as screwturn or mediawiki is a good tool to document a project

portrait	screens
i ve set my director to landscape but when i was looking at the coordinates of the touch event it was still picking them up as though the screens was portrait

692613
msbuild	nant
i d advise you to use msbuild with conjunction with makefile nant or even simple batch file if your build-system is not as convoluted as ours.

692619
webserver	host
so probably you are running a webserver on the remote host

692619
python	java
so if you use http just write a little server side script in your favorite web developing platform .net php java python ror cgi whatever and just use guidelines on this webpage to submit the image on iphone

692623
lookup	any
i could do this by supplying a parameter to the stored procedure but i can t see any way of parameterising the query on the lookup transformation component

692634
animation	rotation
note i did find that i had to change the to and from properties on the animation to current angle and current angle+360 - lucky for me rotationtransform has no trouble with angles 360 degrees - to prevent starting the rotation over again from zero angle

692634
animation	rotation
continously applying new doubleanimations to the angle property on a rotation transform seems wrong - sort of like i am letting wpf animate the rotation while i am animation the rotation speed myself

692643
pointers	stack
no you will not be able to access t like that because even though in main you made t point to something on the heap which is globally accessible the variables t itself is a pointers which is local to main and located on stack

692654
arrays	loops
that s not how the javascript timeouts work - this happens onclick in your code you loops through the images arrays immediately switch images from 0th to 1st .

692667
put	get
just put in front of a local variables and you now have the key that allows any other part of the program to get at the storage for that variables and use it just as effectively as if they could see the variables name itself

692669
ubuntu	linux
i have a couple of linux ubuntu servers that work together every night to do some heavy processing

692686
python	java
of course they muddied the message by allowing you to have access to functions and they were not helped by the fact that it is not as easy to build up lists of maps of tuples read structured data without classes in java as it is in python ruby etc

692706
multi-user	account
only with real local database servers will you be able to have multi-user data on locked-down account machines

692723

edit be aware that omega and xapian are gpl whereas apache lucene is lgpl if i recall correctly

692750
constructor	object
there is no way to do an initialization after the object is created but before the constructor runs

692776
coding-style	indentation
when fixing the bug use the same coding-style tabs spaces indentation variables naming ... as the existing code

692786
constructor	object
in that case your class needs to have a copy constructor as push_back stores a copy of object

692804
ia-32	x86
see also intelâ 64 and ia-32 architectures optimization reference manual and instruction latencies and throughput for amd and intel x86 processors from can berk gã¼der s now-deleted link-only answer

692893
debian	linux
i m not tied to a linux distro so this can be for anything although debian or a debian-based distro would be nice

692893
hide	show
surely you can make a program which hide the boot messages and show a custom program

692907
installation	building
building a simple-to-install web app so that you can concentrate your efforts on making it better and selling it instead of working extra as a sysadmin or writing extensive installation tutorials

692909
buffering	capture
your function does not return the string it prints it therefore you will have to use output buffering if you want to capture the output

692913
textbox	button
the button is just so the textbox looses focus and updates the object

692928
contains	any
all other tables contains mainly static content save any new downloaded entries

692952

perhaps setting a flag to indicate the spacebar was pressed or if the row was already selected reset the value of the checkbox

692999
base-class	metaclass
the syncdb command inspects the meta object for each model to get a list of fields to create which is created on class construction time via the metaclass of the django.db.models.model base-class

692999
order	add
after the class construction is complete after the dedent following the class statement the meta object is fixed not affected by modifying the model class and you will have to hack the meta which is of course possible in order to add dynamic fields

693007
meta-inf	jar
it probably was named web-inf for similarity with the meta-inf directory in jar files

693007
linux	unix
for example bin directories in unix linux often contain non-binary executable files such as shell scripts

693008
meta-inf	jar
i believe it s really named web-inf to mirror the meta-inf directory in a jar file which contains meta information

693017
gitk	tig
i work only with the git command-line only rarely using gitk or tig to look at some fancy graphics

693033
python	ruby
there s always python and ruby

i connect to a solaris 10 server through ssh from my linux machine

693064
python	ruby
and of course ruby python erlang etc

693067
vba	vb6
for vb6 vba dynamic sql i always find it more readable to create an sql template and then use the replace function to add in the dynamic parts

693067
value	field
however in this case the value in the where-clause would change not the field themselves so you could rewrite this as

693068
checkbox	button
it s funier to manipulate windows button checkbox than int float double and not so much difficult

693074
wamp	php
my setup is windows xp wamp server 2.0 php 5 netbeans 6.5.1

693165
nmake	cmake
and if you need to build your project from the command-line or in a continuous-integration tool you use cmake to generate a makefile for nmake

693165
toolchain	cmake
and if you project is a cross-platform one - you can run cmake to generate the makefiles for the toolchain of your choice

693165
required	checked
for example if you consider using cmake with visual-studio there is some tweaking required to obtain the familiar vs project feeling main obstacle is to organize your header and source files but it is possible - checked the cmake wiki and by writting a short scripting you might even simplify this task

693182
restart	reload
if adding to a conf file don t forget to restart apache to reload the configuration

693182
http	ssl
if you are like me and want to use ssl only on particular pages then you also want a rewrite rule that sends you back to regular http for the rest

693182
rewrite	rule
that means your first rewrite rule to required ssl would go in the vhost.conf file but the second rule to force back to non-ssl will have to go in the vhost_ssl file

693182
httpd.conf	.htaccess
if you are using httpd.conf or .htaccess i think you can put them both in the same place

693191
google-webmaster-tools	sitemap
maybe itâ s true but i would suggest to follow the google guidelines and use robots.txt + submit the sitemap through google-webmaster-tools

693203
selected	listbox
is there a way to detect if the focused selected item is the last first visible item in the listbox

693217

693282
linked-list	tree
walking through memory with can be used for any sequenced container linked-list skip list vector binary tree b tree etc thanks to operator overloading

693287
pointers	stack
basically the compiler cannot assume that the pointers used by the function doesn t alias itself or anything else in that stack frame so it has to reload the value from the pointers every time it s used

693314
ubuntu	debian
for the initialization you have to look around the system used debian uses a sysv init style initialization ubuntu uses upstart

693315

gethashcode	equals
and provide gethashcode and equals

693348
msbuild	nant
like java s ant or nant before it msbuild uses an xml schema to describe the project and build

it is also possible that i may some day want to replace nhibernate with entity-framework or some other technology i am abstracting this out using a repository

693407
arrays	loops
if you want to loops through the elements in the arrays safely just use an enumerator

693410

boost is designed similarly to the stl so knowing your standard library is essential

693419
margins	padding
also it would help you get rid off margins and padding

693423
boost-variant	boost-any
boost-any and boost-variant are good of you need a variant data type with two different approaches

693427
asp.net-mvc	wcf
for the purposes of the client apps silverlight wpf etc i would probably expose them via a web page rather than a wcf etc call - some asp.net handler or asp.net-mvc route that returns the image via an http call

693433
groovy	java
java groovy or grails suggestions welcome

693442
moss	wss
if you have sharepoint wss 3.0 or moss 2007 then you already have blog wiki and discussion grouping functionality built-in

not sure if there is any way to destroy those instances as a way to clean up chart and legend

693481
contains	any
for any line contains both open bracket and close bracket

693501
variables	boolean
you can use the out modifier to write the result into a variables in the caller s scope and return a boolean flag to tell whether it succeeded

693507
binaries	install
yes these have install but you can simply copy the binaries around -- i use universal extractor to get the binaries out without having to run the install

693523
directory	folder
i then transformed this webapplication1 folder into virtual directory this virtual directory is also configured as web application

693539
jquery	.post

693550
implements	abstract
so far i have created modefactory as an interface and implements it into easymode and hardmode but now i need to somehow integrate another abstract factory-pattern or more into these modes so that the quotes can be chosen

693558
average	minimum
for all other objects in cluster k add them to either k1 or k2 by determining the minimum average distance to all other objects in that cluster

693558
average	minimum
to improve the efficiency you could alter step 3 so that you find the minimum distance to only the original object that started the cluster rather than the average distance to all objects already in the cluster

693610
winscp	putty
from a windows machine you can connect to an instances using tools like putty or winscp - you probably know about these if you are able to create a new image

double	int
print_r prints only the keys and values of the arrays opposed to var_dump whichs also prints the types of the data in the arrays string int double and so on

693670
readline	ncurses
maybe one option is to run readline external to your ncurses program

693679
ms-access	oracle
i would consider migrating the ms-access portion to ms sql oracle is possible too but i m not sure of the issues related to that

693679
ms-access	oracle
if there is something technological that forces you to use ms-access the easiest thing to do would be to just create an odbc link to the oracle table through ms-access

693679
ms-access	oracle
i also question the decision to move the table from oracle to ms-access

693679
ms-access	oracle
1 i m more trusting of oracle dbs right off the start and 2 ms-access jet is not known to be highly performing over oracle

693679
ms-access	oracle
so you are moving the problem from one server to another and you are adding to the network congestion by having to synchronise the ms-access table with the oracle table

693696
csv	xml
no need to fiddle with csv or xml formatting

693696
xlsx	xls
you can start with a existing xls file or xlsx and just fill in a named range

693704
checkbox	listbox
in the listbox i want to put a checkbox that s tied to the listbox s selected property

693800
microsoft.build	msbuild
inside the microsoft.build engine using msbuild and team foundation build

693802
32-bit	64bit
as an alternative to andrew medico s answer use -m32 for 32-bit compilations and -m64 for 64bit compilations on ppc or sparc or intel machines - since you don t actually mention which chip architecture you are using and that notation works on all of these

693802
32-bit	64bit
to ensure a 32-bit compilation or more frequently to ensure 64bit compilation

693802
command-line	cmd
the notation i used - which is what i use at the cmd-line - sets cc in the environment while the configure cmd is run

693807
arrays	loops
how can i choose post content and post title from the arrays without it being repeated in the while loops

693813
msbuild	nant

nant has more features out of the box but msbuild has a much better fundamental structure item metadata rocks which makes it much easier to build reusable msbuild scripting

693814
microsoft.build	msbuild
inside the microsoft.build engine using msbuild and team foundation build

693848
textbox	button
when the user clicks a button i want to iterate thru all these textbox and check if their binding expressions are clean of errors

693861
fadein	show
then it won t show until you fadein

693867
32-bit	64bit
edit i also got error_partial_copy with your code running on 64bit but only when the querying process was 32-bit

693869
configuration	environment
this could perhaps allow you to keep the consistent stuff in web.configuration and keep environment specific stuff in other configuration files

693883
arguments	undefined
so if the caller calls the function giving it some arguments the behavior is undefined

693883
arguments	undefined
they can cause severe danger because of those arguments promotions if the promoted arguments type do not match the parameter type of the function definition behavior is undefined either

693883
defined	declare
the second one defined that the function takes zero arguments and also communication that - like with all cases where the function is declare using a parameter type list which is called a prototype

693883
arguments	default
if no parameter type list is present that can t be done and arguments are converted to promoted types that is called the default argument promotion

693883
double	int
char will become int for example while float will become double

693886
virtual-memory	paging
a shuffle on a huge arrays involves accessing pages of virtual-memory in a way that by definition will defeat the os s paging system on a smaller scale the same problem would occur with the cpu s memory cache

693891
msbuild	nant
if you were using msbuild and wanted to know why would you switch to nant then the answer is theres no real reason to switch

693891
msbuild	nant
at least you know msbuild isnt going anywere nant hasnt been updated since december 2007

693915
http	ssl
securing team foundation server with http and secure sockets layer ssl

693923
detect	move
the webpage will also have to detect when it closes or the user move to another page and kill the ajax request and also restart it if it errors or times out

693933
typedef	struct
unary_function and binary_function are just two struct that add typedef

693953
factors	primes
this xpath 2.0 expression defines the maximum primes factors of a natural number

693953
factors	primes
to pronounce it in english the maximum primes factors of a number pnum is the number itself if pnum is primes otherwise if vdiv1 and vdiv2 are two factorss of pnum then the maximum primes factors of pnum is the bigger of the maximum primes factorss of vdiv1 and vdiv2

693953
factors	primes
how do we use this to actually calculate the maximum primes factors in xslt

693960
visualstatemanager	itemscontrol
i am trying to figure out if it is possible to apply triggers animation to on each of the items in the itemscontrol when the visualstatemanager puts the itemscontrol in a particular state

693970
cross-compiling	toolchain
you would need a toolchain to cross-compiling for mach-o but even if you had that you won t have the apple libraries around to develop with

694000
stderr	stdout
my goal is to launch a child process wait for it to finish and then use its stdout in my parent process by referring to p.stdout while letting stderr just print to wherever it would otherwise

694007
itemtemplate	treeview
i m using databinding and an itemtemplate to populate the treeview

694012
cross-compiling	toolchain
in theory it s possible to the the sources to the apple gcc and toolchain as well as the apple kernel and library headers and build a cross-compiling on your windows machine

694029
getter	setter
since the main difference in java and c# are object definitions i would get those by reflecting the c# dlls and then reconstruct the constructs then it would be easy to have an interpreter run through and implements the function bodies and convert properties to getter setter already knowing the structure of the files

694032
emacs	vim
i keep hearing about how many people use emacs vim on a daily basis

694032
emacs	vim
i know how to use vim and emacs but for day-to-day programming i just use an ide as i find myself being more productive

694032
emacs	vim
this is not a vim vs emacs question so please don t argue one against the other please instead argue graphical ide against console ide

694032
emacs	vim
as i m already familiar with graphical ides am i likely to gain any productive advantage by using emacs vim instead

694032
emacs	vim
however to someone who uses a standard gui text editor i d probably say that they should use emacs vim

694032
scite	emacs
scite user wants to know if they should use emacs

694041
emacs	vim
i know people who swear by vim and people who swear by emacs

694045
emacs	vim
using emacs after knowing vim will make that task somewhat annoying

694054
applescript	vba
since word 2008 doesn t have vba you ll need to use applescript

694085
libjpeg	libpng
for jpeg it s libjpeg for png it s libpng

694086
libjpeg	libpng
for jpeg there is already a library called libjpeg and there is libpng for png

694114
placeholder	required
one way is put a content placeholder at the bottom of your master page then the specific slave page that needs the javascript can specify the placeholders contents as the required javascript

694116
virtualbox	vmware
download a copy of either vmware s vmware server or sun s virtualbox and install a few operating systems

694116
windows-xp	windows
get images for windows-xp windows vista and mac os x

694116
javascript	dom
lookup his series douglas crockford theory of the dom douglas crockford advanced javascript douglas crockford theory of the dom and douglas crockford the good parts on yahoo

694122
properties-file	war
personally i wouldn t store configuration information like that in context.xml perhaps in another properties-file or something but the general way for something like this is to have your build script package different versions of the configuration file into the war ear whatever

694135
credentials	integrated
iâ m aware of why this happening integrated auth forcing the browser to resend credentials but iâ m looking for some thoughts on how to minimise or eradicate the situation

694139
instance-variables	subclass
in my uiimage subclass i declared instance-variables

694155
any	set
i can initialize it without any properties set but the templates directory defaults to . so i generally set that one do it before running init

694160
lookup	any
thus encrypting both makes it harder to lookup the user but doesn t add any additional security

694160
hash	md5
most people encrypt their passwords using a one-way hash function of some sort md5 and sha256 are popular along with a salt

694164
emacs	vim
since vi vim and emacs are pretty close in terms of what they can or cannot do productivity with these two editors comes from experience in using it

694175
environment	building
if you shared a bit more of your building environment there might be a better way - there are plugins to provision a number of servers

694178
webserver	host
if you are using some shared hosting plan there should be an option in your host control panel to see the webserver log files

694209
32-bit	16-bit
one of the guys went and changed all ints to shorts to speed up our code since grabbing 16-bit from ram was quicker than grabbing 32-bit

694209
32-bit	16-bit
i had to write a demo program to show that grabbing 32-bit values on a 32-bit system was faster than grabbing 16-bit values and explain that to grab a 16-bit value the cpu had to make a 32-bit wide memory access and then mask out or shift the bits not needed for the 16-bit value

694220
placeholder	required
the closest methods would be using placeholder and printf but that required an explicit call to a function not an implicit substitution

694223
driver	kernel
please be aware that a filesystems driver is the most complex undocumented thing you can do in the windows kernel

694223
driver	kernel
if you have no prior kernel experience but you have say ten years experience programming operating systems in c you are looking at two to three years full time work to produce a filesystems driver

694226
webforms	asp.net
things that are only possible with asp.net webforms

694226
webforms	asp.net
but i wonder if there are some obvious things we will not be able to do with asp.net mvc when compared to webforms or places where we will have to spend a lot of time with asp.net mvc

694263
cassini	iis
as jimmie r houts suggested use iis rather than cassini for a start

694265
ports	dmz
locking down the os reducing the attack surface services ports install apps ie no interactive users or mixed workloads configure firewalls rpc to respond only to specified management dmz or internal hosts

694279
buffering	streaming
is a streaming api - meaning that data is lazily returns as you ask for it via iterator blocks rather than loading everything at once and returning a big buffering of records

694288
httpd.conf	.htaccess
another option is using apache s mod_alias to do a permanent redirect in either .htaccess or httpd.conf

694290
numerical	matrix
if you have a 3x3 arrays of numbers and you want to perform a transformation on every element of it i suspect you may be better served in the long run by using a numerical library like numpy scipy and using the matrix routines it provides

694291
environment	building
i ve been using stylecop as a part of a teamcity building environment

694293
msbuild	nant
i dare say this is partly due to my background in ant but i found building a nant file for protocol buffers to be a much simpler job than building an msbuild file for miscutil

694293
msbuild	nant
i currently like using a setup which i previously thought was really silly - i use nant for my main build file but invoke msbuild to do the actual compile my .net project step

694294
short	zero
django s documentation is one of the best available so if you have zero knowledge of django or even python you can do pretty amazing things in fairly short time

694299
show	next
as you can see i added u commands up so as to show where the next child would be created

694310
credentials	ntlm
i believe you can convince firefox to automatically send ntlm credentials to a whitelisted set of domains via about config settings - use the network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris setting

694313
3-tier	n-tier
tier is often used in reference to 3-tier applications gui business-objects logic database access or n-tier applications

694314
firefox	safari
validating your javascript with a good parts + browser on jslint.com makes it less likely to have javascript behaving difirefoxerently in firefox safari etc

694347
python	java
no jython cannot replace java because python is dynamically typed

694355
python	java
there presently is no pythonic language with feature parity with java -- and such a language would necessarily be incompatible with python as python simply doesn t provide a way to express some of the relevant concepts such as interface typing information

694365
any	set
the virtualbox support is bleeding-edge not in any release may not even be in source control yet but is available as a set of patches on the mailing list -- but this single api available for c python and several other languages lets you control virtual machines and images running in qemu kvm xen lxc linux containers uml user-mode linux openvz and others

694374
persistent	transient
rich domain objects required references to many components but these objects get persistent or serialization so any references they hold to outside components spring beans in this case services repositories anything are transient and get wiped out

694374
repository	entity
when object is loaded from repository or other responsible entity since the component references are transient and obviously don t get persisted

694392
webforms	asp.net
microsoft asp.net 4.0 data access patterns for success with webforms

694396
webforms	asp.net
i m using asp.net 3.5 webforms microsoft access 2003 jquery iis 5 and win xp professional as web server

694407
json	xml
both xml and json are supported by microsoft

694416
entity-framework	ado.net
at first you need to install latest version of ado.net entity-framework form below link

694418
set	bag
if you want to use ilist use first rule i.e change your hbm.xml to use bag instead of set also your phonenumbers class should inherit from ilist not list if you want to use list you will need to change your mapping file to use list instead of set

694421
command-line	cmd
i ve had problems with the tortoise move facility too apart from it being difficult to accomplish with a touchpad and have switched to using the cmd-line svn move cmd when i need to move something

694428
python	ruby
obviously the world for web development is moving towards dynamically typed languages as python or ruby

694434
svnadmin	dump
although i m sure there s technically a way of using svnadmin dump and dumpfilter to do this trick it would be a dodgy rewriting of history to say the least and require rebuilding your repository

694467
environment	building
msbuild allows you to have build environment as much similar to development visual-studio environment for example when building with msbuild postbuild events are executed you don t have to manually maintain a list of .cs files to csc task ...

694467
msbuild	nant
where i work we are currently using nant scripting with msbuild task from nantcontrib

694472
constructor	object
you can just use default constructor so you can instantiate object of type t with the new constraint

694472
constructor	object
then class a can have a virtual or abstract to your liking method that takes an int as an argument and initializes the object after the constructor has run

694472
constructor	object
if you intend some sort of factory pattern you don t need to hesitate initializing parts of an object outside the constructor call as long as it is done before you return the object to the caller s control

694503
ubuntu	linux
i am using the linux flex builder with eclipse 3.3 on my ubuntu 8.04 machine for the very first time and i need to modify a preexisting flex project

694518
standard-library	boost
after reading beyond the c++ standard-library an introduction to boost i would recommend casually browsing the documentation on boost.org just to get an idea of what s available

694523
contains	any
that s why you get the none of the test reports contains any result message

694527
versioning	migrate
the older versioning are available and maintained primarily to support users who don t want to migrate j2ee versioning

694550
quirks-mode	doctype
yes it works without a doctype but that s because browsers enter their quirks-mode in that case

694557
json	xml
xml to json and back to xml

694561
postgresql	mysql
if on the other hand you need to access the data from multiple programs or computers at the same time than again sqlite is not an optimal choice and you need a real database server ms sql oracle mysql postgresql ...

694578
radtreeview	radchart
radeditor radchart radtreeview and

694594
asp.net-mvc	webforms
is there any particular website that would make sense to use asp.net-mvc versus webforms

694601
uiimage	nsdata
another question is that i can convert uiimage to nsdata using

694612
asp.net-mvc	webforms
also even though it is possible to intermix asp.net-mvc with webforms i don t see retrofitting existing apps as a viable alternative unless there is significant other work to be done

694625
entity-framework	ado.net
but everytime i try to save my contact which is validated i get the exception ado.net entity-framework an entity object cannot be referenced by multiple instances of ientitychangetracker

694626
subclassing	base-class
i would like to specify it in a base-class and make all subclassing use it but whenever i try to enable it hibernate fails to find the filtering

694627
linux	osx
first of all with my osx linux background i m not an ie6 expert at all

694641
show	next
getpwd.vbs simply uses the password object to input the password from the user and then print it to standard output next paragraph will explain why that doesn t show up in the terminal

694641
windows-xp	windows
scriptpw is loaded by default on windows-xp and windows 2003

694641
windows-vista	windows
if youâ re running windows 2000 or windows-vista you will need to copy the scriptpw.dll file from the windows system32 folder of an xp system or windows 2003 system to the winnt system32 or windows system32 folder on your windows 2000 or vista system

694641
command-prompt	cmd
then right-click on the cmd-prompt shortcut and selected â œrun as administrator.â once at the cmd-prompt as administrator youâ ll be able to successfully run the regsvr32 scriptpw.dll cmd to register the dll

694649
constructor	object
i ve never used the class and i can t see anything in the draft c++0x spec to explain why the constructor is silently creating an object which doesn t do what you told it to

694651
functional-programming	imperative
i had this idea of showing people 2 set of code that does exactly the same thing one coded in a very imperative way and the other in a very functional way to show that functional-programming can made code way shorter easier to understand and thus maintainable

694671
hide	next
in your gc page administer|tabs then check the hide checkbox next to source

694677
python	ruby
the advantages to ruby or python is that they are dynamic languages so you can use duck typing

694677
python	ruby
but i have to agree that ruby python might be the closest out of the box

694694
reflection	runtime
if you think about it a type parameter is resolved at compile time whereas the system.type is resolved by reflection at runtime

694710
g++	gcc
compiles with both g++ and gcc

694711
ref	out
â a property cannot be passed as an out or ref parameter to a methods

694711
value	field
a field returns the same value each time

694711
any	set
words a user of a type should be able to set various properties defined by a type in any

694713
put	get
i know i can put the other assemblies in my project and set them to embedded resource but how do you get them back out again meaning how do you get it to a place where i can instantiate classes defined in that embedded assembly

694721
getter	setter
in particular having seen java code with several getter and setter being called in the same statement i know that the equivalent c# code would be a lot simpler to read

694738
haskell	python
in python for example you can reimplement the haskell qsort crackmigg posted like so

694745
contains	set
the left cell contains the tabs has a right border set to be the divider between the tabs and the content

694745
firefox	safari
this mechanism works fine in firefox and safari but does not work in ie7

694751
databound	gridview
so the question is this - is there any way to discover the individual row heights of the first databound gridview such that i can alter the other gridview to correctly align

694758
getter	setter
when using and writing them i just think of properties as setter and getter which a much nicer syntax

694762
any	set
these methods will set up any test data i need in the db and delete any test data when i m done

694773
administration	enterprise
if your app is going to be deployed in the enterprise keep in mind that administration can tweak the registry using grouping policy tools

694790
contains	elements
this is because if you are searching a list that may contains boolean you need to be able to distinguish the case of finding a #f from the case of not finding the elements you are looking for

694808
ref	out
out or ref parameter to a methods

694808
value	field
how do you know the field s value has not changed possibly by another thread

694808
getter	setter
most of the protestations could be said for java s getter and setter too --and we had them for quite a while without such problems in practice

694820
web-applications	security
i have done a similar research in jaas for web application and has ran into a mind roadblock until i finally realize jaas is a framework tackling security at a different layer then web-applications in the java world

694826
conditional	operators
operators this is called the conditional operators

694828
persistence	hibernate
i can tell you that orm solutions like hibernate make it possible to have pojo persistence without having to resort to common abstract classes interfaces or modifying byte code

694828
persistence	hibernate
i m inferring that it s possible to get that independence between business-objects and persistence tier without having to resort to those interfaces because i know hibernate does it

694835
conditional	operators
the conditional ternary operators can definitely be overused and some find it quite unreadable

694851
build-process	ant
you define the build-process in xml and ant compiles your java files according to this recipe

694855
xml-serialization	xml
when using the boost_serialization_nvp macro to create a name-value pair for xml-serialization the compiler happily allows the following code to compile even though the element name is not a valid xml element and an exceptions is thrown when trying to actually serialize the object into xml

694871
build-process	ant
my typical build-process with ant goes something like this

694871
code-coverage	cobertura
run the cobertura instrumentation on the source this is for code-coverage

694871
code-coverage	cobertura
run the unit tests via cobertura to get code-coverage of them

694874
cobertura	emma
i prefer cobertura over emma

694876
put	get
you can put your product id in a hidden-field and get its value in page_init using

694878
triggers	insert
in sql-server 2000 when there is an error in a trigger you get no stack trace which can make it really tricky to locate where the problem occurred since an insert can have a cascading effect and trigger many triggers

694878
environment	execution
debugging environment where you can pause then output the value of variables and step to follow the execution path

694887
communication	messages
messages are for communication between windows

694888
upgrade	migrate
i migrate an 1.1 app to 1.2 and i had nothing to do except running the automatic upgrade scripting

694906
directory	folder
my 2nd problem was because of the crazy directory structure i had to ftp to about 3 folder at the same time for trivial changes

694912
selected	listbox
on load i decide to play the songs of myplaylist so i ask you do you know some way how to show the songs of my playlist in a listbox and when i click on the selected item i will change songs

694927
children	nodes
also querying the children of a nodes is not easy and very slow

694936
firebird	mysql
when going with a network share i would go with a network enabled database mysql firebird mssql instead of access

694947
hosts-file	hosts
i have tried pointing the application to 127.0.0.1 via iis and then putting username.site.com in the hosts to point to 127.0.0.1 - but it does not work out

694947
hosts-file	hosts
also tried putting just site.com - 127.0.0.1 in the hosts and accessing username.site.com

694950
keyboard	mouse
i ved developed a c# application that captures screens using bitblt and sends keyboard and mouse events using calls to keybd_event and mouse_event

694950
keyboard	mouse
i have done all of these to get the application to run under elevated priviledges under vista but when uac dialog appear it does not capture those screens and the keyboard and mouse events do not reach the uac dialog

694953
lookup	any
this allows you to use gettext while at the same time perform any lookup on a per-module-per-call-base that allows you to switching locale as well

694971
button	popup
when i run the applet i click a popup saying start program and then the picture i want is in the applet windows itself and the column of button is in another windows by itself

694974
contains	any
yes parent_id contains redundant information potentially denormalizing your table -- but since any insert update delete already requires global changes keeping parent_id up-to-date isn t much extra to pay

694977
selected	listbox
to change the song being played you just need to add selectedvaluechanged selecteditemchanged event and in this event get the file path that is currently selected in the listbox then have wmp played it for you

694990
contains	lookup
you d probably need a lookup matrix contains the items to be compared

695003
32-bit	64bit
one issue we had was going from 32-bit to 64bit which meant all threads were duplicated

695012
swing	awt
it s a iteration of swing awt

695029
datagridview	datalist
have you considered using datalist instead of datagridview

695038
web-inspector	webkit
i would like to use the webkit web-inspector in a custom browser based on webkit on os x

695047
ado	jet
yes you can get away with alike in a jet 4.0 ole db inquiry from vb6 using ado

695061
static-members	non-static
a static class also can not be inherited from whereas a non-static class with static-members can be inherited from

695063
value	field
after trying the dependency mechanism works fine - but simply not needed looking at announcements thanks james at cincom - personal communication i found that all i needed to do was to simply create a methods and send it a message with a parameter my value that methods then simply updated the value holder the aspect of the gui field with the value message

695067
static-classes	static-class
static-classes can be declared when there is no dependence on the its own object identity so a static-class must contains only static members

695071
constructor	object
wrong fields can marked read-only so only the object s constructor can write to them

695073
entity-framework	nhibernate
in any case hibernate and nhibernate natively support pi but the initial version of microsoft s entity-framework does not

695081
constructor	private
before static classes came in c# 2.0 people would often create an abstract class with a private constructor which prevented instantiation

695081
static-classes	abstract-class
static-classes are implicitly abstract they re compiled to il which describes an abstract-class but you can t add the abstract modifier yourself

695106
click	mouse
you can simulate mouse movements and click with java s robot class

695116
csv	xml
furthermore one has to wonder is sending of an email an inherent ability of an order or yet another thing that can be done with it like persisting it serialization to different formats xml csv excel etc

695117
sql-server	oracle
sql-server integration services can do that or oracle s sql developer

695117
sql-server	oracle
however views and stored procedures are different between oracle and sql-server

695117
sql-server	oracle
sql-server uses t-sql oracle uses pl sql

695144
put	get
and for large number of strings you can put them in an arrays and use implode to get a string out of them

695191
background-image	width
or use a background-image on the body but that s less scalability and can t be used for percentage width

695196
element	dynamic
if however and this is more likely the case you are trying to get this to be dynamic why not just use a div element like so

695200
centering	fixed
if you re centering area is of fixed width then you can produce an image with that width one pixels high and then write the following css

695201
selected	checkbox
binding a list of items works fine and i get a beautiful listview with checkbox but i would like to have them all selected immediately

695215
dictionary	arrays
in actionscript 3 is there any convenient way of determining if an associative arrays dictionary has a particular key

695220
winpe	dos
the main problem will be restoring a system volume where you will need another os to boot to like winpe or dos or something else

695220
filesystems	fat
even if you are doing simple file backups it helps to understand filesystems ntfs fat etc so that you know what you can should backup and restore

695249
wavefront	.obj
bill dudney has a post here about how he started getting into opengl-es and then a follow-on here where he provides code for a wavefront .obj loader for the iphone

695263
design-time	designer
however i don t see anything at design-time using visual-studio 2008 s xaml designer

695269
listbox	textbox
i m trying to put a textbox to search in a listbox

695269
object-reference	instances
when i write down in the seachtext to find a songs i receive an error object-reference not set to an instances of an object. in the line selectedindexchanged of the listbox

like martin said quartz.net is really powerful for writing scheduled services and gives you more flexibility than plain scheduled-tasks

695437
driver	kernel
when you get around your initial set of blue screens see below for my debugging tip in kernel mode the filtering mode driver is quite easy to use .

695437

695654
nmake	jam
already make gnumake nmake jam and

695678
order	join
in my provider i can easily get back the 2 resultsets from customers and order if the data was from a sql source i would just construct and pass on the sql join syntax but it this case the data is not from a sql source so i need to do the join in code...but as i said i have the 2 result sets and linq to objects can do a join... and later the projection it would be real nice to just substitute the expression constants and with and and let a provider process the expression...is that possible

696017
document	element
i know little about php and nothing about minixml but what comes to mind is that maybe you ve got an input buffering that s 100k in size and so when it s fed into minixml the close tag is missing from the top-level element in the document

696035

it seems as though update or insert triggers that the merge publication works off of are not getting called when the transactional subscription performs the insert or update

696357
directory	folder
i prefer the following code snippet as it creates a folder inheriting default rights - which seems the right thing to do - other software the user might have setup specific inheritable rights on a directory for a legitimate reason - then adds a full control explicit access entry for the built in users grouping

696776
samba	svn
therefore we are using samba shares with an svn checkout on them

696776
versioning	upgrade
so essentially any action on the checkout using tortoisesvn upgrade the internal structure of the checkout and thus it can t be used on server side anymore since the client versioning is too old

696783
samba	svn
the other option would be to have a separate working copy for samba shares and for running those svn scripts you mention

696806
umask	sudo
to achieve that you would need to write wrapper scripting for the svn commands that set the proper umask or give all involved users the ability to act as one specific user through sudo

696811

but of course you don t have to test because if it s already running and you restart it it ll exit with other instances already running

696868
sql-server	mysql
not sure if this will work in mysql but in sql-server you could create a function

696869
reflection	runtime
the first one is to use reflection to generate a class at runtime for the binding as suggested in this article thanks to vladimir bodurov

696874
python	php
my background is in php and i expected that in python you can create lists that start with index 0 make gaps and then fill them up but it seems you can t

696919
constructor	object
object constructor can do important logic that is not exposed to the consumer

696919

allowing developers to extend built-in types using extension methods allows all and sundry to start adding their favourite pet methods to the string class which can end up with a bewildering arrays of options or requires more policing of coding standards to weed these out

696930
contains	set
first i get an error trying to compile this saying that it must contains a body because it is neither abstract nor extern or that automatic parameters must have both get and set accessors

vis is the idea of an user-interface which actually adapts to the needs of the particular user or his environment including vision impairment tactile preferences mouse or keyboard preferred language to better suser-interfacet right-to-left languages preferred visual presentation button order mac-style or windows-style better use of available space corporate identity etc

696995
any	set
i m guessing it could as user_id can be set by any global

697013
default-value	default
use .get and you can specify the default-value to use for the blank cells or alternatively use collections.defaultdictionary to define a default at dictionary creation time

697013
tuples	set
if the list of tuples is likely to be long the for performance reasons you may want to use a set for the lookup as x y in tuples performs a scan of the list rather than a fast lookup by hash

697024
getter	setter
do funny things with your apart getter and setter

697024
contains	set
you ll lose some strong-typing but if you make apart an object and mainclass contains the collection of part s you can set it by id int or part

697053
getter	setter
for an automatic property you always need both a getter and setter

697064
restart	exit
if the exit status is not 0 until will run the loop body which emits an error message on stderr and restart the loop back to line 1 after 1 second

697087
value	field
but i have another field nos1 with multiple value in table1 that also pointing to table2 i use it like this

697100
any	set
export the path in case of linux or set the ant_home bin to the path variables to access it from any directory in the shell

697102
contains	any
also the function is quite redundant in that it checks the string twice basically saying does the string contains any of these characters

697107
updating	updates
when using a presentation model you do not need to worry about accidentally returning fields a certain user should not be allowed to see or accidentally updating fields that the user should not be allowed to updates because you did not get a whitelist correct

697134
python	perl
what is the python equivalent of following perl code

697147

697182
gridview	datalist
you can always use asp.net s data controls such as repeater gridview datalist to display collections of item

697203
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and the webkit-based browsers notably safari and google-chrome

697220

what you could do is get a virtual-machine appliance for source code control and issue management like vmtrac and either run it directly or pick it apart and figure out how it was put together

697238
persistence	hibernate
if it matters the persistence implementation is hibernate

697251
profiling	trace
it was possible to trace down a lot of these using a profiling and then explicitly deal with resource cleanup in the servlet s destroy method

there is a package for connecting to a .net application just search .net mysql library and it should turn up with java you can use hibernate or any other orm framework and set the dialect to whichever version of mysql you re using in the hibernate.config file

697266
double	int
convert.tostring expands on that and provides some specific overloads for primitive-types char byte int double etc. that allow for some more type-specific functionality like base conversion for example

697271
javascript	dom
is there any event to be handled between the dom loaded and load using prototype javascript framework

697271

it seems that ie is not append the second handler to the onload handler list so when the first one is trying to get height of any of columns it returns 0 coz it s still display as none

697278
decimal-point	digits
because precision for a single-precision 32-bit floating-point value is around 7 digits after the decimal-point

and then the digits after the zero disappear in rounding

697297
oracle	mysql
there are providers for mysql oracle

697322
webforms	asp.net
using controls built for asp.net webforms with mvc can be either very tricky or even impossible depending on the control

contains	any
find all items contains any case version of ra returns items 0 2 and 3

697337
environment	restart
also you may need to restart your interpreter and the shell that launched it for the change to the environment variables to take effect

697346
methods	extend
if by extend built in types you mean extension methods - again this is nothing new just better syntax

697351
constructor	object
object initializers simply allow the client to set properties immediately after construction no control is relinquished as the caller must still ensure all of the constructor arguments are satisfied

697351
icollection	ienumerable
extension methods -- i would use very sparingly but they are very useful for extending the .net types with convenience methods especially ienumerable icollection and string

697363
any	set
you are trying to set the line-height in your sifr-config.js but i don t think that will have any effect

697366
.when	ready
it looks like the app is ready to receive input .when it is not and that s confusing

697369
internet-explorer	firefox
they want it to work in such a way that if a user logs in via internet-explorer that when they login via firefox on the same machine or via ie on another machine that it kills the first session

697370
any	set
the thing is i don t want to use the time server hours days etc because i want the user to be able to set the clock to any time regardless of time zone but for it to still synchronize

697374
python	java
i think python is natively object oriented like java that s why they match so good

697374
perl	ruby
i don t expect something like that from other scripting languages like perl but for sure ruby and groovy are also good alternatives

697385
buffering	streaming
it seems that once dataavailable property is true i read the data from streaming and dataavailable is then temporary set to false while buffering is being filled with another chunk of data but i think is all read and go away

697386
order	add
use the mousechildren property in order to disable all mouse events of the loader.content object and then add a single click event on the loader for navigation to the banner s target page

697388
stdout	stdio
well you could start a new cmd.exe process and use stdio and stdout to send and recieve data

697401
hash	md5
if the md5 implementation is dependent on machine word size i haven t checked the code this can cause the hash to be different

697418

697424
instances	destroy
i destroy all instances and all key pairs

697436
.when	ready
a simpler solution may well be to write to a different filename foo.tmp and then rename it to foo.xml .when it s ready - the rename is atomicity on most operating systemd within a directory so .when the other process sees the xml file it should be complete

697439
telnet	tcp
is this an actual telnet connection are you connecting to a telnet server or by telnet do you really mean tcp ip socket

697491
subtract	time
get the server time subtract n hours set the local time

697536
environment	building
building environment msbuilding and vs will take care of copying that file themselves

697544
crossover	mutation
the problem is that every variables i have is a matrix and the crossover fitness and mutation codes get pretty complicated

697557
document	element
of course this only applies if you are attempting to resize the iframe from it s parent element the document with the actual iframe tag

697557
document	element
if you are trying to resize the iframe from within the iframe the document the iframe loads you will need to call a public function of the parent element to perform the resize

697560
binary-tree	tree
copying directory from source tree to binary-tree

697579
entity-framework	data-access
linq to sql hasn t either but it is not microsoft s strategic platform for data-access that would be entity-framework

i really want to know your experience at working with ado.net datasets calling stored-procedures from sql and crystal reports i know about the 2-4 seconds to

697617
put	get
for example if you put non-numeric characters in a number field you can get a parsing error

697617
put	get
if you put a zero in where it isn t anticipated you can get a divide by zero error

697617
put	get
if you put a much larger value in than is expected or a negative when not expected or any number of other things you can get an error of some sort

697618
32-bit	64bit
for instance one might declare a variables using int_fast16_t but it would actually be implemented as an int32_t on a 32-bit processor or int64_t on a 64bit processor as those would be the fastest types of at least 16-bit on those platforms

697633
cell-array	textscan
you can read the strings into a cell-array using textscan like so

697638
inlining	inline
inlining the whole thing is not really neccesary you can inline the dynamic part and leave the other part hardcoded

697647
firefox	opera
this works like a charm in firefox 3.0.x ie7 and opera 9.6.x

697650
value	field
password .. the value of that field

697668
button	popup
i m not really sure i totally understand your problem but what i think you are trying to say is that when you drag a portlet it s supposed to be binding a click event listener to the setup wrench button on your portlet so that when it s clicked a dialog popup

697668
button	popup
and you are saying that when you click on that wrench a dialog popup for all your portlets and not just the one you clicked the button inside of

697730
version-control	cvs
assuming you re using a non-distributed version-control system such as cvs you will have a repository on the central server and work in progress on developers servers

697730
cvs	git
we have an automated backup system that grabs any directories off our our machines which we specify so i add any repositories and working copies on my machine to that last including both git and cvs repositories

697733

.when it s ready you can signals the other process giving it the offset into your shared-memory where the data begins

697749
python	ruby
i ve seen some custom code written in ruby for a specific project where the output is post-processed to make this possible but when i looked at the feasibility for python wrappers it does not look so easy

697762
javascript	dom
there s no such event afaik and even the dom loaded event is implemented by prototype developers and that s not a default event in javascript

697763
contains	any
i remote debugging because the runtime environment on the debugging server is production-like and doesn t contains any development tools access to the source code etc.

697767
margins	padding
i just turn off borders and padding and margins and throw each div into a cell in its own row and maybe fiddle with max-height on the controls div

i would say that if you can add you can then use it to subtract multiply and divide using addition

697778
populate	row
the newpage above loads the fields of the object into editable fields populate with the existing values of the row

697784
chmod	sudo
sudo chmod 777 shoes2.run

697786
jquery	.post
if you could .post your jquery code and the css you are using that would help a lot

697809
populate	row
based on your updated question it sounds like you are simply trying to display a form populate with information from a given database row and update that database row when the form is submitted

697809
getter	setter
the updaterecordcommand should be defined with the following fields and setter getter

697819

when the scrollbar appear the bottom part of the is actually missing and furthermore the bottom part of the scrollbar is missing due to the top margin

697847
order	add
now in order to access the object owned by the view controllers you ll need to add a property to rootviewcontrollers

697851
callback	methods
just for clarification when you add the parens it is a literal methods call whereas without the parens it is a reference to the methods these assignments work like callback expecting a delegate methods reference

697859
jndi	jms
if all you are using from jboss is jms or jndi or something else that is easily embeddable as a separate 3rd party component in tomcat then by all means drop jboss and move to just an embedded tomcat

pointers	stack
i get a stack overflow unless i set the variables as a pointers and use the getmem freemem commands below but then i can t save it

697979
arrays	loops

697996
activation	account
we will send out an activation code via snail mail long story and the user can return with that info and activate their account

698017
click	mouse
however it provides a usability improvement for mouse users because if the user click on the text within the label element it toggles the control

698019
activation	account
if you are sending them the activation code in an email have a anonymous access page which receives the activation code from the email perhaps via querystring activates the account and redirects them to a login page with forms-authentication activated assuming the username and password are already created

698021
unsigned	integer
for a integer as small as an unsigned char you get best performance using a small lookup-table

698024

698041
default	reset
one way not necessarily ideal is to reset the value to their default using javascript

698043
lgpl	gpl
that means i can t give the code no gpl and i guess no lgpl

698067
fltk	gtk
using lgpl you have many other options including gtk qt as of 4.5 fltk etc

698071
packets	ping
for example if you ve defined in steps 2 3 a packets type called ping you might have a table called ping in your database to hold that data

698076
directory	folder
i ve found using the findfirstflashcard findnextflashcard apis to be more reliable than enumerating directory and checking the temporary flag which will return bluetooth shared folder for example

698079
keyboard	mouse
that way it won t be able to access stage mouse and keyboard events and certain others and there won t be any class definition conflicts

698081
export	csv
i m using csvde to export data from our active-directory into a csv file which then gets imported into a database

698089
python	tcl
fwiw i ve not worked with python swig but have done tcl swig

698106
instance-variables	accessor
in objective-c you need to define accessor methods to get at the instance-variables you can t directly access it like that unless you re calling it from the same class type for instance when you re implementing the nscopying protocols and need to set private variabless but don t worry about that now

698119
fortran	ada
i haven t come across use of java in real-time systems but i haven t been looking at the sorts of systems where i d expect to find it i work in aerospace simulation where it s c++ fortran and occasionally ada for real-time in-the-loop systems

698161
linked-list	arrays
system.collections.generic.list is implemented as an arrays internally not a linked-list

698165
environment	building
building and setting the url for the production environment is easy

698173
value	field
how can i represent a value field that can be of any type in a relational-database

698173
order	join
that doesn t seem right to me because in order to get the values back i would have to join on a bunch of different tables

698174
object-reference	instances
error msb4018 system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

698178
dictionary	arrays
however dictionary s are less likely since they re storing an arrays of buckets so unless the generate enough buckets so the arrays becomes 85000 bytes it s unlikely

698190
value	field
one approach i ve used before is to store the serialization value with a separate string field identifying its type

698206
administration	account
run the program with administration priviledges different than running a program as an account which has administration priviledges

698215
dependency-properties	attached-properties
you can for instances type control. and observe all the corresponding dependency-properties routed events and attached-properties members

698242
contains	any
including any text in the query string does not imply a cookie is created with that information although some sites may contains additional code to do so

698347
right-to-left	hebrew
were translation to hebrew and the entire code editor was right-to-left

698361

it would make sense if you used url-rewriting here to rewrite your urls into this templates

698372
exponential-distribution	probability
selected a probabilistic model for the rss feeds for example that the time between updates follows a continuous probability distribution for example the exponential-distribution

698396
contains	elements
what is being looked for is for the arrays elements to be contains in the field itself something like

698398
callback	methods
this is the callback when the begin-receive methods is executed

698441
any	set
in c++ a char must be large enough to hold any character in the implemetation s basic character set

698441
environment	execution
int has the natural size suggested by the architecture of the execution environment

698452
triggers	insert
the triggers is part of the insert transaction

698460
environment	execution
but it says the type int should have the natural size for a execution environment

698460
32-bit	64bit
but even for 64bit environments int is usually only 32-bit

698472
32-bit	64bit
this code creates a win64 subkey under the 0 key for a 64bit dll and a win32 subkey under the 0 key for a 32-bit dll

latex	tex
i only want this fix to apply to tex latex org-mode

698562
superscript	subscript
disable subscript superscript raise lower

698565
arrays	loops
but the real benefits of putting value in an arrays instead of a bunch of variables is that you can loops over the arrays like this

698566
execute	declare
it also allows one to make private variabless - if you declare a variables inside of an anonymous-function and execute it immediately only other code inside of the anonymous-function can access that variables

698604
instances	private
also i wouldn t recommend setting the private member directly - it would be a good idea to have a single object inside of the returned class instances used just for locking and use some form of accessor methods or property that locks on that synchronization object and then sets the field

698619
munin	cacti
you should have some sort of monitoring solution in-place like cacti or munin giving you visibility into what s going on on your server s

698619
lighttpd	squid
you should be using a lighter-weight reverse proxy like squid or webserver lighttpd or nginx to serve static content and to take over the job of spoon-feeding bytes to slow clients

698725
mousedown	keydown
note how i ve moved the keydown and mousedown event handler to the textblock control instead

698725
selected	listbox
as a side note it s odd how binding always marks my datarows as modified when the selected item in the listbox which has itemssource bound to a datatable changes i don t know if you re using datatables sets

698743
authentication	login
there s one main application that has all the user-interface and handles login authentication and then accesses the others via activeresource

698762
arrays	loops
you d need to loops through all of the elements in your arrays so it s probably not a better solution than any other

698764
hidden-files	backup
i want to backup all the hidden-files and directory in my homedir using rsync but not the non-hidden-files and directory

698780
subtraction	addition

salt	md5
any guid generator or even md5 concat salt current_timestamp is sufficient where salt is something on the user record like timestamp account was created

698787
hidden-files	backup
could you copy the hidden-files to a temp directory backup the temp directory then remove it

698797
sql-server	oracle
when i used oracle i had to hint every query to make sure that it didn t take forever to finish sql-server just works

698797
sql-server	oracle
you need dedicated dbas to administer oracle but pretty much any bozo can keep sql-server running

698797
sql-server	oracle
if you use oracle you also have to buy toad but the included manegement studio will do for sql-server

698806
arrays	loops
you will be getting the images one at a time using that do loops so you don t need to index into the arrays

698807
innodb	myisam
i m renaming tables changing indexes and generally altering most of the table in some way part of that is that i m changing from myisam to innodb tables

698830

698904
selected	textbox
if they selected one i need all the other textbox and dropdownlists to populate with that information

698909
getter	setter
this is most probably because you annotations the id field and not the setter or getter

698913
fogbugz	svn
i use svn and tac on some oof my projects and svn and fogbugz on others

698923
button	popup
when a button is pressed to edit one of the records in the gridview the button first executes some client script that popup a modal windows for the purposes of editing set using .onclientclick

profiling	debugging
go to run debugging settings add a new profiling

698978
decrement	increment
reference counted memory-management with the setter increment the ref count on the new value and decrement the ref count of the old value only make sense for objective-c objects

698985
javascript	dom
if your controls are created and you ve attached handlers to their events then the most probable cause of this error is javascript which modifies your dom form

699002
windows-xp	windows

699060
default	reset
that convinced me that it was indeed a packing problem and a search of the code base for #pragma pack quickly identified the culprit an ancient header file that legitimately required alignment on 1-byte boundaries but never reset the packing to the default

699078
numerical	nan
a common problem with the default behavior in numerical calculus is that we miss the nan or +-inf that appeared in a wrong operation

699092
contains	elements
a contains elements won t stretch to accommodate floating divs

699092
stretch	styles
you can add an empty div after your three picture divs that has that styles to make the b_pics container stretch to accommodate the floating elements or you could just make the b_website div clear both

699101
form-submit	onsubmit
you could even use the onsubmit as a test to see if your form is being submitted but it won t work if you call form-submit

699108
python	c++
c and probably most languages derived from it like c++ or python may be indirect access though

linked-list	arrays
a python list is really a resizeable arrays not a linked-list so it stores the size somewhere

699214

sending the value of the field to the php scripting

699227
colorbox	thickbox
colorbox is one that i found recently and seems similar in capability to thickbox

699239
entity-relationship	diagram
this entity-relationship diagram illustrates this

699245
attributes	properties
there are a few ways to do this - attributes is the lowest friction option but obviously doesn t deal well with generated code or validation of multiple properties better expressed in code

699250
constructor	object
as one of templates parameters we could pass compare predicate why map accept this predicate as templates parameter and not as object in constructor

699250
boost	stl
ofcourse i m understend that when stl was designed boost does not exists but designers could be create something similar on boost function

699276
arguments	default
as given the default type is which pretty much only has one value but you should be able to specify your own type for the compare arguments including boost function and then use various value to control the behavior of your map objects

699302
required	checked
we plan to add build-time checked that the number of annotations parameter names matches the number of arguments since that it what we required

699303
digits	zero
note that escaped adds a leading zero in case of an odd number of hex digits

699325
shell	bash
if i call it from a bash shell most of the output is suppressed by

699332
coalesce	isnull
alternatively if you don t have coalesce available but you do have an isnull function available you can chain isnulls

699335
javascript	dom
no javascript is a relatively compact language -- things like xml parsing etc in browsers comes from the dom

699341
having	select
i have another select statement which is going to return a set of records with one of the column having values from the above set val1 to val5

699342
stderr	stdout
as the os.system docs mention use the subprocess module and if you like set stdout open os.devnull w and perhaps the same for stderr when you open the subprocess

699347
conditional	parentheses
i also try and indent such that the effect of parentheses are obvious though trying to avoid long conditional is generally a good thing

699354
any	set
to answer the specific question i don t think there is any way to set up a transaction in the database sense that will do what you want

699399
32-bit	64bit
edited he s running 32-bit vista so it s definitely not a 64bit issues

699414
type-parameter	return-type
this is kind of weird since the type-parameter t does not appear in the public interface of bar it is not include in any methods parameter or return-type

699436
versioning	upgrade
by contrast with informix esql c an upgrade to the current versioning informix clientsdk 3.50 contains esql c 3.50 which is more recent than the esql c 6.00 which you currently use should be painless unless you ve gone out of your way to write bad code

699436
rollback	commit
also you cannot lock a table except in a transaction and you cannot unlock a table except by commit or rollback

699445
contains	any
clients only know about foo which doesn t contains any generic methods

699445
implements	abstract
so in your example startstuff and endstuff would be abstract in foo and implements in

699483
lxml	tidy
you might also look into using lxml and tidy

699484
processor	cpu
cpu usage cannot be directly measured because unlike an x86 the arm processor doesn t have a register for it

699497
implements	super
you can always implements file uploads yourself it s really not that super difficult if the .net utility has some limit coded in to it though it really shouldn t

699528
typedef	struct
one other good reason to always typedef enums and struct results from this problem

699528
typedef	struct
i would advocate always typedef ing struct and enumerations

699549
children	nodes
in the decorator you are looping over the nodes s children and calling the original non-recursive methods on them

699550
command-prompt	cmd
on all but one of my windows systems it runs fine but on a windows 2003 server it gives a directory not found error but if i run the same cmd flat from the cmd-prompt than it works

699558
32-bit	64bit
in iis 7 it s possible to run 32-bit and 64bit processes simultaneously

699558
32-bit	64bit
for running 32-bit applications on iis 6 64bit windows check out this microsoft article

699567
erlang	lisp
you might want to look at distel an integration of emacs with erlang s message system and slime an interface between emacs and common lisp

699593
hide	show
or do you perform checks in a single view and hide show blocks within it similar to what you would have done in regular asp.net

699607
value	field
you can also define constraints so that some field are mandatory not null or their value constrained by lookup tables

699610
web-deployment	web
i ve added a web-deployment project to my solution to create a clean deployment of my web application

699630

i am new to jquery trying to populate a gridview or telerik radgrid using jquery

699630
textbox	button
essentially i am trying to display a modal windows with a textbox and button

699630

the user than selects records in the grid presses another button and the selected users are inserted into the database-table modal windows is closed and a grid on the parent page is refreshed showing the new added users

699653
firefox	safari
the text on my web page looks fine in firefox safari but in ie7 certain portions are cut off

699664

in windows the os invokes structured exception-handling to convert the processor exception into a language exception that you can catch using a __try __catch block in c or try-catch block in c++

699729
any	set
i could not find any place to set the visibility of tab bar button

699745
directx	xinput
so far i ve learned that this can be done using either the xinput library from directx or the input framework in xna

699750
telerik-grid	gridview
you cannot populate a gridview or telerik-grid using jquery

699760
textbox	button
if you do forget you may well be setting the textbox back to the original session value in the pageload just before the button handler is called

699765
selected	button
when you change it to the contacts button make sure you select the contacts option from the drop down list of apple provide tab bar button - if you type in contacts as the title of a bar button that has been selected as recent - this will cause problems and may be causing the problem you are experiencing

699766
direct3d	directx
i ve seriously tried almost ten different methods and even my search results in google for directx direct3d c# desktop hooks and others have brought me to no avail

699766
direct3d	gdi
direct3d dx gdi or otherwise

699798
spring	guice
for java guice - supposedly better spring - probably good enough

699801
margins	padding
i have some list elements that have a mysterious left padding margins

699801
contains	set
i have set padding to 0 margin to 0 though it shouldn t be this as clearly the border goes around the element contains the gap text-indent to 0 and text-align left

699807
decimal	octal
a leading zero makes the constant octal rather than decimal

699807
digits	zero
which leads to a way to squeeze a couple more digits out of this solution - always start your binary constant with a zero

699808
author	posts
example author should have pk s blog posts should have pk s but the links join table between author and posts not

699817
linux	unix
the standard free cross plaform game library is simple directmedia layer originally written to port windows games to unix linux systems

699823
value	field
this means things like the search results do not implement ienumerable t and instead implement an ugly java iterator objects that need to be close don t implement idisposable value that should be enums are public field other uglies

699859
value	field
most likely you ll find that your variables action statement is not properly append the form field value on the client side before the getjson call sends a request to your controllers

699874
selected	textbox
i don t want them to be clicked on and have the stamp be selected nor the textbox

699881
hide	show
the way i currently tackle this is that i hide the listbox if the result set count 0 and show a label with the no results found message

699895
32-bit	64bit
somehow i would like to willfully use 32-bit or 64bit based on the native width of the processor

699905
textbox	button
so after the button is clicked to change the value the page is reloading and the original value is getting put back into the textbox

699906

699931
icmp	udp
when we send a packet from a udp port we receive an exception if the network returns an icmp host unreachable

699931
icmp	udp
no problem we ll just listen for icmp and that will give us the info we need while ignoring the exception on the udp port

699940
value	field
call document.getvalue for stored field with multiple value

699942
value	field
if you want to ensure that a blogger s posts are associated with the correct user then don t use a form field for this at all since their value can be changed by the end user

699950
hosts-file	hosts
easy way to test this will be to edit your hosts so that username.site.com points to 127.0.0.1 but you will have to do this for each user you want to test on each pc.

699951
recording	playing
since you appear to be simply writing the whole thing out there s no reason to be playing games with fixed size recording

699953

699977
octal	hex
only decimal hex and octal numbers are supported with format specifiers

699996
postdata	request
update using a caching proxy such as squid may be a good idea but each request to the webservice will send rather large xml query in the postdata which may be different each time
