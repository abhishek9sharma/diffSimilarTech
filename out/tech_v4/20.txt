200026
onmouseover	mouseleave
at the same time add an onmouseover function to the windows - this should get triggers when the mouseleave the flash element

200030
any	set
it s set up so that you have a mediator object that listens for events from mxml components then sends a notification which can be picked up by any other mediator

200031
erlang	lisp
my recommendation from personal experience is to learn about lisp erlang or such functional languages and the philosophy behind them

200050
linux	osx
i m not clear on what you mean by linux osx command prompts being nice

200056
postgresql	mysql
is there any alternative to oracle s client software the provides the functionality of something like mysql s mysql or postgresql psql

200087
derived-class	base-class
it s quite an odd design though to force one derived-class to create an instance of a different class derived from the same base-class

200092
perl	php
there are bindings for ming in perl via the swf module and i believe it can be used with php as well

200100
sql-server	oracle
i worked on one project where it was an absolute requirement to support many databases including at least access sql-server and oracle

200102
any	set
utc is coordinated universal time not a character set i didn t find any charset called utc

200138
.net	wcf
if you re using .net 3.x or can a wcf service is going to be your best bet

200138
attributes	properties
you can selectively control which properties are serialization to the client with the data-members attributes

200142
protected	public
edit one variant on this would be to make bar a protected nested-class within foo with a public constructor

200158
32-bit	64bit
in a nutshell a 64bit system running java might execute the code faster than an 32-bit system equivalent

200170
boost	stl
a good start is the boost library of course because it covers most of the templates you seem to look around for when the stl runs out of gas

200171
32-bit	64bit
in fact it will make your program larger in memory since all pointers will become 64bit wide instead of 32-bit

200196
click	mouse
a quick look at the msdn documentation shows that none of the mouse events click button down up etc are supported to be used in your program

200202
entity-framework	ado.net
for example the ado.net entity-framework lets you design a conceptual schema which maps to the business layer and has a separate mapping to the storage schema which can be changed without recompiling the business object layer or conceptual layer

200205
contains	set
which is a pretty decent solution however it makes it hard to get an overview of what differs between files not to mention that i m looking forward to writing maintaining a good 60-80 files each contains a set of variables definitions

200220
sql-server	mysql
dunno if this works in mysql but using sql-server you can also just wrap it like

200221
webserver	host
if you want to test whether you can connect to a webserver you could also create a url based on the host name and the port number and use that to create a urlconnection checking the result including exceptions of the connect method should tell you whether the webserver is reachable

200223
authentication	login
so i think i need to change the authentication to not submit the login information in readable text

200225
arrays	map
i should add that b sometimes is supposed to return an arrays or std vector or std map to a where the size is not previously known

200226
export	report
you can allow the report to be shown within the control or bypass that and export it directly to excel

200229
implements	final
can eclipse make parameters for generated methods overwriting implements interface etc. final and if so how

200250
logout	login
when they login as someone else or logout i want to remove that original cookie that i stored

200253
contains	elements
this follows the naming convention for constraints generally because data elements names will frequently contains underscore characters

200256
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i ve read all the marketing speak about how asp.net-mvc and webforms are complementary etc.

200256
asp.net-mvc	webforms
is microsoft going to continue to improve webforms as a first class citizen or will it just be a supported technology as they move all their real efforts developers and resources to asp.net-mvc over time

200262
duplicates	contains
we can see our tables will not contains duplicates data now think about our first table where student_class could be the same value for many students

200273
database-normalization	database-design
the main technique you can learn about database-design is called database-normalization

200275
modifiers	final
on the code style tab there is an option to automatically add final modifiers to private fields methods parameters and local-variables

200299
entity-framework	data-access
data-access linq-to-sql vs entity-framework

200315
python	php
i presume you are just trying to get data from php to python

200315
python	php
there are too many xml parsers and emitters for php and python for me to even list here

200315
python	php
here s a handy php function which will run a python script to do this for you

200331
versioning	migrate
i have a repository using rational clearcase explorer 2003.06.10+ which i want to migrate into serena changeman versioning manager 8.1.4.2

200341
jar	war
heck you can store content directly in a war file which is basically a jar file with a few extra bits

200356
32-bit	64bit
32-bit or 64bit

200356
32-bit	64bit
32-bit is 2gb for a process 64bit is 1tb enterprise edition 2003 server

200365
show	next
if the message is important enough to show then it should be important enough to leave on screen until the user has read it and click a link to the next page

200385
javascript	dom
approach it as if you have two seperate systems with models views and controllers on the server and javascript dom models views and controllers on the client browser

200409
value	field
extending type field value is no problem but you would have to add columns to the table fill default value for all current rows etc

200417
getter	setter
autogeneration of code getter setter etc much like intellij-idea for java has

200430
database-table	mysql
i ve tried a couple of approaches to update a column in a mysql database-table from another table but am not having any luck

200438
32-bit	64bit
add win64 yes to the registry search because the 32-bit environment on a 64bit machine has a different registry hive and a different frameworkroot

200470
firefox	safari
we have found out that firefox at least v3 and safari don t properly cache images referenced from a css file

200470
contains	any
edit2 i tested this with localhost and the image response doesn t contains any caching information it s

200482
silverlight	wpf
one thing that bugs me about silverlight wpf is that there are no direct methods for drawing onto the screen you have to create an object then add that to a parent control

200488
directory	folder
where web would be a sub directory in my themes folder

200543
environment	execution
a process has a virtual address spaces executable code open handles to system objects a security context a unique process identifier environment variables a priority class minimum and maximum working set sizes and at least one thread of execution

200565
arrays	map
you just map a byte arrays property of your persistable class to an column of type image

200570
perl	ruby
not so long ago i had switched to new job and although i know some bit of python and ruby and a few perl but they were not available on the live system where i had to parse log files create backups and scrape data

200579
groovy	java
2 use groovy a java like scripting language to do functional testing

200581
jar	war
in a jar or war file and pull them at runtime

200596
ip-address	proxy
most reverse proxy offer the possibility to add a header to the http request with the real ip-address of the client

200597
contains	set
set contains the results of those functions

200598
any	set
if any of them are set to cache or are missing you will find the browser is correctly caching the file s

200602
subtract	time
edit2 i have no problems counting the actual time difference but subtract that off-time 00 00 00-08 00 00 and 16 00 00-00 00 00 per day

200604
height	frame
i also do a good guess i believe you aren t wrapping your texturess in any direction and that the animation frame are a bit misaligned so that your application has a bit wrong textures coordinates height in the quad you are drawing

200608
output	mode
so you can run sqlplus in an interpreted mode and then provide it commands and read the output as well

200609
parsing	comma
can you recommend a java library for reading parsing validating and mapping rows in a comma separated value csv file to java value objects javabeans

200622
csv	xml
java lib or app to convert csv to xml file

200625
spreadsheet	apache-poi
if you want to read or write excel compatible spreadsheet with java the apache-poi library from apache is the way to go

200641
hide	show
include the calculated data in your regular page but hide it style visibility hidden then make it visible with a print.css media print as described by guido so it only show up when you print

200651
boost	stl
you should know enough about the subject to be able to effectively use templates libraries such as the stl or boost

200655
methodology	waterfall
cost of product changes when using agile tends to be much smaller than when using a waterfall methodology

200656
csv	xml
the csv file to xml question asked previously seems to answer all my questions

200661
ip-address	proxy
the http_x_forwarded_for header gets the ip-address behind proxy servers

200684
environment	building
if you create a set up using the flex-mojos maven plugins you can set up a building environment very easily without the need to have a flex buildinger license

200686
associations	model
i m having a quite complex model with many fields has_many associations images added by image_column etc.

200700
binary	hex
if you need to be absolutely sure what s going on create the files in binary either using a binary hex editor or writing it out from a program

200712
selected	button
click the little triangle on the open button and selected open with

200713
duplex	was
i thought that was only needed for duplex communication channels from the server side

200717
selected	button
at the menu selected file-- properties and then at the text file encoding section selected other radio selected utf-8 from combo - lastly click ok button

200717
selected	button
in text file encoding section selected other radio selected utf-8 from combo - lastly click ok button

200717
selected	button
in text file encoding section selected other radio selected utf-8 from combo - lastly click ok button

200718
32-bit	64bit
doing de-referencing of memory pointers in the jvm can take a longer time with 64bit pointers than 32-bit

200718
32-bit	64bit
there 64bit processor instructions that are more effective than the 32-bit ones

200718
32-bit	64bit
64bit jvm will allow you to have a heap size 2 32 times bigger than the slightly less than 4 gb one you can get with 32-bit

200719
reflection	runtime
if you want the runtime to supply a default parameter value you have to use reflection to make the call

200721
esoteric-languages	brainfuck
i m interested both in compiled interpreted and vm languages but not esoteric-languages like whitespace or brainfuck

200728
value	field
the database can t perform type-checking eg for dates etc and the generic value field will not be optimised for the data being stored in it

200738
binary	hex
using the php pack function i have converted a string into a binary hex representation

200756
python	java
very nice to work with and sadly trampled by java and now the newer languages like python and ruby

200779
configuration	environment
i would suggest to have a separate configuration file for environment parameters alone if you want to avoid cluttering

200800
compact-framework	.net
the .net compact-framework garbage collector works slightly differently to the one in the full .net

200811
value	field
i don t really want to have a table per fee type though so i create fee as the base class and fees as the table which contains the union of all the field needed across all the sub-types plus a type column whose value corresponds to the name of the relevant sub-class

200814
communication	messages
if you want to get philosophical about this communication doesn t actually depend on eloquence rhetoric or articulation but on the emotional context in which the messages is being heard

200828
show	next
i would also ensure the fields start with error icon show next to them and the icon should only disappear once data has been provided for that field

200830
attributes	properties
is there an attributes that will tell a control whether to use a properties as a column for example

200843
attributes	properties
by default with auto column generation enabled it will simply obtain via componentmodel the properties or those that omit this attributes

200843
attributes	properties
in reality i expect it would be better to create your own attributes and use that to find the properties you want to display via reflection and build the columns yourself

200847
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework - don t have a good understanding but seems too complicated and has bad reviews

200847
base-class	inherited
4.generated classes inherited from a common base-class

200914
haskell	rebol
haskell and rebol are both fascinating languages for very different reasons

200914
haskell	rebol
the nice thing about rebol is that it s much easier to get started with it than with haskell

200915
decrement	increment
this problem is not dissimilar to reference counting increment a dirty count on edit and decrement on undo

200916
python	java
python c# java skipped these languages look to me as a rehash of notions originating elsewhere with a huge standard library

200924
subclassing	base-class
subclassing here doesn t mean overriding the .net base-class behavior

200935
.net	csla
if you are using .net framework you may want to take a look at csla .net framework by rockford lhotka

201011
asp.net-mvc	webforms
while you can do views with webforms and you can do forms with asp.net-mvc each has trade-offs

201011
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in the future i do expect to see asp.net-mvc get better with dealing with data entry scenarios but these scenarios will likely come at a pretty high price compared to doing those with webforms

201011
asp.net-mvc	webforms
what i m most interested in going forward are hybrid applications that use asp.net-mvc for the display and publishing end of the business while webforms are used more naturally for heavy data entry end.

201024
facebook-apps	facebook
it would be great if there would be a good facebook api for delphi for php it would make rapid to create facebook-apps

201026
nunit	nmock
there is a rather good book describing how to use nunit and nmock to do c# unit-testing

201030
.net	csla
i would recommend csla .net framework by rockford lhotka

201038
msbuild	nant
a beginner question bear with me i m just wondering under what circumstances one should use a build tool like nant or msbuild

201044
order	add
it can be done without programming but there is one bit of information you need to add in order for this to make sense - the date or sequence number for each entry

201044
pivot-table	pivot-chart
selected the now 3 columns and choose data | pivot-table and pivot-chart report..

201044
widget	button
right-click the count of in time field button widget

201044
aggregate-functions	sum
change to sum average max or min anything that represents the actual data - it only applies to the one value so aggregate-functions are fine

201045
erlang	scala
it features a functional style api some very efficient implementations of various immutable data structures and agent system bit like actors in scala and processes in erlang

201056
msbuild	nant
if you want to automate anything it s good to use nant msbuild

201058
binaries	install
apart from that you can use the build engine on a dedicated build-system so that your binaries can be built unattended and without having visual-studio install

201067
swing	awt
i was able to fix 99 of my awt applet redraw issues by switching to swing

201071
build-process	msbuild
while technically visual-studio projects are msbuild files it s better to have the official build-process be separate of the development environment

201080
httphandler	httpmodule
generally this web-dependent assembly is also where my httpmodule and httphandler live too

201084
scheme	lisp
scheme immediately comes to mind a nicer lisp

201124
json	xml
if it s the asmx then it s probably getting caught by your application_error but as asmx returns xml or json it won t necessarily get displayed on your ui unless you re looking for it

201126
javacc	jflex
the right way would be to use parsing generator like antlr jflex or javacc

201147
command-prompt	command-line
i ve tried ffmpeg using the command-line tool with process.start but the same command that works in a windows forms application and from the command-prompt does not work in asp.net presumably because of permissions

201163
entity-framework	nhibernate
thereâ s a place i think for both the entity-framework linq to sql traditional stored procedures and other tools like nhibernate etc but you should justify and rationalise the choice of technology first and try to ensure it is appropriate for the present and future needs

201171
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is worse complexity than mergesort in the worst case.

201171
quicksort	mergesort
but you can implement quicksort more efficiently than mergesort for almost any application other than ones dealing with sorting millions of items

201172
temporary	copy
we used to have this problem with asp.net because when visual-studio created its temporary copy of the assemblies the indexing service would start scanning them for viruses and this would occasionally cause an access denied message because the debugger would be trying to open a shared file

201175
tcsh	zsh
my general rule of thumb is if it is a one-liner or a for-loop to catch a bunch of files and do just a few operations to them i use bash tcsh zsh else i use python

201175
python	perl
i used perl for a long time and switched pretty exclusively to python

201181
required	checked
another possiblity is to store the whole refence string in one larger field and use the user-interface to checked to make sure all required parts are there before concatenation the record and sending the information to the database

201185
contains	set
we don t want this table to grow out of control and eat up too much space so we d like to set a cap on the number of rows that it can contains to some big number like one million

201185
triggers	insert
i imagine we could do this with a triggers or by making all insert with a stored procedure but is there anything simpler

201188
configuration	environment
is it possible to reference system environment variables as opposed to java system properties in a log4j xml configuration file

201245
checkbox	button
row three will always have two radio button and two checkbox and those are in the html side of the page

201245
checkbox	textbox
i can loop through each item in the datagrid and i can access the radio buttons and the checkbox but the textbox arenâ t there

201249
value	field
going back to the person example above we could use this system if the hash was calculated by looking at the value of the first name last name and social security number field

201261
selection	cell
let s say that i create a sub not a function whose mission in life is to take the active cell selection and set an adjacent cell to some value

201277
windows-server	windows
if you are using the following windows versions or later windows-server 2012 windows-server 2012 r2 or windows 8.1 then makecert is now deprecated and microsoft recommends using the powershell cmdlet new-selfsignedcertificate

201282
sql-server	mysql
microsoft sql-server and mysql have an information_schema table that i can query

201287
selected	button
however then i would have to loop through each button just to check and see if it is the one selected

201287
selected	button
is there an easier way to find out which button has been selected

201289
triggers	insert
the insert are slowed down a little by the triggers that they kick off in my case one per file where each file is responsible for up to a million rows inserted but my later selected queries can go from minutes to single digit seconds

201294
emacs	vim
while it doesn t launch from vim the way emacs does it provides vim like keybindings and behavior

201298
configparser	configobj
configobj is essentially a replacement for configparser with support for nested sections and much more

201309
textbox	button
you cannot apply a roundedcornersextender to input elements such as textbox or button

201317
lan	vpn
the client and server exist in the same organisation typically a lan perhaps a wan vpn situation

201330
traversal	parent
yep - parent traversal up the tree

201349
click	mouse
use key strokes to navigate the grid rather than mouse click

201352
shell	tcsh
if you can read or modify it in the the shell using commands like ulimit -s in sh ksh zsh or limit stacksize tcsh zsh

201353
driver	kernel
there s a completely different driver model where much of the code is kicked out of kernel spaces and back into userland to prevent poor drivers from trampling over the system

201354
logging	trace
i created a test application to compare the performance of both logging methods in several scenarios and i m finding that log4net is significantly slower than the trace class

201354
profiling	trace
poking around with clr profiling confirms there are a large amount of collections for a ton of log4net.core.loggingevent objects that are generated to be fair it looks like trace generates a ton of objects as well but it doesn t display the large variance that log4net does.

201362
.when	ready
this way the client will know that data is ready even if it wasn t running .when the notification was sent

201367
filtering	sorting
dataset automatic sorting filtering

201374
factors	primes
the primes factors of 13195 are 5 7 13 and 29

201374
factors	primes
what is the largest primes factors of the number 600851475143

201378
perl	php
the more sophisticated patterns in perl and pcre regex library used in php can correctly parse rfc 5322 without a hitch

201389
contains	elements
the problem is that percentage heights refer to the height attributes of the contains elements not the height minus margins and padding

201390
order	add
or add additional order by info so the resulting objects are in order via the parameter you re interested in

201391
selected	checkbox
currently i don t see any way in which i can create a list of checkbox with similar names but different id s so people can selected 0-1-more options from the list

201398
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework

201398
entity-framework	nhibernate
the entity-framework and nhibernate take distinctly different approaches to the problem of bridging the object-relational divide

201398
entity-framework	nhibernate
well the nice thing about nhibernate is that there is a very vibrant community around it and when you do encounter those esoteric errors and believe me the entity-framework also has its share of esoteric errors

201398
entity-framework	nhibernate
that said i don t have a lot of personal experience with nhibernate beyond the evaluation we did which led to us choosing the entity-framework so i m going to let other people with more direct experience comment on this

201399
debugging	trace
personally i prefer log4xxx because of it s fexibility but if you want something that doesn t impact as much and you don t really need logs for production say in debugging only trace should be enough

201400
shell	bash
the obvious candidates for an interactive shell are bash dash zsh and pd ksh

201400
bash	zsh
pick whichever you like for interactive use i d tend to go with bash just because it s the standard on linux but they all have their merits and zsh in particular seems popular

201406
safari	opera
but somehow this seems to triggers a reload in safari opera and mozilla -- no matter what the event handler contains

201413
glib	gtk
i ve seen mention of a gtk library called glib that a few people consider fills the bill but are there other libraries that would provide stl functionality in c

201435
factors	primes
although the question asks for the largest primes factors it doesn t necessarily mean you have to find that one first.

201441
identifier	temporary
perform the partials match agains that temporary table and retrieve the identifier

201442
windows-vista	windows
windows drivers are under higher scrutiny under windows-vista and pretty much require certification imho

201457
ruby-on-rails	django
what s the best way to implement a url interpreter dispatcher such as found in django and ruby-on-rails in php

201483
glib	gtk
glib was originally part of gtk but the non-gui code has been completely factored out so that you can use it in command-line programs

201507
profiling	trace
create a trace and examine it in profiling

201520
keyboard	mouse
i can figure out how to capture keyboard events and mouse events

201523
cakephp	kohana
check out projects such as -- in no particular order -- zend framework cakephp symfony code ignitor kohana solar and akelos

201544
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
and obviously cakephp is the most similar to the ruby-on-rails style

201552
worksheet	excel
if you could just alter other cells inside a function used from a worksheet then there s no way for excel to know the order and what to recalculate if a cell changes

201560
pointers	stack
in cases where you really have a good reason to truncate pointers you can make wp64 accept your code by stack multiple casts

201560
32-bit	64bit
i m not able to reproduce your warning with the version of the compiler that i have installed but i suspect that your problem is related to the fact that you re casting a 64bit unsigned size_t into a 32-bit signed int

201560
32-bit	64bit
you might have better luck if you stack multiple casts to do the 64bit to 32-bit conversion and the unsigned-to-signed conversion

201560
32-bit	x86
also if you build both x86 and x64 binaries you can disable wp64 for your 32-bit builds so that you don t have to annotate any types with __w64

201561
triggers	insert
2 - build a triggers on the source table which checks for a change to any monitored field and insert the current record into the log table on any change

201568
python	php
this has led me to think about the usage of xml xslt in general and in what situations it would be more useful than the approach i ve always used which is storing all of my data in a my sql database and then using php python etc

201572
antivirus	security
antivirus security software if applicable

201581
getter	setter
i agree with ya ll that they should be using getter setter and just set the _table to private

201621
oracle	mysql
this is the same thing as this oracle question but for mysql

201683
contains	set
the user guide has a good example of how to set up your build scripting so that you not only seperate the instrumented code from the execution but it s also all contains in the same so that you don t have to run a series of different targets but instead you can just do something like ant emma tests if ant tests was how you normally ran your unit tests for example

201696
getter	setter
i have a sessionhelper class that manages the session setter getter

201705
hash	md5
do i need to worry about collisions in the md5 hash value that gets produced

201705
hash	md5
bonus how many files could i have before i d start seeing collisions in the hash value that md5 produces

201706
value	field
to summarize i want non-nullable field with db-assigned default value but i don t want them isdbgenerated if it means i cannot provide value for them when making updates or inserts using linq to sql

201741
widget	popup
here s an outlook popup style notification jquery widget

32-bit	64bit
so you re asking for an idl datatype that is 32-bits on a 32-bit machine and 64bits on a 64bit machine

201749
32-bit	64bit
so what do you expect to happen to the extra 32-bits when you call from a 64bit process to a 32-bit process

201774
webrequest	webclient
shawn wildermuth gives a great overview of the two options you have webclient and webrequest

201795
enumerator	any
you could use any language you prefer to pull out the enumerator and enumvalue tags and generate your desired code

201796
authentication	login
however currently when performing the search the built-in forms-authentication sees that the page being posted to requires authentication and redirects the user to the login page with the previous page not the search results page as the referrer

201798
internet-explorer	firefox
i had the same problem but only in internet-explorer i tested version 7 - not in firefox 3 or safari 3

201822
textbox	button
the password textbox has an onkeypress attribute added that will force a dopostback on the submit button if the enter key is pressed

201824
configuration	logging
for tomcat 6.x you can change the logging configuration in conf logging.properties

201831
contains	any
i think it shouldn t be a problem because yui is all contains in namespaces so it shouldn t break anything i don t know if jquery break things around yui but as long as it doesn t extend basic object there shouldn t be any problem

201838
bad-request	http-error
http-error 400 - bad-request

201838
order	add
are there some settings i need to add to my web service configuration in order to allow backslashes to be added to urls in a rest wcf service

201860
contains	any
i d add a check for a path contains before doing the relative path check and note you must do that before any cwd calls

201883
windows-messages	spy++
windows-messages from grid combobox and edit control from spy++

201887
oracle	mysql
if not how would you suggest i implement this for a piece of code that could access any of sql server mysql and oracle

201888
wait	hang
what this means is that during a restart cycle the application hang the remote client which can actually connect to the server but wait for a response until the spring containers fully initializes

201898
contains	set
make sure that the directory contains the private key files is set to 700

201904
constructor	object
your best bet is to set them in the constructor of the object or on the private fields if you are not using automatic properties

201905
ruby	php
you can also get the source code in php python and ruby which is cc licensed

201922
bison	yacc
since the code is 20 years old scrap down the parsing syntax analyzer and replace it with one of the newer lex yacc bison or anything similar etc based c++ code much more maintainable and easier to understand

201922
boost	stl
if you have some time left try replacing data-structures one by one to use the more standardized stl or boost

201925
worksheet	excel
when excel is recalculating a worksheet it needs to maintain dependencies between cells

201931
contains	set
each xml file contains the set of sql statements for one of the dozen databases

201937
32-bit	x86
the reason is that the physical address map includes not only ram but device memory as well and x86 and x64 systems map all device memory below the 4gb address boundary to remain compatible with 32-bit operating systems that don t know how to handle addresses larger than 4gb

201938
linux	osx
they ve been evolving for a number of years and they work equally well in linux windows osx last time i checked

201944
32-bit	64bit
you could run multiple 32-bit vms on a 64bit os so that each app has access to as much memory as possible if your machine has more than 4gb

201950
postgresql	mysql
postgresql gets much better performance and this is coming from a former mysql partisan

201952
32-bit	64bit
maximum addressable memory for a 32-bit machine is 4gb for a 64bit machine you can address loads more

201965
configuration	logging
instead call a logging api and use configuration to redirect the output wherever you want

201965
debugging	trace
while debugging you ll get your output on the console - on the customer site you d configure it to redirect the trace output to a file to the event log or similar

201965
debugging	trace
so prefer trace to debugging if you want the output to be available in release builds

201968
contains	any
can be used instead if you don t need any other key for accessing the contains objects

201988
communication	messages
messages communication with the

201988
windows-xp	windows
a windows-xp sp3 workstation is trying to establish a connection to a windows server 2003 machine

201993
required	checked
i ve checked out yahoo s pipe and found no such functionality google-reader can sort of do it but it required a manual marking of each item

201998
malloc	free
they can be allocated deallocated and reallocated dynamically using the new delete operators in c++ and malloc free in c

202009
windows-xp	windows
should work with windows-xp windows server 2003 vista ...

202033
getline	istream
you can use the std istream getline or preferably the version that works on std string function to get an entire line

202058
triggers	insert
depending on the size of the database and the number of tables you could put a triggers in place that would handle updates or insert and log that to another table potentially logging the table name and a timestamp it isn t elegant but could work

202068
lighttpd	apache
seeing as the majority of traffic to the hosted sites would end up at their top level domain this would result in only static media hits the html page with the embedded flash movie i could set up lighttpd or nginx to handle those requests and pass the django stuff back to apache mod_whatever

202088
updating	updates
you can use window.settimeout yourrefreshmethods when the yourrefereshmethods gets called it will check number of characters being typed so far and compare it to the some counter the counter will starts with 0 value so the initial call will do nothing other than updating the counter with the current characters typed count the second time your methods get called it will check the number of characters typed if it matches the previous number recorded by the counter then it means the user didn t type anything new and you can fire your refresh methods otherwise you will updates the counter value

202095
webforms	asp.net
it s generally a good idea to minimize the amount of things you do in a code behind and instead push logic into a presenter class and follow the mvp pattern for asp.net webforms development

202106
expression-blend	wpf
wpf s support for declarative ui through xaml rich controls templating and styling and tools like expression-blend makes it a lot better for designers to work with developers on the same project

202106
silverlight	wpf
in addition silverlight supports a subset of xaml and the same control classes as wpf so your application can be ported as ria with minimal efforts

202122
elementtree	lxml
lxml has support for cdata and api like elementtree

202126
csv	xml
another answer in some contexts it makes sense to define your enumeration in a non-code format like a csv yaml or xml file and then generate both the c++ enumeration code and the to-string code from the definition

202130
compact-framework	.net
is it possible to include a library which is not a part of the .net compact-framework in a xbox 360 project

202135
convention	standards
the uppercase name is the standards convention for types and they only appear in specific places so they won t get confused with properties or methods

202150
response	timeout
the time durations you mentioned vaguely feels like a dns timeout issue when opening a connection incurs the penalty for the first down misaddressed dns response to timeout

202187
bazaar	git
this might not be a viable option but perhaps you could use a distributed system like bazaar git or mercurial

202187
directory	folder
i know with bazaar the repository is simply a hidden folder added to the directory

202195
tree	trie
this is quite an achievement that can t possibly be beaten by a search tree trie

202204
triggers	insert
you could write an on insert triggers to check the contents of the table and then discard the insert if your criteria are not met

202216
profiling	trace
there is a workaround on sql 2000 to obfuscate the profiling connection dialogue box to limit the sysadmin connection to running trace only

202224
httphandler	httpmodule
another possibility for your threadabortexception is any code that runs outside the page request lifecycle on the server side such as httpmodule and httphandler

202234
solaris	linux
update as was pointed out before this is a limit to the default shell for solaris sh vs linux bash

202245
contains	set
what i need is another column in the result set which contains these auto-numberings

202250
tree	trie
okay so the naiive trie encodes string keys by starting at the root of the tree and moving down branches that match each letter in the key starting at the first letter of the key

202250
contains	any
so what you need to do is associate a node with any key that contains that particular substring

202261
sql-server	oracle
in sql-server you have a row_number function which can be used and in oracle there is a rownum pseudo column

202265
sql-server	mysql
sql-server has the row_number over construct to simplify this but i don t know if mysql has anything special to address it

202267
solaris	linux
if you make the change on solaris to the same shell you re using on linux does that fix the problem

202273
superclass	subclass
i would like to know what file the subclass resides in from the superclass

202275
sql-server	mysql
ms sql-server has row_number which mysql has not

202295
export	report
i have not been able to find a way to export import subscriptions either in the report manager or by sql-server management studio

202296
conditional	operators
the relevant section of the c# 3.0 spec is 7.13 the conditional operators

202300
32-bit	64bit
another thing to note is that a 32-bit program cannot use more than the 2gb address space on a 64bit system unless they enable the largeaddressaware yes linker flag

202303
directory	folder
if you re running windows use the junction utility from ms and map your share directory to the webcontent folder

202308
inherited	subclass
each subclass would need to have an explicitly implemented methods that returned __file__ which completely defeats the point of inherited in the first place

202310
windows-vista	windows
inherent scalability use the windows-vista magnifier tool on a wpf application and on a windows forms application note that in the wpf application all the vector art scales beautifully

202313
jquery-plugins	jquery
jquery has been doing some work along these lines and some jquery-plugins have emerged as solutions

202313
javascript	dom
keep in mind that when you send a page of html the browser is putting a dom structure into memory in roughly the same way that your javascript does

202320
integer	digits
if your dates go from bc to far future negative to more then 4 digits it would be easiest to store an integer just for sorting reasons

202340
row	col
some examples row col tag value etc

202349
ftps	ftp
moveit freely is a free command-line ftp secure ftp ssl ftps client for windows-vista business edition 2003 xp 2000 me and nt 4.0 systems

digits	zero
string count digits - leading zero aren t

202360
digits	zero
replace all of the trailing digits with zero

202365
plugins	add-on
it also has more add-on widgets plugins created by the user community

202366
icollection	ienumerator
i have found many pieces of documentations and recommendations about ienumerator ienumerable icollection ilist and their generic counterparts

202369
sftp	ftps
it says that it supports ftp over ssl ftps which i think is the same as sftp

202371
put	get
plus you get these little widgets that you can put on the page the yellow box on perlbuzz that gives the count of current readers

202382
conditional	operators
by the way your code is a special case that doesn t have to use the conditional operators at all

202384
instrumentation	trace
my program s already set up to use tracing though i m going to need to add instrumentation code to trace activity in suspect methods

202405
shell	bash
i inevitably end up running some non-cygwin programs through the bash shell such as build scripts batch files created in-house and the subversion cli binaries i have the windows ones installed

202426
account	api
as you are specifically mentioning java as your environment you might want to take openoffice or staroffice into account - they have an api that s a lot easier to talk to from java than activex or remote-controlling word

202467
icollection	ienumerable
ilist icollection ienumerable

202473
unmanaged	c++-cli
this is c++-cli and the caret is the managed equivalent of a pointers which in c++-cli terminology is called a handle to a reference-type since you can still have unmanaged pointerss

202478
datagridview	databound
problem with combobox and databound datagridview

202483
row	col
this way i wouldn t have to explicitly write anything on a per definition level just do something like define_pair_type positioning int int row col

202504
visual-c++	dev-c++
i use either bloodshed s dev-c++ cygwin or visual-c++ express

202536
javascript	dom
if you re using a third-party javascript framework toolkit library it probably provides a function method that allows you to execute code once the dom has fully loaded

202541
.net	wcf
we have implmented a rest-style get service using wcf in .net 3.5

202547
configuration	environment
my tool doesn t even have a configuration file so the user would otherwise have to pass in the proxy settings on every command or set an environment variables or somesuch -- way too much hassle

202547
firefox	opera
is there one set of proxy settings in windows used by all browsers probably ie s or would i have to write different routines for ie firefox opera etc

202550
asciiencoding	utf8-decode
you probably want to use utf8-decode rater than asciiencoding

202562
delphi	c++
after working with borland c and c++ compliers since bcc 4.1 dos and delphi from 3.0 thru 2007 i can tell you honestly that you re in for a great adventure either way

202562
delphi	c++
the choice between c++ and delphi is one i suggest you make after getting your feet wet on a few small to mid sized projects in both languages

202562
delphi	c++
borland s c++ builder delphi s vcl added to c++ compiler takes many of c++ sharp edges off and is my second favorite language

202562
delphi	c++
although c# has a good amount of friendliness built in compared to c++ if pushed i d still stick to delphi or builder if i was just starting out

202565
lazy-evaluation	maybe
i do not understand why a takes a non-negligble time to load but maybe you could to a lazy-evaluation initialize yourself by refactoring a

202571
margins	padding
the additional 24 pixels leaves room for the browser google-chrome padding and margins you may want to manipulate etc

202601
32-bit	64bit
you can check this by reading the php_int_size constant 4 32-bit 8 64bit or read the php_int_max value

202617
constructor	private
it requires that the constructor of the singleton be private so that no instances can be created by the client

202634
triggers	insert
3 i assume that you know that your triggers cannot query or update the table on which the triggers is defined so no queries or insert into sometable

202654
icollection	ienumerable
idictionary ilist icollection ienumerable

202658
superclass	subclass
you can start with the unit which acts as a superclass then you can have a team as a subclass of unit

202683
configuration	environment
i think the global.asax option will be a good if you are in a shared hosting environment for example where you don t have access to iis configuration

202698
attributes	properties
error sys.invalidoperationexception managedruntimeerror error #4004 in control xaml1 system.windows.markup.xamlparseexception invalid attributes value textwrapping for properties properties

postgresql	mysql
postgresql is a free database engine which is well scalable and widely used besides mysql

202762
vb.net	vb6
also they have something similar over at codeproject asynchronous processing - basics and a walkthrough with vb6 vb.net

202764
value	field
the primary key field must be an integer the largest value is 9223372036854775807

202764
value	field
use a separate indexed field and insert the value as string

202766
playlist	playing
here s a scripting for opening itunes and playing a playlist

202774
continuous-integration	nant
what i typically do in these situations is use nant with a continuous-integration tool like cruisecontrol.net

202778
python	php
although it is based in python not php

202793
continuous-integration	build-process
the build-process should be fully automated so we re prepared to set up a continuous-integration environment continuum

202807
.net	wcf
is there a way in the .net framework to validate that a process has access to a specific wcf address namespace without attempting to call servicehost.open and capturing the resulting addressaccessdeniedexception

202808
sql-server	mysql
not sure what it does for mysql or ms sql-server

202817
export	report
my users need to be able to export a report to pdf and without being able to use crystal i am pretty much lost

202836
performance-testing	profiling
this way you can build a working application get the system up and running quickly without worrying to much about optimisation and start performance-testing profiling as soon as possible

202854
arrays	loops
edit a for loops on list t are a bit more than 2 times cheaper than foreach loops on list t b looping on arrays is around 2 times cheaper than looping on list t c looping on arrays using for is 5 times cheaper than looping on list t using foreach which most of us do

202859
telnet	tcp
to control the robot one needs to connect with it wirelessly via telnet and send commands through the tcp ip protocol

202861
dictionary	arrays
neither int nor list int is an associative arrays -- that would be a dictionary in c#

202863
contains	any
any file or grouping of files that contains data but does not express relationships within that data is a non-relational database

202919
linux	bsd
if you are developing on any unix-derived platform linux bsd cygwin you can almost always do something like man printf or info printf to get documentation for any library function

202934
contains	any
the datagram doesn t even need to contains any data if the client app can assume that any udp data on a certain port means it needs to get new data from the server

202934
packets	subnet
if necessary you can even make this a broadcast packets if you don t know who the clients are and they are on the same subnet as the server so long as the server isn t too chatty

202939
web.py	django
i already found out about django and web.py

202942
reflection	runtime
an equally productive alternative might be attributes annotations and runtime reflection

202948
gnome	kde
you should know that using any theme that is not officially supported by gnome kde can have bugs

202975
any	set
i have use the folding at the text indent levels - an easy way to collapse and expand file sections without any work to set up each section

202993
lookup	any
these databases are usually based off complex hashing algorithms and provide a very fast lookup o 1 based off a key but leave any form of relational goodness to end user

202993
key-value	key
in a key-value database you would denormalize as much as possible and then use a unique key to lookup data

203003
system.web	.net
system.web is very useful if you are doing web development as well as knowing how .net interacts with iis while this may be irrelevant for a developer who does windows and console applications

203008
firefox	opera
this function is used by firefox and opera to get their proxy settings by default although you can override them per-browser

203009
sql-server	oracle
date would argue that many databases in common use such as oracle and sql-server do not comply sufficiently with the relational model to be termed relational

203012
linux	osx
the entire linux desktop doesn t have the visual integrity of osx for instance and i wonder why

203012
gnome	kde
with linux there s not only different windows managers gnome kde flux openbox enlightenment etc etc there s different user-interface toolkits qt gtk tk wx etc etc different versioning in common use and countless different ways of using implements them

203012
ubuntu	linux
as for a nice integrated linux desktop environment - i would say the default ubuntu installation is probably the closest to this

203023
google-chrome	firefox
there s the prism add-on for firefox and google-chrome has this functionality built-in

203033
keydown	keyup
in the combobox i handle the keydown textchanged and keyup events which fire in that order

keydown	keyup
if i go from keydown to keyup with textchanged skipped i check whether the character was a keys.q or keys.oemperiod

203036
binaries	install
it copies the product files into a temp directory usually c windows temp patches the binaries and then uses movefileex to copy the files back to the install directory on a reboot usually c program files product

203036
directory	folder
the files in the install directory are inheriting their security attributes from the parent folder

203046
adplus	dump

203050
web-hosting	hosting
i do not have ssh access to my hosting package which is just a basic lamp web-hosting package but i do know that there is an svn client install on the webserver

203061
32-bit	64bit
there is only a 32-bit jet provider no 64bit provider so the app needs to be running in 32-bit mode

203061
any	set
my dev box is vista 64 so i set the project to build for x86 instead of any cpu

203090
put	get
what s a windows command-line statement s i can use to get the current datetime in a format that i can put into a filename

203090
windows-xp	windows
i m using windows server 2003 and windows-xp professional

203092
any	set
set copy settings from to any cpu which was the default setting in the active solution platform

203094
directory	folder
if you really want to move them to a different location creating a temp folder in the same place as the files to be patched would help the permissions stay the same assuming the directory is using inherited permissions

203099
archive	backup
if you want further ideas for automating backup to 7-zip archive i have a free open project you can use or review for ideas

203104
runas	cmd
one suggestion i can think of would be to create multiple user account on the box and then create shortcuts to internet-explorer with the runas cmd or use the run as.

203106
children	nodes
imagine a treeview control populated with the root nodes the children of the root and the grandchildren of the root

203124
implements	abstract
you could abstract your csv reader implementation from any particular streamreader by defining an abstract stream reader interface and testing your own implementation with a mock stream reader that implements that interface

203135
derived-class	base-class
even covers how default-parameters in a methods in a derived-class are ignored and any default-parameters in a base-class are still taken

203148
python	lua
it s the main reason why i find myself working more in python than in lua

203165
search-engine	seo
templates columns are source-order independent so you can put your most important content first in the markup layer for improved accessibility and search-engine optimization seo

203174
openoffice.org	uno
edit the openoffice.org uno project does seem to be closest to what i asked for

203189
32-bit	64bit
long is a typedef for 32-bit integers on 32-bit systems don t know about 64bit systems it is irrelevant at this point because i am on 32-bit windows

203189
primitive	int
using different primitive for rect members int long short uint32...

203196
32-bit	64bit
php brutally murdered its integer support to the point where you have no predictable way of knowing it a specific install will handle 32-bit or 64bit integers

203226
jquery	.post
you re requesting the url with a get while the jquery code uses a .post

203266
pylons	django
i would recommend looking at the wikipedia articles for django turbogears pylons etc

personally i like turbogears a lot since it is based on well-known components cherrypy for web serving and url routing kid for templates and sqlobject for object-relational mapping

203288
ruby	php
i m a php developer who knows a little bit of ruby

203302

203399
postgresql	mysql
what is the best way to write a case insensitive query that is compatible with both mysql and postgresql

203401
defined	declare
nothing wrong with long variables names as long as they describe what the variables is doing rather than how it s declare or defined

203405
early-binding	late-binding
is there a reason you are using late-binding rather than early-binding

203410
keyboard	mouse
the keyboard and mouse hooks are what i find to be most valuable

203420
keyboard	mouse
i implemented a global keyboard and mouse hook during anappaday

203428
postgresql	mysql
i m not sure if there is an equivalent for mysql but you can always do this which is a bit ugly but should work in both mysql and postgresql

203443
build-process	msbuild
i use this with msbuild as part of cruisecontrol its very nice and with some of the community tasks for ms build you can do .config or any xml file substitutions as part of your build-process

203453
administration	account
also i d like people to be able to opt in and out using the same account administration interfaces they use now

203468
webforms	asp.net
just for clarity this is an asp.net web application using webforms and script# for the ajax functionality

203488
python	perl
and of course both mailman and majordomo come with all their source code python or perl respectively so it would be possible to customize either in any way you wanted

203506
reflection	runtime
you can ask your clients to add metadata annotations and check them at runtime with reflection like this

203520
checkbox	textbox
i have a .net winform control that contains a textbox and a checkbox

203520
checkbox	textbox
the textbox is for price the checkbox to indicate that the price is a price override

203520
checkbox	textbox
when the user enters a value into the price textbox the checkbox is automatically checked to indicate they are overriding the price value

203520
checkbox	textbox
however the price value being databound a bind event is fired which updates the textbox value which fires the text changed event handler which re-checks the checkbox

203538
populate	row
each row also has some unique-key and when you click on each of those acccordionpanels headers that will in turn reveal the content panels which will then open up another gridview which is populate with the information from that is pulled from a database with that unique-key

203561
nsstring	nsdata
if you want to use cocoa nsstring and nsdata have methods for reading writing to file and nsfilemanager gives you file operations

ruby	php
this is sort of a tangential answer to your question but i too came from php development over to ruby rails dev and it was a big transition for me

203571
base-class	inherited
require that they inherited from a base-class you provide which is guaranteed to be immutable

203580
checkbox	textbox
have you considered handling the textbox textchanged event to handle the checkbox state instead of binding it

203580
checkbox	textbox
you could then compare the current textbox value to the original and determine if the checkbox should be true or false

203582
jquery	.post
check out rick strahl s .post client templating with jquery

203585
compile-time	hardcode
added well the whole point starts with the idea that you don t specify at compile-time how to convert uris to uids in a hardcode fashion instead you might use dictionary or parsing to do that giving you a much more flexible systemd

203591
contains	set
in other words the result set should contains a number of rows equal to max slots enumerated slot from 1 to max slots and sum for each of these slots should reflect the sum of the slotvalues projected out to the slots positioning

203600
constructor	object
but if the object contains a bunch of other objects then instantiating it is gonna call all their constructor and destructors when it s deleted and you may get memory fragmentation and so on

203602
right-to-left	hebrew
i learned to program when i was 7 years old and only spoke hebrew which is right-to-left and with no english which made it quite a fascinating experience

203622
webforms	asp.net
for example as soon as you add a validator control to an asp.net webforms you have let business logic leak out into the view

203628
.net	wcf
you can use wcf services in .net 3.5 inside of windows workflow foundation a bit more easily

203630
switching	screens
to some extent this became handled in screens readers by the reader switching between a table mode and a layout mode based on what it saw inside the table

203630
nested	order
finally with a table-based layout in order to achieve a fine-grained control of the position of elements on the page highly nested tables are often used

203642

203659
internet-explorer	firefox
this works in both firefox and internet-explorer

203670
linux	bsd
the linux libelf is also gpl but i believe the bsd projects have their own libelf which you could use

203682
jquery-plugins	jquery
when in rome... example use the jquery style for jquery-plugins use the apple style for ios apps

203682
required	checked
the former example required more vigilance since javascript can get messy and isn t automatically checked while the latter example is simpler since the standard has been well-enforced and followed

203682
any	set
i will set aside all my naming habits to follow any existing conventions

203697
selected	checkbox
selected this little checkbox made all the difference

203701
.when	ready
.when we are ready to release we create a release branch that effectively freezes that code and only bug fixes are applied to it

203702
required	checked
ok so at some point in time somebody checked in some files with names that required a case sensitive filesystems into the trunk of a repository that i constantly checkout

203702
any	set
is there any way that i can set my local subversion copy so that it will ignore any files whose names differ only in case

203709
windows-xp	windows
server 2003 windows-xp windows 2000

203722
constructor	object
as an aside even if i were writing this object as a private inner class i would still provide a constructor to simplify the code to initialize the object

203727
sniffing	packets
packets sniffing is illegal without the network owners consent

203739
google-chrome	opera
it s the same in ff3 ie7 opera and google-chrome

203760
any	set
if you have any labels or other controls you want to reference in your code wire them in ib to your custom cell class - not the file s owner which you do not ever need to set using the above code you can leave it as nsobject

203762
prerequisites	installshield
there is no need to create an odbc connection to use a connection string like this and installshield makes the sql native client a prerequisites for sql 2005 connected databases so it is assured of having the correct driver available

203777
contains	any
the fact that your myasync interface doesn t contains any methods signatures and doesn t have a particularly informative name is a code smell from my perspective but i ll assume that this is just a dummy example

203777
callback	methods
remember that type erasure will erase this methods signature to getlist myasync callback

203782
perl	php
i used suid-perl to change effective uid gid and call those perl scripts from the php

203782
httpd.conf	.htaccess
in your .htaccess files or httpd.conf you should block all access to .svn directories from anyone anywhere

203782
revision	svn
it only has one action it can perform which is updating the web directory to the latest revision from svn

203783
value	field
the only purpose would be to set the field value according to whatever is in the constructor

203783
value	field
if the constructor is not called then all the field will get their default value 0 or null

203799
pointers	stack
pretty much the struct which are considered value types are allocated on stack while objects get allocated on heap while the object reference pointers gets allocated on stack

203803
private-members	self
if you are working with c++ and you find your self using friend keyword it is a very strong indication that you have a design issue because why the heck a class needs to access the private-members of other class

203808
contains	set
if you haven t set this and your datetime field in the database also contains a time part you may end up with more grouping than you anticipated

203810
arrays	loops
loops iterators and arrays indices are the obvious places to use short and arbitrary variable names

203819
.when	ready
you could also use selected on your input descriptor so that you only read .when it is ready

203828
defined	declare
basically you defined that your class holds a pointers to a struct that you forwarding declare

203844
webforms	asp.net
it s with asp.net webforms but you can ignore that if you wish

203850
json	xml
there is an example here which returns either json or xml data depending on the content-type header create rest api using asp.net-mvc that speaks both json and plain xml

203853
base-class	inherited
base-class object inherited

203874
digits	base
if you were coding in base 8 you d have and could extract each octal digits as a block of three bits

203893
macros	vba
simply add the code in vba to the macros that applies the required date format to the column with the date data

203897
macros	vba
thus if you record a macros the best way to find these problems in 2003 and then run it in 2002 you will have run time errors relating to the new arguments that simply do not work in the 2002 vba editor

203899
defined	declare
is there a way to get the compiler linker to list out identifier which have been declare or defined but are not being referred to anywhere

203910
positioning	slider
bindings can make this pretty straightforward for positioning stuff bind an x value to a slider though you will not get direct manipulation of the elements of course

203913
internationalization	localization
it covers the application globalisation internationalization and localization options in detail with pros and cons and excellent examples and also topics i hadn t considered such as localising the deployment clickonce and setup projects

203919
instances	private
you probably should add a private __clone methods to disallow cloning of an instances

203933
strcpy	fgets
functions such as gets and strcpy are replaced with their safer counterparts like fgets and strncpy which have a length arguments to prevent buffering overruns

203943
multiple-processes	multiprocessing
as mentioned in another post python 2.6 has the multiprocessing module which can take advantage of multiple cores processors it gets around gil by starting multiple-processes transparently

203944
sql-server	ms-access
a method of doing this which hasn t been mentioned is to use a pass-through query which will enable you to keep all your code in ms-access without having to create objects on the sql-server

203966
directx	gdi
but you can do the trick by creating a converter class which will accept all output graphics from your gdi designed application classes and convert the format to fit the needs of directx or sdl classes depending what do you want to use

203966
directx	gdi
so i think you can do the same for converting gdi - directx or gdi - sdl

203992
duplicates	elements
the easiest way to remove repeated elements is to add the contents to a set which will not allow duplicates and then add the set back to the arraylist

204006
constructor	object
you can get it through the constructor property of the base object class

204009
value	field
used for intermediate value for assignment to a field or use as a methods argument

204025
postgresql	mysql
what do i have to consider in database design for a new application which should be able to support the most common relational database systems sql server mysql oracle postgresql ...

204032
attributes	properties

204034
persistence	hibernate
or use a persistence technology such as hibernate nhibernate that abstracts away the difference between different dbs

204060
oracle	mysql
i currently support oracle mysql and sqlite

204060
enterprise	platform
commercially it is worth it for enterprise level applications but for a blog or say a website you might as well stick with one platform if you can

204062
messagebox	alert
i have been using win32api.messagebox to do alert and this works for apps running from the interactive prompt and normally executed code however when i built a python service when a messagebox is triggers i can hear the beep but the box does not display

204064
oracle	mysql
it might turn out that you may cover 95 of your potential customers by supporting just oracle sql server or mysql sql server or.

204068
sql-server	mysql
i could theoretically run the c# under mono but mysql is so sql-server specific even though i don t use stored procs it would be a huge effort to port

204068
sql-server	oracle
if you are targeting a business corporate market you ll find that some shops are strickly oracle or strictly sql-server and that your app might be ruled out in the early rounds of the competition based on the technology it uses

204071
sql-server	oracle
for example sql-server has an integer but oracle uses a number

204073
build-system	qmake
qt has its own build-system qmake which creates platform dependent makefiles so no makefile hassles

204082
message	alert
when the service wants to alert the user of some conditional it would notify the desktop-application which would then display a regular message box

204085
.net	wcf
the best solution if we re talking .net seem to be to use wcf and streaming http

204094
webserver	security
if you re already going through a webserver then it s probably your ie security settings are a bit strange

204102
pointers	stack
there are similar names in the language but they only refer to the default accessibility of things when you call new you get a pointers to the heap location while if you have a non-pointers reference it is stored directly on stack or within the other object ala struct in c#

204141
selected	button
so in your controller you can get the value of selected button with

204150
interpreter	runtime
the global interpreter lock in the cpython and pypy runtime preclude this option

204150
multiple-processes	multiprocessing
use the processing module now include in python 2.6 as the multiprocessing module to run your code in multiple-processes at once

204152
hash	md5
you can then use a javascript md5 library to generate a hash password by combining the random string and the password pwhash md5 randomstring+password

204156
dependency-injection	service-locator
if you don t understand dependency-injection ioc or aspect oriented concepts spring may not do too much for you and you might as well stick to service-locator type things and explicit try catch blocks all over your code..

204180
versioning	upgrade
there s a general point here worth making i think that you can only automate db versioning and upgrade so far - the abstractions are very leaky

204183
expression	brackets
when you re writing queries use full join syntax and brackets the joins so that each join is between a single table and bracketsed expression

204186
contains	any
in writing some test code i have found that selector.select can return without selector.selectedkeys contains any keys to process

204192
sql-server	oracle
in 2001 i worked on a product that had to support oracle 8 ms sql-server 2000 and ms jet 3.51 a.k.a

204192
sql-server	oracle
one approach was to create linked tables in access jet for oracle and sql-server then exclusively write jet sql

204192
sql-server	oracle
oracle and sql-server used substring but jet required the keyword to be mid

204195
moving-average	average
you need a smoothing filtering the simplest would be a moving-average just calculate the average of the last n points

3des	rsa
rsa with 3des cbc sha

204269
oracle	mysql
out of curiosity i ve switched between oracle ms sql mysql and sqlite with the same set of migrations and the worst problem i had was discovering i had to ensure my column and table names were not in the union of reserved word lists across the dbs

204270
16-bit	8bit
that s because in a 32-bit environment the cpu can handle 32-bit values quicker than 8bit or 16-bit values so this is a speed size tradeoff

204276
webforms	asp.net
oh and if you ve never been exposed to webforms and come from a classic asp background why not give asp.net mvc a try

204279
excel-vba	vb6
to make it even more confusing i do a lot of work with excel-vba which is still vb6

204281
string-length	maxlength
small note - i initially suspected the string-length i ve read that strings in ie have a maxlength of 1mb which is what you were hitting i m not 100 sure if this is accurate but i changed the concatenation to an arrays push - which is generally faster anyway

204295
contains	any
this allows the clients that produces these files to store data in any way they want so the interpretion of all types contains are not known

204298

objectoutputstream	ioexception
private void writeobject objectoutputstream out throws ioexception

204402
objectinputstream	ioexception
private void readobject objectinputstream in throws ioexception classnotfoundexception

204416
methods	extend
if so you could extend it to include an isobjectderived methods with semantics that it returns true iff the class only derives from object

204423
base-class	inherited
maybe composition instead of inherited is what you want have a base-class object as a member and just implement the interfaces you need forwarding any methods needed to the member

updates i m looking for some advice specific to duplex channels where the server might try to use a callback channel that was faulted

204442
filtering	sorting
the adjacency model also described on the page you link to provides for the most flexible sorting and filtering but with a significant performance impact

204442
nested	order
as for changing your order criteria it s a one off batch job so you can afford to blow some ram and cpu on it the most flexible answer would be to break the nested set representation down into an adjacency representation and rebuild the nested set from the adjacency based on new criteria

204459
having	select
having three separate select options if you re limiting to three

204466

204537
put	get
or to really get some reuse going put the logic in a service

204552
credentials	account
i would think that if your app pool identity is a domain account you can use spsecurity.runwithelevatedprivileges to use the app pool credentials to access the file

204552
credentials	account
or use impersonate to explicitly pass another account s credentials

204563
contains	elements
could you initialize the hashtable with one elements contains key and value of empty string

enterprise	platform
i have a specific need now to do some cross platform development and was wondering what the community thought about mono as a choice in the enterprise

204712
32-bit	64bit
many of the techniques used for 32-bit overflow chacking apply to 64bit as well not all of the techniques discussed use the next larger integer type to handle the overflow

packaging	building
even more importantly because you use a separate server for building and packaging your application it will always package everything the same way every time

204799
highlight	selected
i recall that in an earlier version of eclipse there was a context sensitive action from the synchronize view that would highlight in the navigator view the same files that you have selected in the synchronize view

204799
selection	highlight
then from the navigator view you can choose to export the highlight selection

205096
python	c++
there s also shed-skin which translates python to c++ but i can t say if it s any good

205096
interpreter	runtime
pypy implements a jit compiler which attempts to optimize runtime by translating pieces of what s running at runtime to machine code if you write for the pypy interpreter that might be a feasible path

205096
cpython	pypy
the same author that is working on jit in pypy wrote psyco previously which optimizes python in the cpython interpreter

205114
selected	button
the behaviour of the button is to selected the adjacent node in the tree

205114
selected	button
the first time i click on one of these button i get the expected behaviour and adjacent node is selected and the both panels are updated to reflect this change

205114
selected	button
the selected node of the treeview seems to remember the previously selected node and the button act on this node

205119
paint.net	photoshop
if this is something you will be doing on an occasional basis and doesn t need automating you can do it in an image editor that supports layers such as photoshop or paint shop pro probably gimp or paint.net too but i m not sure about those

205129
itextsharp	itext
itextsharp is a port of the itext a free java-pdf library

205136
oracle	mysql
i m a real novice when it comes to oracle administration and have mostly just used mysql in the past so i m definitely out of my element

205137
stream	send
that way if you re unable to open and stream it then you will be unable to send it and can action the appropriate error-handling

205138

is there a way to quickly create a work-a-like with the additional animation support in jquery scriptaculous or mootools

205157
version-control	git
and to head off this becoming a what version-control should you use war once you re using svn you can move to any number of more advanced version-control systems such as git or svk

205162
ftpwebrequest	ftp
ftp process assumed that ftpwebrequest could talk to a bank s secure ftp server

205175
any	set
if the process has superuser privileges any argument to setuid 2 is allowed but then all -uids get set to the same value

205178
arguments	default
these is some arguments about just how random the default inputs to the dev random entropy pool really are

205189
webserver	security
assuming sql-server log into sql-server enterprise manager and under security - logins open the properties for the applicable user probably the network service or asp.net account of the webserver and go to the database access tab and ensure that the permit checkbox is ticked for the database you are connecting to

205210
value	field
also you can use the docvariables field to retrieve the value of a document variables after it has been set to display within a word document

205244
google-chrome	firefox
both mozilla firefox and google-chrome load the web site perfectly with no hassles

205244
internet-explorer	safari
why might microsoft internet-explorer and apple safari fail to load my web site properly

205251
queue	fifo
work items are queue up centrally and need to be processed in an essentially fifo order

205271
project-management	project
i ve recently begun evaluating a few project-management project for the company i work for

205295
push	pull
from there on out you can clone and pull from the central repository and push to the central repository

205304
versioning	migrate
it doesnt have to be the newest versioning it doesnt even have to be to a gui versioning but i do need to migrate to a supported os such as linux

205305
value	field
what you want is either to make it a templates field and use a hidden-field to hold the value or set the style on the control to display none

205312
where-clause	sql
then you can filter apply a sql where-clause or sort the data using the dataview s methods

205332
internet-explorer	google-chrome
the web site now loads perfectly in microsoft internet-explorer and apple safari as well as mozilla firefox and google-chrome

205337
sql-server	mysql
i wish to migrate the database of a legacy web app from sql-server to mysql

205350
arguments	default
however the default in jquery.getscript as in all the other calls in jquery s ajax library is to append a further additional arguments where 1234567 is really a time stamp

205356
getter	setter
if you want an easy way to copy from type a to type b then you could try beanutils.copyproperties as long as the setter and getter of type a and type b match

205361
postgresql	oracle
postgresql scales better than most if you are going to stay with a relational db oracle would be it

205364
postgresql	mysql
mysql i am told can be optimized to do faster reads than postgresql but both are pretty ridiculously fast in terms of # transactions sec they support and it doesn t sound like that s your problem

205372
aggregate	grouping
i think you will also find that this is invalid ansi sql because d.date is not part of a grouping by or the result of an aggregate operation and should not be able to be selected ed

205388
selected	textbox
all you have are selected and from clauses and a textbox for the lastname column that may or may not have a value in it

205394
javadoc	doxygen
the documentation of the code javadoc doxygen etc

205417
session-cookies	cookies
as far as i understand it curl will handle session-cookies automatically for you if you enable cookies as long as you reuse your curl handle for each request in the session

205417
any	set
in any case you have to set one of the two in order to enable cookies at all in libcurl

205417
session-cookies	cookies
that won t read any cookies from disk but it will enable session-cookies for the duration of the curl handle

205425
postgresql	mysql
on the db question i d say postgresql scales better and has better data integrity than mysql

205427
value	field
final field of a primitive at declaration time the value is inlined

205427
reflection	runtime
the final fields at runtime using reflection we would get

205428
required	checked
if you are using reflection to checked the class of each object and you can determine programmatically that that class is immutable immutable final fields then you don t need to required that the class itself is final

205464
postback	ajax
i think you re right about the ajax partial page postback that it doesn t update the hidden input __viewstate

205472
order	join
this happens for instance when mysql creates a temporary table during some join or order by or grouping by operations

205477
duplicates	contains
you can see that although the name of the photo most certainly is stored in some other table contains the photos and i could retrieve the name from there i will duplicates the name in the metadata field because you don t want to do any joins on other database tables if you want speed

205486
put	get
i get a little fed up sometimes with co-workers who excessively put everything into its own methods or class or file and this becomes a nightmare to navigate

205545
sql-server	oracle
properly configured oracle or microsoft s sql-server should be able to handle anything you throw at it

205556
sql-server	postgresql
i ve worked with what i consider huge data bases in both microsoft sql-server 11 million records daily logging events at a large global automotive company and in postgresql several million records as well for gis data

205565
sql-server	oracle
if it s terabytes of data i m pretty sure oracle or sql-server won t have a problem with it

205592
directory	folder
i m assuming you have frompath an absolute path for a folder and topath an absolute path for a folder file and your re looking for a path that with represent the file folder in topath as a relative path from frompath your current working directory is frompath then something like this should work

205610
getter	setter
what finally convinced me was the fairly obvious point in retrospect that properties in .net are just syntactic sugar for getter and setter methods and those methods have a different name from the property itself

205614
any	set
is there any other flag setting that i am missing to set unset which tells mysql to not expect a password

205649
postgresql	mysql
i say database because it is column-oriented a very different model from row-oriented databases like mysql postgresql oracle etc

205688
safari	opera
i know ie and gecko browsers support window.onerror but what about opera and safari

205694
subtract	time
use the date command to convert the two time into a standard format and subtract them

205722
virtualization	vmware
what are the key use cases for the use of virtualization -- that is running one or more virtual pcs using software such as vmware and microsoft virtual pc -- for software development

205722
virtualization	vmware
also -- are there other instances uses of virtualization that aren t covered by my definition above use of a tool like ms virtual pc or vmware and that are useful to developers

205726
emacs	vim
you can use pylint for such things and there seems to be a way to integrate it into emacs but i ve never done the latter b c i m a vim user

205728
environment	building
the simplest case which applies to my current situation is that we have a complex client-server environment and with virtualization every developer can very quickly get a baseline set of operating systems to deploy their local building to and verify end to end functionality

205739
show	next
many presenters use a viewmodel for presentations - it allows them to revert immediately to reset the presentation for the next day transfer all presentation materials quickly between computers and not have to show your attendees your messy my document folder

205751
user-controls	wpf-controls
we are creating custom wpf-controls not user-controls for an xbap application and we would like to add a storyboard animation to scale the control to be 110 of its original size when the mouse hovers over it

205774
virtualbox	vmware
i used to use virtualpc but i really hated not having any type of snapshot feature like vmware and virtualbox have

205781
sql-server	oracle
oracle sql-server db2 etc will all handle large enterpise databases

205800
keyboard	mouse
the functionality we need is to specify which application is shared and also to give the viewers permission to control the mouse and keyboard

205806
json	xml
however you will need control over the webservice so that you can turn it into xml or json or whatever format you wish to use

205813
where-clause	sql
i think it s not a good idea contruct the sql concatenating the where-clause values like you are doing

205827
sql-server	oracle
this posting i made a few weeks ago discusses the relative merits of oracle and sql-server for vldb applications with a segue into shared nothing systems of which the best known example is teradata that give you the best degree of scalability through having no central i o bottleneck

205858
xsd	xml
however it is especially useful if you have xml schemas describing your domain objects as it really maps well to xsd there s even a beta tool xsd2jibx which can take xsds and create stub domain classes and mappings which you can then take and coax to fit your existing domain model

205864
oracle-xe	oracle
since you are comparing db2 and oracle i figured i d direct you to a comparison of db2 express-c and oracle-xe on my blog

205884
google-chrome	safari
webkit safari google-chrome etc now appears to support onerror

205886
xsd	xml
intellisense for xml documents is controlled by xsd files

205917
xsd	xml
the parser which wrote the java classes was quite good with little discrepancy against the original xsd though i think it had problems supporting abstract xml elements

205938
python	php
if there is a library for asp.net has to be available as well for other kind of language php python ror etc

205959
binary-tree	tree
in a way std map is a tree it is required to have the same performance characteristics as a balanced binary-tree but it doesn t expose other tree functionality

205959
boost	stl
in general if there s a basic library functionality that you want that s not in the stl the fix is to look at boost

205982
firefox	opera
window.onerror catches all errors in ie and most errors in firefox but does nothing in safari and opera

205997
for-loop	loops
if you need the index rather than using a for each loops i would just use a for-loops that went through the indices so you know what you have

206011
children	nodes
- are the number of children for a nodes fixed or variables

206012
hash	md5
i want to generate unique filenames per image so i m using md5 to make filenames.since two of the same image could come from different locations i d like to actually base the hash on the image contents

206024
highlight	selected
when i selected a node the label gets updated as expected and the treenode that i click on becomes highlight and the previously selecteded node is no longer highlight

206024
highlight	selected
however if a node is original highlighted selected in the code-behind the highlight is not removed when selected another node

206024
highlight	selected
why is its highlight not removed when selected another node

206057
any	set
do check if your doc has any attributes set

206134
dialog	pop-up
from a practice standpoint - excluding accessibility - modal windows provide an alternative that are less startling as say dialog boxes and feel less intrusive than pop-up windows

206134
javascript	dom
they typically require javascript and because of the way that modals are managed with respect to the dom screen readers will not interpret them well

206134
dialog	pop-up
i think that when used correctly they provide a decent experience - if something has to get my attention then i d rather it do so without redirecting me from the page showing an ugly operating system themed dialog or a pop-up which my browser will likely block anyway

206146
getter	setter
there is no need for getter setter and no-arg constructor just to satisfy the tools

206153
queue	fifo
queue are for fifo order not random access order

206159
keyboard	mouse
to achieve a multiple selection tree control you will need to draw the tree items yourself and override the keyboard and mouse handling

206165
hash	md5
if you re still concerned using a combination of sha-1 plus md5 as another answer suggested gets you to a total of 288 high-quality hash bits which means you ll have a 50 chance of a collision once there are 2 144 files

206169
spring.net	ninject
microsoft s unity ioc containers vs castle windsor spring.net ninject etc

206170
twitter	tweets
with twitter s search api i can use the since_id to grab all tweets from a specific id

206199
fopen	fread
the commands fopen and fread default to little-endian 1 encoding for the integers

206199
fopen	fread
fopen or the fread commands in matlab

206216
any	set
for future reference the em_linescroll message is what you send to any multi-line edit control to set the scroll positioning

206236
xsd	xml
if you have an xsd for the xml and you don t need to bind the data to an existing set of classes then i really like xmlbeans

206258
bugzilla	trac
has anyone implements functionality within trac or using external tools to get the functionality of the bugzilla whine

206265
msbuild	nant
msbuild from nant

206272
data-members	private
is there a way to hide private data-members of a c++ class away from its users in the cpp file

206275
hash	md5
there are pairs of different files with the same md5 hash not theoretical

206275
hash	md5
for your application this means someone could upload two different images which would have the same md5 hash or someone could generate such a pair of images and publish them somewhere in the internet such that two of your users will later try to upload them with confusing results

206289
calloc	free
you d have to keep track of how many void were originally calloc d and iterate over them free-ing each one then free the original values variables

206296
malloc	free
i would malloc the individual pieces of the arrays i need and then free them when i m done i suppose

206296
malloc	free
you can t free something you didn t first malloc

206299
malloc	free
edit you re also asking for trouble by alternating between c++-style new delete with c-style malloc free

206299
malloc	free
it is okay to use them both as long as you don t delete something you malloc ed or free something you new ed but you re going to mix them up in your head if you go like this

206309
put	get
monorail and the related castle projects always seem a bit disjointed which will put off the less than expert developer just looking to get started

206315
value	field
it appears that the properties from the list are added to the office 2007 doc but only with the default value for the field on upload creation

206318
fiddler	charles
aside from fiddler charles and poster firefox plugins

206320
directory	folder
i m using grep to get a list of all files and folders in the given directory but i don t know which of the values returned is a folder name and which is a file with no file extention

206323
selected	textbox
specifically i want to execute diff on two files that are programmatically selected and write the results to a textbox

206325
filtering	sorting
the data layer returns iqueryable which permits the consuming layer to apply filtering and sorting expression on top of that

206325
filtering	sorting
the bonus is being able to specify a single getproducts method for example and then decide appropriately in the consuming layer how you want that sorting filtering or even just a particular range of results

206336
private	self
using a descriptive name for the new methods using private date initnexttuesday in your case will allow for the self commenting code advantage

206353
any	set
you can launch any command-line program using the process class and set the standardoutput property of the process instance with a stream reader you create either based on a string or a memory location

206365
put	get
you would have to get them to upload the image to your server then put the jpeg on a page with javascript to call window.print

206384
callback	methods
this solution got my object from the callback methods and displayed the dates on the page properly using the date format library

206386
order	join
to get a feed selected from events_feeds join in events order by timestamp

206395
environment	building
if your building-server is running in a viewmodel you can make a snapshots of it for every software release in order to be 100 sure that you can recreate the building environment in case you want to make patches to old release for example

206409
firefox	opera
every browser that supports xhtml firefox opera safari ie9 supports self-closing syntax on every element

206443
installation	upgrade
snapshots and rollbacks are nice too but i use them only occasionally really useful during installation upgrade tests

206443
versioning	upgrade
suppose you re developing a new versioning of your software and checking that the upgrade from the previous versioning works correctly.

206456
solaris	aix
the oda products are compiled for a number of operating systems including windows 32-bit sgi solaris windows 64-bit macintosh hp windows ce linux ibm aix

206464
updating	updates
the updates will be updating all the matching base value regardless so i didn t really need the resource key after all which allowed me to use the grouping by

206484
put	get
i know that i shouldn t have to put locationid at the end of each one but i can t get the syntax even close to being correct

206496
calloc	free
also note though it is not illegal to use both new delete and calloc free in the same piece of code it is frowned upon

206505
instances	private
i ve tried this on numerous classes - public private static you name it - in several assemblies either the startup project or a referenced project and the context menu item create instances never appears

206510
swing	swt
you already have the choice of swing and swt can you really do better than these two teams

206528
value	field
i have this function in my javascript code that updates html field with their new value whenever it is called

206528
value	field
if you use another section of the page that wouldn t change the value of the total cost but calls the updatefields function again the cost field then updates correctly

206534
filesystems	fat
is to move them to a fat filesystems

206538
python	java
currently properly supported in c++ java and python with more implementations coming from third parties - such as myself

206558
order	join
i end up rewriting the query change the order of join change some grouping and then it eventually works but i just don t quite get it

206560
ethernet	lan
i specifically want to know about a tcp connection - not just the ethernet connection as a whole your lan connection might be dandy but there could be an issue going to an outside server

206574
put	get
to get a very rough estimation i could just put nslog calls on either side of the code i wanted to profiling but it seems like the processor being otherwise very busy could skew the results

206575
integer	zero
the only way i can think that this would cause a performance loss is that the compiler has to compare the entire integer to 0 and then assign the bool appropriately unlike a conversion such as a char to bool where the result can be copied over because a bool is one byte and so they are effectively the same or an integral conversion which involves copying some or all of the source to the destination possibly after a zero of the destination if it s bigger than the source in terms of memory

206587
command-line	cmd
the difference with the visual-studio cmd line compilation feature is that eclipse does not seem to directly read its .project and .classpath in a cmd-line argument

206613
python	ruby
the macros they allow plus mixing in good features from ruby and python and other languages

206622
functional-programming	imperative-programming
logic programmers are rarer but can often be found coming from non imperative-programming backgrounds they are also the sort of people that find functional-programming intuitive

206642
swing	swt
i d go look at the source for the swing and or swt as they are already implemented

206643
put	get
my understanding is that you can store it prior to authentication but i could never get anyone that would put that in writing

206645
contains	any
a multipart identifier is any description of a field or table that contains multiple parts - for instance mytable.somerow - if it can t be bound that means there s something wrong with it - either you ve got a simple typo or a confusion between table and column

206651
click	mouse
this will save many wasted mouse click every time you open a project from within the ide

206695
profiling	debugging
in addition to having seriously powerful real-time debugging capabilities phped from nusphere www.nusphere.com has a built-in profiling that can be run with a single click from inside the ide

206705
javascript	dom
the way to change class i assume you re talking of the dom in javascript is

206721
click	mouse
it takes 2 mouse clicks to set time click 1 for hour and click 2 for minutes

206743
profiling	trace
in my previous job i designed and helped build a run-time production profiling tool that among other cool features was able to give me .net stack trace for every sql statement that executed

206765
instances	self
in constrast objects in __init__ are created at instantiation time and belong to the instances only when they are assign to self

206788
windows-vista	windows
i ve installed the windows xampp package on three separate computers 2 running windows-vista 32 bit 1 ultimate 1 home premium and 1 running windows-vista 64 home premium

206823
python	ruby
i am interested in getting some python code talking to some ruby code on windows linux and possibly other platforms

206823
python	ruby
specificlly i would like to access classes in ruby from python and call their methods access their data create new instances and so on

206823
python	ruby
what have other people done to get code from python and ruby communicating with one another either locally on the same system or remotely accross a network

206829
value	field
the following c++ example that finds a running instance of the windows calculator and gets the value of the edit field in it

206839
python	java
please be advised that i don t speak from personal experience here but i imagine jruby and jython the ruby and python implementations in the jvm would be able to to easily talk to each other as well as java code

206855
beautifulsoup	mechanize
i have previous experience with a mechanize beautifulsoup and python combo but i am up for something new

206890
debugging	trace
use the trace files from running #5 to generate unit tests using wcf load test from codeplex this somehow seems to me an ideal tool for recreating user errors in production field in a debugging environment

206897
environment	building
building environment prerequisites

206899
display	width
i don t mean a link but literally display the url as a value to the user assuming that the text might be in a container of fixed width and you don t want to wrap or run outside of the container

206900
any	set
and any cpu was set to x64..

206927
32-bit	64bit
so this question is specific to gnu linux 32-bit or 64bit version

206939
hash	md5
next i need to update the md5 fields with the hash of the file contents

206941
google-chrome	firefox
now that firefox s awesome bar and google-chrome s omnibox address bars can be used to search the browsing history it makes it much easier for users to search their history for previously visited sites so having clean urls may help the user find sites in their history more easily

206941
google-chrome	firefox
since both firefox and google-chrome search for each space separated word typed into the address bar it could be argued that it isn t necessary for searching that the url be completely human readable but to allow the user to actually read the keywords they are interested in from the url the amount of noise should be kept to a minimum

206942
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql are very fast to connect mysql especially and thus usually connect on each request

206948
least-squares	regression
i want to do sparse high dimensional a few thousand features least-squares regression with a few hundred thousands of examples

206953
indexof	equals
indexof won t work since i may have a number of equals objects

206963
shell	bash
as noted in the comments to the question it s not really about sed but how to include a quote in a quoted string in a shell bash

206985
indexof	equals
if you have two objects that are equals but not identical and you do want to distinguish between them then you do have a problem since indexof is using the equals methods

206993
expression	evaluation
the function iif returns one of 2 values depends of the evaluation of an expression

206997
having	select
the problem i am having is that internet-explorer doesn t seem to extend it s hover over the options of a select box

207014
folder	dir
i think enso does this because they have a dir in their folder called chrome.

207020
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome browser is based on webkit as used by safari

207033
msbuild	nant
it obviously isn t as customizable as using msbuild or nant but it does have some options

207050
perl	ruby
you could use it with other languages too see its bindings for perl ruby ...

207056
sql-agent	msde
i implements this a lot at clients who have sql express no sql-agent for backups like msde

207059
emacs	vim
or from emacs or vim you could run python -c import x where x is the name of your file minus the .py extension

207062
google-chrome	firefox
firefox also has the word google-chrome all over its code base

207073
reflection	runtime
assuming you are using generic to have an arraylist you can add non-node into it by using reflection because during runtime the type information is not kept

207104
order	add
i d also add that a .net assembly has to be strongly named which requires it to be signed in order to be added to the gac

207112
lan	wan
for the lan wan you can use a combinations of the following win32 api calls to tell you whether the remote connection exists without having to deal with a network time-out

207132
perl	awk
one might say that awk has been completely obsoleted by perl

207132
perl	awk
however since i was using awk since before perl existed i still use it

207132
python	perl
as for more serious scripts i use python instead of perl

207152
linux	unix
if you are on unix or linux i think you can create a symbolic link to the library in the directory you want the library

207157
value	field
i need help with the proper syntax to get the value and display out of my xml field

207160
postgresql	mysql
bmdhacks is right that if you re using mysql or postgresql it doesn t matter as much since connections are pretty cheap

207166
export	csv
no problems easy enough but i want to transform one of the properties parentcontainerdn before export to csv

207234
ip-address	hostname
so if the ip-address of my computer within the local network is 192.168.1.1 and i have three other connected computers i would want it to return the ip-addresses 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3 192.168.1.4 and possibly their hostname

207290
expression	evaluation
prior to posting this question i spent quite a bit of time looking at python templates engines hoping that one might expose the sort of low-level functionality i m asking about -- namely something that can find expression in a variety of contexts and tell me where they are rather than being limited to finding expression embedded using a single hard-coded syntax always evaluation them and always substituting the results back into the original string

207315
debugging	trace
the processors don t often have the trace capability without high end emulation hardware needed to perform good code coverage without inserting additional debugging code into your firmware which then has consequences and side effects that are difficult to control especially with timing issues in real time systems

207315
low-level	hardware
you can even test the low-level hardware drivers if you are interested in developing the software emulation required for that although timing issues can be somewhat troublesome

207320
low-level	hardware
c# as a managed and protected run time engine does not allow low-level hardware access and the memory locations associated with actual hardware are not available

207343
priority-queue	heap
i m writing a data structure in c# a priority-queue using a fibonacci heap and i m trying to use it as a learning experience for tdd which i m quite new to

207446
integer	digits
the three subpatterns that are used more than once are the optional sign the digits sequence for an integer and the decimal fraction

207459
driver	kernel
to expand on adam s answer you can t even perform memory-mapped i o from a win32 application without the cooperation of a kernel driver

207459
driver	kernel
you either need to write a kernel driver to do what you re talking about or have a driver install that has an api that ll let you make requests for i o against particular physical addresses and such a driver would be a pretty big security hole waiting to happen i d imagine

207461
groovy	java
assuming you want to do this with groovy guessing based on the groovy tag your approaches are likely to be either heavily shell-script oriented or using java libraries

207461
groovy	java
you re probably stuck with finding java libs for use with groovy for the html parsing as it doesn t appear there are any groovy libs for it

207485
any	set
is there any way to set how deep a line is drawn so that you can plot things beneath what s already there

mootools allows you to do that as do jquery prototype dojo and yui and i m sure most of the other frameworks do as well

207554
jsonp	ajax
for get requests i can do this with ajax and jsonp but that doesn t work with post requests

207560
callback	methods
yes it gets ugly wrapping every methods callback into the edt in a runnable instance but that s java for you

207568
swing	swt
that said though i find swing easier to work with at a code level than swt

207593
pyflakes	pylint

it should be a pointers to the left right root pointerss a double-pointers so the posted code is correct although somewhat unclear

207625
compact-framework	.net
it is a native function not .net compact-framework

207625
windows-mobile	windows-ce
the function only exists on windows-mobile 5.0 os s or better this does not mean it exists on all windows-ce devices

207625
shutdown	restart
just from a personal perspective at work we ve implemented our own shutdown and restart facilities for a windows ce based os

coverity	klocwork
what i d like to know is how the commercial product such as klocwork and coverity stack up against these

207655
unsafe	out
i haven t personally encountered anything related to memory-management or chipset but i ve seen a lot of wholly unexpected exception-handling flow out of comesque situations ldap as a lousy example maybe file or database i o where you might not declare or feel like you re calling unsafe code but nonetheless encounter low-level problems beyond your control that return nothing but obscure error codes.

207663
pointers	stack
generally it is immune to pointers errors and exec data type problems but .net is not immune to stack or memory overflow - there are a couple of points of memory leakage infinite resurrection and large object heap

207669

filtering	sorting
enhanced version of content query web part that has the same functionality like a regular list web part views filtering sorting easy to use interface

207720
firefox	safari
i ve studied and tested tons of properties regarding document height in firefox ie safari documentelement.clientheight documentelement.offsetheight documentelement.scrollheight body.offsetheight body.scrollheight .

207720
firefox	safari
does someone have a real cross-browser at least firefox ie safari solution

207721
contains	any
the gamename.engine assembly contains a bunch of interfaces so other parts of the program don t need to depend on any particular implementation

207727
mobile-phones	nokia
all popular mobile-phones from nokia sony ericsson samsung come with a java virtual-machine installed

207727
compact-framework	.net
if you instead are targeting business customers the microsoft .net compact-framework is the way to go in my opinion

207730
subclassing	superclass
the idea being i can easily create lots of similar subclassing from a number of superclass which have similar characteristics

207737
authentication	login
i have authentication mode set to forms in my asp.net web.config but am still getting a windows login prompt when i browse to the website

207768
boost	stl
is there an elegant way to do this with less lines of code using stl functionality and not using boost

207803

you have configured anonymous access in iis administrator but the iis user does not have permission to access the filesystem defaulting to the login dialog to authentication as windows user

207809
pointers	stack
you ve just allocated some stack space for a pointers to a

207817
where-clause	sql
update i realize that with special operators this becomes a google to sql where-clause conversion rather than a google to tsquery conversion

207817
where-clause	sql
should produce an sql where-clause like this

207821
python	ruby
this isn t what your after but worth a read embed python interpreter in ruby this code s pretty old

207821
python	ruby
fukusima ruby python doc index.html

207824
protected	public
looking at preferences- javascript- appearance- members sort order it seems able to indicate whether a methods is public private or protected but all of my use the default marker a blue triangle

207829
contains	elements
what is the optimal approach to use given that the cricital sections typically do not contains a lot of operations mostly just adding removing inserting or getting elements from the list

207831
python	java
i have used getopt in python and was hoping there would be something similar in java

207832
postgresql	oracle
postgresql sql server 2008 and any recent version of oracle all have spatial indexing table partitioning and blobs and are capable of acting as the back-end of a large geographic database

207836
export	report
the report displays fine but the export link is present but disabled and the selected a format drop down list that s normally visible when you view the report in reporting services isn t there

207842
where-clause	sql
then in the search condition where-clause of your sql dml you would use both the varchar max search value itself plus a hash of your varchar max search value on the respective columns in your table

207856
copy-protection	drm
how does this reflect on the open-source world where many programs are available that seemingly infringe on commercial rights copy-protection and drm circumventions

207858
installation	upgrade
my only experience with 4 was trying an upgrade on the heavily-customised installation

207867
oracle	mysql
i m not targetting a specific database here but oracle is probably the most relevant although i m testing on mysql for the time being as part of a proof of concept

207871
ubuntu	debian
i use ubuntu debian

207888
constructor	object
build a static method for the configobj class which acts as a de-facto constructor for loading the object

207895
silverlight	wpf
what you wanted is a silverlight version of the wpf headeredcontentcontrol

207897
any	set
what that will do is any default content within your tags - will be set as the child property on your class

207897
any	set
then once it s been set you can assign it to any control you like

207901
datagridview	databound
i have a databound datagridview

207906
icollection	ienumerable
for example the icollection interface implements ienumerable while adding additional methods

207910
administration	account
to access local iis web sites you must run visual-studio in the context of an administration account

207911
malloc	free
each malloc you do has a size-tag in it so you do not need to state the size of the chunk you pointed for free -routine

207943
ftp	ssh
from a cursory glance it s an ssh implementation in pure python which allows tunneling for things like ftp

207943
sftp	ftps
update a commenter pointed out that i mixed up sftp and ftps sorry

207945
linux	bsd
gnu ps as used on linux supports both which it can do because the posix options have dashes in front and the bsd ones don t as well as some of it s own options in the normal gnu --long-option-name style

207957
attributes	properties
although i can see you might want the properties values mapped to attributes of the entity object

207960
exception-handling	try-catch
from the answers it seems the most popular way is to use a simple command-line option or try accessing the console object in a try-catch block in a service the console is not attached to the process and trying to access it throws an exception-handling

207970
datagridview	databound
rows cannot be programmatically removed unless the datagridview is databound to an ibindinglist that supports change notification and allows deletion

207972
logout	login
if it goes well you can logout and login as a standard user and print again

207982
graphics2d	java-2d
java-2d graphics2d and friends is indeed the best choice that i know of

207992
defined	declare
if an implementation permits it main can be declare in other ways but this makes the program implementation defined and no longer strictly conforming

207996
libavcodec	ffmpeg
ffmpeg s libavcodec and libavformat are your friend

208003
ostream	std
returning from operator allows the chaining of operator like on std ostream s

208008
versioning	upgrade
2 edit i have upgrade my f# versioning to 1.9.6.2 and still the same consequence

208018
csv	xml
if it was just one sheet i d use the excel csv content type but i ve heard something about an xml format that can represent an entire workbook

208030
ftps	ftp
twisted seems to have some implementation of ftps ftp over ssl under the conch sub-project

208033
frame	width
especially since the swf has multiple frame and the frame are of different width height

208035
extends	sealed
you can not extends the rulesetdialog class since it is sealed but you can host it in your app

208038
databound	gridview
i m looking for a way to selectively apply a css class to individual rows in a gridview based upon a property of the databound item

208046
substitution	replace
i m happy doing simple text substitution using regular expressions but i m having trouble working out how to replace multiple-times inside the match in order to get the output i desire

208050
selected	button
if you look in the build section of the project info pane selected the project hit the info button in xcode choose the build tab from the top you can see many of the options

208066
compatibility	legacy
however i do agree with you in today s environment there s probably not a lot of reason to continue doing it except where legacy compatibility makes sense nix etc

208068
space	input
i imagine because some code somewhere is still processing the input as a set of space seperated parameters much the way the windows command prompt handles unquoted file names

208069
callback	methods
when invoked async you will get callback to your specified async methods that will indicate the status of the request

208070
sql-server	mysql
i need to run a rlike query on a database mmoved from mysql to sql-server 2005 however having problems replicating the rlike functionality that mysql provides

208085
child-process	spawn
one of apache processes spawn some long-running python scripting asynchronously and apparently doesn t seem to collect its child-process table entry

208089
contains	elements
for example person is the command class and address is contains into its address field then the city elements would be

208112
any	set
you can tell if any two regexes describe the same set of accepted strings

208114
triggers	insert
however if you really only want to perform the check at insert time then do it in a database triggers or in the api code

208117
internet-explorer	firefox
this works in firefox and internet-explorer and i think it works in all others

208123
silverlight	wpf
some of these classes are compatible with wpf and i would quite like to be able to have silverlight wpf code all in one project

208193
emacs	vim
as someone who uses vim for programming and works in an environment where most all of my colleagues use either vim or emacs for all of their work what are the advantages of ides

208228
highlight	selected
as i type code the ide automatically checks the validity of the code i can highlight a methods and hit f1 to get help right click and selected go to to definition to jump straight to where it is defined

208233
emacs	vim
you can have all this and some more using separate tools or just a great programmable editor and extra tools like emacs vim as well but has a little less idebility imo

208234
hide	show
i also want to hide the form and show a thank you panels before the redirect takes place however it seems the asp.net engine just does the redirect without doing the 2 tasks before in the following code

208252
stream	send
if you are trying to send a file to a user you can stream it to them using response.write

208256
ftps	ftp
i believe you could use twisted to implement ftps by simply using its ftp implementation but changing the ftpclient.connectfactory attributes to be a function that does something with connectssl rather than connecttcp

208260
bash	zsh
in bash and zsh you can do this with brace expansion

208262
hide	show
i d therefore want to be able to access all instances of the plugins within the page and access their show hide validate submit functions in unison

208263
virtual-machine	vmware
the uat physical machine is quite the same but a virtual-machine is used under vmware

208282
ubuntu	debian
if you are running on a debian or ubuntu system i suggest installing the authbind package which will allow you to grant your program permission to open privileged ports without actually having to give your program any other special permissions

208282
ubuntu	debian
if you re running on any other system i suggest installing debian or ubuntu

208292
put	get
put the spreadsheet on a confluence wiki where we can edit it via webdav and get locking and versioning

208299
emacs	vim
although i know with addins you can probably get a lot of this with emacs and vim

208334
vb.net	vba
you may be able to convert your vba modules and class modules to vb.net using the visual basic upgrade wizard in visual-studio but it doesn t upsize everything dao ado code to ado.net code and doesn t create code that is optimized for .net and may not be easy to write unit tests on depending on the design of the vba code

208389
linux	unix
i ve seen people mention a rename command but it is not routinely available on unix systems as opposed to linux systems say or cygwin - on both of which rename is an executable rather than a script

208401
attributes	properties
the param attributes will attempt to set the properties on the bean to a request parameter

208409
hide	show
hide it client-side with javascript and then do the redirect or do two postback first postback to hide the form and show the thank-you and the second to do the redirect once the thank-you has been rendering to the screen

208419
perl	c++
for php java c++ c perl javascript css you can try

208435
button	popup
now my client s requirement is that when he clicks on preview button before submitting the page in admin panel he wants to see the preview in a popup windows with the front-end s theme

208467
project-management	scrum
first of all scrum is a methodology for project-management not for development...it can be combined with xp or rup.

208468
versioning	upgrade
what issues or refactoring did you have to do when you upgrade from asp.net-mvc preview 5 to the newly released beta versioning

208471
hide	show
i m using jquery to hide and show elements when a radio-button grouping is altered click

208490
32-bit	x86
in my opinion setting a 32-bit value on an x86 processor should always be atomic

208492
.net	wcf
would .net web services be good for this scenerio or would wcf be better suited

208493
value	field
is it possible to search every field of every table for a particular value in oracle

208493
value	field
but the only thing i know is that a value for the field i would like to query against is 1 22 2008p09rr8

208501
display	width
for the flexible tables those without any fixed width after downloading entire table tag browser has to parsing till the last row of the table to find out the width of each columns then has to parsing it again for display the content

208514
python	ruby
i would recommend using a script python ruby etc. combined with the command line svn and ftp client to export the files from svn and ftp the files to the server

208517
installation	environment
environment variables i recommend using one just one that points to a place where your material is kept - an installation directory or some such

208527
cfengine	puppet
it is similar to cfengine - you create a model of the desired deployment and puppet figures how to get the environment to this state

208544
constructor	object
dt.select will return all rows in your table as an arrays of datarows and the list constructor accepts that arrays of object as an argument to initially fill your list with

208568
environment	building
just a shot in the dark but do you have a different ld_library_path environment variables when you building the app than when you run it

208570
attributes	properties
i want to write a generic methods where i need to get the properties on a entity which is marked with the parent attributes

208588
getter	setter
in myactionclass you will have to declare the property next with its getter and setter

208601
getter	setter
this style of notation is more useful when you mix acessibility for the getter and setter

208601
getter	setter
you could also put an internal setter or even make the getter private and the setter public

208628
any	set
any windows that must be shown above some other windows specifies that windows as its owner when being created - if you have multiple document windowss each one gets its own set of owned child windowss that you can dynamically show and hide as the document windows gains and looses activation

208632
keyboard	mouse
this means that you are using the actual hardware network comms and all but with screen keyboard and mouse reflected to the screen

208640
webserver	upload
either upload to a server or try something like xampp to easily get a webserver running on your own machine

208677
handler	service
even if you could get passed that problem say with a service we ll call the handlemanager the handlemanager would then have to create a new reference to the object to pass to your handler

208682
databound	gridview
now the checkbox is in a gridview and on databound - for all the rows in the gridview the checkbox is set to false

208682
panels	grid
another thing - the grid that contains the checkbox has an ajax panels on it and when i page the grid try to go to page 2 - the checkedchanged in codebehind is triggers

208702
debugging	trace
for debugging and trace messages because

208703
attributes	properties
does anyone know where i can find more information a tutorial on these properties attributes

208708
expression-blend	designer
the ones in your example is used by the visual designer ms expression-blend and visual-studio designer to give hints in the designer ui

208708
default-value	default
setting default-value for instance will not set the property to that value by default you have to do that manually

208710
contains	any
xml-serialization is a good example xmlserializer provided by microsoft as part of the framework can almost any class there are a number of requirements on the class though - it uses reflection to see what data is contains in the class

208727
implementation	instantiation
the other answers show ways to solve this problem in a portable way in essence putting the definitions of the templates member-functions in a place that is visible from where you instantiate instances of that class -- either through explicit instantiation or putting the implementation in a file that is #included from main.cpp

208728
ingres	mysql
where there is no mvcc mysql ingres it is a trick to get around locking problems that can slow performance or cause the locking system to run out of locks if not properly tuned

208728
sql-server	mysql
in mysql db2 ingres informix not sure about sql-server sybase it can be used to bypass the lock management facility for performance

208730
checkbox	button
checkbox and radio button are on off switches that may be toggled by the user

208730
firefox	opera
for me the following markup produces a checkbox which is checked in ie firefox and opera as you d expect based on the spec

208732
windows-server	windows
you can also use windows activation service was for vista and windows-server 2008

208755
vb.net	vba
what is the vb.net version of this excel generated vba code

208759
javascript	dom

208772
perl	php
the available server-side scripting languages are perl php and python

208781
archive	backup
this can be scheduling but requires some maintenance of the backup metadata xml file when you start running out of disk spaces and need to archive older backup

208799
csv	xml
google it and you will find a few examples csv to xml

208811
ms-access	oracle
i have a workstation with windows 2008 x64 ms-access 2007 and oracle 11g x64

208816
constructor	object
i discovered another way of creating an instance of an object without calling the constructor at all while answering another question on sf

208816
constructor	object
in the system.runtime.serialization namespace there is a function formatterservices.getuninitializedobject type that will create an object without calling constructor

208816
constructor	object
but i did prove to myself that the constructor was never called but the object was instantiated

208843
optional-arguments	default-value
optional should go at the end to me because most languages allow you to specify a default-value for optional-arguments to avoid having to include them

208883
put	get
added a new httpverbs enumeration that contains the most commonly used http verbs get post put delete head

208907
sdl-ttf	ftgl
that said when i had your problem i eventually went with ftgl as the way sdl-ttf produces an sdl-surface with its font rendered on it overcomplicated matters in my situation

208926
json	xml
xml is big json smaller but amf is binary and much more compressed

208937
configuration	environment
if you are a boost user you might take a look at the program options library it supports using configuration files as well as environment variables and of course command line options

208968
boost-variant	boost-any
you might want boost-variant or boost-any

208985
64bit	x86
i am on vista 64bit and i have a project built with x86 configuration

208993
button	popup
this page is displayed in a popup and when the user clicks the save button it closes automatically and the download starts

208993
dialog	pop-up
but when i try with ie7 vista the pop-up opens and closes after about a second without displaying the file download dialog

209008
drools	jess
good free rule engines for java is drools some people also like jess which is a clips clone

209024
any	set
isn t the path for finder and hence any gui-launched cocoa apps set from your login shell

209047
arrays	loops
that s mainly because dsp apps are essentially 2 for loops fed with arrays of values and adds multiplies etc said values.

209048
python	ruby
both python and ruby can work with the gtk libraries

209048
python	ruby
and for links for ruby and python respectively

any	set
you can also set the proxy for any particular connection with system.net.webproxy

209086
shutdown	exit
so recognizing that in an ideal platonic world of virtue the best thing to do would be to wait for all the threads to exit and then shutdown cleanly what is the next best real world solution

209110
hide	show
what i want to do is at run time show and hide one of these panels

209110
hide	show
whilst with the following code i can show and hide the view associated with the panels i can t temporary remove the panels itself

209118
pointers	stack
think about what it would take for c to support nested functions that can access the variables of the outer function while still being able to send function pointers up and down the call stack

pointers	stack
the downwards funargs problem sending a function pointers down stack as an argument to a function you call is actually not incompatible with c and gcc supports nested functions as downward funargs

209118
pointers	stack
gcc does not prevent you from letting a trampoline pointers exist after the outer function is no longer active has no record on the call stack and then the static link pointers could point to garbage

209135
debugging	trace
when working on some code i add extra debugging logging of some kind to make it easier for me to trace the state and values that i care about for this particular fix

209147
google-chrome	opera
according to some - browser - statistics ie6 market share is still bigger than google-chrome safari and opera together nearly as much as ie7

209152
selected	checkbox
in this case i ve found that using the body onunload event to clear any selected checkbox solves the problem

209160
reference-type	generics
must be a reference-type in order to use it as parameter t in the generics type or method

209166
shell	bash
this file is loaded every time you start up a new shell if you re using bash which most people are

209171
tcsh	bash
add it to your .cshrc file for csh and tcsh .profile file for sh and ksh or .bash_profile file for bash

209176
python	java
i think you can use jython to compile python to java bytecode and then compile that with gcj

209179
debugging	trace
also you can use a log level like trace or debugging which should not be turned on in production

209229
windows-vista	windows
i note the support statement for visual basic 6.0 on windows-vista and windows server 2008 states vb6 development on 64-bit windows is not and will not be supported.

209242
hide	show
specifically i need to show hide items on a page depending upon whether the currently logged in user is part of domain groupa in active-directory

209245
tokenize	parsing
if you want a collection of tokenize words from html then can t you just parsing it like xml needs to be valid xml and grab all of the text between tags

209246
put	get
you need to get out the string call the function and put it s result in place as above

209274
double-quotes	single-quotes
also i suggest using single-quotes instead of double around a string like this so that you don t have to escape all of the double-quotes inside the string

209283
entity-framework	ado.net
you can give a try llblgen and ado.net entity-framework but for the number of tables the entity class generation will take a while in any orm.

209321
splitter	panels
get a panels as in a cview derived-class surrounded by your splitter windows

209322
contains	set
if a large fraction of the query is changing regularly you may be better off just refreshing the application s cache on a set frequency rather than running queries constantly to get the changed data dcn does not contains the changed data just the rowid of the row s that changed

209335
worksheet	excel
i have a chart in a worksheet in excel and i have a macro set up so that when i change the value in a certain cell the range of data in the chart is set to a2 down as far as the row number corresponding in this certain cell

209336
contains	any
the arguments could easily contains any perl code instead of a module name.

209338
copy-constructor	temporary
the way i have handled this in the past is to have a copy-constructor for my cview classes so i could easily store them in temporary variables

209349
python	perl
a lot of the exciting software development under linux happens in python and perl and other dynamic languages to a lesser extent so you should almost certainly learn one of those

209353
g++	gcc
gcc g++

209353
shell	bash
understand shell basics probably bash typically the default

209353
perl	tcl
a scripting language bash ruby python tcl perl

209359
inline-assembly	assembly
from what i recall you can t use an external c++ label in your inline-assembly although you can have tassembly-style labels in the assembly block that can be referenced by the assembly instructions itself

209372
spacing	layout
the gnome hig human interface guidelines have a chapter on layout and spacing

209383
put	get
i could make a temp table to put the results in but because there are 80 columns so i would need to make an 80 column temp table just to get 2 columns

209384
oxygene	delphi
if you must move to .net yeah i know you didn t make the decision someone with less information did then i would suggest using delphi for .net or remobjects oxygene

209422
python	perl
you can use inotify from perl with linux inotify or from python with pyinotify

209425
export	report
if you dig in it does report that there are compiler generated methods which it doesn t export in vb.net or c# with 3.5 compatability on .

209431
children	tree
building a tree where the objects point to their immediate children would probably be the best approach especially if you need to do future look-ups

209441
authentication	login
the really nice thing with openid is that i get to choose my openid provider and thus the level of authentication needed to login to a relying party

209461
python	ruby
if your want to code utilities scripting languages especially ruby and python will be your tools of choice and you ll have to choose a gui framework on top of that gtk qt and wxwidget show the way

209461
ruby	php
if it s more about web and network programming python ruby php or java can do it

209463
shell	tcsh
the tricky part of trying to do this is the fact that the user could have their shell set to anything sh bash csh tcsh and so on and each shell sets up its terminal environment differently

209465
object-reference	instances
intermittently when building the solution the build will fail with the error build web object-reference not set to an instances of an object. the error has no associated file line column or project information

209468
value	field
add value tags to your form field and put the data you want in there then open the page and hit the submit button

209469
any	set
put another way considering the initial set of n colours as a large undirected graph in which all colours are connected you want to find the longest path that visits any m nodes

209470
perl	awk
i currently do my textfile manipulation through a bunch of badly remembered awk sed bash and a tiny bit of perl

209471
unmanaged	c++-cli
an int would be and arrays of intptr from your description i think you might want to look into using c++-cli to help you with the conversions e.g from an unmanaged int to a managed arrays

209473
configuration	logging
you need to configure logger named net.sf.jasperreports in your logging configuration file to control the logging level of jasperreports

209481
object-reference	instances
an object-reference not set to an instances of an object is clearly a run-time error not a compile-time error

209481
show	next
next question i d ask does this happen only in visual-studio or does the same thing show up when you build using msbuild or csc

209491
firefox	safari
this is only an ie issue as firefox and safari work just fine

209534
emacs	vim
please don t reply i should use ddd nemiver emacs vim or any other front-end i just prefer gdb as it is but would like to see its output with some terminal colors

209550
decimal	hex
with the 0x prefix python can distinguish hex and decimal automatically

209560
portable-applications	platform
java provides a very rich api right out of the box and hands-down produces the most portable-applications since there is a java viewmodel for almost every platform

209560
web-applications	enterprise
btw i haven t used java since i left college since i work for a microsoft shop but i can t think of a single thing i can do in c# that i can t do in java whether it be enterprise applications web-applications or desktop applications

209562
linux	unix
the essential linux unix commands

209562
subprocess	shutil
by using python shutil and os modules you don t fork a subprocess

209562
perl	awk
replace awk and perl with python

209563
linked-list	queue
note arraylist and linked-list can also function as queue stacks

209563
duplicates	sorted
similar to an except that it keeps its items sorted and does not allow duplicates

209563
enumerator	any
does not guarantee any particular enumerator order

209569
instrumentation	profiling
assuming you want to profiling a whole app not just a snippet of code and that your app is written in c c++ objective-c not ruby and that you re using xcode 3.0 or higher you should also check out the instrumentation application

209576
boost	stl
i also recommend you learn the stl and boost - the latter is especially useful when writing c++ apps in linux as you get libraries for threading file system regex etc

209576
boost	stl
this is how i got started in linux - i took a windows project and converted to use the stl boost and added a browser-based user-interface

209586
value	field
if - upon entering an invalid number - you are fine with the user being presented a blank field you may store value in date- integer- whatever-properties

209617
splitter	panels
the width of the first panels which is docked left will determine the location of the splitter

209622
enterprise	platform
i use java for our bpm platform and used java in the past for enterprise web apps

209622
python	java
ruby and python can be good options for things like utility apps and guis including web apps but for enterprise apps that don t use windows java is pretty much the only option

209624
hide	show
dannysmurf gives you one example - ceditview - of a cview that creates a caret that you can show and hide

209648
continuous-integration	teamcity
i highly recommend teamcity to anyone looking for a continuous-integration server or any build server really

209665
perl	awk
if it s processing text files then sed awk and perl are the top contenders

209665
python	ruby
i would consider python or ruby if i had a requirement for a dynamic language in particular

209706
any	set
i m asking in generalities - why would any server not set and return headers and or status codes

209707
scala	java
if you write an application in java today you can seamlessly transition to scala at any time

209714
json	xml
yui also provides the ability to send reports on the results in either json or xml format

209719
value	field
without requiring you to specify null value for the missing field

209731
gnome	kde
ideally the solution should allow me to apply a look-and-feel that looks like the underlying windows system ie windows lnf for windows gtk lnf for gnome gtk qt lnf for kde qt the default one for other platforms

209731
any	set
it let s the user chose any one of the available lnf and then tries to set it

209731
swt	awt
ps- i ve tried other solutions too such as jgoodies plain awt and swt

209731
swing	swt
however swing with gtk lnf would be the best solution to avoid the hassle of swt native libraries and jgoodies extra jars also jgoodies lnf doesn t look as integrated as swing gtk under gnome

209732
put	get
however if i actually put an alert called inside this if-statement like line 4 it becomes consistent and i get the result i want

209742
gentoo	linux
i would recommend you to start by using gentoo it should be hard the first weeks but after a while say 2 months and less if you have basic linux understand you will be able to use every distribution and you will know exactly what will happen and how on your system when you press digit something i think that you will be re-paid for this more time learn gentoo is a bit harder then other distros spent on gentoo

209764
value	field
i would like to be able to perform some logic in the table.modifiedfield methods which compares the previous value of a field to the new value

209768
any	set
that does get you your separate projects but comes with its own set of problems - mainly if you update the shared section for one app you have to regression test the other two to check you haven t broken any dependencies

209775
shell	bash
sadly the ssh daemon has some issues when it comes to quoting commands that go into a cmd as opposed to bash shell

209778
delphi	basic
visual basic 6 is dead visual c++ is obvious and delphi seems to be the prime choice for that but i wonder if there are any other alternatives

209779
ip-address	hostname
when it replaces an existing machine it needs to set its ip-address dns wins and hostname to match the machine being replaced

209791
attributes	properties
once you re more comfortable with xml you will probably start to define rules that you ll use to determine which properties become attributes and which properties become elements

209812
contains	any
the class that contains this code is in the com.xyz package if that makes any difference

209827
subtract	time
the advantage to doing this yourself is that over time you evolve it with things such as keeping the labels on the left side the same width but expanding the fields to the right this is done by not resizing the labels at all and subtract the end of the labels area off from the width of the form before applying the position and width changes such as

209842
linked-list	nodes
a linked-list such that whenever a nodes is selected it is moved to the front of the list

209842
linked-list	nodes
a linked-list such that whenever a nodes is selected its frequency count is incremented and then the nodes is bubbled towards the front of the list so that the most frequently accessed is at the head of the list

209862
internet-explorer	firefox
this page displays beautifully in firefox but i get all kinds of problems when testing the site in opera or internet-explorer mostly with the menu

209874
radio-button	selected
i m trying to write a jquery function to add a new row to the table whenever the user selected a radio-button but only if they are currently on the last row of the table

209875
pthreads	fork
after posting about this problem online i got some feedback indicating that this should not occur on newer versions of linux since they implement the pthreads fork methods using copy-on-write presumably meaning it will only copy pages that it needs to modify when it is required instead of the entire address space immediately

209892
32-bit	64bit
to split a 64bit value into two 32-bit values do something like this

209892
32-bit	64bit
then to recombine two 32-bit values to a 64bit value

209894
arrays	loops
to get something like the shortcut mentioned above i suppose you could create an arrays of symbols in the order required and pull the values out of the hash in a loops

209906
python	java
other major languages can do this -- java c# python javascript etc

209924
value	field
i have a field called operation in the table domainuser which has value like 1 2 3

209931
double-quotes	single-quotes
how does it handle single-quotes inside of double-quotes or vice versa

209945
put	get
for example to obtain a resource you use http get to put a resource on the server you use http put

209945
put	get
rest is a very simple in that it uses http get post and put methods to update resources on the server

209966
any	set
i have a set of business-objects that potentially can be persisted in different ways although for any given configuration of the application only one persistence mechanism will be active

209981
processor	cpu
this loop repeats infinitely until some state of some game element or input tells it to stop or quit. this approach keeps the cpu and graphics card pretty busy hence the market for gamer machines with fast processor and even faster graphics cards

210008
any	set
can anyone point me in the direction of a good set of sample programs for a kid learning c# or any other resources you think might be good for him

210037
oracle	mysql
it support many different database like ms sql oracle mysql etc

210057
annotations	mapping
does things like generating hibernate mapping files from annotations java classes

210077
contains	set
therefore no matter what string you test on if it contains blah it will always match the entire string and leave lastindex set to the length of the string just tested

210096
ubuntu	linux
if you are using ubuntu linux there was a patch added to the python-mysql package that added the ability to set that same mysql_opt_reconnect option see here

210097
triggers	insert
i have a table that has an insert triggers on it

210097
triggers	insert
if i insert in 6000 records into this table in one insert statement from a stored procedure will the stored procedure return before the insert triggers completes

210097
triggers	insert
just to make sure that i m thinking correctly the triggers should only be called i know called isn t the right word once because there was only 1 insert statement right

210098
json	xml
the library can persist any object to xml json binary or sql

210103
factors	primes
on a sidenote you ve also found all the primes factors of n on the way

210105
hide	show
using states you can selectively show and hide components

210113
triggers	insert
your insert triggers will run once for the entire insert statement

210113
triggers	insert
i just tested an insert and update triggers and indeed they are considered part of the insert by sql-server

210117
hide	show
instead of actually using roles to hide show certain controls i would suggest having another layer of permissions for each role and show hide based on those instead

210124
triggers	insert
each call to your insert procedure will result in the triggers being fired and the procedure will not return until the triggers finishes

210141
triggers	insert
one important thing about triggers that you must be aware of is that the trigger fires once for each transaction at kleast in sql-server you shoudl check other dbs but even if it will process row by row that is usually a poor idea so if you insert 6000 records the trigger fires once not 6000 times

210141
triggers	insert
many people are not aware of this and write triggers as if they will processs multiple record insert one record at a time

210141
triggers	insert
this is not true and your triggers must account for handing the multiple record insert

210145
attributes	properties
what other c# attributes are useful for properties after learning these i feel like i m missing out

210157
attributes	properties
c# properties attributes

210169
drupal	django
what would be the best way to port an existing drupal site to a django application

210180
firefox	opera
edit i am on a debian box only on firefox i see this code i just tried opera this code doesn t appear in opera really strange never heard of firefox having such problems

210188
deployment	install
in your case it seems that install is used to make the management of the deployment easier since codeigniter s local repo is the shared repo

210189
contains	any
i need to be able to determine if a part of an image outside of predetermined crop marks contains any image content

210195
ruby-on-rails	django
i ve not really used django in anger before but in ruby-on-rails and cakephp and by extension any mvc web-framework the fat model skinny controller approach to organising your methods has been a real eye-opener for me

210208
defined	declare
so instead of trying to defined that behavior itself the abstract base-class can declare abstract shutdown and startup methods

210208
abstract-class	base-class
the base-class knows that it needs those methods but an abstract-class lets your class admit that it doesn t know how to perform those actions

210218
environment	execution
how do i set up my execution environment for esc java2 in windows-xp

210235
xsl-fo	xslt
you need an xslt transform for html to xsl-fo

210240
gentoo	linux
no solution here but as a datapoint it doesn t look at all like that for me firefox 3.0.3 in gentoo linux

210266
dto	dao
the problem occurs when an implementation of the dao needs to refer to a specific type of dto

210282
implements	extends
specificdto would extends or implements dto

210290
python	ruby
enter python ruby et al

210290
python	ruby
if on the other hand you want a language that will grow with you as you want to do more may i suggest python or ruby

210303
32-bit	64bit
most 32-bit apps can run on a 64bit kernel with no issues as long as relevant libraries are installed

210316
selected	checkbox
check the map extensionless headers checkbox and selected the language you want from the combobox

210338
postback	ajax
it also includes some very handy and simple functionality for ajax postback

210344
locale	french
i do not have any other versions of python install on this french locale windows-xp sp3 machine

210352
double	int
the javascript number representation is a standard ieee double so you can t represent a 64 bit int

210352
double	int
iirc you get maybe 48 bits of actual int precision in a double but all javascript bitops reduce to 32-bit precision that s what the spec requires

210354
contains	elements
things like having an elements specified in a methods as being of type int and the inbound xml elements contains a decimal number

210360
configuration	upgrade
as such it sounds like there might be a configuration problem with your install of fckeditor or you need to upgrade

210364
silverlight	wpf
the references are for .net 3.5 and wpf not silverlight

210371
ubuntu	linux
i can download the file just fine using firefox or ftp in passive mode on ubuntu dapper linux

210371
solaris	linux
i ran it under strace on linux same as ptrace on solaris

210388
contains	elements
the usual way is to loop over every elements in the document for efficiency use a specific tag name if you know the class will only be applied to elementss of a certain type and test the classname property of each noting that the property contains a space separated list of class names not a single class name

210392
jquery	.post
ben nadel has a great blog .post on how to do this with jquery

210400
freebsd	linux
the site says ratproxy is currently believed to support linux freebsd macos x and windows cygwin environments but i ve only used it on linux

210412
gethashcode	equals
as you are using at least .net 2.0 i recommend implement equals and gethashcode on stepdoc

210428
any	set
when put behind a public-get private-set they can t be added to since it requires re-allocation and re-assignment but a consumer can still set any subscript they wish

210432
any	set
doing an export of your project won t export any svn externals you might have set which means you need to do multiple exports

210437
exception-handling	error-handling
while the exception-handling pattern is supposed to be the main error-handling in c++ it is not the only one

210437
messagebox	alert
my own preference goes with a throwing finalize methods a non-throwing destructor cleaning resources not finalized manually and the log messagebox if possible to alert about the failure in the destructor

210438
value	field
if your server-side code has access to their username and password from the cookie then can t your page just populate the value attributes of the form field like so

210454
any	set
is there currently any easy way to set up a yaws webserver in front of apache tomcat servlet container similar to popular apache + tomcat set up

210455
web-config	app-config
currently it requires the developer to put a setting in the app-config or web-config with a key of applicationname and a value of - you guessed it - the application name which is a unique non changing id for us

210486
base-class	subclass
the usual example is to take an animal base-class with a speak methods a dog subclass would emit a bark whereas a pig subclass would emit an oink

210495
authentication	login
i am currently using mediawiki as a documentation website with login authentication by ldap

210502
any	set
any good web-app framework will have pleasant data mapping for this simple set of data

210506
pointers	stack
i might be able to look at stack pointers to detect if my wrapper class was allocated later than the referenced class but this seems hacky and not standard c++ doesn t define stack behavior

210510
py2exe	exe
using nsis is great i use it too but i would suggest using a packager like pyinstaller my personal fav alternatives bb_freeze py2exe to create an exe before the using nsis

210511
duplicates	contains
i m assuming the collections don t contains duplicates

210515
postgresql	mysql
i d like to find a very generic way of doing this that would work in mysql oracle postgresql etc

210520
binaries	install
so the easiest would be to install bonjour for windows then get the windows binaries for mono.zeroconf try the example mzclient.exe drop the mono.zeroconf.dll and or mono.zeroconf.providers.bonjour.dll into your project references and go

210522
click	mouse
so far i only came out with the idea to bind to tab and mouse click although if i bind the mouse click to the entry widget i only get mouse events when inside the entry widget

210564
execute	prepare
is there a way to get the raw sql string execute when calling pdostatement execute on a prepare statement

210568
arrays	loops
if walking the arrays doesn t fit for some reason use a loops

210589
value	field
query a single field for multiple value in a stored procedure

210590
printf	scanf
why is it that scanf needs the l in lf when reading a double when printf can use f regardless of whether its argument is a double or a float

210595
printf	scanf
scanf needs to know the size of the data being pointed at by to fill it properly whereas variadic functions promote floats to double not entirely sure why so printf is always getting a double

210601
derived-class	base-class
in c# what is the best way to access a property of the derived-class when the generic-list contains just the base-class

210605
order	join
join on this table order by processorder and selected all fields from the other table

210616
arguments	default
is like belongs to and the list after params and body are like default arguments or something

210617
base-class	subclass
you might have some issues with generics and subclasses in which case you should go back to system.collections.arraylist but you have to cast the base-class to the subclass you wish to use

210617
base-class	subclass
if you use the as directory it will succeed if the base-class can be casted to the subclass or it will be null if it cannot be cast

210629
bitwise-and	xor
is there a standard way in python to carry on bitwise-and or xor not operations assuming that the inputs are 32-bit maybe negative integers or longs and that the result must be a long in the range 0 2 32

210637
thickbox	jquery
i have been looking at jquery thickbox for showing modal dialogs with images it is great

210643
dialog	pop-up
just calling click doesn t seem to do anything or at least it doesn t pop-up a file selection dialog

210646
windows-xp	windows
i m trying to determine how i can detect when the user changes the windows font size from normal to extra large fonts the font size is selected by executing the following steps on a windows-xp machine

210646
unique	words
but none of these messages are unique to the situation when the font-size changes in other words when i receive the wm_settingschange message i want to know what changed

210652
any	set
i don t know why you cannot do it but one thing that is a security risk and which you are not allowed to do in any browser is programmatically set the file name on the html file element

210676
32-bit	64bit
the vs 2008 ide is not a 64bit application - it s a 32-bit app and runs in wow

210685
put	get
restful web-services chapter 8 section overloading post reads if you want to do without put and delete altogether itâ s entirely restful to expose safe operations on resources through get and all other operations through overloaded post

210693
execute	prepare
the sql statement is sent to the database server when you do prepare and the parameters are sent separately when you do execute

210693
execute	prepare
you will circumvent the benefits of prepare queries by interpolation variables into the sql string before execute

210693
execute	prepare
internally if you use pdo attr_emulate_prepares pdo makes a copy of the sql query and interpolation parameter value into it before doing the prepare and execute

210693
constructor	object
the pdostatement object has a property querystring but this is set only in the constructor for the pdostatement and it s not updated when the query is rewritten with parameters

210696
iteration	elements
if at any certain iteration you can t place an elements on the map without crossing a sanity check shift two positioning on the map and try again

210696
show	next
in steps 2 and 3 show each iteration to the user items left in the list positioning on the map and the next computed move and let the user intervene

210706
contains	any
you can check the contents of the control and modify them if they contains any characters you don t want

210710
nstextview	nscell
the principal technique is to create an nscell that can host an nstextview

210746
derived-class	base-class
you would need to have the properties be declared as virtual on the base-class and then override them in the derived-class

210746
implements	abstract
you would either need to implements the property in the base-class to return a default-value such as null or to make it abstract and force all the derived classes to implements both properties

210761
highlight	selected
but i also need to selected and highlight the default-value that is placed in that text field

210765
revision	svn
this method does not address database continuous integration which means rolling back svn to a previous revision will break the build unless your database is very static

210765
bug-tracking	bugzilla
use bugzilla on the central subversion server devel.dundermifflin.com for bug-tracking

210765
simpletest	phpunit
write a shell scripting to run phpunit simpletest tests to be called by item 4a

210778
google-chrome	firefox
when i go to it in firefox or google-chrome it says connection partially encrypted

210792
thickbox	jquery
the easiest methods would be to either use modalpopupextender as mentioned by jon or potentially use jquery s thickbox or something similar as well

210821
javascript	dom
i have read the post here about using settimeout during intensive dom processing using javascript but how can i integrate this function with the below code

210822
children	nodes
this expression tells you which children of foo bar have any child text nodes

210822
children	nodes
so to ensure that all children are empty no child elements or text nodes ensure that this expression returns true

210824
python	perl
perl and python urllib or urllib2 will help you get there

210836
32-bit	64bit
in xp 32-bit this line compiles with not problem however in vista 64bit this line

210836
calling-convention	getprocaddress
if both m_funcaddr and getprocaddress have the stdcall calling-convention why do i have to recall it with cdecl

210842
keydown	keyup
i ve been able to achieve keyboard triggers with creative shifting of focus in and out of the control between keydown keypress keyup events

210850
np-complete	np-hard
np-hard np-complete is a way of showing that certain classes of problems are not solvable in realistic time

210857
32-bit	64bit
in 32-bit farproc happens to work with the signature you have but probably not in 64bit

210881
highlight	selected
i d like to be able to access specific placemarks in the kml file from javascript for example to highlight a selected polygon on the map in response to user action

210888
np-complete	np-hard
that doesn t mean that you can t solve a particular instances of an np-complete or np-hard problem

210891
callback	methods
pass the beginxxx methods a callback methods that will be executed when the methods completes

210891
callback	methods
for most cases use the callback methods of the apm style unless you prefer the style of the socketasynceventargs async methods

210893
base-class	inherited
a good first step is to insert another base-class into the inherited chain between action and one of the original monstrous action classes lets call it classa

210905
export	csv
i would run thru the venues table start at the beginning match the venues.id to volunteers_2009.venue_id then run the csv export function to pull all the data where venue_id # then attach it into the email and the recipient would be venues.chair_email

210905
export	csv
i already have a export csv function i could just pass it the venue_id to pull the appropriate volunteers and i have a working email function as well so i can pass it the attachment and recipient

210926
webserver	host
database servers don t host webserver

210926
webserver	upload
usually what happens is you develop using a locally installed database server upload code to qa servers that have a little looser access policy but are only accessible from company networks then have the dbas copy the database schema and roles to production and publish your app to the production webserver

210926
credentials	account
web apps are often configured to run under limited credentials service account which have read write but not admin access to the database

210926
contains	any
i typically encrypt any part of my web.config that contains connection information as well

210931
while-loop	loops
this is essentially a while-loops but each iteration of the loops is done in an timed interval so the browser has a bit of time to breathe in between

210953
python	perl
at least nothing along the lines of cpan for perl or the python package index for python

210955
installation	uninstall
an installer step could reset the key when the user reinstalls or you could just clear out the registry key on uninstall if you don t want to keep any settings between installation

210965
python	java
how do you decide between c# java php and python

210978
output	args
when i output a string using .join args and paste that into my shell prompt the jvm launches fine and everything works

211014
memcached	ehcache
either one is the way to go as long as you re sure to use atomic updates memcached supports them don t know about ehcache

211034
command-pattern	memento
remembering object oriented design courses i immediately thought of memento and command-pattern

211034
contains	elements
i have a abstract class abstractdiagram that contains two arraylist one for storing nodes called elements in my project and the other for storing edges called links in my projects

211038
any	set
set the caching headers to disallow any caching of the page at all

211042
buffering	streaming
you could modify it to read more than one byte at a time but the internal file streaming should already be buffering the data so even this simple code should be relatively fast

211043
gnome	kde
this happens to lock the screens in kde gnome too

211049
superclass	subclass
but if the reopening and the definition are in reverse order you ll get that error because the class will already have been defined as a subclass of object but is trying to be redefined or reopened with a different superclass

211050
command-prompt	command-line
if you open a suitable command-prompt with its environment variables already set then you can compile on the command-line

211051
swing	awt
edit 2 so swing classes are subclasses of awt classes so i imagine if you re able to find the height width of those the approach would generalize

211055
linux	unix
does linux unix posix provide an api to user-space applications to access a monotonically increasing clock with centisecond to millisecond accuracy

211060
getter-setter	setter
for things like trivial getters and setter share the comment between then and describe the purpose of the property not of the getter-setter

211060
instances	private
for instances a constant - that is private static final variables - should have a javadoc especially when its value is not trivial

211071
directory	folder
i have a vb .net 2005 winform application and each time i do an installer build it deletes overwrite the _svn folder in the directory

211078
scrollbar	tooltip
edit in response to the comments it sounds like you re trying to have the tooltip appear without affecting the positioning of existing elements and thus causing the scrollbar on the main windows

211093
h.264	mp4
there s no real advantage to one over the other for a simple program either way x264 only takes a single type of input raw yv12 video and spits out a single type of output h.264 elementary streams or in the case of the cli app it can also mux mp4 and matroska

211105
command-pattern	memento
q how to represent the steps in your app with the memento command-pattern

211117
command-line	cmd
i m not familiar with scons so i don t know the best way to get these settings configured for that tool but for standard makefiles there s usually a line in the makefile which sets a macros variables with the include directory path and that macros is used as part of a cmd-line parameter in the cmd that invokes the compiler

211120
perl	c++
some languages have this built-in php probably does others have it included perl comes to mind others need you to grab it from elsewhere c c++

211120
perl	c++
of course that s why i don t use c c++ but i use perl instead

211120
perl	c++
it takes a lot less effort to ensure i don t overwrite memory in perl than it does in c++

211135
any	set
another note you can also set a service s security descriptor using the sc tool which can be found under windir system32 but that doesn t involve any programming

211141
constructor	object
using a constructor also ensures the object is properly initialized

211141
constructor	object
after the constructor finishes the object is valid

211141
initializer	setter
if your object requires the use of setter to initializer it it s possible to have an invalid object

211145
versioning	upgrade
do i have to upgrade to a more powerful versioning of installshield

211154
png	gif
it only checks for gif bmp jpg and png files

211198
getter	setter
it made life difficult to document setter and getter

211201
databound	gridview
this will obviously be easier if your gridview is already databound

211210
export	report
we wrote our own scripting in vbscripting that uses the undocumented application.saveastext in access to export all code form macros and report modules

211210
command-line	cmd
if you need a clickable cmd instead of using the cmd-line create a file named decompose.cmd with

211233
json	xml
json or xml are good ways to exchange data between the applet and the server similar to the way you do an ajax application sending xml or json between the browser and the server

211238
access-control	authentication
there are a raft of handy plugins that are all readily available for use with activerecord such as authentication and access-control

211245
debugging	trace
basically the fact that we can trace step through each line of code when you re debugging an obscure bug makes it all worth the effort

211258
csv	xml
i have built a ms-access 2007 application that can create reports files in various formats pdf xls csv xml

211283
click	mouse
detecting mouse click in windows using python

211293
csv	xml
reporting services will generate pdf xls csv and xml formats as output for your reports and you can generate those reports just by passing the parameters in the url to the server which will return your report in the format requested

211294
silverlight	wpf
half of the book is wpf xaml silverlight which i already knew

211306
traceroute	packets
traceroute transmits packets with small ttl time to live value

211306
traceroute	packet
by using small ttl value the packets will quickly expire so traceroute causes all routers along a packet s path to generate the icmp messages that identify the router

211307
constructor	object
this is generally only a problem when initializing global that reference each other during their own initialization so only affects object with constructor

211308
internet-explorer	firefox
i ve come across this type of problem before when images uploaded to our site were jpegs in cmyk format - internet-explorer would show them as a small red x but firefox would show them ok definitely as of version 3 not sure about earlier releases

211314
constructor	object
i expect the constructor order between modules is mainly a function of what order you pass the object to the linker

211318
version-control	git
with distributed version-control systems like darcs and git

211343
gentoo	linux
for instance in gentoo linux you would do the following from the command line to get a list of possible package updates

211344
macros	vba
last but not least your access macros vba sub will need to shut access down

211353
crystal-reports-xi	crystal-reports
i m porting an application from crystal-reports 8 to crystal-reports-xi in delphi 5 using the rdc activex interface

211375
highlight	selected
the goal is to allow the user to click around on the image options having the selected one highlight with a border colour

211376
implicit-conversion	equality
there are no implicit-conversion from vector3s to my class or vice-versa and argument-dependent lookup should be pulling in the equality operators from the engine namespace and matching it

211378
shell	bash
what are some of your favorite hidden features of the bash shell scripting language

211382
boolean	double
if you use double brackets around your boolean expression you can the normal boolean operators

211385
tunnel	vpn
there is a vpn tunnel between the service s and the client s machines but they do not use the same active-directory

211400
removeclass	addclass
best using addclass and removeclass in this scenario

211419
using-declaration	typedef
typedef names and using-declaration

211435
linux	unix
if you want to target the unix linux or apple platforms you should be looking in frameworks more native for the respective platform though you can get a certain degree of interoperability with the mono project but i am not up to date on how complete their implementation of .net currently is

211452
selenium-ide	selenium
selenium-ide and selenium core do not share 100 same functionality

211468
getter-setter	setter
for things like trivial getters and setter share the comment between then and describe the purpose of the property not of the getter-setter

211476
uninstaller	msiexec
presumably since you ve rebuilt the com info have you uninstaller the msi from your machine and re-installed so msiexec is not just doing a maintenance install rather thana full install

211505
vbscript	vba
vbscript has a lot in common with vba so it should not take long create something usable and there is a great deal of help available for asp and vbscript on the internet

211506
contains	any
and make sure that your string representation doesn t contains any changing data that you don t want to be checked

211515
order	add
perhaps a simple way to determine the order in which rows have been added would be to add an identity-column to the table avoiding the need to keep your guids in order and hence avoiding the performance hit of maintaining a clustered index on the guid column

211535
openbsd	freebsd
also thanks for the tip about strcasestr and checking out other implementations from other sources like openbsd freebsd etc.

211550
display	width
so the normal display is all of the divs within the td stacked up to the left until they fill the width then flow to the next line and so forth

211555
groovy	java
other than that and javascript which you ve mentioned and is built into java 6+ via the javax.script package groovy and jruby are also worth looking at too

211564
mootools	extjs
personally i always used to say something like gallery or some other os script but recently i have found myself using more and more something like a simple php script which just spits our a list of images maybe 7 a page but relying on a javascript library such as mootools or extjs to provide all the functionality particularly for small or individual galleries

211566
dialog	pop-up
it all depends on the kind of pop-up from system s message box to custom dialog

211566
button	popup
should i have the problem i would use a macros language like autohotkey or autoit to detect the activation of the popup and automate the click on the discard button

211587
uninstaller	nsis
see nsis s page on add remove programs for more details on uninstaller registry keys

211634
windows-xp	windows
both machines run windows-xp sp3 but mine was running classic windows theme and the other was running the new xp theme

211659
jmockit	junit
i want to use jmockit s incremental test runner instead of the standard junit test runners from within eclipse

211670
windows-vista	windows
lately i noticed that windows focus is set differently on windowss-vista aero as it used to be on xp

211671
json	xml
from webservice returns xml even when responseformat set to json

211673
openbsd	freebsd
for example of glib glibc openbsd freebsd etc

211674
hide	show
in windows explorer the file extension for links lnk is never show even if you have disabled the hide extensions for known file types feature

211693
order	add
i just need to know what to add to the post-build step in order to generate the docs

211714
execute	declare
each publicly exposed function was declare as a delegate and execute via the above fragment

211722
versioning	upgrade
also if you want these settings to persist between assembly versioning ie be upgradable you will need to upgrade the settings on application startup

211743
jquery	dojo
switching to jquery or yui or dojo or anything else would require completely throwing out all the code you have and stating over

211744
global-asax	web-config
2 modify the existing global-asax web-config default.aspx and so on to switch the asp.net-mvc handler on for routing and then publish my asp.net-mvc application to a subfolder

211774
value	field
a namedtuple is immutable so you can only assign field value when you create it

211789
webforms	asp.net
scott hanselman has a good blog post discussing how to combine mvc with webforms and other asp.net technologies

211792
attributes	properties
add the cssclassproperties attributes to your properties

211792
attributes	properties
you can look at the attributes that are applied to similar properties in .net classes

211811
administration	account
i am assuming here that are talking about normal windows user account and normal machine domain administration account

211811
credentials	security
impersonation is not simple from what i have tried you need to request access through your domain controller and negotiate that you are user b and that you have the rights to impersonate user a generally that is done by user a and user b sharing and negotiating credentials handles and security contexts

211821
updating	updates
you can use the -n flag to get the updates output without actually updating the files

211829
ms-access	oracle
i can se the oracle driver in the standard odbc administration but when i start this from within ms-access the driver does noe appear

211829
sql-server	oracle
if i look in the registry the oracle driver is noe existing under the hklm software wow6432node odbc odbcinst.ini key like the ones for sql-server

211830
perl	c++
i want to use perl tk for the gui but i am not sure how to link the c++ to the perl

211883
groovy	java
otherwise groovy which is based on java syntax and may be an easier learning curve if most of your developers are java guys

211888
any	set
i have searched quite a lot on the .net but have not found a suitable solution nor any detailed instructions on how to set this up

211896
iteration	set
if for some reason your function starts 20ms late in one iteration the value will already be 520 so your function will then set it to 20 meaning it will only wait 480ms before the next iteration

211911
xhtml	tidy
hopefully the output from fckeditor is xhtml as getting html into xml is a world of pain in itself which tidy can be useful for

211911
xsl-fo	xslt
next unless some poor soul has already made an fckeditor xhtml - xsl-fo xslt for your xsl-fo implementation you ll have to make one

211911
xsl-fo	xslt
that involves learning xsl-fo xslt and xpath

211911
xsl-fo	xslt
so what s all this xsl-fo xslt stuff and all the other things

211911
xsl-fo	xslt
xslt formatting objects xslt-fo an xml vocabulary for specifying formatting semantics

211911
xsl-fo	xslt
anything as long as it isn t fighting html xsl-fo fop xslt and xpath

211914
capacity	storage
let me clarify my statement - with sql-server you have limited options when you exceed the physical storage capacity of the box

211922
sql-server	oracle
oracle or sql-server

211938
python	ruby
dynamic languages like smalltalk ruby or python does however support message-based oo

211941
google-chrome	opera
we support ie fx but ideally a solution would work in opera google-chrome safari too

211949
dlopen	dlsym
on unixy platform the equivalents are dlopen and dlsym

211951
linux	unix
you can use the posix dlopen dlsym dlerror dlclose functions in linux unix to dynamically open shared libraries and access the symbols including functions they provide see the man page for details

211961
glib	gtk
if you want to use a library for this i d recommend glib the utility library that lies underneath the gtk user-interface toolkit

211968
scala	java
such libraries originated in the functional land haskell and ml but nowadays parser combinators libraries exist for java c++ c# scala and other mainstream languages

211986
document	editing
again this still uses subversion but it has a web-viewer for the repository nicely integrated as well as a wiki capability to allow for versioned shared editing of simpler document

211990
attributes	properties
since you want to refer to a properties of the windows you need to set the datacontext to point to the windows instance which is what i do in the datacontext attributes of the windows

212006
put	get
if inside the same project i include this header from more than one cpp file i get an error saying multiple definition of test_ns testclass testmethods while if i put the methods definition inside the class body this does not happen

212009
swing	awt
the thread dump showed that there are a couple of non-daemon threads notably swing s edt awt and a couple of websart related threads

212009
decrement	increment
the actual strategy used is that each windows increment a counter when it is created and decrement one when it is closed

212015
textbox	button
thus if you click the button from the example code here it will update the textbox

212015
textbox	button
without implementing this interface and if you click the button the textbox would not update

212026
methods	extend
you can eventually extend the el language by using the el functor which will allow you to call any java beans methods even with parameters.

212034
swing	awt
the console windows is used to see stdout err of the webstart process as well as rudimentary log debug but has the side effect of created a top-level awt swing windows

212039
selection-sort	bubble-sort
should it be the bubble-sort or the selection-sort

212046
naming-conventions	conventions
it is going over naming-conventions file conventions variables usage code layout whitespace and comments

212053
quicksort	mergesort
if you want to teach sorting algorithms then you should really be teaching quicksort mergesort insertsort and possibly even heapsort so that students can get a feel for the tradeoffs between various sorting methods

212059
javadoc	doxygen
javadoc in my own experience or any such tool like doxygen for c++ is not a valuable tool to document a library but more to document its implementation

212072
quicksort	mergesort
it s also a great example of why simple solutions are not always the best which could lead into a discussion of more interesting and faster sorts like mergesort and quicksort

212075
bubble-sort	big-o
sorting algorithms are really a intuitive concrete way of teaching some good lessons about big-o notations optimization common sense and computer science in general and maybe a bubble-sort + selected sort + merge sort approach might be useful for comparison

212076
asymptotic-complexity	big-o
could be a good way to segue into asymptotic-complexity and big-o notation

212088
swing	awt
however there are recurrent problems with leaks including within the implementation of awt and swing

212088
daemons	systemd
the webstart thread should all be daemons when there are no systemd windows console javax.jnlp services and other dialog showing

212095
insertion-sort	selection-sort
at a bare minimum the students should be taught at least one of each of the major sorting types namely an exchanging sort a selection-sort an insertion-sort and a merge sort

212095
selection-sort	heapsort
heapsort from the selection-sort category

212095
insertion-sort	bubble-sort
also it is quite likely that if someone is able to understand quicksort then they should be able to learn the bubble-sort and insertion-sort on their own

212103
operators	keyword
you can use the infix infixl or infixr keyword to define operators associativity and precedence

212109
keyboard	mouse
what would be really helpful is a logging tool that keeps track of mouse and keyboard actions and possibly also stores the properties of components that have been clicked the aut is written in java

212111
silverlight	wpf
is it possible to convert an existing wpf application to silverlight automatically with minimal effort

212117
backwards-compatibility	compatibility
on the other lack of backwards-compatibility including subjective user-interface compatibility is a deal breaker

212129
silverlight	wpf
you can build assemblies that can be used on different supported platforms wp7 silverlight wpf and even xbox applications

212142
toolbar	tabs
rather than spending hours choosing and customising a set of toolbar you have access to everything through the tabs

212143
versioning	upgrade
the business problem is really that they need an incentive to upgrade and so they keep adding new features who do you know that uses all the features of word and then they need to find ways to present those without making the application impossibly cluttered which was certainly happening in the previous versioning of office

212152
silverlight	wpf
i have found some articles regarding the multi-targeting option for wpf and silverlight at the same time

212152
silverlight	wpf
what do you need to have in mind is that silverlight uses a smaller thus more limited library than wpf

212152
silverlight	wpf
the idea of prism is to provide guidance to developing applications not only using wpf but using silverlight also - prism v2 formally was known as composite application guidance for wpf and silverlight

212163
delphi	c++
for example i ve been using microsoft s c++ and c# for a lot of years delphi before that

212166
quicksort	heapsort
introsort short for introspective sort starts as a quicksort and switches to a heapsort if the recursion depth exceeds a level based on the logarithm of the number of elements being sorted

212173
expression-blend	silverlight
ok so see questions like this one and this one and the question i have is - does one have to use expression-blend to do silverlight development or can any of it be done with just visual-studio

212173
expression-blend	silverlight
i haven t gotten started using silverlight yet and through my workplace s msdn i can get expression-blend without any issues but for my side work do i have to drop the 499 for expression-blend 2

212173
expression-blend	silverlight
obviously i m concerned that in order to get into silverlight development there s a huge financial investment involved and i already own visual-studio 2008 - is it possible to do development without expression-blend or would that just be impossible

212180
.when	ready
alternatively perhaps resetting the receive buffering size after the sleep .when you re ready to start reading again causes it to fflush it as well

212189
silverlight	wpf
list of differences in wpf silverlight

212228
abap	x++
i was thinking along the lines of having a programming language easily available to my systems such as abap on sap or x++ on axapta - but it doesn t look feasible to me at least not easily - even if you use gold

212247
python	java
a person comfortable with object oriented concepts will have an easier time switching between java and .net or python than a person who simple learned how to program in c#

212259
attributes	properties
when a node or attributes is added to an element whether via functional construction or an add methods the node or attributes s parent properties is set to that element

212274
arrays	loops
i know that perhaps learning while or for loops in several languages aren t so difficult - but when your problem goes up one level of abstraction iterate through this arrays you ll find yourself using instead of and vice-versa

212292
forwarding	port
gcc 3.4 and later appear to have substantially improved the mips code generation so i m planning to port our changes forwarding

212325
arguments	default
you may want to consider doing something like adding a command-line arguments to act as a switch between an automatic mode using default and the full user-input mode

212328
contains	elements
once in the body all elementss contains in the test elements have header-content-widget applied in document order

212332
runas	cmd
runas noprofile user mymachine administrator cmd

212334
subtract	time
adds or subtract the specified amount of time to the given calendar field based on the calendar s rules

212334
subtract	time
for example to subtract 5 days from the current time of the calendar you can achieve it by calling

212345
short	base
cycorp have a short description of how their cyc knowledge base derives meaning from sequences

212374
account	userid
aside from the sudo policy which is probably better there is no reason why each admin couldn t have their own account with userid 0 but named differently with a different password and even different home-directory

212381
iteration	elements
the overall goal is to create this multidimensional arrays in an iteration that will append elements to a known index

212387
google-chrome	firefox
if it runs fast in firefox or google-chrome then it s a javascript issue for sure

212387
google-chrome	firefox
we had a sharepoint page that took 10 seconds to render in ie and sub 1 second in firefox and google-chrome

212429
reflection	runtime
i ve used reflection to create the appropriate type at runtime before i make the call to the web service like so

i was under the impression that any cast from object will work as long as the contains object is convertable

212458
selection-sort	quicksort
i would compare and contrast an o n-squared like selection-sort with a o n log n sort like quicksort

212520
unmanaged	c++-cli
most of our target projects are managed assemblies - those that need unmanaged functionality are usually written in managed c++ or c++-cli and link in unmanaged static libraries

212524
hash	md5
one option would be to store the hash sha1 md5 of the password instead of the clear-text password and whenever you want to see if the password is good just compare it to that hash

212529
boolean-expression	operators
the parsingr could know that it s not a boolean-expression because the + is arithmetic not a boolean operators and the parsing could throw an error at this point

212535
hash	md5
otherwise use hash sha1 or md5 like others have said here

212545
publishing	release
i haven t used it myself but the features to customize publishing between debugging and release mode looks promising

212548
library-project	libs
creating a libs can be as simple as firing up visual-studio and creating a class libs-project

212550
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is in the title - ie is misbehaving and is saying that there is a script running slowly - firefox and google-chrome don t have this problem

212562
put	get
is there a good way to have a get and put ignoring case

212576
c-strings	c++
this doesn t really matter if you are calling them from c++ except that you will have to understand regular c-strings

212587
display	width
you can see that the drop down width is not wide enough to display the whole text without expanding the overall drop down list

212587
onchange	onfocus
weâ ve looked at various ways to utilize the onfocus onblur onchange keyboard and mouse events to attempt to solve the problem but still some issues

212591
execution	exit
the general rule is that loop constructs and subroutine exit are allowed to go to an earlier point in execution all others must go to a later point in execution

212591
subroutine	scoping
moving code to another subroutine may be an option but can play havoc with scoping or even just having things close together that are conceptually close together

212606
csv	xml
birt has a gui for eclipse that lets you define the pdf from xml db csv etc etc

212629
put	get
would it be possible to implement your own map overriding put get methods

212643
build-process	nant
does anyone know any good tutorial about using nant for native code build-process instructions

212654
perl	c++
since perl is going to be providing the gui i d embed the c++ code into perl

212655
silverlight	wpf
this will get better with client side data binding in asp.net which follows a very similar model to silverlight and wpf for data binding

212664
rhino-mocks	mbunit
ie rhino-mocks htmlagilitypack mbunit rhino.commons castle project

212666
display	width
we have a fixed width drop down list and we want to have it behave as in firefox 7 as display above

212708
turkish	locale
normalise the case before using a string as a key not turkish locale works differently from the rest of the world

212728
reliability	scalability
if its commercial or open source then you need to make sure it supports whatever your system-requirements are such as connectivity via different clients throughput latency scalability persistence performance clustering ha reliability

212792
logging	trace
your program will run faster and the text for the trace logging won t be compiled into your executable

212798
order	join
there are some tricks like knowing that the order of the join does matter but i believe you ll just pick those up on the way

212820
selection-sort	bubble-sort
then talk about bubble-sort vs selection-sort

212830
memset	malloc
piecewise construction of objects can also be a lot slower than one dirty great memset of the aforementioned malloc ed arrays of struct

212831
ingres	oracle
the first informix sql-based dbms was released in 1985 so it also has longevity and pedigree similar to oracle db2 ingres sybase

212831
solaris	aix
it runs on unix and derivatives solaris aix hp-ux linux and macos x as well as on windows xp vista etc

212831
dbd	dbi
you can use dbi and dbd informix with perl

212843
groovy	java
i regularly use groovy and ruby professionally and believe that their purpose is best for writing parts of applications with particularly complex logic where java is cumbersome to write

212843
python	ruby
i haven t used python but it s syntactically similar to ruby and i would believe it s purpose would also be similar

212844
base-class	subclass
you can use your newly refactored class as a base-class and implement each specific action as a subclass using those refactored small methods

212851
selected	cell
the items in the cell are wider that the cell width so the dropdown list is also wider than the cell so the user can see what top selected

212874
version-control	bazaar
other distributed version-control tools probably will work too bazaar for example but i have less experience with them

212900
bison	yacc
i ve used lex and yacc more usually bison in the past for various projects usually translators such as a subset of edif streamed into an eda app

212901
having	select
the column contains many nulls but queries often select all rows having a value

212924
constructor	object
a singleton object comes from a class which has its constructor instantiator method overridden so that you can allocate only one of that class

212930
bison	yacc
one major difference is that antlr generates an ll parsing whereas yacc and bison both generate parsing that are lalr

212930
bison	yacc
antlr is generally considered to be easier to use than yacc bison for precisely this reason

212944
geocoding	geocode
most of the services also restrict the number of geocoding queries you can make per day so it s ok to look up addresses of say new customers who get added to your database but if you run a batch job that feeds thousands of addresses from your database into the geocode you re going to get shutoff

212973
dialog	pop-up
it ll pop-up a connecting dialog when it disappears you get a list of processes on the device

212976

213018
mediawiki	dokuwiki
i have evaluated mediawiki confluence and dokuwiki

213018
groovy	java
it allows scripting using velocity and groovy i think. this allows you to customize things if you want to especially if you have a bunch of java developers using the wiki

213020
google-chrome	firefox
with that in mind here is what i ended up with seems to work in ie6 ie7 firefox 3 and google-chrome see new note at the end

213020
firefox	opera
this includes the more recent firefox and safari and opera browsers

213041

213092
data-access	ado.net
many people using hand-written or code generated data-access find themselves writing their own framework over low-level data-access libraries like writing helper methods for ado.net

213104
methodology	waterfall
scrum can be a bit of a culture shock if you re coming from a waterfall methodology

213107
inlining	inline
the second snippet works because you ve inlined the definition of the function which means that even if the compiler doesn t generate any inline code for the function say you ve got inlining turned off or the compiler decides the function is too big to inline the code generated for the function definition will be visible in the translation unit only as if you d stuck it in an anonymous namespace

213115
arrays	loops
in your case i suspect you are creating an arrays with one element then adding an element each time through the loops

213148
databound	gridview
the databound to gridview is from datacontext created using linq

213157
vba	vb6
granted its been a while since i ve done classic vb6 and my vba experience is even rustier.

213158
gridview-sorting	gridview
more information on sorting in a gridview can be found here msdn gridview-sorting the methodology used to get the data should not matter you can use the same sorting

213169
postback	ajax
consider using pagemethods via ajax to get your data back to your form instead of postback

213169
put	get
you can put the guids in hidden spans inside the list element where you can get at them if need be

213176
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i found guidance about how to create new asp.net-mvc apps and even how to integrate new webforms based content in it but much less about porting an application to asp.net-mvc gradually

213195
authentication	login
when i try to login to this site using my yahoo openid it takes me to the yahoo site i click continue meaning that i want to send my authentication details to stackoverflow.com and stackoverflow.com gives me the following error underneath the login text field

213204
32-bit	64bit
you ll occasionally find it with closed-source c++ libraries on windows c libraries are an entirely different matter but then the vendor will have to provide a compiled version for each and every build type release debugging 32-bit 64bit etc and target compiler various versions of visual-studio require different binaries then there is borland and a bunch of other compilers and it quickly becomes a nightmare to support.

213237
contains	any
the form object that is passed to animals animal_form.html will be animal and thus won t contains any of the specifics for the derived classes dog and cat

213249
contains	any

213256
detect	move
if i could reliable detect that i could programmatically move the dialog back where they are visible again

213258
contains	any
the code gets the job done and doesn t contains any obvious howlers but as others have written there are better ways of doing this

213270
json	xml
you would bet better off using something with an existing parser like xml or json so you don t have to write your own parser and so that others can easily write documents for your parser without needing specialized tools

213297
callback	methods
i can resolve this issue by adding the following to the end of my async callback methods

213298
udp	tcp
how are the udp and tcp protocols used in mmorpg client-server communication

213300
priority-queue	heap
example compare the imperative implementation of a fibonacci heap often used as a priority-queue with the functional implementation

213333
constructor	object
constructing an object using int as the generic type and passing in two ints as arguments causes the incorrect constructor to be called from my point of view

213336
haskell	lisp
likewise collection methods like map and zip are also higher-order constructs which find their roots in languages like lisp ml and haskell

213336
scala	java
in fact in the case of scala and haskell these are very statically typed languages much stronger type systems than say java

213344
arrays	map
how are you managing the relationship of nested arrays in the hash map to repeatable sections in the template

213344
base-class	inherited
these would inherited from a common token base-class with overridable parsing rendering and map methods

sharing	share
when run individually the plugins should just work but when in concert they will be sharing some of the same model content and one of the plugins should present the user with a list of other plugins to share content with

213350
udp	tcp
anyway a combination of udp and tcp would be appropriate--you just need to ask yourself do i want reliability or speed

213359
udp	tcp
it s perfectly possible to do your own secure communications over udp you don t have to use tcp

213373
font-size	display
i don t think the display dpi changes when the font-size changes

private-key	rsa
opening that as text i see it contains both a begin end certificate section as well as begin end rsa private-key

213598
declarative-services	spring-dm
there are several options to facilitate this such as coding directly to the osgi api declarative-services spring-dm and ipojo i am sure there are others as well

213640
value	field
there s simply no good way to get non-nullable field with db-assigned default value working with linq to sql

213644
debugging	trace
half the time the debugging trace isn t actually telling you what the problem is understandable i guess

213646
account	api
to verify whether the api wrapper code really did do the right thing if the response indicated success i invoke the ftp server s com api and query its store directly to see if for example when creating a user account the user account really did get created

revision	svn
does anyone know of an easy way to import a legacy project whose version-control system is a series of dated folders into svn so that the history of the revision is preserved

213730
binary	hex
instead i was able to write conversion code to convert binary to hex encoded strings

213737
authentication	login
in that case the whould show the login screen and with the correct params would log the user in if authentication is successful

213779
hash	md5
good practice is storing only a one-way hash of the password in the database -- typically md5 or better sha1

213808
json	xml
come up with an internal representation -- be it xml json some binary file you come up with yourself or any other form of serialization

213816
punctuation	words
what i want to do is check for duplicates words right next to each other but even if there is punctuation in between

213827
build-system	scons
if you re going down that road you might also want to investigate scons which is a build-system itself built with python

213832
python	perl
perl python powershell are all good choices

213833
emacs	kate
i already used kate scite geany emacs vi and bluefish so those are not interesting

213839
selection	highlight
fast nice code highlight and many useful shortcuts like ctrl + d to comment selection language wise

213844
any	set
its not guaranteed to make any difference and if the dll is not used then it will have been swapped out and isn t part of the current working set

213860
account	api
for example if you can create a user using the high-level api then there should be a high-level api to get the user account too

213897
double	int
hacked out of code for raising a double value to an int power - had to remove the code to deal with reciprocals for example.

213908

213934
tapestry	wicket
alternative view technologies like wicket tapestry etc

213937
zend-debugger	xdebug
the great thing about using eclipse as a php ide is that you have great integration for zend-debugger xdebug and you can use common eclipse extensions like mylyn or subclipse also for php

213939
jquery	.post
i ve tried using jquery and the .post method

213939
jquery	.post
i m not tied to using jquery i m just trying to figure out how to do a .post from a javascript

radio-button	button
button check visual c++ runtime libraries radio-button setting download prerequisites from the component vendor s web site

213990
debugging	trace
if the only objetive of the debugging code you are having problems with is to trace the values of some varibles i think that what you really need is a debugger

213999
contains	any
note that the vswprintf function is defined in the c99 standard and since there are not yet any fully conforming c99 compilers i believe it s very possible that any given implementation of vswprintf does not fully conform to the spec or that it contains bugs the former is more likely than the latter

214050
double	int
instead of int one 1 one can surely use 1 but will that hold true for double pi 3.141..

214057
groovy	java
i am a java developer and i am naturally inclined to do everything using java-related technologies j2se j2ee groovy grails jruby jython jwhatever and so on... but please be welcome to post whatever you use being related to java or not

214059
python	perl
i m most familiar with perl but i m perfectly happy with a solution in python or any other language

214060
contains	set
the result set contains only the records matching the criteria and it extracts a value from the xml into a column called value

214060
having	select
i d like to get sql to do the heavy lifting and only return data matching my criteria rather than having to select transfer and then process a potentially massive chunk of data

214076
cout	cin
contrary to other claims the n character is mapped to the correct platform end of line sequences only if the stream is going to a file std cin and std cout being special but still files or file-like

background-color	display
the background-color of the tab seems to be controlled by the os s display properties

214082
windows-xp	windows
specifically the under the appearance tab windows and buttons property windows-xp

214088
ruby-on-rails	django
it competes with django and ruby on ruby-on-rails for rapid development but has a more flexible backend

214102
http	ssl
or it could be that the socket is closed by the ssl tls protocol if i m not mistaken ssl tls has its own higher-level protocol for closing the underlying connection but httpclient somehow managed to not notice this don t know whether it s possible but say the remote side closed the ssl connection but was using http 1.1 persistent connections and didn t set a connection close response

214109
exception-handling	try-catch
then i placed some try-catch blocks and low and behold when i don t debugging there is no exception-handling

214111
attributes	properties
i d add an attributes to the properties where you can specify a custom name and you can provide more user friendly names using the attributes

214133
silverlight	wpf
i would argue that you can port silverlight to wpf with minimal effort

214133
silverlight	wpf
since silverlight is a subset of wpf its allot easier to go from silverlight to wpf than the other way around

214133
silverlight	wpf
i had some minor issues around authentication as silverlight 2 will pick up any authentication information in the browser while in wpf you have to role your own login screen and manage cookies etc

214133
silverlight	wpf
i recently did a blog post about the dive log sample application and how i ported it from silverlight 2 to wpf

214159
xml-serialization	xml
i ve successfully used this to create a type for that uses xml-serialization to an xml field based on ayende s example

214162
postgresql	mysql
at that point you should think about migrating the database to postgresql or mysql because they ll be able to handle concurrent requests much faster

214164
codeigniter	cakephp
although i personally love cakephp and i ve done many projects for clients running on shared hosts and it runs just fine if a light footprint is really important for you codeigniter would be my choice

214172
mediawiki	bugzilla
i m getting a lot of great feedback that this is hitting a sweet spot - it allows you to bring bugzilla reports in line into mediawiki documents and create standard aggregated reports

214178
variables	boolean
other one word variables like boolean toggles what have you are never abbreviated ie

214199
iequalitycomparer	iequatable
.net has this via iequalitycomparer for a type which can compare two objects and iequatable for a type which can compare itself to another instance

214202

django has a lot of other great benefits simple templating language uses python easy to host etc but the admin is the reason i chose it over ruby-on-rails

214205
32-bit	64bit
when i put the code in a file and run it under strace -ff it appears that on 64bit hardy it calls clone like fork before execve whereas on 32-bit dapper it does no such thing

214205
32-bit	64bit
maybe someone among you can tell me what the difference even is between these commands on the 64bit system let alone why they work the same on the 32-bit one

214206
reflection	runtime
now we can use reflection to build a map of message handler at runtime

214217
select	union
sql select a b from table1 union

214227
associations	model
your example data can also refer to other default model which are represented by procs with delayed evaluation so you can override associations easily when desired

214271
fflush	stdout
and anything printed to stdout will be automatically fflush ed

214271
stderr	stdout
in other words is there some way i can tell stdio to automatically fflush stdout after every printf the way it automatically flushes stderr

what are basic variables types like a string int or double

214295
dynamic-programming	divide-and-conquer
4 discuss various ideas behind algorithms such as 1 divide-and-conquer 2 dynamic-programming 3 brute force 4 creation of a data structure 5 reducing a problem to a similar one already solved for example fibonacci numbers is a classic recursive problem to give beginning programmers and 6 the idea of being greedy like in a making change example if you were in a country where coin denominations where a b and c

214295
combinations	permutation
or compute the number of combinations or permutation of r elements from a set of n

software-quality	legacy
when i was working in the software-quality team at my old part-time we usually tested all the versions possible to guarantee that some old legacy problem wouldn t appear

214329
scrollto	slider
i was recently working with scrollto to implement a coda-like slider wizard

214329
contains	set
set a contains div to the dimensions i wanted the slider to appear as

214333
vbscript	jscript
however vbscript or jscript used with the winows scripting host works just as well and requires nothing additional to install

214356
filesystems	fileserver
or you could drop the blob data in the database and store it in a filesystems with the md5 value as a filename with an http server as a network fileserver

214360
double-quotes	single-quotes
however by setting the environment variables delimident you can turn on the sql standard behaviour - single-quotes around strings and double-quotes around delimited identifier

214363
any	set
using any tools which you would expect to find on a nix system in fact if you want msdos is also fine too what is the easiest fastest way to calculate the mean of a set of numbers assuming you have them one per line in a stream or file

214365
decimal	hex
so you just have to take each pair of hex digits and convert them to decimal

214375
javascript	dom
ext js is large js library that includes a lot of functionality from standard dom manipulation through the one of the most comprehensive set of javascript ui components

214382
contains	set
create a startup.m scripting file contains the commands to set up the state that you want

214382
put	get
put your startup.m in any of those directories and it will be found whenever you start matlab startup.m is also found if it is in the directory from which matlab is started but the technique above allows you to start matlab from an arbitrary directory and still have startup.m get run

214411
click	mouse
ability to receive events such as mouse click

214428
python	perl
i ve done a decent amount of scripting in both linux unix and windows environments in python perl batch files bash etc

214428
python	perl
because of this i ve found myself writing scripts that were unwieldy as batch files in vbscript instead since i can t usually depend on python or perl or bash being available on windows

214434
default	reset
unfortunately it won t show you the filename for that default css but it will show you what properties were reset

214474
json	xml
another example if your xml includes dtd descriptions and entity references that must be resolved over the wire and your network connection has high latency then you could see improvements with json

214486
rtos	isr
i can t say 100 because whatever operations your do in your isr s may interfere with the rtos

214503
environment	execution
the best way to avoid this is to ensure any scripting invoked by crontab do not make any assumptions about the environment when execution

214525
exception-handling	try-catch
how about using try-catch overflow exception-handling

214527
value	field
however whenever i create field for database tables i find myself using value like 16 32 128 for text field and i try to combine boolean value into set data field

214546
getter	setter
every class that isn t brainless getter and setter is unit-tested

214567
solaris	linux
the solaris and linux 64-bit jvms should be what you should be after

214567
solaris	linux
i would expect the 64-bit os from windows to get stable in about a year or so but until then solaris linux might be better bet

214626
perl	php
this was slightly non-trivial because we had php which called perl which called sql functions procedures

214626
javadoc	doxygen
any other code-crawling tools would help in a similar fashion javadoc rdoc perldoc doxygen etc.

214643
integer	short
in short you will find that if you can assume power-of-2 dimensions then a lot of integer multiplications and divisions turn into bit-shifts

214649
wicket	jsf
wicket is quite popular but jsf has a bunch of tooling and widgets and works with seam which gets rave reviews

214650
versioning	migrate
this lets me migrate data from the old versioning to the new for example you ve switched storage of user preferences from the registry to an xml file but you want to be polite and migrate their settings

214651
linked-list	arrays
for instance why use a hashtable versus an arrays versus a linked-list

214667
http	ssl
would it be possible to simply use ssl http

214673
attributes	properties
use reflection to get the values of all the properties from the class then write them as attributes on to an xmlnode

214680
json	xml
popular varieties from java are xml json amf although you can always roll your own

214693
ref	out
have you seen how many developers don t really understand ref out

214693
ref	out
sometimes using ref out is the most appropriate approach - the various tryparse methods etc

214696
libpng	zlib
if you go with libpng you ll also need zlib and if you re using devkitpro you ll probably run into some missing functions from playing with the code for 5 minutes it looks like it relies on pow which doesn t seem to be in libnds. i have no idea what the official nintendo sdk offers in the way of a standard-library - you might be in better shape if that s what you re using

214701
ref	out
ref out automatically means mutability and functional-programming with immutable value is all the rage these days

214703
macros	let
i ve actually written some macros that let you navigate source using alt-cursor

214708
ref	out
ref out also don t work with func delegation so these style apis are less composable reusable with some other apis that use delegation

214710
convenience-methods	initializer
it would be nice if mlabstractdatapackets provided a convenience-methods that returned the correct initializer class for a packets of data that comes in the form

214710
subclassing	superclass
the superclass doesn t know about any of its subclassing

214720
installation	building
because it just helps building the distribution it doesn t ship with your code or do any installation it can do a lot of powerful stuff

214727
python	c++
as an alternative you could write a c c++ program that does all that kernel space work for you and interface with it in python via the subprocess module or python c c++ bindings and another link for that

214729
command-line	cmd
you could open a cmd-line and execute the netstat cmd to see if the port is used before starting your services

214735
continuous-integration	build-process
it s worth noting that by continuous-integration i mean automated integration with an automated build-process and automatically runs tests and automatically detects failure of each piece

214765
ruby	php
weborb does has the advantage that is supports .net java php and ruby

214780
revision	updates
before updates you have to perform an additional insert in the revision table

214780
revision	svn
using a revision number per busines transaction you can do versioning over table records like svn does over files

214794
hash	md5
#1 there are several different ways you can compute the md5 hash

214794
hash	md5
use mysql s md5 function to compute the hash

214830
getter	setter
i don t document getter setter or anything done by the book

214835
wicket	jsf
i understand a book is expensive but investing in a book will help you understand the fundamentals which will help you if you move to struts spring-mvc wicket jsf or whatever other framework you will use in the future

214836
document	element
when the middle tier receives an xml message it uses the document element s tag name as the name of the stored procedure it should call and calls the sp passing it the entire xml message as a parameter

214866
nagios	cacti
if you want to have stats and everything else on top of what nagios gives you then add cacti

214867
python	c++
i ve never used giveio.sys myself but personally i would establish that it was loaded correctly by using c or c++ or some pre-written app before i tried to get it working via python

214871
web-services	webserver
out of the box it knows how to monitor web-services webserver of varying types such as iis tomcat websphere 5 and 6 and a host of other things such as natively pulling performance data from mssql and db2

214910
short	base
short of changing and recompiling the source code which is possible with open source changing the base language is not really possible

214957
windows-server	windows
we have a number of servers only one is windows and so we want to get away from using that windows-server and have all linux servers for ease of management

214966
copy-constructor	constructor
if you have a member that can t be trivially copied you ll need to provide a copy-constructor a destructor an assignment-operator and a default constructor

214987
.net	wcf
i am building a web application using .net 3.5 asp.net sql-server c# wcf wf etc and i have run into a major design dilemma

215007
.when	ready
.when that s ready i m thinking a couple of weeks i will generate the documentation and set up a quick site with some demos and example code

215029
webserver	nginx
i will use nginx as a webserver

215049
put	get
this refactoring may seem like overkill for just the get methods but when you add a put methods etc

215070
parallels	bootcamp
in addition to that i believe that parallels has bootcamp support so you can even virtualise your windows partition

215074
jlist	jtree
i m writing a custom swing component something completely new but think jtree or jlist

215074
jtable	jlist
i m trying to follow the general design of jtree jtable jlist etc for consistency i ve also seen various poor 3rd party components abandon the separable model and or renderer approach

215077
tokenize	parsing
it is quite trivial to parsing with a tokenize or some regex so i am not sure where you are stuck

215078
gridview	formview
it appears when using built-in databound controls such as gridview detailsview or formview which utilize â œdatakeynamesâ

215084
difference	factors
another critical factors was to only use http for authentication but use http for all other traffic -- i was really surprised how much that made a difference

215095
boolean	int
functions are a built-in datatype no different from int and boolean

215095
expression	evaluation
in functional languages even impure functional languages expression evaluation is the fundamental unit of execution

215096
python	java
i like python fine but i frequently encounter awkward mismatches between the python type system and the java type system

215096
python	java
for example if you just want a hashtable should you use a python dictionary or a java hashmap

215096
python	java
the decision might be different depending on whether you are just using the data structure locally in python code or passing it across the java boundary

215099
virtualbox	vmware
at a pinch i could always virtualise with virtualbox or vmware or parallels to use visual-studio or dual boot for that matter

215100
deployment	install
rather you would enable users access to the deployment you have install based on a user s identity using windows nt authentication

215100
arguments	default
by default query-string arguments are disabled

215100
command-line	cmd
unsafe arguments are ones that include database or command-line escape characters that could allow a malicious user to manipulate your application into executing arbitrary cmd

215113
getter	setter
mocks were invented in part to answer the question how would you unit test objects if they had no getter or setter

215123
put	get
get the team to put you on bug fixing for two weeks if you have two weeks

215130
debian	linux
i ve done this with ubuntu debian pc linux os freespire and xandros on my vista home premium machine and they all worked that way

215130
any	set
regadless you don t need wubi or vmware or any virtual anything a straight install with a dual boot set up is the default on a typical live cd linux install and it works even with vista

215154
linux	osx
eclipse projects are fairly compatible for linux and osx but not windows

215184
any	set
with some exception-handling hungarian notation i think consistent usage may be more useful than any arbitrary set of rules

215186
webserver	security
your webserver should be able to handle most of your security concerns but if documents are small and the db isn t already under a big load then i don t really see a big issue with having them in the db

215198
png	gif
several output formats are supported such as x11 vga postscript pdf cgm hpgl svg png bmp ppm gif and tiff

215198
python	java
plotting extensions for the languages perl python and java are also supported for most operating systems

215219
hide	show
i would like to use jquery s show hide feature to minimize the table but still show part of the top and bottom rows

215219
hide	show
if javascript is on then it hide the middle table rows and adds the show hide links

215224
binary-search-tree	nodes
this contrasts with a balanced binary-search-tree treemap which must start at the root and work its way down to the desired nodes every time a lookup is required

215224
data-structures	tree
alternatively two separate data-structures can be maintained internally a hashtable and a tree

215238
hide	show
to get it to degrade nicely you d have to have all the rows show initially and then hide them with your jquery document ready function and also create the row with the link in

215244
.doc	xls
these can only be handled if you provide an extension white list listfindnocase fileext .doc xls powerpoint jpg

215277
keyboard	mouse
i even carried it between home and office kept another monitor keyboard mouse at office but i do even now that i have a mbp and it was awesome

215288
templating	mako
it s default templating language mako is very nice to work with

215288
lighttpd	apache
you can use it with apache lighttpd though i ve not tried this

215298
configuration	environment
if that s not the case you should try to pass the environment variables to apache since doing a setenv in the configuration file doesn t work

215301
jface	swt
if you want a native look and feel use swt jface

215302
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to create a file in the tmp directory working on a linux ubuntu 7.10 that has read write execute access for any user

215316
rewrite	rule
i ve tried putting the rewrite rule in an .htaccess file after modifying my etc apache sites-available default file to set allowoverride all

215316
rewrite	rule
i ve tried putting the rewrite rule in apache2.conf httpd.conf and rewrite.conf

215321
python	c++
if you re familiar with matplotlib you can embed python in c c++ applications

215324
joomla	drupal
cms content management system describe systems that are used to manage content - as for example joomla drupal sharepoint and etc

215345
rewrite	rule
try a different rewrite rule with no conditional for example

215375
firefox	safari
ie 7.0 firefox 3.0 and safari 3.12.

215375
firefox	safari
after a few months of working with this problem i ve found that safari and firefox are amazingly consistent between mac and pc

215381
uname	bsd
on bsd systems check with uname -a proc should always be present

215383
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
is there a way to implements it through the subview tile class how do other tiles receive the touchesbegan touchesmoved event as the finger move

215384
margins	padding
general box models padding margins et al should all be standard

215390
ruby	php
no server-side php ruby python java etc

215407
javascript	dom
just an opinion here and not canonical advice but you re headed for a world or hurt if you re trying to extract exact text values from the dom using the inner outer html text properties via javascript

215445
put	get
but even if you put debugging if you disable the log for the module in question you dont get any messages from it

215473
firefox	opera
os x has many webkit-based browsers safari shiira icab omniweb as well as firefox seamonkey camino and opera

215473
firefox	opera
even if you test with mozilla firefox opera and konqueror from kde 4 on windows you re not even close to covering most of the userbase

215473
opera	gecko
that being said if you narrow your focus to browsers with support for modern css you ll find that there s only a few underlying engines trident ie gecko mozilla webkit apple khtml kde and presto opera

215473
firefox	gecko
gecko used by the mozilla suite s browser mozilla navigator seamonkey navigator iceape navigator mozilla firefox icecat iceape epiphany-gecko galeon kazehakase-gecko

215473
google-chrome	safari
webkit used by safari shiira icab omniweb google-chrome epiphany-webkit kazehakase-webkit arora

215473
google-chrome	safari
rendering should be completely consistent across all os x browsers as they use the system-provided webkit library but safari and google-chrome on windows have very different drawing engines underneath and on linux there s both gtk+ and qt versions with different behavior

215494
alfresco	opencms
open source examples would be things like alfresco bricolage and opencms which you can take a look at to get a feel for what this space does

215494
document-management	content-management
the difference between something like drupal and an ecms is that drupal has lots of websitey features it is its own front-end web application it has a search function it allows users to register and comment that an ecms does not while it lacks robust content-management features like structured content workflow versioning asset document-management and metadata

215497
protected	public
in java are there clear rules on when to use each of access-modifiers namely the default package-private public protected and private while making class and interface and dealing with inherited

215498
antivirus	security
it s been my experience that some security software like symantec s norton antivirus oftentimes prohibit their removal from a windows system via the add or remove programs utility going so far as to occasionally require a removal program obtained from symantec s homepage

215534
directory	folder
right click the desktop and navigate to new and then from the sub-menu selected shortcut â browse to the windows directory or folder and then to the system32 directory and click ok

215540
swtbot	swt
for example the swt framework used in eclipse provides swtbot jfcunit has already been mentioned mozilla has their own way of simulating this in xul and from what i ve read on their blogs these tests seem to be quite brittle

215540
required	checked
sometimes you have to take a screenshot and test for pixel-perfect rendering i believe that mozilla does this to checked for correctly rendering pages - this required a lengthier setup but might be what you need for the graphs

215542
python	java
are there any libs out there for perl python or java that automates that task

215545
oxygene	delphi
2- a partial reuse of your existing delphi business layer code by using oxygene from remobjecs a visual-studio plugin with a syntax that is very similar to the delphi syntax

215545
intraweb	vcl
if you decide to stay with delphi you might want to look into vcl for the web aka intraweb and into delphi 2009 a lot has changed in the delphi world since delphi 7 was announced 6 years ago

215548
buffering	streaming
streaming vs buffering execution orderby is deferred but buffering

215565
specifications	w3c
from w3c document object model core level 1 specifications bold is mine

215575
queue	fifo
implements a circular buffer style fifo queue

215577
linux	unix
for example on linux ext3 supports file attributes that are not part of the standard unix read write execute user group world paradigm

215579
protected	public
many languages find the hierarchical nature of public protected private to be too limiting and not in line with reality

215603
mousedown	mouseup
this will probably involve mousedown mouse move and mouseup

215613
command-line	cmd
run this cmd at the cmd-line and see if you get some more detailed information

215623
hypertable	hbase
if you need to scale really big there s always hbase or hypertable which are both bigtable clones

215629
jlist	jtree
afaik neither jlist nor jtree require the renderinger to rendering text

215638
implements	extends
public class java.lang.throwable extends java.lang.object implements java.io.serializable

215646
default	reset
right-click the transparencykey property and press reset to set it back to default

215659
xml-serialization	xml
customize your .net object xml-serialization with .net xml attributes

215735
subclassing	superclass
a dealer also offers after-sale vehicle service so i could have appointment booking class as superclass and then vehicle service and test-drive as two subclassing

215742
logic-programming	declarative
by logic-programming i mean the a sub-paradigm of declarative programming languages

215749
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome seems to have roughly the same level of svg support as safari

215749
google-chrome	safari
konqueror uses the same svg engine as safari and google-chrome - ksvg claims to be in beta

215752
python	c++
i decided to experiment with embedding python code in c++ using the boost.python library

215761
windows-xp	windows
data test on windows-xp and to users loginuser appdata roaming test on windows vista

215766
directory	folder
due to legacy issues i have two folder under app_code directory

215778
codeigniter	kohana
as a result several people took up a huge interest in getting their contributions in and while kohana is based on all the same principles and ideas as codeigniter the implementation is much better and much easier to work with

215794
internet-explorer	firefox
it drives internet-explorer but is also functional with firefox and safari to some extent

215810
ubuntu	linux
i ve got an unmanaged linux vps running ubuntu that i m using for the web server for a personal website

215823
versioning	upgrade
i actually recommend that everybody use the latest ssms 2008 client regardless of what server they re connecting to because it has some nice perks and upgrade that work with all server versioning that you connect to

215853
strong-typing	types
essentially you can think of a uri as an actual data types so using one provides a level of strong-typing

215855
temporary	copy
you may have to create a component that will intervene and create a temporary local copy of the file

215856
minidump	pdb
b copy-paste back all the exe dll pdb files to the development machine to a temporary folder along with the minidump in the same folder

215861
execution	restart
this can produce surprising results when the server is restart because the newly generated execution plan will be targeted at whatever parameter is used first - not necessarily the best one

215871
any	set
all i ask that with the log you mention the os complete version information for the jre and any heap gc related command-line switches that you have set

215871
scala	java
i d also like to know if you are running grails groovey jruby scala or something other than or along side java

215890
oracle	mysql
this is why some people say oracle can t scale and why other people say mysql can rule the world

215902
web-applications	scalability
building scalability web-applications with google app engine

215908
perl	c++
i can read just about any programming language c# c c++ perl oz haskell erlang whatever.

215918
ref	out
just a thought i find ref out to be useful when the arguments capture the state of execution in target methods rather than capturing returned data

215924
firefox	opera
i m wondering if there s any way to have firefox 3 or ie 7 or safari 3.1 or opera flag that a redirect has occurred any deltas between the hyperlink or url entered into address bar and the page you land on whether you ve arrived from a hyperlink or entering url into address bar

215966
ref	out
the reason i was told is the 1.0 gc had problems when ref out was used

215983
rewrite	rule
if that is the case you can try the user friendly url - rule templates feature of url rewrite module iis7

215983
rewrite	rule
rule templates are used to provide a simple way of creating one or more rewrite rules for a certain scenario

215983
rewrite	rule
in addition to that url rewrite module user-interface provides a framework for plugging in custom rule templates

216009
32-bit	64bit
one was 32-bit the other was 64bit

216010
32-bit	64bit
i think that coreset.o was compiled for 64bit and you are linking it with a 32-bit computation.o

216011
32-bit	64bit
it looks like the object file was compiled on a 64bit toolchain and you re using a 32-bit toolchain

216038
entity-framework	ado.net
have you looked into using the ado.net entity-framework

216047
macros	let
the macros system should let you emulate some functional programming ideas

216052
contains	set
if you find that you always have some specific files that should not be added to the repository for example generated binaries you should set up the svn ignore property on the contains directory so these files won t keep showing up when using svn status

216078
binary	hex
hex editors are made to view and edit binary files

216079
binary	hex
as for showing the raw binary values you need a hex editor like xvi32

216080
text-editor	editor
what you want is a hex editor rather than a normal text-editor

216088
common-lisp	smalltalk
and some of them support functions as first class citizens languages in that area are ecl embbedabble common-lisp iirc gnu smalltalk gst smalltalk has blocks then there are libraries for closures e.g in glib2

216088
haskell	ocaml
well or you can go learning ocaml haskell mozart oz or the like

216089
binary	hex
you could always open a file binary or text file there really is no difference in a hex editor and look at the raw binary data

216095
licensing	lgpl
2 filemap is under lgpl if the licensing terms are of any concer of you

216108
xml-serialization	xml
xml-serialization is a little easier than returning an xelement because all you have to do is mark properties with attributes and the serializer does all the xml generation for you

216108
attributes	properties
i for one would rather mark my properties with attributes than write a methods

216118
pointers	stack
push original object pointers onto stack this

216118
arrays	loops
loops over arrays and for each invocation

216128
pointers	stack
you now have two copies of s one in the caller one on stack as a parameter each which contains a pointers to that same block of memory

216134
scons	jam
you can use makefile projects which allows you to use any external tool you like make scons jam whatever to do your build

216154
constructor	private
make the copy constructor and operator private in your class

216178
perl	php
can tomcat serve other dynamic contents like perl php etc

216196
external	embed
if you allow embed objects from any domain you are already allowing full scripting access to your page from an external domains so html injection is the least of your worries

216197
versioning	upgrade
that gcc versioning had some bugs so i upgrade to gcc 3.4.6

216203
instances	destroy
i have a framework in flex which loads and destroy child sections which are instances of module classes

216204
shell	bash
when bash is invoked as an interactive login shell or as

216204
shell	bash
when a login shell exits bash reads and executes commands

216204
shell	bash
when bash is started non-interactively to run a shell

216211
32-bit	16-bit
ok found a solution seems that you need to have the pc lsb set to 1 when you do a branch or it falls into the arm mode 32-bit instruction instead of 16-bit instructions like in the thumb mode

216215
pixels	line
if you re referring to a 2 line by 16 character display they ll generally be pixels based and will have an integrated controllers as they re much more complicated to control

216228
contains	any
in this case trunk should contains any current development efforts but a release branch defined early before the next release can serve as consolidation branch in which only the appropriate code validated for the next release is merged then fixed during the homologation phase and finally freezed as it goes into production

216232
scala	ocaml
modern functional languages ocaml haskell erlang scala f# c# 3.0 javascript do not have those features

216237
sql-server	oracle
and then you can derive a class for specific sql-server or oracle implementation

216237
any	set
as for conditionals you can use to test if you destroyed the object or garbage collector set the object in the finalization queue that it is not available to you any longer

216268
connection-pooling	pool
as jwalkerjr mentioned you should be disposing of connections in code if connection-pooling is enabled they are just returned to the connection pool

216270
websphere	ibm
you might like to take a look at ibm s websphere service registry and repository

216270
websphere	ibm
disclaimer i work for ibm as a websphere consultant

216272
order	add
the user-interface would be more useful if you add more button i would think about these order by priority but these are not essential

216302
erlang	prolog
the first erlang interpreter was written in prolog - and for a reason since prolog is very well suited for parsing and encoding the logic you find in parse trees

216303
ienumerator	ienumerable
in c# there are two interfaces ienumerable and ienumerator

216308
required	checked
if you required only perfect code to be checked in then actually nothing should get checked in

216315
any	set
right now i am checking that the value of the system property webstart.version is not null but i couldn t find any guarantees in the documentation that this property should be set by future versions alternative implementations

216369
command-line	cmd
it can do indention of xml on the command-line maybe your favorite editor can execute external cmd so you can make a menu entry for this

216379
svg	vml
if you want to display a chart directly in your web page you could possibly use either vml vector markup language or svg scalability vector graphics

216379
svg	vml
vml is supported by ie whereas svg is supported by many other browsers although ie can display svg by means of a plugin

216379
svg	vml
google-maps for example uses vml when running in ie and svg for other browsers

216379
svg	vml
both vml and svg use an xml format for defining the grahical charts you want to display

216381
postgresql	mysql
it has adapters to support mysql mssql postgresql sqlite oracle and others

216420
32-bit	64bit
beware that you ll run problems on 64bit architectures if you use a 32-bit zlib dll and vice versa

216426
realloc	free
i ll end up copying the entire string with realloc then copying it again manually to free up the first arrays element

216438
attributes	properties
the compiler determines if the attributes are events styles or properties but since this is done at compile time it is not reflection

216438
reflection	runtime
reflection by definition is done at runtime

216438
reflection	runtime
however i would say that the term reflection is very often used in a broad sense to mean anything that calls methods whose names are determined at runtime or creates objects from classes named only at runtime

216449
checkbox	button
it makes it pretty straightforward to test things like if i click button a dialog b should be displayed or if i select option 2 from the drop-down all the checkbox should become deselected

216459
keyboard	mouse
if you have a linux or windows pc already then you probably have a monitor usb mouse and usb keyboard

216477
event-listener	listener
if you added the event-listener with a weak reference and have no other references to it the target of the listener should be garbage collected then

216508
cyclomatic-complexity	lines-of-code
warning 1720 lines-of-code 0 errors in findbugs 0 in modified checkstyle cyclomatic-complexity under 10 for all functions

216528
implements	abstract
this approach however doesnt work if you have a backend that is limited in capabilty with regards to stored-procedures in which case you build an abstaction layer to implements sql or generate target specific sql based on an abstract limited sql syntax

216536
selected	button
after the user selected the item he s interested in he will click on the submit button

216545
combinations	permutation
i believe it would be overly complex and difficult to maintain if you attempt to have a set of derived classes that implement all the permutation and combinations of people and their roles

216546
inlining	inline
gcc was among the first to implement inlining and introduced the inline static inline and extern inline constructs

216572
internet-explorer	firefox
if i visited a website in firefox and then in internet-explorer cookies would be stored for both attempts seperately

216601
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql

216614
postgresql	mysql
a comparison von mysql and postgresql can be found here

216616
double-quotes	single-quotes
if i m using single-quotes it s trivial maurice the rocket richard but what about double-quotes

216645
instances	private
you could create an emailableperson that decorates person where emailableperson uses composition to hold a private instances of a person and delegates all non-email methods to the person object

216655
entity-relationship	diagram
that will not trak organize your metadata geneate your ddl or anything else for that matter - but it will give you an entity-relationship diagram that you can easily edit updates

216664
h.264	mp4
i do have access to the h.264 frame coming in but that seemed more complicated via mp4

216673
postgresql	mysql
when i worked on the zend framework s database component we tried to abstract the functionality of the limit clause supported by mysql postgresql and sqlite

216699
parentheses	braces
what i m not sure though is whether it ever adds the braces as requested for the loop or the extra parentheses in the conditional of the same loop

216705
scientific-notation	numeric
the g29 format specifier is similar but can use scientific-notation if more compact see standard numeric format strings

216723
mouseleave	mousemove
here s one way to do it using mouseenter mousemove and mouseleave to triggers the necessary redraws

216724
stateless	stateful
but again the stateless tier has some sort of rule s that it uses to contact the stateful tier

216730
value	field
basically you format the datetime field and then proceed to do the grouping etc on the formatted value

216733
placeholder	required
working around it either required you to write the expression manually or to use a delegate as a placeholder

216733
put	get
the get expression is where you put your extension stuff orderbywhatever first etc.

216737
glassfish	geronimo
tool availability - awesome ides like eclipse netbeans are free as are webserver like tomcat and application servers jboss glassfish geronimo etc.

216737
solaris	sunos
sun solaris sunos unix

216737
midp	cldc
motorola cell phones midp cldc

216772
getter	setter
your classes are just data-structures none of them has any behaviour just getter and setter

216781
relative-path	filepath
i now want to add log4j for logging and i d like to use a relative-path for the log file as i don t want to change the filepath on every deployment

216783
firefox	opera
using the data url in the img src doesn t work in ie but it does in firefox and opera

216804
scp	ssh
have been supplanted by ssh scp etc

216805
ubuntu	debian
on debian including ubuntu will not work because that points at usr share tomcat6 which has no link to var log tomcat6

216805
linux	unix
but for tomcat on linux unix i would create a setenv.sh in the catalina_home bin directory

216818
textbox	button
to further explain - i have a button that after clicks set the url of the image - i also put this value in the textbox just to see if the same thing happens - after postback my textbox still has the value but the image does not - and all of my other asp.net images lose their image and they are defined right on the controls ie imageurl

216828
file-access	fileinfo
edit on 2nd thought you can avoid the security lookups on each file-access by using directoryinfo and fileinfo instead of the static file methods

216853
intermediate-language	cil
this is what runs part of .net programs which are not in native-code but in cil common intermediate-language a language and machine-neutral intermediate-language

216905
flying-saucer	itext
see the article generating pdfs for fun and profit with flying-saucer and itext

216911
naming-conventions	conventions
of course a sort of minimal version of objects is not the only sort of naming conventions this applies to -- nearly the vast majority of naming-conventionss make use of a common substring to form the names

216914
xsd	xml
i m not sure about dtd but you can generate xsd files from an xml file using the xsd.exe tool

216922
defined	declare
i ve seen a technique used to ensure that globals are definedd exactly once by using a macros to declare the variables as extern but the macros would be redefinedd to nothing for the single case where the header declarations are used to defined the variables

216926
attributes	properties
the error may be the use of the value properties according to value is the constant value to which the variables specified by other attributes s of this tag will be compared

216937
contains	any
in your case output_tray might be a good example but i don t generally use nested classes if the class is going to have any methods which are going to be called from outside the contains class or is more than primarily a data class

216940
linux	unix
since i m not familiar with details of unix linux debugging this stuff may not apply at all to other os s

216944
.net	wcf
wcf is for enabling .net framework applications to exchange messages with other software entities

216947
webforms	asp.net
seems like ms finally came up with something decent considering the asp.net webforms mess.

216968
silverlight	wpf
mono olive and moonlight are supposed to add .net 3.0 less wpf and silverlight functionality

216976
json	xml
i believe you could use either json or xml serialization to achieve the same thing though

216992
.net	wcf
in wcf you are in the different world about web services and this s the best technology in .net to expose services can you see the difference.

216992
communication	messages
with wcf you can use ssl to encrypt the communication to do that in asmx you need to use wse - web-services enhancements you can send big files and securely to do that in asmx you need to use mtom - messages transmission optimization mechanism

216995
directory	folder
say i want to copy the contents of a directory excluding files and folder whose names contain the word music

217000
.net	wcf
in addition to the above responses wcf was created to replace .net remoting in .net 3.0 and beyond

217000
json	xml
web services in various formats xml and json wcf also offers msmq and named pipes

217018
associations	model
take a look here in the ruby-on-rails api in the associations join model section

217020
shell	bash
when iâ m back in the bash shell typing shift-3 just produces a â as expected

217034
any	set
though i have had myself set on becoming a web developer i m not so sure about that any more so am trying not to limit myself to that area of development

217035
numeric	digits
then to represent a particular move from a positioning you could use numeric move notation as used in correspondence chess which give you a short 4-5 digits representation of a move on the board

217038
click	mouse
it lets you do things easily with a few mouse click and visualise how the code works plus in the debugger console you have an intercative gdb

217056
execution	exit
xdebug has a nice trace feature that ll allow you to see all the entire trace of your php app execution and it should give you give clue as to where your exit is

217064
mp3	wma
probably your only realistic chance is to do this using wma instead of mp3 because you can write simple c# wrappers around the multimedia sdk

217065
linked-list	arrays
i m working on a sparse matrix class that needs to use an arrays of linked-list to store the values of a matrix

217065
linked-list	arrays
each element of the arrays each linked-list represents a row of the matrix

217065
linked-list	arrays
and each element in the linked-list arrays represents a column and the stored value

217082
any	set
you can set to stop to prevent the scripting from executing any further statements

217089
space	input
in gvim inputting the kanji works you input the pronounciation and then press space bar to get the kanji but when you confirm the kanji you want it replaces that kanji with question marks

217109
onmouseover	mouseover
buymenu.subscribe mouseover onmouseover foo bar false

217111
asp.net-mvc	wcf
i m working my way into asp.net-mvc at the moment but on my to learn at some point list i also have wcf

217111
asp.net-mvc	wcf
i just wonder if wcf is something that should could be used in an asp.net-mvc application or not

217111
json	xml
should i just use special views have the controllers return json or xml using the contentresult

217111
forms-authentication	credentials
i can either use windows authentication or if the site is running forms-authentication have the user store his her credentials in the application but i would then essentially create a http client in my application

217111
asp.net-mvc	wcf
so while asp.net-mvc application seems really easy application asp.net-mvc does seem to be somewhat tricky and a possible use for wcf

217111
asp.net-mvc	wcf
i m not trying to brute-force wcf in this but i just wonder if there is indeed a good use case for wcf in an asp.net-mvc application

217114
dictionary	for-loop
edit you can also replace the first for-loop s construction of h with a dictionary constructor and a generator expression

217118
contains	any
instead fix it by changing your templating system or style so that any time you output text you always html-escape it as a matter of course even if the data can t contains special characters

217140
text-editor	editor
it is a fine text-editor with good performance simplicity but pretty much all the features expected of a capable editor

217145
linked-list	arrays
aside from the syntax issues it seems strange to me to use an arrays and a linked-list to represent a matrix

217145
linked-list	arrays
to be able to access arbitrary cells of the matrix you would probably want an actual arrays or at least an arrayslist to hold the rows as linked-list must traverse the whole list from the first element to any particular element an o n operation as opposed to the much quicker o 1 with arrayslist or an actual arrays

217156
any	set
if this is a question of set map list it won t make any difference

217161
json	xml
you could use ado.net data services to share your data with either json for javascript clients or xml for desktop applications

217190
revision	svn
i have a revision that has been committed to svn trunk which i would like to roll back

217192
revision	updates
you could always go back to this particular revision by using updates to revision... or by using the aforementioned shortcuts

217208
bash	glob
the full available ext ended glob bing operators are excerpt from man bash

217221
getchar	getc
if you read plauger s the standard c library 1992 you will see that the header is allowed to provide getchar and getc as function-like macros with special permission for getc to evaluate its file pointers arguments more than once

217221
getchar	getc
however even if it provides macros the implementation is also obliged to provid actual functions that do the same job primarily so that you can access a function-pointers called getchar or getc and pass that to other functions

217230
postgresql	ingres
my engine works on postgres aka postgresql ingres db2 informix sybase and oracle - oh and ants

217230
sql-server	mysql
unfortunately for you mysql and sql-server are not on the list at the time neither was considered a serious rdbms - but times do change

217230
postgresql	ingres
oracle varchar x sybase text db2 long varchar informix lvarchar postgresql varchar x ants varchar x ingres varchar x y

217267
perl	awk
in the finest of traditions i will answer your awk question with a perl program

217268
extern-c	dlopen
in straight unix c use dlopen in c++ use extern-c which limits what you can do and dlopen

217269
any	set
if the target 8-bit character set doesn t include the characters needed any characters not representable in the target character set get converted to question marks

217273
any	set
if the target 8-bit character set doesn t include the characters needed any characters not representable in the target character set get converted to question marks

217284
hash	md5
otherwise simply taking the first 8-10 characters of the guid or sha1 md5 hash of the guid is probably your best bet

217292
kate	kde
and by extension any other kde program that uses kate as an embedded kpart kwrite quanta+ kdevelop

217304
click	mouse
detecting mouse click in windows using python

217311
lightbox	jquery
look at this lightbox clone list i personally like the jquery lightbox plugin .

217317
postgresql	mysql
long experience with java and databases an example post postgresql mysql oracle differences has taught me that the jdbc drivers we use in doing this work frequently have problems

217348
32-bit	64bit
i have written portable replacement for time.h currently just localtime gmtime mktime and timegm which uses 64bit time even on 32-bit machines

217348
perl	ruby
it is being used in perl and i intend to fix ruby and python s 2038 problems with it as well

217386
contains	set
the suggestions to use cookies aside the only comprehensive set of identifying attributes available to interrogate are contains in the http request header

217407
xsd	xml
this may not be the case but you will probably find more tools to help you if you have a database backend instead of an xml xsd backend

217407
xsd	xml
option 2 hack the subsonic scaffolding so that it supports your underlying xsd xml instead of a database

217432
any	set
as far as making the csv itself you would just loop through the result set formatting the output and sending it just like you would any other content

217440
reentrantreadwritelock	reentrantlock
jdk 6 even contains information about reentrantlock and reentrantreadwritelock

217463
button	popup
when a fatal crash occurs in my code the crashrpt dialog box popup and when i enter my email address and click the send button it takes me to a save file dialog box where i can save the zipped package and the account specified in the install function never receives an email

217480
assign	add
on the synchronize view the very last button is the change sets button - if you turn that on you can assign your changes to sets that you define right click on a file listed and then add to - new change set

217483
web-services	security
i ve found all web-services security stuff to be confusing and it doesn t help that rampart is poorly documented no good tutorials as you mentioned

217495
bubble-sort	quicksort
one system might be 10 times faster than another so it will run bubble-sort and quicksort on a set of data 10 times faster than the other

217495
bubble-sort	quicksort
so bubble-sort is o n 2 and quicksort is o nlogn in the average case and that holds no matter how fast your hardware is

217495
bubble-sort	quicksort
if you re running bubble-sort on your fast hardware you may find it s faster than quicksort on the slow hardware -- but only up to a point

217495
bubble-sort	quicksort
eventually with a large enough input set the quicksort on the slow hardware is going to be faster than bubble-sort on the fast hardware

217509
webbrowser-control	microsoft.mshtml
you need to use the document.domdocument property of the webbrowser-control and cast this to the ihtmldocument2 interface provided in the microsoft.mshtml interop assembly

217509
javascript	dom
this gives you access to the full dom as is available to javascript actually running in ie

217511
authentication	login
when user will tries to login if we he failed to login n times captcha will be displayed so authentication will be using three parameters username password captcha

217543
groovy	java
i considered most of the choices everyone put up here ruby on rails groovy on grails python django and then the spring mvc framework in java

217543
groovy	java
since i didn t need interoperability with java that ruled out a plus in its favor yes i know jruby is interoperable but groovy still has

217543
debugging	trace
after prototyping something in groovy i noticed that the stack trace were not always enlightening for debugging and the performance was slow compared to my ruby-on-rails prototype

217543
ruby-on-rails	django
thought about using python django but i noticed that it would be more difficult to bring others on board since the sheer volume of books in ruby-on-rails python django

217543
ruby-on-rails	django
perhaps i could have given python django further consideration but it was time to make a decision and i choose ruby-on-rails

217545
parentheses	operators
parentheses should only be used when they serve some purpose such as overriding the precedence of certain operators

217563
bootloader	driver
keyboard debouncing routine keyboard driver disk driver video driver filesystems and finally a bootloader - and that s just to launch it for the first time with nothing to do

217598
host	root
update in a virtual host situation you might also like to concatenate the ip with the document root path like so

217600
postgresql	ingres
i did some work on this back when i was a researcher under michael stonebraker - you know the professor who came up with ingres postgresql etc

217604
perl	php
i did it in php not perl

217619
any	set
in your example above the dynamic entity does not have any properties set on it

217624
mapping	unique
or if the mapping is unique just simply

217649
checkbox	button
for example push button and checkbox use the class name button the edit control edit etc

217653
silverlight	wpf
in .net winforms wpf silverlight you just need to use the dispatcher object on the thread of the ui to call the update method for the user interface

217657
.net	wcf
as of .net 3.5 sp1 they should also be usable as paramater and return types in wcf service methods without any additional code

217659
implements	extends
i m working on a custom cms for my own use and was thinking about implements a plugins system so i could extends the code a little easier

217667
worksheet	excel
experienced excel users may notice that if this formula was entered in a worksheet cell it would have to be entered as an arrays formula to give the correct value

217672
inherited	subclass
since your containers is a list but with some other things i would inherited from list and add your additional properties to your subclass

217683
kate	vim
in bash and vim i use lucida typewriter but in kate scintilla eclipse and netbeans i currently use lucida casual a proportional font

217705
configuration	environment
if you find you still have a hard time being able to uniquely identify what server you are on you can give it a little bit of a push. in my situation i have a small configuration file which is unique to each server basically setting a php variables defining which environment i m running in development or production . this way you only need to maintain one small easy to recreate file outside of your source control

217711
javascript	dom
these scripts act like being part of the current page accessing global javascript variables and functions dom objects etc

217729
any	set
from the ec2 documentation we have if you re using openssh or any reasonably paranoid ssh client then you ll probably need to set the permissions of this file so that it s only readable by you. the panda documentation you link to links to amazon s documentation but really doesn t convey how important it all is

217731
protected-mode	real-mode
no one has been able to tell me if since my code was launchd from grub i m running in real-mode or protected-mode at the moment

217748
linux	osx
i ve had similar issues from both osx and linux

217784
forwarding	port
i want to add the option of automatic port forwarding nat traversal to an application

217784
forwarding	port
i need to be able to test this port forwarding feature while developing it

217785
protected	public
what if i change my mind and want to see the public protected private stuff separated out into grouping first and then grouping by member kind

217829
webforms	asp.net
in asp.net webforms we used response.flush

217846
backwards-compatibility	legacy
there s always a chance that legacy code that s left in the language for backwards-compatibility s sake will be removed in a future versioning

217873
value	field
if a date and a time value are stored together in a single data field then iso 8601 suggests that they should be separated by a latin capital letter t as in 19951231t235959

217897
perl	awk
even sticking a perl or shell wrapper around your awk script i think there s still going to be a race condition

217897
file-descriptor	dev-null
the only answer i can think of is to use ld_preload to replace the system open call for awk so that if the file is missing a read file-descriptor on dev-null is opened instead

217904
iteration	elements
according to the sgi documentation about hash containers invalidation does not occur for non-erased elements nor even for resizing there is no word on whether insertions cause resizing so to be careful i admit that as a possibility ---but in the latter case the iteration order will be changed

217909
openoffice.org	uno
initially we used ms office but recently we switched to use openoffice.org uno since it offers better control than ms office and is easier to work with

217918
linux	unix
you could also try setting up a linux unix firwall with igd activated

217944
selected	button
the fields exported are those shown in the defects grid which can be customized using the selected columns button looks like a green grid

217951
chdir	cmd
for example using processexplorer selected cmd.exe right click properties image tab current directory relects the directory set using the cd or chdir cmd

217958
any	set
while traditional processes gives you a set of rules that impedance any creative behavior

217966
mouseover	mouseout
jquery also has an alternative syntax for doing mouseover mouseout stuff called hover

217975
db2-connect	ibm
technically it is possible to work a connection with db2-connect but ibm has made it a priorietary node and prevented other parties from legally establishing the correct drda sequences to connect to it

217993
binaryreader	writer
there are similar equivalents for binaryreader writer

217998
font-size	width
if textbox contents were returned with line-breaks representing where word-wrapping occurs that result will be dependant on style font-size width of the textbox etc. rather than what the user actually entered

218003
boost	stl
i was wondering if there is a native c++ or stl boost function which will search a cstring for a specified string

218004
udp	tcp
typically for tcp udp comms you always convert data to network byte order using the htons function and ntohs and their related functions

218013
boost	stl
it s not stl or boost but since you have two cstring s it seems the most reasonable method to use

218027
debugging	exit
when debugging a trick i do whenever i want to exit the current method without running of its any statements i move the current execution pointer to the end of the method then click f10 11

218031
keyboard	mouse
so as others pointed out you will have to talk to the 8042-compatible keyboard mouse controllers directly

218031
keyboard	mouse
unless it s a usb keyboard mouse and 8042 emulation is disabled where you would need a usb stack but you can use the boot protocol for the keyboard mouse which is simpler

218051
registration	login
i just need a login system something that manages the username password stuff and user registration

218063
perl	c++
it is cross-platform and has libraries for all the major development platforms php python perl ruby .net java c++

218067
enumerator	any
does anybody have any experience in further tweaking the xjc compilation to a more useful enumerator with a getvalue methods instead of a value methods

218083
benchmarking	profiling
jxinsight s probes technology is also the only one that could even run in production considering that we out perform netbeans profiling by 20x and yourkit 100x in specjvm2008 benchmarking

218132
samba	svn
we run an ldap tree with auth credentials in it and this is used by all our internal systems - including trac svn samba openvpn etc

218162
document	element
with a simple test case i get a validation error of document type does not allow element style here

218162
document	element
this is with an empty xhtml strict document with a style element inside a noscript element

218177
instances	self
as we can c.a was replaced by fun2 in inst instances self didn t change

218184
put	get
i answer to my own question thanks to philho who put me on the right track an article from codeproject with the right algorithm to get a windows icon wether it s java or not

218189
revision	ignore
is there any way to set the eclipse diff to ignore the cvs tags like author revision and so on

218244
put	get
you ll also get this error if you try and add a datasource and your project doesn t have any datasources in the project s root if you ve put all your datasource classes in a subfolder

218296
any	set
it reverts to any previous value once you quit up past the level it was set in

218326
hide	show
you may have to tweak the code and hide show the rectangle but basically this is it

218361
contains	set
i think that if your client is set to a different regional setting than the db collation the character arrays containsing the selected statement that gets sent to oracle would contains incorrect bytes where the original funky characters were located - oracle would interpret these as some character other than the one you originally sent causing the row to not be found

218372
python	ruby
beautiful soup and hpricot are the canonical versions for python and ruby respectively

218398
icomparable	equals
i used icomparable originally because i needed to sort them on certain criteria but overriding equals worked perfectly for contains

218412
host	dns
to avoid overloading a load-balancer host itself use round-robin dns or

218430
silverlight	wpf
and the scaffolding part is probably going to be introduced to other parts of the .net - like wpf and silverlight - so this technology is something one should know

218435
gethashcode	equals
also remember if you are going to override equals that you need to also override gethashcode as well

218438
postgresql	mysql
i would look into mysql and or postgresql

218441
value	field
bear in mind that while taking the value for comparison inside your handler code you might get into an infinite loop you call the property accessor which calls the aop handler which calls the accessor and so on so you might need to reflect into the class contains this property to attain the backing field

218476
scrollable	panels
since i m currently on the road i cannot try this but have you tried playing around with cancontentscroll and or wrapping the scrollable content into a panels as suggested by the scrollviewer overview on msdn

218488
boost	stl
boost or stl tr1 from vs9 with featurepack are also possible

218488
any	set
since a map or set only allows me to find exact matches i don t get any further using one of these

218490
ifconfig	linux
on linux ip from the iproute2 package behaves more predictably and gives easier-to-parse output than ifconfig route

218495
rollback	commit

218503
postback	ajax
but when you use ajax does anyone know if the entire page object is created at the server on postback

218510
primitive	int
consider the following code where you declare a variables of primitive type int

218540
hide	show
in card layout you can add multiple panelss in the same place but then show or hide one panels at a time

218541
version-control	cvs
it s not really in vogue anymore but i ve had great success using cvs for version-control

218544
linux	unix
linux isn t unix stupid open group and most real unix boxes don t have anywhere close to the software that linux does

218544
solaris	aix
it s great to have the newer tools in your toolbox but if you don t know the old school way then you re going to be in a world of hurt if you re ever on a aix solaris hp-ux etc system which doesn t have the newer tools and may not even have bash

218544
solaris	aix
and i do as much work as possible on our linux centos 5 system simply because the tools on it are still newer than anything i can find readily packaged for aix solaris is somewhat better

218558
hash	md5
the function hash can be any hash function for example the function md5 from digest md5

218561

a colleague would like to query a table in an oracle using sql-server 2000 enterprise manager

218563
clistctrl	cdialog
i have an mfc clistctrl in a cdialog and i need to add to the clistctrl the tap and hold behavior

218563
click	mouse
if the user clicks a standard click with the left button of the mouse on a clistctrl item then function a will be called

218563
click	mouse
if the user click on a clistctrl item and keep pressed down the left button of the mouse for more than one second then function b will be called

218568
xsd	xml
if you specify a xsd in your xml vs8 even gives you intellisense

218579
highlight	selected
the few objects that can reasonably have different actions for single and double click generally are ok to run the single click action before the double click action highlight then open a folder enter focus on an address bar before selected it etc. the only way to determine would probably be to wait on the single click for an amount of time and cancel the action for the single click if a double click is detected

218587
display	height
therefore your inner listbox thinks it can avoid scrolling by taking up the complete height necessary to display all its elements

218588
selected	button
to use the feature selected your entire implementation block then press the button in the gutter that has two pencils linked by a line...then press tab until you get the first one you want to edit...when you change its name it will change globally in the rest of your source file

218594
sql-server	oracle
- never used oracle actually so not sure if the dbo bit will be correct or if this is only a sql-server thing

218625
ironpython	cpython
these are implementation details of cpython so this probably does not work in other implementations of python such as ironpython and jython

218640
moss	wss
take a look at troubleshooting spsite spweb leaks in wss v3 and moss 2007

218647
perl	c++
languages heavy on symbols like c c++ c# perl etc. look too different for me

218677
document	editing
but in this case you re not editing any document just loading it up long enough to print

218687
output	mode
you re doing the right thing but i seem to recall that djgpp only generates protected mode output which you can t call interrupts from

218699
jquery	dojo
an interesting comment in another thread compares jquery dojo prototype mootools sproutcore and cappuccino the question was removed

218703
linguistics	nlp
i d start off by getting at least a masters in linguistics and then work towards my phd in computer science concentrating on nlp

218706
exception-handling	try-catch
as long as you catch very specific exception-handling just do the try-catch

218709
arguments	default
the other results are the name of the arguments and kwarguments variables and the default provided

218713
arguments	default
the arguments that if the compiler can provide a default copy-constructor it should be able to provide a similar default makes a certain amount of sense

218713
constructor	private
for my own purposes in my ide the snippet i use for new classes contains declarations for a private assignment operator and copy constructor so that when i gen up a new class i get no default assignment and copy operations - i have to explicitly remove the declaration of those operations from the private section if i want the compiler to be able to generate them for me

218717
python	perl
i m looking for an open-source pastebin web-application written in either python or perl

218744
constructor	private
what are good reasons to prohibit inheritance in java for example by using final classes or classes using a single private parameterless constructor

218759
constructor	object
methods called in constructor are often declared final so you don t get any unpleasant surprises when creating object

218766
json	xml
it converts between normal expressions and editableexpressions which are mutable and fully serializable so can be used with json xml binary etc

218779
margins	padding
you must specifically set margins and padding if you want a similar look across browsers as firefox and ie use different defaults for display bullets

218781
exception-handling	try-catch
and what sort of overhead would be involved in adding try-catch throws everywhere if no exception-handling occurs should you avoid try-catches in tight loops

218794
jquery	.post
i have a form that uses jquery to submit an ajax .post and it serializes the form that is sent up

218817
promise	future
future promise and packaged tasks to simplify passing data between threads and waiting for a value to be ready

218836
constructor	object
check for constructor property on the object

218855
hash	md5
assembly version is the intended mechanism for this but you could roll your own by comparing an md5 hash of the gac assembly with the md5 of your latest version

218885
reflection	runtime
what impact will this have when using databinding technologies that don t bind against a specific type but use reflection at runtime to pull out values

218903
click	mouse
there is nothing worse that going to a new site and moving the mouse all over the page trying to figure out what should be click on

218911
grouping	sorting
does anyone know of a good extension to tablesorter or specific configuration that enables tablesorter to keep child rows grouping together with the parent row even after sorting

218924
arrays	loops
a better way to do it would be to loops through the arrays beforehand

218929
exception-handling	try-catch
regarding your question on performance i think its not a propblem to have many try-catch blocks in your code but you will get performance hits when your code raises and catches many exception-handling

218959
typedef	struct
i only had to change the first typedef to a struct

218962
any	set
see examples of file i o and just replace any outfile.write ... lines with responsestream.write ... and you should be set to go

218969
order	join
if i remove the join and just try to order the records in the preferredspacer table which contains the unittypeid field i get my expected results so i must assume the join has something to do with it

218980
constructor	object
an alternate and cleaner way is to breakpoint in the constructor of the object you re throwing

218983
web-config	app-config
basically you can put a few settings in the web-config or app-config to tell your app sharepoint in this case to use a specific version number

218988
contains	set
the task once created contains only the built-in field values i have set

218989
32-bit	64bit
we have inherited an ant build file but now need to deploy to both 32-bit and 64bit systems

219003
windows-vista	windows
on windows-vista ms added some api calls to allow you to query the status of the windows security centre which should tell you if a v software is installed

219026
semantics	keyword
first of all definition of foo.tostring does not define an override for object.tostring but a new one and should be prefixed with new keyword to prevent misunderstanding of semantics

219050
32-bit	64bit
assuming you are using ant for building java application why would you need to know if it is a 32-bit arch or 64bit

219055
callback	methods
the javascript all runs fine and the callback methods gets an object back not an error object

219063
.when	ready
i was a little naive back then .when i did this project and jumped into the deep end before i was ready so any performance issues are likely down to me not the software

219069
xsd	xml
validate an xml string against an xsd schema

219110
webserver	host
but i just don t understand how it all fits together especially when my webserver is given apache running at a host s machine and not something i can really play with except defining .htaccess commands

219110
cherrypy	web.py
what do i need to know install and do if i want to run a web framework say web.py or cherrypy on my basic cgi configuration

219115
order	join
also the order by does work if i am performing it only on the preferredspacer table which is the one that contains the unittypeid field it s only when i do the join that it falls apart

219116
versioning	upgrade
i would still say upgrade from vb6 directly to .net 3.5 actually .net 3.5 sp1 and vs2008 as long as your client operating systems support that versioning of the framework otherwise you will need to choose the lowest common framework versioning which very well may be .net 2.0

219120
protected-mode	real-mode
my kernel is running in protected-mode right now so i can t use the real-mode keyboard routines without jumping into real-mode and back which i m trying to avoid

219131
put	get
it s pretty painless if you get past the put the certificate in the store and give the correct user access to it part

219139
boost	stl
does the stl or boost already have such an adapter class

219140
value	field
i just want to modify the value of the field that without changing what the user typed in

219154
keyboard	mouse
in particular check out adam chapweske s resources on keyboard and mouse programming

219156
versioning	staging
typically a number of different scripting are chained in one monolithic build that has separate targets staging build a staging versioning like build build just build the stuff integration build the stuff and run the integration-testing

219157
buffering	streaming
note that output popen streaming are fully buffering by default

219182
32-bit	16-bit
in case you are not used to it you talk with components at i o ports via the in read and out write opcodes which receive the i o port number a 16-bit value and the value to be read or written either 8 16 or 32-bit

219198
border-layout	gridbaglayout
i explored using gridlayout border-layout and gridbaglayout and i believe that any extra vertical spaces that is present in your application is due to the sizing of the jcheckbox component not related to the layout manager

219229
sql-server	oracle
you would not need any tools other than the database itself and whatever ui is used to interact with the data sql-server management studio for sql-server toad or sqldeveloper for oracle etc.

219231
put	get
i hope once you put this data in db after that all you will get delta of information not 25 gb of flat file

219264
.when	ready
.when variant 2.0 is ready to go to production we merge it with whatever is on the main branch in this case 1.1 and that becomes the new main trunk

219284
versioning	downgrade
maybe you should downgrade to 2.5 versioning

219305
versioning	upgrade
that is if i link against versioning 4.3.2.100 my program should still work if the user upgrade bigcorp s app so that the .dll is versioning 4.3.3.20

219305
installation	upgrade
continuing my previous example my build machine has version 4.3.3.20 installed but i want the .dll it generates to be compatible with installation that haven t upgrade and only have version 4.3.2.100 installed

219306
sql-server	mysql
for example auto_increment in mysql or identity in microsoft sql-server

219311
postgresql	oracle
for your database server you will want something that is fast microsoft sql server ibm s db2 postgresql or oracle

219311
sftp	ftp
these are computer programs that generate statistics from webserver log files some can analyze also ftp sftp and mail server log files

219324
project-management	project
i ve found that on our project 2-3 developers a wiki works just as well for project-management

219328
groovy	java
with the exception of anonymous inner classes groovy is a pure superset of java which means that you can write java code call it groovy and be done with it

219335
installation	upgrade
update april 12th 2010 with the release of team foundation server 2010 the installation and upgrade procedures have improved a lot

219373
put	get
if you put the values in the .resx file by default they get compiled into your assembly or a satellite resource assembly

219382
32-bit	64bit
we no longer believe this is a 64bit vs 32-bit problem

219382
32-bit	64bit
works fine on 32-bit front end but we get the following error on the 64bit front end

219411
deployment	install
is the application install on the citrix server and then simply made available to users or do i need to do further development to make it ready for this type of deployment

219412
user-controls	ascx
you should convert aspx files which contain html server- and or html-controls to user-controls ascx files

219415
web-applications	webserver
in the context of web-applications some webserver eg

219426
oracle	mysql
most rdbms systems oracle sql server mysql etc are much more efficient at performing work on large sets of data not single operations repeated multiple times

219436
versioning	migrate
rake db migrate versioning 1 gives me a error already

219453
linux	osx
there are compilers that target darwin osx from linux but you won t get any of the cocoa or foundation libs with that approach

219456
32-bit	64bit
word on the street is you can t mix 32-bit and 64bit servers on the same farm with the exception-handling of the database server

219456
32-bit	64bit
you can deploy an office sharepoint server 2007 farm on a mix of 32-bit and 64bit servers provided that you maintain architecture homogeneity at each topology layer

219456
32-bit	64bit
for example you should not mix 32-bit and 64bit web front-end wfe servers but you may use 64bit database servers in a farm with 32-bit wfe servers and application servers

219456
32-bit	64bit
so you can mix 64bit and 32-bit but apparently not 32-bit and 64bit wfes

219457
triggers	insert
encryption using built in encryption functions views to decrypt for presentation and base tables with triggers to encrypt on insert update

219493
primitive	int
classes and objects are different from each other in the exact same way that the primitive data type int is different from the literal value 3

219493
any	set
it just says that any class that implements the interface must have that interface s set of public methods

219497
javascript	dom
webcams aren t available to html or javascript dom in any browsers that i know of so you re going to end up dependent on some sort of plugin

219506
selenium-ide	selenium
the biggest hurdle in testing extjs with selenium is that extjs doesn t render standard html elements and the selenium-ide will naively and rightfully generate commands targeted at elements that just act as decor -- superfluous elements that help extjs with the whole desktop-look-and-feel

219506
selenium-ide	selenium
when generating selenium test cases by recording user actions with selenium-ide on firefox selenium will base the recorded actions on the ids of the html elements

219506
keyboard	mouse
some elements require more than simple mouse keyboard interactions due to the complex rendering carried out by extjs

219506
document	element
for example a ext.form.combbox is not really a element but a text input with a detached drop-down list that s somewhere at the bottom of the document tree

219506
hide	show
note that the display none check is necessary because once an error field is show and then it needs to be hidden extjs will simply hide error field instead of entirely removing it from the dom tree

219506
selected	button
selected the button by its caption

219506
selected	button
selected the button by its id

219513
revision	svn
more specifically you can use svn blame with some arguments to look at specific revision

219522
return-value	arguments
the specification for a return-value or an arguments can also be part of the contract

219541
filtering	grouping
instead of a factory that returns a grouping object consider filtering adding some filtering objects that require less granular configuration

219557
unique	words
use a key spaces of at least 2 50 so in other words allow 2 50 possible unique value and you ll have barely any collisions in your entire dataset -- and anyone brute forcing your keys will have about even odds of getting a key if they try 2 25 of them

219563
callback	methods
it adds a methods to ar that lets you skip certain callback for a given block

219572
silverlight	wpf
whenever i dig just under the skin of any xml backed declarative technology such as silverlight and wpf asp.net or msbuild it seems i end up editing a lot of raw xml text

219575
common-lisp	lisp
such a thing doesn t exist in common-lisp although it does in some lisp dialects like pico lisp as far as i understand

219599
implements	super
then in 6 months when your app is super famous and getting dugg and slashdotted and you decide you need more than a single connection all you have to do is implements some pooling in the getconnection methods

219620
binary	hex
in terms of representing arbitrary binary data as text base64 is more efficient than plain hex

219628
put	get
but the put and get functions require a default value and i do not want to spread default values all over the source files

219668
integrated	activation
i m looking for best practices to integrated log4net to sharepoint for web request feature activation and all timer stuff

219700
minify	assets
gzip compression is good but you shouldn t serve gzipped assets to ie 6 so you might also want to minify compress your javascript

219702
any	set
this would give you a set location for the configuration and any changes to it can be released in a controlled manner no need for manual editm just roll back and re-install the solution

219706
directory	folder
so if you deploy the main jar into some directory and then put the dependent jars into a lib folder beneath that the manifest looks like

219720
extends	sealed
as long as its not sealed you should be able to extends it

219729
cairngorm	flexunit
if you re already using an asp.net-mvc framework like cairngorm or pureasp.net-mvc flexunit should integrated pretty painlessly

219756
worksheet	excel
i have an excel worksheet with an image logo

219756
selected	checkbox
if i right-click on the picture and selected format picture protection the locked checkbox is checked

219801
contains	elements
each elements of the input class path contains a

219857
properties-file	jar
we also store it in a properties-file that is built into our jar so the application can read it

219860
assign	add
you could put a hidden-field on your masterpage generate a key during the page_load event of your master page assign the key as the value of your hidden-field and then add that value to your cookie

219875
account	api
i have a c dll that i am using for special installation behavior but i can t figure out how to use the windows api to verify an account s credentials

219887
base-class	inherited
if all of your inner helper classes need access to some of the same methods consider putting them in a base-class so they can be shared via inherited

219922
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
either autoresetevent or manualresetevent

219922
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
the difference between the two is that autoresetevent lets one thread proceed each time it is set while manualresetevent release all waiting threads on set

219925
python	tcl
there are interfaces for c++ python java and tcl

219929
getter	setter
having a setter and getter isn t really any better than having a variables at that level of visibility

219929
protected	public
therefore you could just make the variables itself protected and the reader public

219929
getter	setter
that said setter and getter are an indicator of bad oo--are you sure you need them

219930
any	set
the learning curve is a bit steep but once you set up your schema you will be able to do any kind of cross-cutting queries that you want very quickly

219952
jquery	dojo
for e.g you can use jquery or dojo as your ajax toolkit if you are writing web applications and you want to set some ajax functionality it will take time to build those things by your hand

219990
python	ruby
there is a bit of a learning curve but tools like pamie python or watir ruby will let you latch into the ie web browser and get at the elements

219992
attributes	properties
this can be configured in odbc data sources in odbc connection attributes or ole db connection properties

219992
any	set
and the set statement takes effect before any statements are executed

220003
credentials	ntlm
if using ntlm then you may need to also configure an sso application so that the right credentials can be passed to the webservice or any other data source for that matter

220006
subset	unique
while your guid is statistically unique by taking any subset you decrease randomness and increase the chance of collisions

220010
dependency-injection	inject
i could institute some type of dependency-injection but where would all these variables that i would inject reside

220026
actionscript	mxml
i am attempting to import mxml files that i developed with emacs into a new project in flexbuilder...i have created a project and manually added all my mxml and actionscript files into flexbuilder

220031
value	field
a single table with the applicationid moduleid and key as a primary key with a value field

220062
low-level	hardware
one use is in low-level device driver or embedded code where you need to reference a specific address that s mapped to an input output device like a hardware pin

220073
selected	checkbox
asp.net-mvc maps the guid values of the selected checkbox into the parameter for you and even parsing the strings from the request.form collection into instantied guid objects which i think is rather nice

220075
environment	building
that being said i m trying to set up a cc.net environment to educate myself but i m having trouble finding the information i need to get the automated building portion set up

220075
environment	building
there s a lot going on in here that i m not sure i really need in an automated building environment

220075
cruisecontrol.net	mbunit
so a few questions for the cruisecontrol.net folks the msbuild folks and the mbunit folks

220075
cruisecontrol.net	mbunit
should mbunit tests be part of the msbuild file or the cruisecontrol.net file

220087
url-scheme	mailto
if you plan on putting the app in the app-store you re limited to the standard mailto links as specified in the iphone url-scheme reference

220087
mime	rfc
however even if the above methods did work the rfc still leaves it open to the email client to choose to ignore or otherwise modify dangerous headers within the link - so even if you were able to construct a valid mailto url with a mime body and the proper headers mail.app may still choose to ignore the attachment related parts of your message

220089
solaris	linux
glassfish should work well in windows solaris and linux

220108
webserver	nginx
if not i recommend trying nginx another lightweight webserver that runs php in a separate process via fastcgi

220153
quicksort	big-o
if your dataset is small enough that the constant portion of big-o sorting on quicksort is going to override timesavings from bubble sort the sort will be so fast you shouldn t even waste time asking the question

220164
xquery	xslt
i think i heard all those limitations were adressed in the xslt 2.0 specification sadly ms decided not to implement it and promote xquery instead

220177
python	perl
when you need to do more than the simple example most people either switch to a more modern build system like ant or roll their own in perl python etc

220179
cruisecontrol.net	mbunit
however whatever route you decide to go i d still recommend to not add the mbunit as part of your build step but add it as a separate step in cruisecontrol.net

220188
javascript	dom
according to spec only the body and frameset elements provide an onload event to attach to but i would like to know when a dynamically-created dom element has been added to the dom in javascript

220204
protected	public
variables aren t subclassed at all they don t go into the dispatch table but public or protected variables can be hidden by local-variables

220204
pointers	stack
variables pointers allocations for methods parameters and local variabless are done on stack but even though the variables pointers is created on stack the objects they point to are still never allocated on stack

220226
any	set
hence the volatile value of a timestamp column cannot be set and is subject to change upon any modifaction to the row

220229
ruby	php
i m looking for ruby s active record for php

220229
any	set
i should get default getters and setters without writing any code but overriding a default getter or setter is as easy as declaring get fieldname or set fieldname functions with the behavior i want

220233
value	field
some of these properties reflect http-headers directly navigator.useragent is set to the value of the http user-agent header field

220253
enterprise	licensing
edit as of 2008 2009 under the sap enterprise licensing agreement repaired objects may still be supported by sap

220257
firefox	opera
both safari 3.1 and firefox 3.1 well the current alpha and possibly opera 9.6 support true type font ttf embedding and at least safari supports svg fonts through the same mechanism

220268
conditional	operators
the relevant section of the c# 3.0 spec is 7.13 the conditional operators

220268
conditional	operators
operators control the type of the conditional expression

220279
hosts-file	hosts
perhaps editing the hosts of the remote machine and redirecting localhost to the cassini machine could trick it

220293
markup	xhtml
flash air make heavy use of xml for functionality but they are targeted to an environment where parsing xml-ish markup if not xml itself then html or xhtml is a core part of every application

220300
conditional	operators
both expression in the conditional operators

220310
codeigniter	kohana
both codeigniter and its php5 only fork kohana contain implementations of the activerecord pattern

220319
private-members	private
since the java bytecode verifier does not allow access to private-members it generates synthetic accessor methods for each private field which you use

220334
handler	service
you could implement a global exception handler in your web service that logs the details of any exceptions that occur

220334
handler	service
to implement an exception handler for a .net web service you need to create a soap extension

220352
carbon	cocoa
this is carbon only and won t work with cocoa

220362
firefox	opera
the local webserver doesn t care whether you use opera safari firefox ie to connect to it

220390
restart	exit
if you can add a second .exe a console app that uses the servicemanager class then you can kick off the standalone .exe and have it restart the service and then exit

220390
command-line	cmd
on second thought you could probably have the service register a scheduled task using the cmd-line at cmd for example to start the service and then have it stop itself

220391
restart	exit
for instances you could create a detached process to stop the service then restart it then exit

220409
fragmentation	ram
note that the concurrent collector tends to require more ram allocated to the jvm than the serial or parallels collectors for a given workload because some memory fragmentation can occur

220439
decrement	increment
at every x time interval i want the triangle to move in some direction i need help finding this direction x and y increment decrement

220439
cos	sin
i think it has something to do with the old sin and cos methods and the amount angle that the triangle has been rotated but i m a bit rusty on that stuff

220454
any	set
a logout link is relatively harmless but a remote site could set up a number of hidden forms and post them to your site to perform any action possible through post

220456
json	xml
and here s why it is kind of an xml problem no developer who was using json as his product s serialization format would allow himself to think hey i don t need to implement this feature the user can just edit the json.

220459
logout	login
the new asp.net-mvc beta contains an accountcontroller which may be worth looking at as it essentially implements everything from registration to login logout to forgot password functionality

220463
subtract	add
the classical arctangent gives you an angle normalized to -90â r +90â degrees however so you have to add or subtract 90 degrees from the result depending on the sign of the result and the sign of vx

220465
png	ico
i was wondering how i would be able to use a 256x256 png file in the ico file used as the application icon and show it in a picture box on a form

220465
windows-xp	windows
i am not sure if this is even possible in windows-xp and may need windows vista apis

220470
selected	textbox
when the textbox is rendered i have a javascript that allows users to selected values that are then placed in that input box

220482
memset	calloc
because on these systems neither memset nor calloc can clear out a struct that contains pointers correctly

220516
zend-framework	symfony
as a final thought you might consider looking at what the major frameworks out there are doing such as zend-framework symfony and others

220523
contains	set
set this variables to point at a shared library that contains a symbol you d like to override then launch your app

220535
getter	setter
one that no one has mentioned is being forced to write unit tests for classes that are brainless getter and setter

220538
xquery	xslt
saxon is the xslt and xquery parsing --

220538
stax	sax
1 jdk xml-parsing -- dom sax stax

220560
vbscript	vba
is it possible to do this with word vba or vbscript

220574
any	set
any idea of which ones might be easy to set up

220594
realloc	free
consequently realloc has probably free the original memory and then you pass it the same pointers again and it complains that you re freeing the same memory twice because you pass the original value to it again

220597
sql-server	ms-access
we have a app build using ms-access as a back end and i can t wait till we get our new sql-server so i can move everything to that

220605
sql-server	ms-access
sql-server vs ms-access - pay special attention to feature limits

220635
google-maps	gps
look to google-maps for inspiration here-- if you scroll across a map you can always click link to here and it will provide a link that includes the gps coordinates objects on the map etc

220636
value	field
field refid fieldid value

220642
emacs	vim
vim and emacs do not take full advantage of my screen mouse and keyboard

220642
gedit	kate
i ve heard of scite eclipse gedit medit nedit gvim gemacs kate geany gnotepad ozeditor etc

220643
user-interface	drawing
in my app i ve got a thread which displays for some time please wait dialog windows sometimes it is a very tiny amout of time and there is some glitch while drawing user-interface i guess

220643
exception-handling	try-catch
or other try-catch improvments doesn t help me to avoid that thread exception-handling

220663
value	field
or do you only include one field that points to a record in a separate table for those value

220664
kdevelop	kate
also for a more development oriented tool you could try kdevelop whose default editor is kate but you can change for any other editor implements the ktexteditor interface

220680
required	checked
a page with restrict content could set a variables to the required permission that the header scripting looks for and if set calls an auth function that checked the user belongs to a role that permission

220682
triggers	insert
insert sort will work poorly because every out of order item will triggers an insert

220699
put	get
if i put the prog_delegate back in and remove everything else i get the exception-handling back

220710
emacs	vim
vim and emacs do not take full advantage of my screen mouse and keyboard

220734
selected	cells
selected the cells you just copied into column c and format the cells as text

220736
binary-tree	tree
splaysort is an obscure sorting methods based on splay tree a type of adaptive binary-tree

220742
haskell	c++
all i want is a sane environment to work with haskell ghc c++ gcc and the basic tool chain make and what not

220747
any	set
and the catch that i m falling apart on is the need to filtering the set so that the query returns rows only when ab.val is a max for any given a b pair

220750
mergesort	timsort
timsort is an adaptive stable natural mergesort with supernatural performance on many

220756
solaris	linux
supports solaris windows linux

220758
groovy	java
however many people have asked me how to add groovy and or grails to a legacy java jsp web app

220787
object-reference	instances
nothing s worse than chasing down an object-reference not set to an instances of an object message

220800
loading	gif
this shows a loading message while loading put an animated gif in there for typical web 2.0 style

220805
tcp-ip	icmp
the browser uses the tcp-ip protocol to communicate with the server the http requests when you use ping it uses the icmp protocol and seems the server behind a firewall that drops the icmp echo requests

220807
packets	ping
a ping is essentially an echo request packets sent over imcp a protocols

220807
packets	ping
the correct response to a ping is a handily echo response packets

220816
expression	evaluation
expression evaluation like that in flee or dotmath see here and here

220817
hosts-file	hosts
if they are absolute paths you can get away with editing your hosts to point the original domain to your own server and just place the untouched files on your server

220824
double-quotes	single-quotes
i am seeing funny characters in some browsers but not others instead of single-quotes double-quotes and ellipse

220824
firefox	safari
browsers it looks okay in for example firefox for os x safari for os x

220839
pthreads	fork
it is quite easy to fork for exection of another program and redirect that one s stdin out under pthreads provided to you by cygwin i don t know about plain dos windows though

220855
g++	gcc
by default gcc g++ prints a warning message with the line number only

220855
g++	gcc
i am looking for the option by which g++ or gcc associates the build warning messages with the warning ids so that the warning messages can be identified easily without parsing

220856
mstest	nunit
to do anything in nunit or mstest you have to decorate methods with a testfixture or testclass attributes

220866
implements	final
i m already using wxpython just because which bloats up the final exe file pretty easily so preferably whatever i use to implements this video editing functionality shouldn t add to the bloat significantly

220867
xsd	xml
what is the best way to deal with xml documents xsd etc in c# 2.0

220877
xsd	xml
for using xsd you can load xml using an xmlreader and an xmlreader accepts to create an xmlreadersettings

220882
perl	ruby
other than that i would recommend writing a simple python perl ruby etc script to do it pretty simply

220886
tcp-ip	icmp
ping packets as others have stated are a different type of packet than html packets - ping packets are icmp ip while html are tcp-ip

220886
icmp	tcp
all kinds of stuff in between you and the website could choose to block the icmp packets while allowing tcp packets through

220893
document	element
following on the idea of polling i ve read that some element properties are not available until the element has been append to the document for example element.scrolltop maybe you could poll that instead of doing all the dom traversal

220898
selected	cell
i d also like to use vm-m-v model and create viewmodel wrapper for each cell which would have an isselected property binded to cell s isselected property so i could easily iterate over my data source for selected cell s instead of using datagrid s more row oriented api

220899
put	get
you can do joins and sorts in the dbms but if you don t want to put too much pressure on dbms - just get sorted data out of it and merge it using two ssis merge join transforms

220902
python	c++
this python app usues swig to link to c c++ code

220917
variables	boolean
you can use an event-object or a simple boolean variables for this flag

220922
coff	elf
it runs on a number of platforms and supports more than just elf files i believe it also supports coff and a few others

220931
lighttpd	apache
apache lighttpd and many other web servers can also function as reverse proxies

220960
shell	bash
in the emacs shell it s actually emacs doing the auto-completion not bash

220960
shell	bash
if the shell and emacs are out of sync by using pushd popd or some bash user function that changes the shell s current directory then auto-completion stops working

220962
doxygen	latex
also you can use a tool like doxygen to document the interfaces - it will output html pdf latex etc

220977
glassfish	resin
the biggest bonus of using apache in front of glassfish tomcat resin jetty whatever is the versatility it grants you

220981
xsd	xml
if you need to work with xsd documents to validate an xml document you can use this

220981
xsd	xml
validating xml documents against xsd schemas

220981
xsd	xml
validating xml against xsd at each node update 1

220997
xsd	xml
i definately suggest having an xsd for any xml document you work with

220997
xsd	xml
i find that liquid xml studio is a great tool for generating xsd s and it s free

221022
contains	any
the text displayed on them is output in the value attributes of the tag and so cannot contains any styling or html

221024
hashmap	arrays
a preinitialised arrays would be faster than a hashmap

221027
cygwin	gnu
you can tar from any platform even windows if you install cygwin or use the gnu standalone

221065
msbuild	nant
nant together with the nant contrib extensions seems a bit more flexible in handling oss tools like nunit ncover etc while the fact that msbuild can build vs solutions is a big plus for it

221065
msbuild	nant
i found the easiest way to create build scripting is to use both nant to call the different parts of the build build fxcop test coverage etc and msbuild to do the actual building

221065
mbunit	nunit
i found light weight xunit.net mbunit or nunit to be far better suited for unit-testing

221066
msbuild	nant
msbuild vs nant is slightly different as msbuild is bundled with either the framework or the sdk i can t remember which now - but i think nant is a more pleasant environment to work in

221066
msbuild	nant
msbuild is clearly better for doing the raw build the solution bit - but you can invoke it from nant

221096
command-line	cmd
for a simpler solution you may prefer to download the sp library - or - on which the w3 validator is based then invoke the cmd nsgmls from the cmd-line

221116
font-size	width
and em would probably be a better unit to make the required width dependent on the font-size in the button

221126
interop	tlbimp
create a com interop dll with tlbimp

221141
protected	public
the approach i take is to check arguments and throw exception-handling on publicly visible members - any by publicly visible i mean outside assembly boundaries so any public protected or protected internal methods on a public class

221165
hash	md5
using these guids as the primary key for the object seems a reasonable idea and i ve followed delicious and connotea in using the md5 hash of the guid

221165
hash	md5
you ll see the md5 hash in your browser status bar if you mouse over the edit or delete button in a delicious or connotea book mark

221165
hash	md5
where e4a42d992025b928a586b8bdc36ad38d ais the md5 hash of

221165
hash	md5
for me an advantage of this approach as opposed to using an auto incrementing primary key generated by the database itself is that i have to do a lot of links between objects and by using md5 hash i can store these links externally in a file say as the result of data mining scraping then import them in bulk into the database

221165
hash	md5
in the same way if the database has to be rebuilt from scratch the urls to the objects won t change because they use the md5 hash

221166
digits	base
use base 2 32 and print 8 hex digits at a time

221179
differential-equations	ode
ordinary differential-equations and ode solvers

221191
jmock	junit
most of my testing is done using junit and jmock

221197
exception-handling	try-catch
or you could wrap the double.parse example in a try-catch block and set myfloat to a value of your choosing when an exception-handling is detected

221200
python	c++
i ve downloaded python2.6 and vs c++ express edition 2008 and the problem with the msvcr80.dll is gone i assume because python and vsc++2008xe use msvscr90.dll

221249
hash	md5
multiple strings can produce the same md5 hash

221256
export	report
however when the report is exported it does not triggers the on activate event and the first page of the export is in one of two formats

221267
python	perl
a python or perl solution would be preferred but any solution would be a help

221273
json	xml
i d rather not have a proliferation of web services or helper pages returning xml json so if there s a way to use client callbacks or page methods can t you tell i m not particularly familiar with either - buzzword bingo

221275
xsd	xml
i use xerces for xml parsing dom and validation against xsd

221287
callback	methods
i ve noticed that when you create a web service object inheriting from soaphttpclientprotocol and you use the async methods it makes the callback on the windows gui thread

221292
export	report
when export a report from my application crystal-reports sometimes freezes

221298
malloc	free
you should not free the memory as you didn t malloc it yourself

221307
javascript	dom
i ve been scanning through all the popular javascript libraries but i can t find one that has a width function for a dom element that actually accounts for quirks mode in internet explorer

221319
midl	idl
selected properties on the idl file then configuration properties midl output

221324
dijkstra	a-star
the most commonly used algorithm for this problem is a a-star which is a generalized dijkstra s algorithm search with added heuristics - the purpose of the heuristics is to direct the search towards the search goal so that typical searches finish faster

221337
keydown	keyup
for all your keydown keyup keyboard needs use the jquery hotkeys plugins

221345
hash	md5
final solution including an md5 hash of the image for later comparison

221347
microsoft-dynamics	dynamics-crm
the customer data for this app is being moved into microsoft-dynamics-crm 4.0 and i need to modify the asp site s authentication to look up user credentials in dynamics-crm instead

221367
parentheses	operators
the main reason of the existents of the arrow operators is that it shortens the typing of a very common task and it also kind of easy to forgot the parentheses around the dereferencing of the pointer

221385
jeditable	jquery
has anyone gotten the jquery plugin jeditable to run properly in a rails applications

221390
continuous-integration	build-process
if you re using continuous-integration and it s definitely a good idea to be then your build-process should be kicking out an artifact war file each time you make changes in source code

221392
click	mouse
if someone wants my attention while i ve got headphones on far easier to press a couple of button than click the mouse on a button that s about five pixels wide

221395
arrays	loops
to solve this issue i needed to loops through the entire arrays and found closest values

221396
order	add
its an order system you type in how much of each item you want hit submit and it should add the order to the table

221413
jmagick	rmagick
if you need to go further the simple gradient imagick and one of its wrappers like rmagick or jmagick for java could be useful

221434
google-chrome	firefox
until recently i had this working fine in firefox 2 3 ie5 6 and google-chrome

221464
any	set
aside from the server just set up exim or postfix and a web interface to send newsletters from and do this on a server with an ip-address that is different from your own personal mail server maybe even a different network you will want to get your terms and conditions of use nice and tight so that you can remove access to the systems from any customer that has complaints made about emailing

221483
gethashcode	tostring
there are four public methods defined equals gethashcode gettype and tostring

221497
hardware	monitor
as for all performance questions are always dependent on your actual hardware and workload an can only definitely answered by local benchmarking system monitor

221523
button	slide
i ve put a uisearchbar in interface builder and hide it behind a view when user click a button it calls the following code which i hoped it would bring the search bar to the front and slide the keyboard to view

221545
expression	brackets
in a brackets expression

221545
perl	awk
those in perl and awk

221589
python	java
dont waste time in java go for python ruby or erlang

221592
specifications	w3c
does anyone know whether the iphone supports or will soon support the w3c geolocation specifications

221611
annotations	mapping
what annotations would you use for the mapping temporal

221612
duplicates	lookup
i personally favour this syntax which uses the explicit isdbnull methods exposed by idatarecord and caches the column index to avoid a duplicates string lookup

221626
environment	building
one other thing in an intranet environment you will generally have a standard client building meaning that you can code to a specific browser versioning ha ie6 normally

221636
contains	elements
it should give you log n time for testing and removing an elements if it is already contains in the cache and constant time for re-adding it

221639
malloc	free
after all not just gc is not deterministic free is as little deterministic as malloc is

221639
malloc	free
it might as well try to combine smaller free memory blocks surrounding the free d one to a big one and this behavior is not deterministic nor is the runtime for it sometimes free won t do that and malloc will do that instead on next allocation but nowhere is written that free mustn t do that

221639
malloc	free
in a critical realtime system you might even replace the system standard malloc free with a different implementation maybe even writing your own one it s not as hard as it sounds

221639
malloc	free
for me gc is a plain convenience thingy it is to get programmers away from focusing on sophisticated malloc free planing and instead having the system deal with this automatically

221639
malloc	free
if i need a more sophisticated memory handling i d maybe write my own malloc free that works as desired and most deterministic and write my own reference counting model on top of it

221639
malloc	free
reference counting is still manual memory-management but much more comfortable than just using malloc free

221639
malloc	free
your malloc free implementation can have a function finddeadobjects that searches for all objects with a retain counter of zero that have not yet been released and free them at a later point when you are in a less critical part of your code that has more time for such kind of tasks

221658
json	xml
so to solve your problem you can create a php script that outputs some text or xml or json then call it and you analyze the answer with javascript

221667
keyboard	mouse
then one would see the question here how do i detect if s was used to inject mouse keyboard input

221678
contains	lookup
the fifth column lookup contains the formula

221693
export	csv
i have a function that automatically export a table into a csv file then i try to attach that same file into a function that will email it

221703
quirks-mode	doctype
ie will also throw into quirks-mode if anything but doctype is on the first line

221703
quirks-mode	doctype
even a blank first line with doctype on the second line will cause quirks-mode

221704
export	csv
it depends on your functions if you have a function that can export the table as csv into a string and then the mail functions support creating attachments from a string then i think you have what you need.

221756
any	set
this way i do not get any nullerrorexception and i can compare it to a date that i know isn t set

221763
json	xml
the nice thing is if you implement your restful resources using jax-rs then the jersey client can reuse the entity providers such as for jaxb xml json atom and so forth - so you can reuse the same objects on the server side as you use on the client side unit test

221790
order	join
join the tables based on the relationships in order to use the data

221790
double	int
for each type of property int double varchar etc. add a value table

221794
uninstaller	msiexec
working with msiexec and forcing update uninstaller and uninstalleration of clone detective for vs.net solved this problem

221823
document	element
the elements exist in the document only as element nodes and not as blocks of text as you seem to be implying

221859
sql-server	oracle
we use the dbproviderfactory very heavily for our multithreaded applications which connect to oracle foxpro and sql-server and i haven t seen this issue

221864
contains	any
hopefully the data in the db contains the utc offset and if so any changes to daylight saving rules will be irrelevant

221871
inherited	subclass
you could put what you have into an inherited methods and then wrap the results in each subclass

221885
linux	unix
if a company wants a linux unix system with support they have plenty of options

221887
rollback	commit
global temporary tables are only visible to the session that creates them and disappear either at the first commit or rollback or at the end of the session

221903
linux	unix
the few tools that still follows it today such as grep sed and friends are mostly on a unix linux shell

221916
methods	extend
however unfortunately an enum cannot extend a class but it can implement an interface so the best you can do at the moment is define an interface which includes the getfieldname methods and have all your enums implement this interface

221918
implements	extends
enums can implements interfaces but not extends since when compiled they translation to a java.lang.enum

221920
command-prompt	cmd
opened a cmd-prompt and typed the cmd which concatenates all vcards into one

221921
shell	bash
it s on a common linux machine i have bash shell

221924
copy-constructor	constructor
in c++ we had to write explicitly everything that the compiler is supposed to write for us default constructor destructor copy-constructor copy assignment operator for every class

221941
buffering	streaming
likewise you can put a check at the end and if the length of the streaming is the same size as the buffering returned by memorystreaming.getbuffering then you can just return the buffering

221944
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it seems to me that webforms would be less performant but i havent tried asp.net-mvc yet to know for sure

221947
webforms	asp.net
what are the key differences between asp.net webforms and mvc

221947
webforms	asp.net
biggest advantage to using asp.net mvc vs webforms

221953
mathml	tex
likely not what you wanted to hear but after trying mathml i went back to tex as it s far more readable and compact than the xml representation

221959
xargs	cut
-name .txt -type f -print | xargs file | grep foo | cut -d -f1

221987
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc uses the webforms view engine by default itself and can be configured to use any number of custom view engines so if you want a performance comparison you ll have to be more specific

221995
ms-access	mysql
i know that there are several good alternatives for the database part of ms-access the jet database such as sqlite mysql vistadb etc

221998
click	mouse
you can now develop your application with visual-studio and then with a few mouse click launch it in a vm in recording mode

222006
promise	future
also the c++0x thread library will have promise future and packaged tasks which allow a thread to wait for the result of an operation performed on another thread without any user-level locks

222007
asp.net-mvc	webforms
also asp.net-mvc has the potential for better performance because it takes fewer steps during a page load but realizing that potential can require a lot of discipline by the programmer just like webforms

222019
execute	prepare
when running the above java example i see 5 pairs of prepare and execute commands in the mysqld log file

222019
execute	prepare
moving the ps assignment outside of the loop results in a single prepare and 5 execute commands of course

222019
execute	prepare
how does hibernate execute prepare statements to take advantage of the cacheprepstmts setting

222024
vb.net	vb6
however you might be able to find a ms-access to vb6 translator their syntaxes are roughly similar and from there there are vb6- vb.net translators and even vb.net - c# translators

222054
oracle-xe	oracle
it has a migration assistant as well that you run your access database through it proccesses the data and the forms migrates everything to an oracle this works with the free database oracle-xe and comes install by default and builds webforms for your access database

222070
silverlight	wpf
tools to develop wpf or silverlight applications

222080
httphandler	httpmodule
going to rewrite the httpmodule as a httphandler and bind it to .aspx so it doesnt interfere with webresource.axd

222102
any	set
is there any way to add some default set of assemblies to load types from

222142
syntax-highlighting	textmate
since it uses textmate syntax files it offers out of the box syntax-highlighting for more than 50 languages and 20 themes

222159
python	ruby
it s also worth making sure that you have a fairly robust understanding of the programming language behind the framework before you jump in -- trying to learn both django and python at the same time or ruby and rails or x and y can lead to even more confusion

222165
margins	padding
if that doesn t work remove all padding and margins and give the parent div and children divs each a width of 100 leaving in your height of 100px

222166
derived-class	subclassing
in addition to ajryans suggestion you may also need to subclassing your clistbox derived-class in order for it to pick up mouse messages from you dialog

222183
upgrade	migrate
if you want use this wizard to upgrade the back-end to sql express then manually migrate to another db platform

222188
directory	folder
is there a way of configuring svn to create the _svn folder outside my working directory

222213
debugging	trace
the specific details of what the c++ spec says is outside of my knowledge but a debugging trace with gdb and g++ seems to bear this out

222220
for-loop	arrays
if i iterate using a for-loop i have to account for the missing indexes and just copy the keys to a new arrays but that seems clumsy

222229
constructor	object
only parameters really needed in constructor are params that are need to correctly initialize the object

222234
protected	public
assuming that you are talking about using _declspec dllexport dllimport on a class or class member yes you can do that and it should give you the expected result - the static data would be accessible outside your dll and other c++ code could access it provided that that c++ access specification public protected private wouldn t block outside access in the first place

222235
32-bit	64bit
that way you could have a fixnum the full size of a 32-bit pointer at the cost of references all being 64bit

222235
pointers	stack
stack can do similar - store the accurate marking information in data sections of the code itself and have the garbage collector examine the stored program counter and or link pointers on stack and or other information placed on stack by the code for the purpose to determine which code each bit of stack relates to and hence which words are pointers

222235
exception-handling	try-catch
lightweight exception-handling mechanisms tend to do a similar thing to store information about where try-catch occurs in the code and of course debuggers need to be able to interpret the stack too so this can quite possibly be folded in with a bunch of other stuff you d already be doing to implement any language including ones with built-in garbage collection

222235
pointers	stack
which is probably quite fiddly so a reasonable approach potentially resulting in slower code would be to require the jit to always keep a copy of all pointers values it s using on the accurately marked stack

222236
constructor	object
if you have all of those different constructor due to the fact that you want variables options on how to construct an object you should seriously consider using the builder pattern

222263
binaries	install
see the pycairo downloads page for instructions on how to obtain install binaries for windows

222264
digital-signature	signing
or in the case of my ca s cert digital-signature certificate signing off-line crl signing crl signing

222266
double	int
wrote i m reading binary data written by another program from a file and outputting int double

222266
32-bit	64bit
run on 32-bit and 64bit machines of both endiannesses which means that i

222281
selected	button
if you re debuggingging in eclipse you can pause the application selected the app in the debugging view and the little || button on the debugging toolbar and then it can report deadlocks

222295
optional-arguments	arguments
and it lets us have default optional-argumentss without needing to keep track of any kind of arguments order since any order of those calls will work equally well

222299
required	checked
this required that all code in the working copy was checked in since the export will be from trunk and not from the working copy

222305
contains	any
once you do this everything inside your project is compiled into a single dll file any external assemblies are still contains in their own dll files though but there are options around that as well

222307
turbogears	cherrypy
most python web frameworks cherrypy turbogears is what i know already include a way to dispatch requests to specific classes based on the contents of the url or the user input

222333
ip-address	hostname
you need to be use the process of elimination for example if you can ping the ip-address but not the hostname then there s dns issues

222334
base-class	inherited
make all your classes inherited from a single base-class

222351
integer	digits
this integer value can have 28 or fewer digits

222367
websphere	ibm
websphere message broker is ibm s flagship esb which runs ontop of mq

222370
vb.net	vb6
with this in mind should someone who is approaching .net for the first time using vb.net and with a vb6 background be encouraged to get into the mindset of having to work with compile-time type checking because that s the best practice in the clr

222374
command-line	cmd
if you re familiar with the cmd-line you can try the netstat cmd

222383
command-line	cmd
i don t need to limit this just to a specific flavor of shell script ideally i would like a generic framework for documenting api or command-line type cmd on a web page that is easy to extend or even better is self documenting

222401
.net	wcf
wcf is extremely powerful and should be looked into by anyone in the .net space starting up a message based system

222411
dictionary	map
you could potentially store several separate dictionary - one for i ve only got one element direct mapping then i ve got two elements map to a pair struct with the two references in etc until it becomes silly - quite possibly at about 3 entries - at which point you go back to normal lists

222415
freebsd	linux
multi-platform runs on windows linux os x solaris freebsd netbsd and many others

222415
lan	wan
read write many different capture file formats tcpdump libpcap catapult dct2000 cisco secure ids iplog microsoft network monitor network general snifferâ compressed and uncompressed snifferâ pro and netxrayâ network instrumentation observers novell lanalyzer radcom wan lan analyzer shomiti finisar surveyor tektronix k12xx visual networks visual uptime wildpackets etherpeek tokenpeek airopeek and many others

222415
decompression	on-the-fly
capture files compressed with gzip can be decompression on-the-fly

222415
bluetooth	usb
live data can be read from ethernet ieee 802.11 ppp hdlc atm bluetooth usb token ring frame relay fddi and others depending on your platfrom

222415
kerberos	ssl
decryption support for many protocols including ipsec isakmp kerberos snmpv3 ssl tls wep and wpa wpa2

222415
csv	xml
output can be exported to xml postscriptâ csv or plain text

222431
any	set
you don t have to allocate memory for it and you don t have to set your pointer to any value

222435
contains	set
unicode is a character set that other than ascii which contains only letters for english 127 characters one third of them actually being non-printable control characters contains roughly 2 million characters including characters of every language known chinese russian greek arabian etc. and some languages you have probably never even heard of even lots of dead language symbols not in use anymore but useful for archiving ancient documents

222435
python	java
unicode is the default encoding for many newer oses in mac os x almost anything is unicode and programming languages java uses unicode as default encoding usually utf-16 i heard python does as well and will use or already does use utf-32

222442
contains	set
i have a database-table on a development server that is now fully populated after i set it running with an import routine for a csv file contains 1.4 million rows

222444
versioning	upgrade
we recently upgrade to castor 1.2 from versioning 0.9.5.3 and we ve noticed a dramatic drop in performance when calling unmarshal on xml

222445
stderr	stdio
that will redirect both stdio first and stderr to dev-null and run in the background

222450
python	c++
i d like to write python scripts that drive visual studio 2008 and visual c++ 2008

222456
any	set
i ve set breakpoints in the supporting project and they re ignored and i can t for the life of me get it to step into any references to that project

222486
g++	gcc
the simplest of answers is an editor take your pick - at least one is already on there and gcc g++

222494
emacs	vim
some sort of editor ide emacs vim eclipse

222494
python	c++
language specific tools like easy_install for python you said c c++ but the same goes for everything

222494
lighttpd	apache
apache lighttpd nginx

222504
getter	setter
plus my java objects all have getter and setter whereas the as3 equivalents do not which means the public private accessors are different in any case

222513
kate	kde
i prefer kate part of kde as it features a built-in terminal as well as many features you would expect from an editor inside an ide like code folding and regex search replace

222513
emacs	vim
many people also recommend vim or emacs both of which are probably available through your distro s repositories

222513
g++	gcc
your compiler should probably be gcc - on a debian system installing the g++ package as well as build-essential should be enough to get c++ going build-essential should contain the gcc package required for c development

222516
button	popup
you click the copy button in your app and it popup the windows progress box as if you had used explorer to arrange the copy

222533
pointers	stack
since you re using a function pointers for a function that might easily be inlined if you were willing to release multiple binaries performance must not be a huge issue anyway but you might like to know that some compilers can be quite fiendish optimising memcpy - for small integer sizes a set of loads and stores can be inlined and you might even find the variables are optimised away entirely and the compiler does the copy simply be reassigning stack slots it s using for the variables just like a union

222536
python	tcl
pexpect can be used to automate tasks in python does not need tcl to be installed

222544
zend-debugger	xdebug
i tend to prefer using zend-debugger for debugging and would love to find something like this that doesn t depend on xdebug

222545
swing	awt
it s pretty straight forward as long as you re using one of the standard java windows libraries swing awt

222576
xsd	xml
if you create a typed dataset in the designer then you automatically get an xsd a strongly typed object and can load and save the xml with one line of code

222606
keyboard	mouse
i need a way to detect mouse keyboard activity on linux

222619
webforms	asp.net
this is debatable because both of them have different performance pros and cons for example asp.net mvc gives you control over the html javascript that gets to the browser so you can minimize the amount of data on wire to make the whole application weight less however asp.net mvc routing have so much dependency on reflection which is relatively slower than fetching a file from the disk which webforms is doing

222621
html-tree	mechanize
while in general lwp simple or www mechanize and html-tree are good ways to extract data from web pages in this particular case tv listings there s a much easier way

222630
multibyte	strlen
i m wondering if anyone has experience with the mbstring.func_overload setting which replaces the normal string functions strlen with their multibyte equivalents mb_strlen

222632
click	mouse
the specifics of how to gather the mouse click move or key press events will depend on what language you are using to write you program

222633
value	field
edit if you re looking to match up optional _post value with field that may or may not exist in your table you could do something like this i m assuming you re using mysql

222648
order	add
in that case you could add a column to the database-table to explicitly set the sort order

222651
rollback	commit
the open a new windows until commit functionality a new windows is opened after an insert or updates statement and you are forced to commit or rollback

222674
binary-search-tree	tree
these are implemented using a red-black tree a type of balanced binary-search-tree

222684
traveling-salesman	path-finding
actually the problem you posted is similar to the traveling-salesman but i think closer to a simple path-finding problem

222698
export	report
on the html version of the report page i have a link to export the report that the user is viewing

222712
lazy-loading	dto
if you are trying to cache the members dto data transfer object it s probably not a good idea to be applying lazy-loading because it may only be executed in a very unpredictable moment

222714
valgrind	gprof
among others you should also have gprof and valgrind or something in it s class

222718
shortest-path	path-finding
there are many path-finding algorithms that you can use to find the shortest-path here

222721
debian-based	ubuntu
in ubuntu or any debian-based distribution you can issue the following command to install all the necessary tools

222726
json	xml
if you want to pass the information to javascript use javascript object notation json instead of xml

222728
.net	wcf
for two .net apps communicating wcf is the way to go in my opinion

222732
sorteddictionary	sorted
you could create your own generic class and have it derive from dictionary or sorteddictionary and implement your own version of getenumerator in which you can sort the dictionary by key and return the value sorted or if you use sorteddictionary then it s already sorted

222737
select	union
i remember a very long select which involved several union

222737
select	union
each union included a join to a price table which was created on the fly by a select that was itself fairly long and hard to understand

222742
sorteddictionary	sorted
that is using an icomparer based on the addition order you may have difficulty retrieving an element from a sorteddictionary by key-value it might end up lost in the tree which is the backing of a sorted dictionary

222767
firefox	safari
tested on firefox 3.01 safari 3.1.2 with

222807
selected	cell
to add a comment to a cell load the file activate the worksheet then selected the cell as a range and set the comment

222814
bazaar	git
support for svn git mercurial bazaar and svk

222824
attributes	properties
there are two kinds of input value field s properties and field s html attributes

222824
value	field
if you use keyup event and field.value you shuld get current value of the field

222824
attributes	properties
the properties represents what s been typed into the field and changes as you type while attributes doesn t change automatically you can change it using field.setattributes methods

222834
value	field
so the following vb.net code snippet will give errors if the value of any of the field lastname intials or sid is dbnull

222855
debian	linux
replaced the hard drive then installed ubuntu linux debian

222871
type-conversion	int
whenever i try to assign null to it it says there is no implicit type-conversion between int and

222875
double-quotes	single-quotes
if it is absolutely necessary to have single-quotes you could write your xml document to a string and then use a string replace to change from single to double-quotes

222902
perforce	git
the real question is - what is it about perforce that is not meeting your organization s needs that git can provide

222902
perforce	git
and similarly what weaknesses does git have compared to perforce

222918
arguments	undefined
the behavior for class types as varargs arguments may be undefined but it s consistent in my experience

222937
python	lua
on the other hand i have discovered scripting languages like lua and python

222956
uinavigationcontroller	uiview
my problem is that these correct dimensions seem 320x460 the iphone s screen size but i m pushing this tableview controller pair into a uinavigationcontroller which is itself contained in a uiview which itself is about half the height of the screen

222966
assign	add
they add a new event handler to a node without altering any handler previously added to it even once assign through a property onxxx

222970
web-applications	scalability
i ve been arguing with some friends on the university and we can t get to a point to which is the framework with more scalability for web-applications and still very fast

222970
ruby	php
one calls for jsp the other one for ruby other for php and so on

222999
gridview	formview
i m not using a gridview formview detailsview or any other rad type object which persists the key value by itself and i don t want to use any of them

223003
base-class	inherited
i really wanted to maintain persistence ignorance meaning that domain objects could be created as plain old c# objects without being forced to inherited from a certain base-class or clutter up the class with a bunch of attributes

223008
ruby	php
i believe that java servlets and jsps compile to servlets native code will be faster than ruby and php by some amount

223014
document	element
xmlreader also provides the simplest way of processing xml document fragments the stream of xml elements with no encluding element that sql-server s for xml raw option returns

223029
ruby	php
a compiled language will generally run faster than an interpreted language so i think ruby and php start behind the eight ball but it really comes down to how you use the language and how you structure the code

223032
information-retrieval	tf-idf
tf-idf term frequency - inverse document frequency is a staple of information-retrieval

223043
xsd	xml
but here are detailed instructions on how to create a strongly typed object from an xsd or xml and serialize deserialize in a few lines of code

223044
message	alert
or is no renegotiation alert simply an informative error message which now means that the connection is useless

223045
put	get
multiple workspaces on a single machine numbered changelists developer branches integration with ide visual-studio eclipse slickedit ... many build variants composite workspaces integrating some fixes but not others etc i ask because if all folks are doing is get and put from the command-line git has that covered and so do all the other rts

223056
ruby	php
ruby and php are not webapp frameworks

223061
document	editing
my experience with most wiki software mediawiki is that it tracks the versioning of the document you are editing

223061
document	editing
if the document changes during your time editing your change is rejected and you are prompted to perform a manual merge

223067
perl	php
we have a ton of clients so accessing the data outside of delphi is also very easy .net data provider odbc ole db php perl jdbc etc

223068
constructor	object
if the compiler made assumptions about inheriting constructor we wouldn t be able to properly determine how our object were instantiated

223068
arguments	default
in c#4 you could specify default parameter value and use named parameters to make a single constructor support multiple arguments configuration rather than having one constructor per configuration

223092
perl	ruby
i m considering using javascript + extensions -- i really like javascript -- seems to me there should be some way to connect a javascript engine to wxwin or even the tk toolset -- it s been done for perl python ruby etc

223094
export	report
when i print directly from the preview windows in visual-studio everything looks good but if i export the report to a pdf file and print it then the labels and even some of the vertical lines come out pixelated

223113
base-class	subclass
but you can achieve code reuse by calling a base-class s constructor inside the subclass s constructor or by calling a virtual methods you define like initialize

223118
msbuild	nant
i use both nant and msbuild

223118
msbuild	nant
nant was upgraded with nantcontrib so that i got msbuild taks

223118
msbuild	nant
building projects with msbuild greatly simplified legacy nant scripting we used csc task

223128
contains	set
the overhead introduced by max will be minimal-to-zero since the result set contains a single row

223138
rollback	commit
in any database system i ve worked with there is no harm in doing a rollback right after the commit so if you commit in the try block and rollback in the finally things get committed whereas if an exception-handling or early return causes the commit to be missed the rollback will rollback the transaction

223139
value	field
if you are using the field to indicate whether the record needs to be processed or not you might consider using y and null as the value

223158
any	set
depending on your data you could either output a checkboxlist which is not possible in the newer versions any more and use a parameter or you could set up multiple forms and just modify the action

223173
duplicates	contains
i ve got two directory contains 20 gb of music files mostly mp3 some ogg and i would like to detect all duplicates songs

223184
directory	folder
just to make it clear in the bin debugging directory i don t want another layer of libs systemhooks in there and all the files presently being copied to the bin debugging libs systemhooks folder needs to be copied to the bin debugging folder instead

223186
svnadmin	dump
use svnadmin dump

223187
exception-handling	try-catch
it is recommended that the code above should include try-catch or using so that if an exception-handling is thrown all resources are disposed properly

223210
debugging	trace
the debugging and trace classes also have a whole slightly-cumbersome infrastructure of other classes like textwritertracelistener that allow you to do spiffy things like change the output of your trace log from a local file on disk to a web service or to nothing just by editing the application configuration file

223210
debugging	trace
my favorite trick is to implement a textwriter that can write text to a textbox and use that to redirect all the debugging and trace output to the user-interface

223210
instrumentation	trace
finally if you need to instrumentation your app to do something like trace when every method begins and ends the tool to use for that is the miraculous postsharp

223216
reliability	scalability
but that means it may be awhile before your object is disposed of meaning you ll be holding onto resources longer than you should be which may have negative effects on performance reliability scalability

223220
treeview	listview
i want to have a tooltip for each item in a treeview and each item in a listview and different for each subitem column in the listview

223220
any	set
but any attempt to set the tooltip text causes a stackoverflow

223225
memory-management	memory-leaks
you may think it is useless when you see fragments of code like the one you posted but more often than not it saves you a lot of headaches think c c++ manual memory-management since it greatly reduces memory-leaks and lets you worry about how your application will run and not how you will manage memory

223253
deployment	install
the projects share some assembly references the filesystems are all structured to use the same bin folder making deployment of changes to those assemblies problematic since the ms install will only overwrite assemblies if the currently installed version is older than the one in the msi

223253
installation	environment
i m not suggesting that the pessimistic installation scheme is wrong - only that it creates a problem in the environment i ve been given to work with

223266
installation	building
it will save you a lot of time and it allows you to building com add-ins that don t require any third-party components at installation time

223268
internet-explorer	firefox
i know there is built-in internet-explorer but what i m looking for is to open firefox mozilla windows run the application with specified url

223288
value	field
it works much like these sign-up forms that check if your login is taken before you even submit the form with two key difference request is being sent onsubmit and sends all field value except input type file

223293
ms-access	mysql
we used an internal app based on ms-access as a frontend to a mysql database

223296
forwarding	port
so basically all my im and web browsing traffic that i do in vmware which is usually running full-screen on a 2nd monitor is getting ssh encrypted sent out over port 80 to my home router and the router forwarding everything to the real internet

223298
audio	id3
the closed source software creates an audio fingerprint of a file regardless of format id3 checksum etc

223307
arguments	default
if you explicitly do not want to use the user s default browser you can run the browser with the url as the first arguments

223316
environment	building
building environment is

223324
button	popup
allow the user to delete a record by dragging a row from an advanceddatagrid dropping it onto a trash-can icon and verify the user meant to do that via a popup alert with ok and cancel button

223324
button	popup
after the user clicks the cancel button and the popup alert closes no rows in the adg can be dragged

223342
subset	unique
the first flaw can be dealt with however you like such as by taking the last 3 or 4 letters or whichever subset you feel is most representative most unique or easiest to type

223347
performance-monitor	perfmon
if you want to measure memory allocations you need to look at the various performance-monitor perfmon counters

223355
directory	folder
svn external keyword for project directory was well defined also lib folder still contained proper version of libraries trunk version

223363
selected	checkbox
the form checkbox will be converted to an arrays of integer ids categoryids each representing a selected category

223379
document	element
absolute positioning will take the element out of the document flow allowing it to sit above the content

223387
msbuild	nant
keep in mind that anything you can do in nant can probably be done in msbuild as well

223407
audio	id3
i m sure there s more elegant solutions out there - but if the audio data is equivalent then stripping the id3 tags and hashing should do the trick

223415
webforms	asp.net
for unit testing asp.net webforms as well as mvc you can use ivonna

223425
value	field
the screen is responsible for owning all the fields on the screen and the fields are responsible for specifying what is display and what variables the field affects and the input methods s to affect the field value

223428
button	popup
just spotted that between the drop event and the cancel button of the popup there is an asynchronous web service call which appears to be handled by getparticipantorderinformation

223430
windows-server	windows
if you have a windows-server you could try installing windows sharepoint services

223435
exception-handling	try-catch
the only way to log exception-handling irrespective of idisposable is try-catch and then to re-throw in the catch

223435
exception-handling	try-catch
you would have to wrap every call at your api s public boundary with try-catch in order to log that the exception-handling came from your code

223471
value	field
i would approach this from a julian date perspective convert each field into the julian date number of days after the first of year then compare those value

223474
authentication	login
i m setting up my first site using the asp authentication provider and using the built in asp.net login control

223474
http	ssl
or do i need to use http ssl to accomplish this

223477
http	ssl
if you are concerned about security use http with ssl encryption.

223485
http	ssl
i would use ssl http if you want your authentication to be secure

223501
having	select
i haven t had to deal with this problem exactly but i presume that having it come through as a string from the select query would be fine

223517
hide	show
for modulea show hide option

223526
xsd	xml
i have seen xsd files used to generate vb classes that can serialize themselves into and out of xml very easily

223527
default	reset
you have to reset it into the default state using begin initial discard any input text buffering up by unput and otherwise arrange so that the next call to input will start reading the new input

223533
export	csv
if we use excel or even export to csv we need to be able to import to move to .resx files

223566
python	php
the difference is that in php you represent the name of the class you want to refer to as a string while in python you can reference the same class directly

223570
pygobject	pygtk
gst-python isn t coupled with pygtk at all - it just happens to share a common object model pygobject and a way to help generate bindings

223572
htmlspecialchars	echo
even if you shorten echo htmlspecialchars to h it s still a problem that you have to remember to add it almost every time and trying to keep track which data is pre-escaped which is unescaped-but-harmless only makes mistakes more likely

223592
wait	hang
when process hang use top ps gdp strace ltrace to find out the state of the process whether it wait in selected or consumes 100 cpu in some library call

223604
msbuild	nant
msbuild is a bit more declarative than nant though so take your time and experiment a bit

223609
order-of-evaluation	let
order-of-evaluation doesn t matter in this case so let s just start from the left

223611
country-codes	iso
when i try to create a new regioninfo with certain iso 3166 country-codes bd for bangladesh so for somalia lk for sri lanka i get an argumentexception that says it s not recognized

223623
python	java
my main point would be this a person who knows python inside and out will probably be able to make more scalable code using python than using java

223631
listbox	textbox
i want behavior that s like a textbox with a listbox below it and up down events in the textbox get passed to the listbox

223634
any	set
this way i can easily set up relative paths for all of the dependencies of any projects i write or come across and wish to compile

223634
environment	building
the reason i am interested in setting up a linux programming environment is that it seems that both the tool and library dependaecy problems have been solved efficiently making it easy for example to building openssh from source

223640
subclassing	superclass
is there any way to achieve what i want to achieve without changing the methods declaration in the superclass and the field declaration in the subclassing

223641
xsd	xml
have you tried using the xsd tool to reverse engineer an xml output file into the xsd you need

223654
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu debian apt-get goodness

223663
reliability	scalability
scalability and reliability a concern

223668
selected	textbox
you may need to use a textbox instead of a combo box because using the arrow keys is selected values from the combos list and overwriting your current value

223668
textchanged	textbox
by using the textbox you can do you lookup in the textchanged event and you can store the currently typed value by overriding the keypress event to collect and store the keys the user has typed

223686
ordereddictionary	sorteddictionary
more info on nameobjectcollectionbase ordereddictionary and sorteddictionary t t

223689
firefox	opera
i believe this to work and output it tests fine on recent safari opera and firefox

223692
versioning	upgrade
edit turns out i was wrong about the versioning of mysql i needed in the first place and i fixed and upgrade a bunch of stuff

223699
windows-mobile	symbian
in order to get full features you always need to use the native technology of the open platform you are targetting be it android iphone the several variants of symbian os brew windows-mobile or palm os handsets

223700
compression	streaming
i have also experimented with built-in .net compression on a byte arrays of the memory streaming following serializing with some success but not as quick compressed as i had hoped

223713
defined	declare
is it possible to declare an asp.net-mvc view in such a way that it accepts an ienumerable as its view data where t is definedd by what gets passed from the controllers or will i have to defined a concrete type to populate from my query

223727
driver	kernel
how to prevent this from happening figure out which driver is causing you trouble and either stop using or become a kernel hacker and fix it

driver	kernel
you can also become a kernel hacker and make the driver use task_killable as explained in the lwn article

223737

the framework include a few classes for compression streaming

223768
subclassing	superclass
i don t think you can do what you want without changing either the superclass methods signature or the subclassing list declaration

223774
selection-sort	bubble-sort
if you can ultimately only teach one algorithm at all i think selection-sort is even easier to teach and implement imho as bubble-sort

223774
selection-sort	bubble-sort
otherwise i vote for bubble-sort and selection-sort those are easiest to understand and show how sorting the easy way these are simple enough students may actually come up with these solutions without ever having heard of any sorting algorithm is sometimes not very effective

223774
quicksort	mergesort
in contrast i d show quicksort and mergesort being very good divide and conqueror algorithms and both also very fast

223774
radix-sort	shellsort
algorithms i d not use as their concept is harder to get are shellsort radix-sort heapsort and bucketsort

223774
insertion-sort	shellsort
you might mention the little sister of shellsort insertion-sort which is basically a shellsort where the step width has finally reach one but only because many quicksort implementation use inesrtionsort as fall-back sort once the recursion gets too deep or the remaining data set to sort recursively gets too small .

223780
normal-distribution	probability
it turns out that for sufficiently large n this actually converges to a normal-distribution with probability 1 central limit theorem

223784
webforms	asp.net
in the case of stackoverflow they use asp.net mvc rather than asp.net webforms

223784
asp.net-mvc	webforms
with webforms the url is pointing to a file on your disk while asp.net-mvc is pointing to a controller action

223789
vbscript	vb6
this is actually a sample written in vbscript for printing crystal 8.5 reports but the syntax is the same for vb6

223793
compatibility	legacy
as per the wikipedia article on gb18030 gb18030 can be be considered a unicode transformation format an encoding of all unicode code points that maintains compatibility with a legacy character set. that is all unicode characters can be encoded in gb18030 but they will be encoded with different byte sequences than would be generated with utf-8 or utf-16

223800
directory	folder
what would be the best workaround to relax the open_basedir restriction so that the the directory tree under the domain folder becomes available to my application

223801
type-safety	generics
the whole point of generics is to provide compile-time type-safety fo things such as the type of a collection

223809
postgresql	mysql
i am limited to an open source solution so it ll be mysql or postgresql if that helps at all

223818
key-value	key
ref is used if the join uses only a leftmost prefix of the key or if the key is not a primary key or unique index in other words if the join cannot selected a single row based on the key-value

223823
xsd	xml
from what i ve seen they re using an xml based standard and have an xsd available for the the document standard so you could use that in conjunction with your own code to build a document file in the proper format

223828
sftp	ftp
you can of course use other protocols like ftp tftp sftp to move files around but that s often confusing for folks writing client apps

223858
keyboard	mouse
it neither processes mouse or keyboard input nor sends wm_command messages to its parent

223869

223875
configuration	logging
furthermore i can t effect any other type of logging configuration via various properties files

223887
zend-debugger	xdebug
your only other real alternative to the debugging facilities xdebug provides is zend-debugger which is a part of the zend platform again available as an extension

223887
profiling	debugging
and especially won t find beyond zend debugger a debugging protocol and definitely won t find any other extension that does profiling

223911
openoffice.org	uno
you might be interested in openoffice.org uno cli language binding

223920
nvidia	ati
you won t get the performance of modern ati or nvidia chipsets but they aren t that bad either

223955
low-level	hardware
if you have some hardware flexibility you can cause one of the external interrupt pins to be raised by the timer isr at 500ms intervals and then let the low-level interrupt processing of your every-500ms code to occur

223961
directory	folder
nb it seems very odd to have your library solution folder inside an include directory which are really intended for .h or other #include d files

223963
perforce	git
5 interpreter source code is currently going through the throes of converting from perforce to git

223966

salesforce	sugarcrm
i m in the process of trying to move our company from salesforce to sugarcrm but i ve run in to a nasty bug the moment i add a custom field to account all account stop showing up

223994
methods	extend
i have a base class that i extend all beautiful soup classes with a bunch of methods that help me get at text within a grouping of elements that i don t necessarily want to rely on the structure of

224007
document	element
but under most circumstances you won t encounter this and here s why if you want to store say the text of an xml document as the content of an xml element you ll probably use a dom methods

224009
ruby	php
this issue is treated by the web server apache iis or by the language runtime php asp.net ruby jsp

224013
filtering	grouping
filtering the grouping by grouping that have more than 1 element

224032
triggers	insert
if understand you correctly you want to maybe use triggers to check for every insert update delete if the referential integrity is kept on remote databases

224038
shell	tcsh
my shell is tcsh

224041
put	get
i have put the code in the onopen event which i thought occurred before any data is loaded but when i test this out i get a message telling me that the back-end cannot be found it s looking in its old location

224042
driver	kernel
if they last much longer it usually means a hardware problem or a device driver problem which looks the same to the kernel where the device driver is waiting for the hardware to do something which will never happen

224044
selected	cells
has to provide an image of the spreadsheet that users can drag a selected box around to selected cells then click an import button and have the right thing happen

224044
selection	cell
i was able to handle the selection change event and go the cell data i needed

224044
selected	cells
must either allow me to handle the selection change event or must allow me to find what cells are selected or were most recently selected if clicking the import button on my dialog causes the selected cells to become unselected

224045
shell	tcsh
not a tcsh user but if the program runs then reads in commands via stdin then you can use shell redirection to feed it the required commands

224046
stdin	pipe
you can create a temporary file with your inputs and then pipe it in with the stdin redirect

224059
if-statement	loops
or the inverse if inside the while it makes me wonder if they actually wrote it that way or if they added the if-statement when they realized the loops didn t handle the null case

224072
directory	folder
i ve copied the extracted folder to my plugins directory and run eclipse -clean but i can t find anything matching jalopy in preferences

224090
ubuntu	linux
i am currently running gdb version 6.7.1 on ubuntu linux and working in a c++ project

224094
procedure	records
the last step will be to remove the customer being merged out of so if there is ri on a table you never added and you try to do a merge it will fail because you cannot remove the customer being merged out of since there are dependent records in a table which wasn t already added to the merge procedure

224104
pascal	ada
but pascal has repeat - until and while for each scenario and if i remember correctly ada has another construct that lets you quit in the middle but of course that s not what you re asking

224113
triggers	insert
also if you have triggers the text fields will not appear on the insert or deleted tables

224133
linux	unix
memcached runs on linux unix and windows start it anywhere you have spare ram and start using your resources

224133

one of the posts provides this very handy tip on how to run 32-bit explorer on 64bit windows

224162
sql-server	oracle
we will be using sql-server or oracle as the database and the client platform is not fixed yet but you can assume winforms wpf asp.net or a java webapp

224211
ms-access	oracle
it s powerful runs on multiple platforms java-based and supports different database systems oracle db2 ms-access etc

224214
localization	translation
i m not sure how comprehensive an answer you re looking for but if you re really just using string string pairs for your localization and you re just looking for a quick way to load resource .resx files with the results of your translation then the following will work as a fairly quick low-tech solution

224214
csv	xml
csv or excel interop you could also instruct your translators to store their translated content in excel saved as xml then use xpath to retrieve your localization info

224223
innodb	myisam
a better solution is not to use myisam for tables where the data is constantly changing - innodb is much more bulletproof and as paul correctly points out you can use transactions on innodb tables but not on myisam

224223
triggers	insert
of course if you are inserting a very large number of rows then the risk would be that all of your live data is unavailable for as long as the insert takes to complete but overall this approach is far less destructive to indexes triggers or anything else that may be linked to the tables in question

224234
stringstream	ifstream
i m using an istream which could be stringstream ifstream or a user-defined stream type and i need to know if in the case of an ifstream it was not opened in binary mode so i can throw an exception-handling

224256
data-structures	hashmap
internally i would maintain two data-structures a priority-queue and a hashmap

224256
linked-list	queue
keys are stored in a linked-list with the oldest keys in the front of the list new keys go to the back so when you need to eject something you just pop it off the front of the queue and then use the key to remove the value from the map

224275
contains	any
following up on jon b s answer if your file contains any other data you might want to prefix the data with the count of values

224300
operators	keyword
write something to allow them to enter formulas into your application using the type of operators that they actually will use with keyword for the different base prices

224315
notepad++	komodo
i m looking into some different editors like komodo edit notepad++ but i m wondering what tool has the ability to one click ftp for me

224337
put	get
i have to put a button on each page to get the values from a previous page rather than simply having fields auto-populated

224337
splitter	panels
i think the best idea is to have some button on one panels that change the information on another panels a splitter windows

224352
checkbox	button
note that the s around the radio button and checkbox line up correctly

224352
contains	elements
the input boxes were inheriting the left margins of all of their contains elements

224378
restart	daemon
xsp2 shouldn t restart the appdomain so our daemon will be safe

224386
contains	any
typically this module would contains items like routines for managing any uarts timers etc

224388
jprofiler	visualvm
jconsole visualvm or other profiling such as jprofiler will also show you the threads and their stacks however if you don t want to use any external tool i think ctrl-break will give you what you re looking for

224393
children	nodes
when an orphaned nodes is released its associated children will also be released

224393
.when	ready
i ve worked around this situation by keeping a scratch pad domdocument around and using it to create fragments or orphan nodes and adopting them into their destination document .when i m ready

224409
bazaar	git
git mercurial and bazaar are distributed control systems that operate of the idea that you aren t always connected to the .net and that there need not be one central version of the repository

224428
subtract	time
assuming you re thinking monday to friday and holidays are temporarily immaterial then you can use an algorithm in perl that notes that wday will be 0 on sunday through 6 on saturday and therefore if wday is 1 you need to subtract 3 86400 from time

224436
directory	folder
svn export is like a checkout but w o the .svn folder and w o the ability to do subversion work in that directory

224464
perl	php
i can t think of a shorter way to it in either php or perl

224471
minimum	max
meaning if you have a fancy javascript effect that displays a div that s supposed to be on top of everything e.g lightbox multibox etc.. onclick of a certain element and that div overlaps a your div get s to be displayed as if it s under the on this case a max and minimum z-index doesn t work

224495
.net	wcf
if you can upgrade to .net 3.0 i would suggest switching to wcf for your client proxy

224513
updating	updates
because the are used globally across all iphone apps you incur the double-edged sword of an os updates updating the look-and-feel of your application giving it a fresh new look that may or may not work right

224518
border-layout	boxlayout
i use border-layout 90 of the time while nesting boxlayout and springlayout

then the debugger can compile a new version of the function replace the existing version using the padding space as necessary fix up stack set the instruction pointers and keep going

224529
linux	unix
on unix linux we can t use mswi obviously so we provide another installer which basically does the same thing move all the files out of the way install as if brand new and then delete the backup

ensure you have a robots.txt or even .htaccess or something

224551
push	pull
you may also setup a httpserver run push and pull via ssh

224553
any	set
how to set bits of any event flag and which can be the possible relationship between task and event flags

224574
any	set
how to set bits of any event flag and which can be the possible relationship between task and event flags

224578
gethashcode	equals
it is very important that your value that you store override the gethashcode methods and the compiler will warn you about equals so override that as well

224598
double	int
this probably isn t worth it for things like float double etc since they are stored verbatim under protocol buffers - but there may be savings for things like int simply due to how it packs ints.

224611
constructor	object
if you are doing a lot of object construction then delegate.createdelegate won t help you can t use it on a constructor - but in 3.5 expression can be used to do this again compiling to a typed delegate

224635
toolchain	gnu
i m trying to program arm using eclipse + cdt + yagarto gnu toolchain + openocd

224641
lookup	any
when defining classes add an attributes to any class that you want to put in the lookup table

224650
c++	lua
moreover and to the point lua is designed to be integrated to c c++ programs and to be extended with c ++ functions

224658
instances	self
the instances to be passed self

224680
stdin	pipe
if my assumption is wrong and all you really want is this pause then you can try to set things up so that gnuplot will get data from stdin and then use this scripting name it paused-input.sh to pipe input file with pauses after each line

224689
rollback	commit
all that commit and rollback stuff

224690
convention	standards
i perfer to follow the former since it is the standards java naming convention

224707
rollback	commit
that is the easiest way but it does have complexity and you have to be careful to commit properly and rollback

224707
rollback	commit
any failure will pop you right out of the using and the transaction will always commit or rollback depending on what you tell it to do

224784
linux	aix
all application execution in a unix linux mac os x aix etc. environment depends on the executable search path

224784
shell	bash
note also that this technique requires that your login shell be bash the default on mac os x and most linux distributions

224786
32-bit	64bit
how can one get visual-studio 2005 2008 to reference assemblies in the 64bit gac instead of the 32-bit gac

224791
subtract	add
store the difference and add subtract it from the sleep interval at the end of this loop sleep delay can go too long or too short

224793
removeclass	addclass
or you can use your favourite addclass removeclass implementation

224819
administration	account
if it s a service which i m guessing mssearch.exe is then it is probably running as the system user which has higher privileges than even the administration account

224830
response	timeout
however i m still getting the same result and i can t tell if i m succeeding in setting the timeout because the response from sqlcmd.exe is the world s least helpful error message

224866
rounding	currency
one of the reasons for mapping the old currency type in the front end to decimal 19 4 type in the back end was that currency exhibited bankers rounding by nature whereas decimal p s rounded by truncation

224889
file-not-found	access-denied
if you look on this page you would see that error-code 2 is access-denied instead of file-not-found

224932
where-clause	sql
here it is suggested that i use ms sql s built-in xml functions to construct a dynamic where-clause

224948
python	perl
git doesn t maintain back links from a blob to tree so it would be a scripting task perl python

224958
global-variables	call
to call a procedure you set global-variables call the procedure and then inspect the contents of those global-variables or others that might get set

224973
search-engine	web-crawler
the effect of this is that the search-engine web-crawler and users who have javascript disabled get to see a link to information about the speakers

224984
automake	gnu
if you want your code to build on as broad a variety of different unix systems then you re probably wise looking into gnu autoconf and automake

224988
protected	public
you can have private protected and public inherited in c++ which will determine what derived classes can access in the inherited hierarchy

225002
versioning	upgrade
as i understand weblogic has a feature called parallel deployment to eliminate downtime during ear versioning upgrade

225016
nvidia	ati
with windows 7 probably going to rtm next october and directx 11 with it would it be worth waiting for directx 11 s explicit gpgpu features meaning it will be cross-platform ati nvidia not windows linux mac whatever

225036
low-level	hardware
bitfields are very useful if you have very tight memory and speed requirements or when doing low-level hardware programming

225039
button	popup
if you just want a flat button that doesn t accept focus use a regular button with flatstyle flat or popup and tabstop false

225043
dfa	nfa
regexes are usually implements as one of two algorithms nfa or dfa that correspond to two different fsms

225053
mstest	nunit
testdriven.net has the ability to test nunit mstest etc with team coverage which you already have since you have team system dev

225064
testdriven.net	ncover
testdriven.net will also work very well with ncover

225064
ncover	nant
you can get some very nice html reports out of ncover and you can integrate it with nant

225065
iteration	elements
these little critters are blazing fast with respect to union intersection and membership testing even though iteration over all elements might take a while depending on the size

225065
contains	set
bloom filtering use a vector of hash in order to check if an element is contains in the represented set

225077
buffering	streaming
this won t test how it writes to the streaming one byte at a time or as a big buffering but usually you shouldn t care about that anyway

225078
stream	send
i m aware of ustream.tv but i think they just take a direct webcam connection rather than allow you to send any stream

225080
authentication	login
i m trying to configure an ejabberd installation using ldap authentication but i just can t login even with the admin user

225084
conditional	operators
this means that the statement to execute when either conditional evaluates to true or false can be another ternary operators

225108
contains	any
some of these panels contains jtable which i would like to be resized in line with any resizing of the dialog

225122
revision	updates
choose the file that was the base revision before you updates your working copy

225123
asp.net-mvc	webforms
a lot of things that people mentions for asp.net-mvc can be done in webforms but with some additional effort

225134
dictionary	arrays
separator delimited tostring for arrays list dictionary generic ienumerable

225150
innodb	myisam
one of my projects use the myisam engine in mysql but i m considering changing it to innodb as i need transaction support here and there

225151
32-bit	64bit
it is not an option to convert this dll to 64bit so i wrapped the dll in a separate 32-bit .net process and exposed a .net interface via remoting

225151
32-bit	64bit
is there any way i can load my 32-bit dll into a 64bit process and access it directly perhaps through some sort of thunking layer

225164
json	xml
this makes sense since there is no way to serialize the parameters without wrapped in either json or xml

225169
32-bit	16-bit
both 16-bit and 32-bit windows lived in a 32-bit linear address space

225169
32-bit	16-bit
first notice that a full-sized 16-bit pointer and a 32-bit flat pointer are the same size

225169
32-bit	16-bit
this means that data-structures containing pointers do not change size between their 16-bit and 32-bit counterparts

225169
32-bit	64bit
neither of these two observations holds true for 32-bit to 64bit thunking

225169
32-bit	64bit
the size of the pointer has changed which means that converting a 32-bit structure to a 64bit structure and vice versa changes the size of the structure

225169
32-bit	64bit
and the 64bit address space is four billion times larger than the 32-bit address space

225169
32-bit	64bit
if there is some memory in the 64bit address space at offset 0x000006fb 01234567 32-bit code will be unable to access it

225187
highlight	selected
you can use this value to highlight or selected the row in the datagrid easily

225268
bufferedreader	ioexception
the key is to try to close the bufferedreader even if an ioexception is thrown

225281
entry-point	legacy
if your current c++ code can t compile cleanly with clr turned on then i d suggest trying to build your application as a static lib without clr enabled and then have your main be in a cli c++ project that calls your legacy app entry-point

225283
xml-serialization	xml
i have also added options for xml-serialization based on the stingray libraries which implements dom via the microsoft xml sdk

225309
difference	count
the only difference i see is the way to high actual row count on the pk_ed_transitions index when directly using the parametervalues

225315
shell	tcsh
that works in bash zsh and tcsh and probably other shell too.

225315
shell	tcsh
if the path it gives back doesn t include the directory that has git-upload-pack you need to fix it by setting it in .bashrc for bash .zshenv for zsh .cshrc for tcsh or equivalent for your shell

225318
border-layout	boxlayout
try out boxlayout or border-layout for that as well

225336
unmanaged	c++-cli
assuming you are talking about real unmanaged code - not just native c++ running in a mixed-mode assembly compiled with clr - the easiest way is to create a wrapper to your .net code in c++-cli

225367
arrays	map
yes i know you could use regular objects as associative arrays in javascript but i d like to use something closer to java s map s implementation hashmap linkedhashmap etc

225370
click	mouse
when run the less interactive the better ideally safely synching multiple folder pairs with a couple of mouse click as synctoy does

225370
click	mouse
can multiple folder pair syncs be done at the same time with only one or two mouse click

225371
arrays	loops
how else might you compare two arrayss a and b and reduce matching elements out of the first to prep for the next loops over the arrays a

225371
arrays	loops
my goal is to have an arrays that i can loops over pulling out groups of related content i have defined those relationships elsewhere until the arrays returns false

225375
directory	folder
my project has two source directory that are both built and then some files are copied into the output folder

225403
constructor	object
we ll just start by writing a constructor and we ll piggyback off of arrays which is object but has some useful methods that will keep this example from getting too tedious

225421
postback	ajax
if you want to do this and postback instead of using ajax to update your data based on from fields you ll need to get creative about what types of controls you use

225421
postback	ajax
better to use ajax to send back your updates or use html controls like unordered lists or select added via javascript and stuff the selected data in another control that doesn t complain hiddenfield on postback

225486
javadoc	doxygen
i d only use doxygen with java if you re new to java and you ve used doxygen before reducing the learning curve you d experience with javadoc

225486
javadoc	doxygen
if you haven t used doxygen before i d stick with javadoc since it was specifically designed with java in mind

225498
any	set
you will be able to edit the preferences within filezilla to set your default text editor this is something you should be able to do with any ftp program

225524
versioning	staging
so whenever we deploy a new versioning we create a tag of the code which we check out on staging then go through a couple lists of checks etc

225536
buffering	streaming
for streaming the overhead comes from the need to construct the steam and stream buffering

225573
selected	button
is there a way of using forward and back button to navigate through displaying a set of states rather than selected certain objects that will then change the state onscreen

225586
iso	rfc
i figure this is because probably rfc is written in north american paper letter format 216 ã 279 mm and i want to use iso a4 format 210 ã 297 mm

225589
constructor	object
for example looking at what i ve given you would also need to add constructor property checks before the object property check as this currently works

225592
floor	ceil
this will usually be round though in special cases it could be floor or ceil

ubuntu	debian
jenkins is now a standard package on ubuntu debian redhat fedora centos and others

225623
any	set
is there any property i need to set to adjust the installer dialog such that it appears properly on both higher and lower resolution screens

225633
scriptaculous	jquery
ideally i d like to create the menubar and menus using pure html and css but i also have jquery prototype and scriptaculous at my disposal if necessary

225655
ironpython	ironruby
ironruby and ironpython do not work on the xbox 360 because they are based on the dlr dynamic language runtime and the dlr makes heavy use of system.reflection.emit types which are not currently available on the xbox 360 .net a modified versioning of the compact .net

225660
repository	entity
i m using the entity repository pattern and doing a take skip on the presentation layer

225662
versioning	upgrade
it was about the beta 2 but i have upgrade to the release versioning and it s still a problem

225664
sorted	lookup
also if you handle collisions in a sophisticated way each node is again a sorted table and you can perform binary-search within these your lookup might still be fast enough if the table is loaded to 200 so you have twice as many items as capacity

225668
folder	dir
i have app_themes in my root dir and then i add a theme to that which is a folder which i rename

225686
disposable	dispose
however i ran into a case where t is disposable and actually needs to be dispose for unit tests

225711
selected	textbox
place a textbox on the form and add the following event handler on the form to allow ctrl - a to selected all the text in the textbox no matter which control has the focus

225720
rollback	commit
exclusive locks for writing are held to the end of the transaction in case the transaction has to be rollback - this stops other transactions seeing the new value until the transaction commit

225733
contains	any
if your windows has any child windowss that contains text send each of them a wm_setfont message whenever your windows s font changes

225762
factory-pattern	singleton
in your case probably you should better use the factory-pattern abstract methods - whichever is the best for your case combined with a singleton

225766
reflection	runtime
just inspect the exception-handling instance at runtime using reflection to see what members it exposes on your target platforms

225776
postgresql	mysql
not sure about mysql but postgresql pg_dump has a command to just dump the schema without the table contents so you can see if you ve changed the schema any

225830
virtual-machine	vmware
im pasting from windows within a vmware virtual-machine it might be eclipse xmlspy logfiles and other programs

225838
hotmail	gmail
for example imagine what happens if a bots starts going around stealing twhirl passwords or hotmail gmail yahoo paypal from applications that run on the user s desktop

225843
positioning	slider
i have a menu div that i want to slider down so it s always visible but i want it to be positioning under my title div

225855
margins	padding
just stick to basic css properties like margins and padding etc. and it should all be fine

225857
bytearrayoutputstream	outputstream
if you have to pass an outputstream you can pass a bytearrayoutputstream and you can also call tostring on it to get its contents as a string

225907
default-value	default
for example if an action specifies set default but the default-value would not satisfy the foreign key the operation will fail

225911
callback	methods
if you are doing this within an object and you want to call a filtering methods within the object you can use this form for the callback

225915
textbox	button
i have a case where i have a bunch of textbox and radio button on a screen all built dynamically with various divs

225915
radio-button	textbox
there are onblur routines for all of the textboxes to validate entry but depending on the radio-button selection the textbox entry could be invalid when it was valid originally

225915
radio-button	textbox
i can t use onblur with the radio-buttons because they could go from the radio-button into one of the textbox that was made invalid and create an infinite loop since i m putting focus into the invalid element

225915
radio-button	selected
since each text box has its own special parameters for the onblur calls i figure the best way to do this is to call the onblur event for the textboxes when the form gets submitted to make sure all entry is still valid with the radio-button configuration they have selected

225915
textbox	onblur
i also need it to stop submitting if one of the onblur events returns false so they can correct the textbox that is wrong

225923
put	get
they both do o n searches over the list to try and find the key which pretty much defeats the purpose of a hashtable hashtables are generally constant time for get put

225936
authentication	login
i will just have to have them authentication through a facebook-api like form during the first login

225956
display	width
apparently spans can not have width and divs and spans with display block don t appear horizontally next to each other

225973
base-class	inherited
this get s worse when you inherited from multiple classes that inherited from the same base-class

225983
silverlight	wpf
i wrote this thinking you were talking about wpf rather than silverlight but there may be enough overlap for this to be helpful so i m posting it anyway

225985
hash	md5
entering each name as some hash value of the name suppose md5 - 32 bits

225986
rollback	commit
if you use mysql with innodb you can also wrap the inserts in a transaction by issuing begin followed by the inserts followed by either commit if everything is successfully added or rollback in case of failure

225993
procedure	records
one of those procedure is to import data into a kind of management reporting sandbox table which combines records from a particularly important table from across the different databases into one table that managers who don t know sql so can use to run ad-hoc reports without hosing up the rest of the system

226019
expression	evaluation
in the assignment you first extract the old value of x to use in evaluation the right-hand side expression in this case x

226019
expression	evaluation
last you assign the results of the expression evaluation 10 to x via the assignment statement

226025
post-increment	pre-increment
it totally defeats the purpose of the post-increment pre-increment operators

226037
asp.net-mvc	webforms
my testing shows something between 2x and 7x more req sec on asp.net-mvc but it depends how you build your webforms app

226105
document	element
unfortunately dom4j s saxreader using jaxp under the covers keeps reading and chokes on the following document element

226105
document	element
is there a way to get the saxreader to stop reading the stream once it finds the end of the document element

226128
json	xml
preferable data formats are json and xml because most client frameworks and server frameworks are designed around using json and xml

226130
communication	messages
standard web-services use the soap protocols which defines the communication and structure of messages and xml is the data format

226136
implements	final
boost already has much of tr1 implements and dinkumware has it all so you can start using the new libraries already maybe not in their final form however

226151
json	xml
as a result we are usually talking about exposed json xml or soap services

226161
antbuilder	ant
according to the groovy ant task documentation one of the bindings for the groovy task is the current antbuilder ant

226172
innodb	myisam
we know about the tools available for myisam table repairs but cannot find anything for innodb

226228
defined	declare
this does not declare any variables - it defined a type

226228
designated-initializer	initializer
as checkers noted in c99 you can also use designated-initializer which is a wonderful improvement -- one day c will catch up with the other features that fortran 66 had for data initialization primarily repeating initializer a specifiable number of times

226238
json	xml
instead of presenting the data as part of a webpage it is provided in a pre-determined way where some of the more popular are xml and json

226253
versioning	upgrade
the c++ redirector was never upgrade for versioning 9 of symbian os

226261
display	width
technically a span is an inline element however it can have width you just need to set their display property to block first

226262
any	set
any way to set visual-studio to ignore the folder name when labeling the tab

226282
bubble-sort	quicksort
i m not talking about algorithmic stuff eg use quicksort instead of bubble-sort and i m not talking about simple things like loop unrolling

226304
command-prompt	cmd
you can get a list of all workspaces by bringing up a visual-studio command-prompt then changing to your workspace folder and issuing the following cmd

226346
internationalization	globalization
here are some web sites dedicated to internationalization and globalization

226357
sql-server	oracle
finally if you are using sql-server and likely oracle though i have no experience with oracle and xml and you think about the design of your settings class up front you can define an xml schema for your serialized configuration object instances so you can use xquery to quickly get a configuration setting s value without having to fully deserialize

226359
enumerator	any
sadly i believe foreach is a member of list rather than an extension methods though it s easy to define it yourself so you have this facility on any enumerator type.

226362
keyboard	mouse
not a keyboard shortcut but with your mouse you can use forward and backwards button on your mouse to go to previous locations in your code and return to your current location

226363
32-bit	64bit
i can t imagine that it wouldn t be safe on a 32-bit system but 64bit could be a problem since ints remain 32 bit

226374
attributes	properties
the relevant attributes on the modified_date properties are set as so in the dbml designer

226374
attributes	properties
and the resulting attributes on the declaration of the modified_date properties look right as far as i can tell

226387
environment	building
the only reason why it doesn t take longer is because companies like microsoft have building environment setup to help automate integration testings

226401
gentoo	linux
well try it out yourself grab a gentoo or other linux distro or try out the singularity project from microsoft research

226410
linux	osx
i m looking for an osx or linux

226410
python	perl
application that can recieve data from a webcam video-input and let you do some image processing on the pixels in something similar to c or python or perl not that bothered about the processing language

226422
innodb	myisam
one of the big ones to watch out for is that is much slower in innodb than myisam

226467
postgresql	mysql
i think storing your sessions in a database like mysql or postgresql will involve the least headaches especially if you already have a db for whatever it is your app does

226515
multiplication	division
multiplication is faster division is more accurate

226519
multiplication	division
floating-point division is generally especially slow so while floating-point multiplication is also relatively slow it s probably faster than floating-point division

226523
postgresql	mysql
i m working on this package while we support traditional session handling through files we also support database mysql postgresql sqlite etc

226546
vb.net	vba
the statement microsoft no longer supports visual basic could mean several things since there are several versions of visual basic - vb 1 though to 6 vba and vb.net

226546
vb.net	vb6
support for vb6 has ended but vb.net is still very much alive and gaining new features

226559
interpreter	runtime
i ve not done much with vb.net more with c# but as far as i was aware they both compile to the same bytecode and are hence interpreter identically by the .net runtime and that they are functionally equivalent just syntactically different

226559
vb.net	vb6
vb.net seemed a lot different from vb6 when i last used it though

226564
directory	folder
i m wondering if it s possible to point iis to a shared windows folder that exists on another server and have that folder serve as the root directory for iis

226566
environment	building
new building environment

226570
output	mode
if you re not running in xp mode then the mixer apis reflect the mix format - if your pc s audio solution is configured for mono then you ll see only one channel but if you re machine is configured for multichannel output the mixer apis should reflect that

226585
web-inf	taglib
i prefer to not have the taglib elements in the web.xml and instead have the taglib directive specify the uri value that is used in the uri element in the tld that is inside the taglib jar file in your web-inf lib

226589
temporary	copy
the appdomain will copy any dll it needs from the bin directory to a temporary location before locking and loading the dll into memory

226593
msbuild	nant
for your build scripting you can t go wrong with msbuild or nant

226602
vb.net	vb6
when vb.net was created microsoft wanted developers to be able to import existing vb6 projects into .net

226602
vb.net	vb6
that was only feasible if the vb6 functions and method calls had matching functionality in vb.net

226610
arrays	loops
also doing things like removing inner loops when they aren t required or choosing a linked list over an arrays for an insertion sort are not optimizations just programming

226615
licensing	platform
also as i mentioned in that question you may want to consider the session clustering that comes with zend platform - but there are significant licensing costs associated with that solution

226623
xsd	xml
there s a microsoft tool that helps creating the needed xsd to properly deserialize xml into an object

226626
xml-serialization	xml
you might be able to get away with using some of the xml-serialization specific attributes as well but that depends on your xml s schema

226643
assign	add
if i ve created a label in tfs assign it to several files my coworkers cannot change the versions of files nor add other files to that label

226646
directory	folder
in an app server the current working directory is usually the bin folder depends on what app server you use etc

226646
properties-file	web.xml
use an absolute path preferably stored in web.xml or a properties-file to refer to the directory you want to save files to

226655
host	root
enabled smtp email for the root site in iis 7 manager not sure if that needs to be on to enable sites to deliver email to smtp server local host unsuccessful

226658
versioning	upgrade
btw i still have no idea what an unsafe expression is - nor why it continually asks to upgrade to jet 4.0 sp8 when it already has been i verified that it was updated by checking the file versioning

226674
contains	set
now open the file that contains this source and set a breakpoint there and the program would hit this point and stop inside the windebugger

226683
configuration	environment
each environment dev stage prod has a different build.properties that stores configuration for that environment

226686
silverlight	wpf
iirc they used either silverlight or a wpf xbap to host the gadget

226687
contains	any
there is no implicit reference to an instance of the contains class - so you can t use any instance members of the contains class without an explicit reference

226687
private-members	instances
however you do have access to all private-members of the containing class - with a suitable reference for instances members

226689
document	element
the element itself doesn t have an id attributes and i can t modify the original document to give it one although i can make dom changes in my scripting

226693
lookup	any
i realized that a disk-based dictionary is pretty much a database so i manually implemented one using sqlite3 but i didn t do it in any smart way and had it lookup every element in the db one at a time.

226699
command-prompt	cmd
it should be one cmd that can be run from a cmd-prompt in an ssh session and returns information about whether the postfix process is active and the size of the relevant mail queues

226708
versioning	upgrade
the microsoft.visualbasic.compatibility namespace is exclusively for use by the vb6 upgrade wizard may be removed in future versioning and should not ever be used for new development

226731
any	set
i was going to suggest that you attempt to use to actually load the properties into ant and then fail if any of them are not set but i think i was interpreting your problem wrong that you wanted to fail if a specified property was not set in the properties-file

226738
vbscript	jscript
but you may want to build your own simple solution since youâ ll have to modify the codeproject project to support objective-c instead of jscript vbscript c xml and c#

226742
shell	bash
linux apprentice improve bash shell scripts using dialog

226765
put	get
i have a proof-of-concept test that uses staf to start a vm image from a pool of images install the application under test run the rrafs test and put the results on a webserver for others to get at

226774
boolean	int
when using int as boolean this isn t true

226783
bazaar	git
so if you do not use the dumpformat you will stick to checkout all branches tags from svn and adding them to git bazaar mercurial manually via script

226790
environment	building
after launching the windows-xp free building environment i browse to the directory with the three files test.cpp makefile and sources and run the following command

226799
silverlight	wpf
really it was about using presentation model with silverlight wpf

226809
safari	opera
opera and ie maybe safari

226823
google-chrome	firefox
when i use some icons near links using background-image and padding-left on the links the icons display nice on firefox and google-chrome but in ie6 they take a kind of gray background and sometimes the flash strangely

226826
value	field
in the coupon_item_assoc table have a field indicating how many items the coupon may apply to at once with some special value indicating infinite

226839
32-bit	64bit
is it possible you have a 32-bit os and a 64bit os difference or major version changes because we don t know all the changes that the postgresql team has made to the underlying data-structures on disk

226844
constructor	object
just as objects have constructor they also have destructors which are executed when the object dies or is unset

226844
instances	destroy
every time we destroy or stop using an instances it will decrease the connection counter by one

226867
postgresql	mysql
if this is a public facing web application which is expected to receive hundreds of orders every day you ll probably want to run a mysql or postgresql server alongside it on the same server

226867
postgresql	mysql
if you re looking at hundreds of thousands of orders you ll most likely want mysql or postgresql running on a separate server

226867
postgresql	mysql
if you ve got all coders who are just starting out or who have experience with mysql or postgresql then obviously that makes more sense

226885
mousedown	mouseup
if you are referring to the webbrowser-control s document property type htmldocument it only has events for mouseup mousedown etc but not keyboard events

226896
handler	service
i am currently trying to create an exception handler built into my windows service that on an unhandled exception sends a message to another program

226930
folder	dir
i would try turning off indexing for the temporary asp.net files folder located in your windows dir microsoft.net framework whatever version folder

226939
xsd	xml
i ve been working with code synthesis xsd to generate an xml tree to ensure constinency of the xml output to the original xsd

226939
xsd	xml
although the xml is well formed and conforms to the types set in the xsd it is not a valid xml wrt the schema

226968
superclass	inherited
apple s api reference documentation does not show methods inherited from a superclass

226979
any	set
perhaps i m not understanding the question but why not just store the url of the homepage that the user has selected and set any home links to goto that url and not worry about the routing

227017
json	csv
i ve been handed lots of data in different formats xml json yaml csv some custom formats which i need to merge and work with but developing a schema in a relational database will be time-consuming and difficult

227055
ports	dmz
changing your dmz policy and opening ports is usually really hard

227063
any	set
if any errors occur during the step then i set the status of that step to failed

227064
hide	show
often times i need to surround a block of html and related server controls with a panels that i can show or hide based upon some user-interface logic in the code behind

227064
hide	show
in this situation i usually just set each tr to runat server and show hide each of them individually but there must be a better way

227077
rhino-mocks	moq
if that s the case you may want to look at a mocking framework such as moq or rhino-mocks so your tests can execute independent of such dependencies

227077
webserver	host
if its a class that is valid even when a host application iis or the built in webserver process isn t running then its likely because the compilation and symbol generation occurs after the debugger is already running attached to your unit tests

227101
search-engine	web-crawler
is there a way i can modify my httpd.conf on the staging server to block search-engine web-crawler

227102
value	field
most modern rdbms support an xml datatype think an xml document is a value in a table field with xpath xquery to retrieve data from the value

227102
sql-server	oracle
in which case oracle sql-server and others have extensions to perform text searches into those fields

227111
linux	osx
and it runs on windows osx linux iphone and there is an adaptation on facebook

227117
sftp	ftp
ftp sftp tftp ftp

227124
sql-server	oracle
if you re using sql-server or oracle i think cfquery exposes its own per-query timeout attribute that you can set

227131
solaris	linux
current we re using it on linux mac solaris hp-ux

227132
templating-engine	partials
is it possible to use the asp templating-engine with the partials code-behind class dynamic .

227138
ruby-on-rails	django
there are tons of tools out there for different environments - capistrano is a pretty good one and favored in the ruby-on-rails django world but is by no means the only one

227140
windows-xp	windows
it would also be fantastic if this could work on windows-xp or lesser versions of windows vista

227149
value	field
as a table this pretty much translates to two field name value

227225
data-access	ado.net
user extends userdal objects that has low level data-access calls using ado.net

227225
entity	poco
my understanding is that as a poco the user entity would have no problems been passed over the wire and adding methods like save load etc would have no relavence in the sense of a data transfer object

227239
boost	stl
the callstack is entirely stl boost code

227239
boost	stl
bad idea with stl boost containers

227252
forwarding	port
note sorry the sample above is for vb 6 it should be pretty straight forwarding to port the code to vb.net plus you can use the system.xml classes and or stringbuilder to help build the webdav xml requests

227256
getter	setter
typically entities that don t really do anything but contains getter and setter for private-members mean you re working with an anemic domain model

227264
webserver	upload
it should also work as it is if you upload it to a webserver

227282
inequality	equation
i m working on a programming problem which boils down to a set of an equation and inequality

227301
advantage-database-server	dbf
i do support for sybase advantage-database-server and it uses a flat file format allowing dbf s as well as our own proprietary adt format

227304
swing	awt
the getname is used in tostring methods when setting the names of child components inside a composite parent component and in awt and swing debug logging code

227304
swing	awt
i suspect strongly that the getname method is also used by some awt swing testing frameworks

227312
arrays	loops
i know i can loops through an arrays by using element.childelements but i would like something inline that reads cleanly and can be pipelined

227317
player	movie
for fans of the movie tron this is a nice way to waste some time online with other player worldwide

227318
python	c++
i m limited to the core python and cgi modules to create pages that will communicate with a c++ application

227318
boolean	int
the configuration data takes all forms boolean int floats and strings

227325
vbscript	perl
it will also generate vbscript perl and jscript

227347
wikipedia	scrape
you could scrape a public source like wikipedia for names or you could just grab random non-offensive of course nouns from your dictionaryionary of choice usr share dictionary words etc. and append company corporation ltd at random

227368
nsstring	nsdata
it s nice to add convenience methods to commonly used classes such as nsstring or nsdata

227448
vb.net	vb6
vb6 and vb.net has optional parameters in method

227448
vb.net	vb6
vb6 vb.net way of saying shift xltoright allows passing value of a specific parameter by name

227453
hash	md5
generate the hash sha1 md5 etc for a key and hardcode the hash in your application

227460
configuration	environment
in a live web hosting environment it makes life easier both in terms of dns configuration and server configuration

227468
selected	cells
if you selected a range of cells and right-click insert you will be asked which direction to shift the cells

227507
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
how can i read an openoffice.org 3.0 spreadsheet .ods from groovy

227508
unix-timestamp	datediff
to convert a mssql date into a unix-timestamp use datediff

227522
xsd	xml
notice that this xml uses a default namespace the same as the targetnamespace of the xsd

227525
selected	textbox
when you select tabpage1 the selected event fires before the controls become visible and the textbox gets laid out again

227545
directory	folder
how can i get a file that is copied to the debugging bin directory to also be copied to the testresults folder

227555
superclass	accessor
admittedly this does impose additional restrictions on your code for instance subclasses with custom accessors for a property in the superclass must call the superclass accessor but those restrictions are not out of line with various other restrictions common in cocoa

227557
development-environment	platform
i ve quite painlessly install wampserver to get a development-environment up and running on my windows machine but the platform i ll be targeting will most likely be linux

227571
wamp	php
i ve gone both ways without many problems ok there used to be a bunch of problems deploying enterprise sites on wamp don t try to use the php isapi filter but they are solvable now fastcgi

227571
wamp	php
also since you are stating you are using wamp i assume you are using mysql mssql and php have a bunch of issues the ancient driver it requires seriously limits the length of your query

227576
virtual-machine	vmware
i run the free vmware server with a linux virtual-machine

227580
any	set
it looks like the binding is broken since it s set to be oneway with the checkbox then if you click any of the expanders it will then break the binding

227580
required	checked
updating the checkbox might be trickier though since there is some logic required to see if all checkbox or only some are checked

227581
constructor	object
which would most likely cause an exception to be thrown when an object of a type in the dll is instantiated - the body of the object s constructor couldn t be found

227585
perl	php
we have some people that are more comfortable in python some in perl some in php etc.

227586
delta	diff
for generating efficient diff have a look at vcdiff rfc 3284 binary delta compression

227586
delta	diff
in vcdiff the diff can also be sourceless meaning they decompress into the target file without any source file the file to which a diff is applied at hand -- in vcdiff compression a file is a special case of creating a compressed delta between two files

227596
selected	checkbox
one of those 1000 was then asked to selected anywhere from zero to 13 of their selectedions via checkbox

227608
digits	zero
the zero is optional before a single digits day or month

227635
perl	ruby
thou shalt use either python or perl or ruby

227644
websphere	ibm
paid at my day job i administer an ibm websphere mq messaging system with several hundred nodes and have found it to be very good

227648
contains	any
linq does not support this any contains calls will hit the un-managed string functions but will not benefit from indexing

227672
selection-sort	bubble-sort
i think the students would get the most value out of learning a classic o n 2 algorithm preferably insertion or selection-sort but please not bubble-sort which has no justification for being used in real applications as well as a divide-and-conquer o nlogn algorithm such as quicksort or merge sort

227738
z-index	overlay
i d like to up the z-index of the modal overlay as high as possible so the ad won t show on top of it

227742
order	add
if you add another categoryid 100 message with priority 3 the original solution would bring back 2 rows by adding another order condition we eliminate the chance of two items ranking the same

227754
firefox	opera
firefox safari and opera provide the non-standard xmlserializer api so you could do something like this

227788
python	perl
if you re looking for the python equivalent of perl -pi here s a pretty good one

that also means that if zero checkbox are selected by the user all rows will be returned

227797
click	mouse
in my cross-platform architecture i would like to act on a context menu click right button click during a mouse click event

227803

16-bit	x86
take a look at bcc which is a 16-bit x86 c compiler

227847
debian	linux
i m used to debian linux where my command history is automatically saved when i log out so that when i log back in i can press up or ctrl-r or whatever and have access to my history

227860
any	set
it might be worth trying to set the borderstyle property to borderstyle.none to see if that has any effect

227874
domain-driven-design	repository-pattern
try the repository-pattern and domain-driven-design

227874
repository	entity
all the persistence-related code is put in a repository object which manages data-access for the entity

227900
char-pointer	pointers
the next step is to convert the void pointers to a char-pointers

227900
realloc	malloc
the last step free is easy you always and only return to free a value that one of malloc calloc or realloc returned to you â anything else is a disaster

227928
python	c++
i m building an open source project that uses python and c++ in windows

227933

then define a role superclass and doctorrole patientrole and employeerole subclassing assuming that each role has different properties

227935
nstextview	nsmenu
it seems nsmenu popupcontextmenu wants to post an event to the specified nstextview

227938
versioning	upgrade
so if you re doing a minor versioning upgrade to one of your apps the main application also goes up by a minor versioning number

227942

227961
value	field
your text field and value field options are mapped to the appropriate columnns in the data table you are receiving

227971
contains	elements
in your case the primary application windows contains a user-interface elements button link that invokes a controllers action to display the preferences windows

228001
getter	setter
but note that if you don t have any domain logic then you will end up with anemic domain objects bags of brainless getter and setter which is how some shops claim to do soa service layers

228001
repository	entity
i re-read this and i notice that the entity is still thin because it is simply dispatching its persistence to the repository

228025
updating	updates
i ve tried setting that column to readonly and autogenerated so it stopped trying to put in datetime.minvalue but it doesn t seem to be updating on updates

228058
difference	zero
in this example you can see that as the values get smaller the difference between nearly equal numbers create non-zero results where the correct answer is zero

228065
implementation	instantiation
if you know a closed set of types that clients will use you can ensure they are available by using explicit instantiation in the templates s implementation file which will cause the compiler to generate definitions for other files to link against

228079
multiplication	division
pointers arithmetic isn t very fond of division or multiplication

228134
put	get
is the best solution to override instance values upon object creation immediately put the position value on awesomedragonimmunetofire to the current get value of position

228147
decrement	increment
even more efficient as greg d and hazzen say is to allocate by increment or decrement a pointers 1 load 1 store and not offer a way to free a single node at all

228154
keyboard	hid
unfortunately the new leopard hid apis have the ability to peak at keyboard events as they pass by but not to intercept them so you can t build your own application-level device handler unless it s ok that the key events are also going to the appkit as well

228161
base-class	inherited
in the .net world marshalbyrefobject is a common base-class that people need to inherited which can conflict with inheritedance-based dao requirements. with single inheritedance it s not ideal to inherited in order to gain functionality that s probably a separate concern

228165
perl	php
i d be happy with a php or python solution if perl isn t your thing

228214
dependency-injection	singleton
my favourite example of this is dependency-injection frameworks that make use of singleton to act as a connection point to the framework

228223
development-environment	platform
if your platform and development-environment supports it some sort of asynchronis messaging system works well

228231

in the 16-bit days there was the 16 bit ax register which was split into two 8bit parts ah and al for those times when you still wanted to work with 8bit values

228232
attributes	properties
the key thing is that each object has a chain of prototype objects which is examined if you try to access an attributes which the object itself doesn t hold as per yegge s description of what the properties pattern is

228264
triggers	insert
a possibility is to create a triggers on insert to add in the correct sequence number

228266

228298
contains	any
the second link under php in my list also contains basically the same information which is simple enough that you should be able to translate it to any language

you could also pretend to be a more dynamic language and have an arrays of callback as methods and gin up a way to call them using templates or macros and pushing this onto the stack before the rest of the parameters

228448
listitem	checkbox
depending on how you are populating your checkboxlist this might be as simple as adding an onclick attribute to the listitem for that checkbox that calls your function with the same value assigned to the label say oncheckboxclicked this label

228448
contains	elements
that would eliminate the need to derive the label although you could probably do this on the client side as well pretty easily by referencing the previous elements of the checkbox if you just passed a reference to it or parent maybe depends on whether the label precedes the input or the input is contains in it

228468
order	join
but what i can tell you is that the order of join operations is determined dynamically by the query optimizer when it constructs its query plan based on a system of optimization heuristics some of which are

i then have a button above the grid called edit which the user can click to popup a windows and edit the selected row

228563
order	join
sql doesn t define the order in which join are done because it is not the nature of the language

228722
constructor	object
in the same way in c++ raii we don t care about ressource freeing because raii do it for us or for object initialization because constructor do it for us it is sometimes important to just code without caring about who is owner of what memory and what kind pointer shared weak etc. we need for this or this piece of code

228748
silverlight	wpf
the patterns practices group at microsoft has put together some guidance around doing wpf and silverlight applications

typedef	struct
while a typedef will enable you to write it without the struct keyword

228757
typedef	struct
will just create an anonymous struct with a typedef name and you won t be able to forward-declare it

228992
sftp	ftp
because of this maintenance unfriendly setup we use a sftp server to get our files to the production server where the ftp server alwys resets last modified date so it is complicated to determine which files have changed

228992

in vba i can call it using named parameters for the required parameter the optional paramter can simply be omitted in vba unlike in c#.net for which type.missing must be used for all omitted optional-parameters

229167
vba	vb6
so why do vba coders use named parameters if vb6 coders rarely do even though they use essentially the same language

229167
macros	vba
i think it is because the vba generated by the ms office applications macros recorder tends to always

229168
perl	php
i find print_r in php extremely useful but wonder if there is anything remotely equivalent in perl

229172
order	join
regarding the difference between sql-server and lucene the principal problem with sql-server 2005 full text search is that the service is decoupled from the relational engine so join order aggregates and filtering between the full text results and the relational columns are very expensive in performance terms microsoft claims that this issues have been addressed in sql-server 2008 integrating the full text search inside the relational engine but i don t have tested it

double-quotes	spaces
note that spaces in the needle string need to be placed between double-quotes and the wildcards should be outside

229619
python	ruby
languages without memory handling like python or ruby do have something like raii for those cases btw with statement in python

229627

however now i would like to write an application that would use this pattern but i would like to have the entity classes decoupled from the repository provider

229627
oracle	mysql
data stores could include an sql server an oracle server mysql xml files web wcf services and so on

229631
macros	vba
using either the vba macros or add-in method is a best way i have found of getting at the data

229631
push	pull
you may need to get the user who is using the spreadsheet to run a macros that will push the data out of the spreadsheet instead of you running a process to pull the data from the spreadsheet but usually it is quite doable

229632
perl	c++
i cannot use c++ java perl ruby

triggers	insert
mysql triggers how do you abort an insert update or delete with a

229809
communication	messages
it may not be the best solution for the batch server to communication with the servlet though as it cannot be a listener to messages

229824
email-validation	validation
ok there are a million regexes out there for validation an email address but how about some basic email-validation that can be integrated into a tsql query for sql-server 2005

229851
perl	ruby
i m competent in java perl and ruby but i haven t seen anything among their libraries that would aid me here

229871
any	set
you can set the focus back immediately but setting the focus anywhere will triggers the lostfocus-event on any type of control and make it update its stuff

229879
command-line	cmd
did you try the cmd-line cmd openfiles

229890
children	nodes
with a typical implementation of folder in which a folder s children are a list serialization of the root nodes would send the entire graph

229914
version-control	git
version-control vss subversion git etc. is pretty much mandatory

229914
versioning	staging
have a testing staging qa server with the same configuration as the live versioning as much as this is possible

229915
for-loop	loops
putting the whole thing in a for-loops makes it neater and ensures that the iterating isread is called each loops

229917
boolean	int
byte char int short boolean float are all stored in 4 bytes each

229920
packaging	building
you may be able to do it by packaging your on-install code as an extension in your gem as if it were a native extension and providing a rakefile to building the extension call your code

229922
for-loop	loops
in ada and i believe most other algol-derived languages the terminating condition of a for-loops is evaluated only once at the beginning of the loops

230014
webforms	asp.net
i m using the asp.net 3.5 sp1 system.web.routing with classic webforms as described in

230028
contains	elements
the key lookup above in the templates for item returns a nodeset contains all the item elements with the same string value as the context node

230058
contains	set
the idea is to do the pagination on the database as the result set contains thousands of rows so caching is not an option and using viewstate is not even considered as imo sucks

230095
configuration	environment
personally i ve used ant with platform environment specific properties to allow for one configuration file in svn or any other scms that is either overridden in the local environment or has placeholders that get substituted during the build by platform environment specific values

230109
asp.net-mvc	webforms
we are moving from regular 2.0 webforms with no testing to tdd asp.net-mvc

230132
arrays	loops
a last thought it sounded as if you wanted to loops through the arrays multiple times

230139
put	get
if they use the moodle wysiwyg view the html would just get put into one line with no breaks

230145
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i think if you are moving from webforms to asp.net-mvc that it will be more of a rewrite than a conversion

230146
subclassing	inherited
i ve made a class which inherited from user-controls but which i only want to use as a base for subclassing

230149
installation	building
if you develop a module and use module building to manage the installation you even have a testcover target

230173
ip-address	hostname
i ve seen a few methods on determining environment from the machine s physical name good for limiting unauthorized use of code to ip-address hostname etc

230175
buffering	streaming
a streaming reading a file from a local harddrive will probably block until the read operaition has read enough data from the disk to fill the buffering and only return less data if it reaches the end of file

230184
teamcity	msbuild
if you answered no to any of these questions i would go the open source route svn or git cruise control or teamcity msbuild etc.

230184
asp.net-mvc	webforms
we are moving from regular 2.0 webforms with no testing to tdd asp.net-mvc and i need to know the lowdowns as in i ve never made such a jump before not that its a huge jump but i m a nooby programmer that has just graduated college

230184
asp.net-mvc	webforms
this is a good time for you to learn asp.net-mvc then since you don t have a deep investment in webforms knowledge and asp.net-mvc is a much better model for someone like you to master

230193
scala	java
any languages that compile to java byte code scala jython etc... not work as expected

230199
any	set
if i add a new project and forget to go in and add it to the working set i won t get any warnings for it which with all the other projects i might not notice

230203
oracle	mysql
okay so we all now that we can easily store a blob in a sql server oracle sqlite mysql server and any other database thats worth anything

230208
continuous-integration	build-process
the trick to this is a stable repeatable build-process and a continuous-integration server

230208
daemons	systemd
so far we ve had zero issues as a result of this process except when the build-server kicks in while our source control systemd also known as the daemons spawn see so many of my recent remarks performs a large multi-file check-in

230213
order	join
since the query is really a view one way to think about it is that oracle needs to be able to join the view back to the target table in order to know what row to update

230225
margins	padding
whenever i am dealing with margins and padding i will add a border around the part you are working with then from there it shows me the room i have to work with

230233
spring	jsf
innovative technologies spring hibernate wicket jsf ws rest ... - there are some restful ideas being applied in our project and we are using some features of the .net like lambda expressions

230259
virtualization	parallels
mac virtualization vmware fusion or parallels

230266
output	mode
using vim i m trying to pipe text selected in visual mode to a unix command and have the output append to the end of the current file

230283
value	field
well you can use a recordset object to loop through your query in vba concatenation field value based on whatever criteria you need

230313
subtract	add
once you have the offset you can simply add subtract depending on which way the conversion is going to get the appropriate time in either timezone

230318
tokenize	parsing
also different editors and ides use different tokenize and highlight rules and javascript is one of more dynamic languages to parsing so try opening the file in emacs vim gedit with javascript plugins .

230335
controller	routes
do i need to add and maintain manual routes in the routes.rb file which is a pain do they go in a different controller do i become unrestful or am i missing something fundamental

230335
controller	routes
if i wasn t using map.resources to add the rest goodies the standard controller action controller action id routes would handle pretty much everything automatically

230342
solaris	linux
it runs on mac os x and includes cross-compilers that target windows linux and solaris an objective-c runtime and portable foundation framework that works with all three and an appkit framework for windows

230343
bug-tracking	mantis
as i am working on implements a new bug-tracking system it looks like it will be mantis right now i got to wondering how we could best allow our customers an interface with our development process that would provide better tracking of feature requests and client submitted bugs as well as communicate our response back to the client

230345
textbox	button
then add a small bit of javascript to trigger that button s postback action when you press enter inside the textbox

230354
value	field
but what can happen and has happened to me many times is that you have bad data in your usertbl like a country that doesn t exist anymore or another value in its country field that just doesn t match any of your values in the country dropdown

230376
environment	building
even worse depending on which building environment you re using the specifics of how to escape properly will likely change

230393
postgresql	mysql
otherwise mysql or postgresql will do the job much cheaper

230398
metaphone	soundex
all soundex metaphone and variant scheme are occasionally going to give results that aren t identical to what you expect

230404
perl	c++
python ruby perl php xml html css django javascript vbscript delphi java c++ c# lisp renderman rsl and rib maya embedded language sql smalltalk axapta 1c ini diff dos .bat bash

230417
selected	textbox
thanks to an msdn forum post - this problem only occurs when textbox are in multiline mode and you d like to implement ctrl + a for selected all

230425
directory	folder
you could instead change the current working directory before running the program to the desired dll folder

230429
versioning	upgrade
solutions seem like they can be upgrade by incrementing the versioning number but it doesn t seem to modify things like content types and columns--especially if they re in use

230444
stderr	stdout
so this little piece of code just captures the output redirecting stderr to stdout and searches for error messages

230468
any	set
a stored procedure returns a record set like any other so you can actually do this

230484
oracle	mysql
i ve never had a problem with oracle informix or mysql but other databases may have less precision also

230500
any	set
yes they can become messy and obscure exactly as any other piece of code somebody may write but they have an advantage over code they represent the set of strings one is interested to in a formally specified way at least by your language if there are extensions

230507
button	slide
click the button and we slide over to another screen i suppose these are called views which has another label and the back button in the top menu bar

230523
controllers	routes
searching is something i add to many controllers but not every one so i add it and maintain the routes normally

230531
button	slide
you ll need to use a uinavigationcontroller to accomplish the slide back button behavior you re talking about

230531
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
essentially uinavigationcontroller allow you to push and pop instances of uiviewcontroller or subclasses thereof and take care of the animation and view history tracking for you

230536
controller	routes
as to if they should be manual routes or a new controller that depends on how distinct the activity is

230551
traversal	parent
this will find the checked form fields traversal up to find the parent form object and submit that

230561
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu

230580
put	get
i think you re nearly always better served by learning a technology better rather than learning a crutch unless the tool is something where you can put in simple info and get out a lot of boilerplate code

230593
shell	bash
you can find the details of these and other related shell parameter expansions the test or command and conditional expressions in the bash manual

230622
capacity	storage
maximum storage capacity is 1gb

230624
revision	svn
the build is stored to a directory according to svn revision number

230624
revision	svn
that way we can always retain the source from the svn repository by simply checking out this very revision that way the source is archived as well

230642
triggers	insert
the create triggers statement was successful and quick in a test environment and the triggers works correctly when rows are insert updated to the table

230656
python	java
maybe the underlying java objects are not exactly what you see them as in python

230660
pointers	stack
the pointers to something a memory block an object etc. itself usually follows the rules of above a pointers declared within a function is stored on stack but the data it points to the memory block itself or the object you created with new is stored on the heap

230660
pointers	stack
you can create pointers pointing to stack int a 10

230695
controller	routes
having said that you re absolutely right that there s no point in forcing your app to user restful routes when it doesn t deliver anything over controller action id

230697
python	java
props to euro micelli - maintenance is the key which is also why languages like ruby python and in the past tho still.... c# and java kicked butt over c c++ and assembly- humans could maintain the code which is way more important than shaving a few ms off a page load

230724
selected	button
they can selected a file and click the submit button

230724
selected	button
if someone then chooses to upload selected and hits submit if they press the cancel button before the file is fully uploaded php should stop the uploading of the file and delete it

230728
scrollbar	widget
if you are using interface builder you can simply go to table view size properties windows and change bottom insets for both content and scrollbar with the height of another widget

230736
subclassing	base-class
obviously the above code doesn t work but if it did what i m trying to tell the compiler is that t must be a subclassing of base-class

230746
base-class	inherited
i started a base-class that a master page can inherited

230755
textbox	button
it contains several textbox controls a few dropdownlist controls a save button and a cancel button

230755
postback	ajax
is it possible to wrap the contents of the control in an updatepanel and then be able to turn on off whether or not the updatepanel does ajax or postback for the control events

230772
scriptmanager	updatepanel
the easiest way to just turn off your updatepanel is to set enablepartialrendering to false in the scriptmanager

230780
stderr	stdout
-u unbuffered binary stdout and stderr

230787
communication	messages
i find that it helps greatly with keeping messages documentation and timelines communication to the client

230801
platform	gpl
another option is to use the gpl highlight gui program by andre simon which is available for most platform

230808
nstextview	nsmenu
since i didn t see a way to use nsmenu without having it send a notification to an nstextview i came up with a scheme that initializer a temporary nstextview

230812
python	java
this ensures that you can put python classes into java s collections

230834
button	popup
in windows i want the user to click and button and then a popup should make the user select the path of where they want to save the file

230856
benchmarking	profiling
you can use the pear benchmarking package for getting timing and profiling information

230861
protected	public
perhaps you have a public property which supplies access to it or maybe you declare it as protected and derived classes can use it

230877
midp	cldc
alchemo for iphone is capable of converting j2me applications utilizing an extensive subset of java-me cldc 1.1 and midp 2.0 including touch screens support and supports several jsr extension apis including the jsr-256 mobile sensor api

230907
contains	elements
your original list doesn t contains the variables names it just containss elements that refer to the same values as the variabless you listed

230911
zend-framework	cakephp
if you don t know how to do this i would use a php framework like zend-framework cakephp or symphony

230914
visual-web-developer	expression-web
for those features you need something more full featured like the already recommended and excellent expression-web or perhaps even visual-web-developer

230951
any	set
in addition you could also set any properties you have provided for the user-controls if you have

230953
.net	csla
csla .net for silverlight is a subset

230953
.net	csla
of csla .net targeted at the

230953
.net	csla
csla .net for

230953
.net	csla
benefits of csla .net on silverlight

230953
.net	csla
the result is that csla .net for

230953
.net	csla
with csla .net objects running on the

230959
variables	boolean
javascript is dynamically typed meaning variables can change type string number boolean on the fly and without casting

230963
kate	kde
i really like kate and since it s a kpart other kde programs use it as the editor so it s goodness everywhere

230966
children	nodes
have no children be a leaf nodes

230980
execution	restart
the stored-procedures are compiled only once unless specified and the execution plan is stored so a restart of the server wouldn t loose it

230985
web-services	webserver
i have a delphi webserver setup and running publishing web-services and i want to know some stuff on the calls to the web-services

231033
text-align	width
use fixed width divs with the css text-align property

231043
updating	updates
since they are updating very fast and have a rss feed of latest updates they are saving a lot of my time

231052
textbox	button
i have a page where a few textbox cannot be empty before clicking a save button

231086
sql-server	mysql
try if you can get the data out of mssql and into mysql by using the ssis dts packages you can generate with the import export wizard of sql-server

231092
vb.net	vb6
you mean vb6 vba or vb.net

231092
vba	vb6
in vb6 or vba you can do clng

231111
event-log	logfile
at a bare minimum you re better off having a component in the middle tier or even the database periodically write to a logfile windows event-log table etc

231117
32-bit	x86
long shot since you have a dependency on 32-bit code you should set target platform in the build property tab to x86

231145
macros	vba
for more details see migrating excel 4 macros to vba

231147
value	field
theoretically it should improve performance for queries using the indexed field but it really depends on the distribution of true false value and the other field involved in the queries that you re concerned about

231148
export	csv
a lot of export excel docs as csv or tab delimited and then running through a bunch of re transformations in textpad

231158
webforms	asp.net
i m writing an asp.net webforms app and i m using jquery for my ajax calls

231186
value	field
your best test for this would be to build the index and examine the execution plans for the 0 and 1 value of the bit field

231189
linux	unix
if code is on linux unix are find and grep the best method

231190
linux	bsd
going through the rest of your list i can t speak for against the file size right now but pyglet is being actively maintained in fact the devs were quite helpful to me on the bug tracker just two weeks ago is bsd licensed depends on nothing with optional avbin support for additional file formats it works for us on windows and linux

231200
exception-handling	error-handling
herb sutter s and andrei alexandrescu s book c++ coding standards comes with a whole chapter on error-handling and exception-handling including

231226
sql-server	mysql
this is the first time i have come across the adodb library and it supposedly is going to help me switch over from mysql to microsoft sql-server

231235
switching	router
at my last office job it wasn t that we shared spaces but the day that i decided to switching our office over to wireless router i found that there was already a wireless lan open to the world from the medical health facility right thru the wall in the office next to us

231283
configuration	environment
how do you manage configuration changes for each of your environment

231286
django-sphinx	sphinx
i d recommend sphinx for full-text search and aggregation and django-sphinx is good enough for production use

231286
django-sphinx	sphinx
we found that sphinx was the least resource-intensive and fastest way to index and search our document and that django-sphinx was a nice wrapper on top of the sphinx client

231290
python	perl
groovy python perl will all do search replace operations - use your favorite or pick one to learn

231302
exception-handling	error-handling
with c++ you should end up with less visible error-handling code anyway because you can leave a lot of the heavy lifting to exception-handling

231306
configuration	environment
as far as managing configuration changes i manage multiple configuration files with extensions that indicate the deployment environment and then just do a simple rename as a step within my build script

231308
http	ssl
the reason for this is because ssl is wrapped around http and the host headers is sent inside http

231329
updating	updates
feature activation code deactivation code and feature stapling should be used when updating any content updates

231332
32-bit	16-bit
using 16-bit variables on modern machines is actually less efficient than using 32-bit variables as no overflow code needs to be generated

231340
controller	routes
i have the routes set up for forward to the correct controller action by doing this

231346
contains	any
you could always allocate a type field adjacent to any primitive field which contains any needed metadata flags

231347
callback	methods
a callback will use that function on whatever data is returned by a particular methods

231347
callback	methods
again i m not sure how this particular library works ie what methods the callback will get called on

231395
put	get
if its a h1 tag it will put it in the h1 column and if its a title tag it will get put in the title column

231423
contains	set
when you index an integer column sql s index contains a set of rows for each index value

231423
contains	set
if your query looks for the index matching 1 and then where name contains fred assuming the name column is not indexed sql gets the set of rows matching 1 very quickly then table scans to find the rest

231423
value	field
when you index a bit field or some narrow range you only reduce the working set by the number of rows matching that value

231434
digits	zero
that is why the last three digits are zero after it has been put in the database

231463
spring-annotations	spring
as for the annotations the implementation of tag will scan the classpath for all classes with the spring-annotations and create spring metadata placeholders for them

231490
indexof	charat
when people call length indexof and charat methods they re interested in the character positioning not the byte positioning

231514
export-to-pdf	fdf
using openoffice.org writer one can easily make simple pdf forms since writer does xforms and can export-to-pdf and embed the form using fdf

231553
attributes	properties
a properties with a special descriptor the attributes

231562
shell	bash
not to bash no pun intended shell scripters but if you write perl and shell scripts all day then it might very well be hard

231586
attributes	properties
xml is somewhat subjective in terms of design - i don t think there are exact guidelines for how the elements and attributes should be laid out but i tend to go with using elements to represent things and attributes to represent singular attributes properties of them

231588
low-level	hardware
when they want to do something complex they can dig into the direct hardware access and fiddle at the low-level but at the same time they can do some pretty cool things such as build little webserver or pan tilt network cameras

231592
value	field
i want to be able to undestand the encryption used seems a simple one although is binary data to recover the value of the field for the tuples whose plaintext i don t know

231596
vbscript	basic
you can use getstring in vba which will return the recordset separated by any value you like comma dash table cells etc. although i have to admit i ve only used it in vbscript not visual basic

231607
repository	entity
user-interface asks for dto #1 you load entity from the repository convert it into dto #1 filling in only b and c and give it to the user-interface

231629
contains	elements
when desiging a format i tend to use elementss for holding data content and attributes for applying characteristics to the data like an id a name a type or some other metadata about the data an elements contains

231634
value	field
if your goal is to make querying for records where the bit field value equals 1 faster you might try an indexed view of your base table which only contains records where your bit field equals 1

231634
value	field
in theory this would increase the speed of selected queries which only look for records with a bit field value of 1

231642
value	field
i have an implicit scalar field defined in 2d for every point in 2d i can make it compute an exact scalar value but its a somewhat complex computation

231654
specifications	w3c
even within w3c specifications you can smell lisp in dash-separated-names of xslt and java in the camelcasenames of xml schema

231654
document	element
narrative document models such as html or docbook tend to put printable text in text nodes and metadata in element names and attributes

231666
arrays	loops
...i need to loops through all the in a and push them into an arrays and just pass that arrays variable to the function instead of a long string

231675
perforce	git
i was asked by shawn pearce you may know him from his git and egit jgit glory â he is the hero that takes over maintanance when junio is out of town to come in to help him train the google engineers working on andriod in transitioning from perforce to git so android could be shared with the masses

231679
display	width
if you do not use width and height attributes in the object tag the svg will be display in full size

231681
attributes	properties
the solution is to fetch the attributes in rows instead of columns and write a class in application code to loop over these rows assigning the values into object properties one by one

231681
attributes	properties
what i would look for in an eav framework is some boilerplate code that retrieves a multi-row result set like this and maps the attributes into object properties and then returns the collection of populated objects

231695
value	field
i need to store several date value in a database field

231695
value	field
i could use a one-to-many relationship here but each user will have exactly 4 date value tied to them so i feel that a one-to-many table would be overkill in many ways speed but if i needed to query against them i would need those 4 value to be in different field mydate1 mydate2 .

231706
http	ssl
you can do ssl cross-domain ajax using iframes as long as everything is http and the http scheme is used in the iframe src

231706
http	ssl
ssl certs 1 with backend request to bar.foo.com via http somewhat complicated

231724
sql-server	mysql
one of the things i really like about the tools for mysql that sql-server is missing out of the box to be certain

231733
any	set
i would say it is not any harder it just requires a different knowledge set different considerations

231737
linq-to-dataset	linq-to-sql
we use it and it is nice but linq-to-dataset is not as nice as linq-to-sql

231747
javascript	dom
if not walk your dom in javascript to find them inside the form you made - they ll be in the same order you inserted them

231755
put	get
depending on how much effort you want to put into it you should be able to get somewhere

231755
aes	rsa
if it s a recent well-regarded methods such as rsa or aes you re probably out of luck

231762
python	java
i don t know python but it sure looks like the underlying java object s equals and hashcode aren t honoring the required contract

231790
jquery	dojo
and really it s not that hard especially what with javascript frameworks like jquery and dojo around that take care of the scutwork

231807
printf	scanf
it also defines macros for use with the printf and scanf

231815
convention	standards
it is a standards naming convention for data types usually defined by typedef

231815
convention	standards
as a convention these names are in a standards header file stdint.h and end with _t

231818
32-bit	16-bit
in code where word-size and ordering is important it s very common to use custom defined types that are explicit such as byte word normally 16-bit dword 32-bit

231818
32-bit	16-bit
although these days most pc-centric development treats it as 32-bit much stuff for non-pc development still treat int s as 16-bit

231821
vb.net	vb6
i am working on a vb.net winforms app that was upgraded by visual-studio originally 1.0 or 1.1 from vb6 code which was itself upgraded from vb5

231824
internet-explorer	google-chrome
if you can get an enterprise lock-in then multiple browser support can become less of an issue if your customers are all companies using internet-explorer then why build the site to look good in safari or google-chrome

231824
google-chrome	firefox
i don t think i could see a logic to testing across all browsers as i initially fill out a form or do some other basic functionality as it could be a big productivity drain to test across at least a few browsers ie 6 7 firefox 2 and 3 opera 9.5 safari and google-chrome if one wants to get all the big boys and at least a couple o s as safari on a mac can be different than safari on windows which is a lot of tests even for just one or two pages

231840
switching	router
layers 4 and below each have a very specific purpose in moving the data switching router ensuring data integrity etc

231843
implements	abstract
the idea was to abstract away the complicated distributed transactional bits which would be implements by a containers such as websphere or weblogic leaving the programmer to develop business logic free from worries about storage mechanisms and synchronization

231849
weblogic	oc4j
oc4j orion will continue to be supported however the weblogic release is the future of the platform

231855
methods	extend
the extend methods is a list object methods that expects an iterable and adds its values to the list

231861
keyboard	mouse
if it was more than a few hours 3 then i could see it if you tend to optimize what you are doing at any moment when you are programming do you try to optimize where the mouse keyboard and monitor all are

231874
callback	methods
a callback is either a function an object instance methods or a static methods on a class

231903
debugging	trace
use the debugging log level to trace

231912
sigaction	signals
i was about to add an extra signals handler to an app we have here and i noticed that the author had used sigaction to set up the other signals handler

231914
profiling	debugging
when i need to optimize resources on any script i try always to analyze profiling and debugging my code i use xdebugging and the xdebugging profilingr there are other options like apd and benchmark profilingr

231930
sigaction	signals
it s possible to use both the signals and sigaction functions within

231930
sigaction	signals
the sigaction function specifies more information than the signals

231930
sigaction	signals
signals or sigaction

231931
keyboard	mouse
monitors under the simultaneous command of one keyboard mouse pair and i still

231937
hide	show
i am trying to show and hide an inline element eg a span using jquery

231942
logging	trace
imho logging every method entry exits is overkill and will also produce a noise especially since you can just embed a stack trace

231982
any	set
i worked on j2ee projects on health care systems that deal with enormous amount of stored data literally millions of patients visits forms etc and the general rule is not to show more than 100 or 200 rows for any user search advising the user that those set of criteria produces more information that he can understand

231988
configuration	logging
once this is done i can change the configuration again and go back to the light logging

231988
remote-debugging	debugging
at my current place of work we don t have the ability to do remote-debuggingging into our web-applications and we can t always tap into the production database without potentially augmenting data so having this full debugging is the next best thing

232003
formatting	printing
what s nice about this is you can take an exiting web page that is displayed to the user change the formatting slightly to remove any fancy banners or other ink hogging type images and then printing out what they see on the screen

232006
export	report
alternatively you can do export to excel by downloading data in csv format and letting the user construct their own report from the data

232009
itextsharp	itext
you should also look at itext and itextsharp

232022
account	userid
in other words if mysqld creates files owned by userid and gid mysql mysql then add your own account to group mysql

232039
pure-virtual	base-class
will work in general but not for calls within the constructor of the pure-virtual base-class

232039
subclassing	base-class
at the time the base-class in constructed the subclassing override doesn t exist so you can t call it

232041
http-patch	put
as i commented near the bottom of his blog it isn t clear how using http-patch is any better than using a patch document against http put

232041
http-patch	put
it is worth noting that although sam comes out against misusing http put he doesn t seem to advocate the use of http-patch either

232055
ccombobox	clistctrl
possibly faster than ccombobox with drawitem would be an owner data clistctrl

232058
webserver	host
otherwise you would have to use two separate ip addresses or the wildcard certificate as the other answers already mentioned the http headers including the host header which tells the webserver which site is being requested are encapsulated within the ssl tls connection

232081
constructor	object
alternatively make a factory method for creating the objects and make the constructor private the factory method can then initialize the object after construction

232089
linux	unix
one should prefer using sigaction to signal if possible as the signal has implementation-defined often race prone behavior and behaves differently on windows os x linux and other unix systems

232100
show	next
when i ll click the next button another new 5 images will be show in place of previously display images

232117
indesign	acrobat
using their server side modules you can have a designer create your document in indesign or illustrator then programattically drop in the dynamic fields on top even using acrobat to place the fields

232185
web-parts	ascx
web-parts are also able to accept connections from filtering web-parts on the same page giving additional flexibility to web-parts compared to hosting ascx controls on the site

232200
lazy-evaluation	maybe
maybe i m too old-school or too lazy-evaluation or both but i have to disagree

232213
dialog	pop-up
it s not the greatest for example i think you have to make sure itunes.exe is running in a desktop session and several commands can cause dialog to pop-up and block your automation but it does let you do things like create new play lists and add songs

232227
display	width
if display inline-block was well supported you could change the style to inline-block and then animate the width or height but unfortunately that won t work very well these days

232228
python	php
given that i am using mysql and php possibly python is there a better way to approach this

232230
directory	folder
the application totally behave like a normal asp.net application except for the directory or folder where users can create pages

232278
parentheses	braces
you can also use the command to jump between matching parentheses braces brackets quotes etc

232285
virtualization	virtualbox
there is also other virtualization software available virtualbox qemu etc that you could look into

232290
boolean	int
public boolean containssum int nums int sum

232307
margins	padding
try getting rid of the height rule on the anchor tags and using top bottom margins padding to ensure they fill the spaces

232308
ubuntu	linux
it is a good idea to keep practicing linux on vbox for windows in advance before switching using one of pclinuxos centos opensuse ubuntu

232322
sql-server	oracle
a dts data driven query task will let you insert|update data from the sql-server connection in dts to an oracle server connection in dts w o a temp table or a linked server

232345
licensing	platform
i m also wondering about platform coupling and source code licensing

232345
sharpdevelop	monodevelop
it appears that mono.addins was influenced by system.addins sharpdevelop and monodevelop

232347
python	java
concepts are preferred but examples in java c python ruby lisp etc

232351
put	get
i ve even found that the best way to write technical documents -- which i generally dislike doing -- is by doing some interesting coding even if it s prototyping or experimental or otherwise throw-away to put me in the right mode and just get my brain working

232370
launchd	daemons
an alternative and more complex solution would be to create a small windows service or unix daemons that checks periodically to see if there are updatess this service can download the updates and launchd the install

232379
anchor	nav
your nav anchor are inheriting line-height 2em from #header

232382
multiplication	modulo
so you want to use as little division as possible in favor of multiplication or modulo

232382
subtraction	addition
not shown are subtraction addition and comparison operators cause they blow all of these out of the water

232388
.net	wcf
this article contrasts wcf to .net remoting -- edit the key take away here shows that wcf throughput out performs remoting for small data but approaches remoting performance as data size increases

232424
any	set
you have some value set in the request object using setattribute from page 1 which you retrieve in page 2 using getattribute then if you try setting something again in same request object to retrieve it in page 3 then it fails giving you null value as the request that created the jsp and the request that gets generated when the jsp is submitted are completely different requests and any attributes placed on the first one will not be available on the second

232430
filtering	grouping
the problem was that the user being authenticated was a local account and by default local account have a filtering token with the builtin administrators grouping having a deny acl

232444
dataview	datarow
load your two-dimensional string arrays into an actual datatable system.data.datatable and then use the datatable object s selected methods to generate a sorted arrays of datarow objects or use a dataview for a similar effect

232459
.net	wcf
if you re using .net 3.0 wcf is likely your best bet

232467
silverlight	wpf
composite application guidance for wpf and silverlight

232468
realloc	malloc
also obviously in real code you d check that the return from malloc realloc isn t null

232476
command-line	cmd
but it is possible to run a vb6 project build from the cmd-line so it is possible to do simple vb development using any text editor ide capable of running a cmd an capture it s output

232486
aquamacs	emacs
i ve used slime within emacs as my primary development environment for common-lisp or aquamacs on os x but are there other compelling choices out there

232487
web-deployment	web
web-deployment projects can be used with either the asp.net web site or asp.net web application project options built-into vs 2008 and provide a few additional build packaging and deployment options for you to use

232491
default-value	arguments
if you call with an arguments not already in the map it inserts that key into the map with a value equal to the default-value of the value type 0 in the case of int

232500
.net	wcf
i have a wcf service up and running and am able to communicate between the service and a .net 2.0 client using basichttpbinding

232500
push	pull
the clients are part of a product that will be install in the wild and phoning home to push and pull data

232500
.net	wcf
what are my options for securing the wcf service and being able to authenticate from my .net 2.0 clients

232521
.net	wcf
using ssl certificate is the only option for .net 2.0 client accessing wcf service as basichttpbinding provides no security

232525
contains	elements
your motive in using a dotted border is to reduct contrast vis-a-vis the background visual elements contains it

232558
idisposable	ienumerator
i noticed that the generic inherited from idisposable but the non-generic interface ienumerator does not

232559
boolean	int
the functional spec is f int int - boolean not f string string - boolean which is kind of the domain of indexof

232562
for-loop	arrays
the actual extraction has to use a for-loop though as far as i can see array.copy requires the source and target ranks to be the same and buffer.blockcopy only works for value type arrays

232563
margins	padding
i have exhausted the various settings of margins padding sizes min max locations anchors.

232591
margins	padding
or has uc-a got a negative value for the bottom value of padding or margins

232602
idisposable	ienumerator
ienumerator t does inherited idisposable however whereas the non-generic ienumerator doesn t

232602
ienumerator	ienumerable
even when you use foreach for a non-generic ienumerable which returns ienumerator the compiler will still generate a check for idisposable and call dispose if the enumerator implements the interface

232607
idisposable	ienumerator
having ienumerator descend from idisposable ensures that it can clean up when enumerator is complete

232616
implements	extends
with c# 1.2 introduced in vs2003 - there s no 1.1 bizarrely foreach began to check in the finally block whether or not the iterator implements idisposable - they had to do it that way because retrospectively making ienumerator extends idisposable would have broken everyone s implementation of ienumerator

232616
idisposable	ienumerator
if they d worked out that it s useful for foreach to dispose of iterators in the first place i m sure ienumerator would have extended idisposable

232630
required	checked
plus you have to consider what is include in your login perimeter it is is an habilitation login process you need to have more that just the user name but also other parameters helping your java module to grant him access its grouping which might be in ldap but also the kind of action he wants to make in order to checked if he has the required accreditation level

232631
pointers	stack
two copies of all of your registers using different stack pointers is very simple and usually consists of a series of register pushes to save the current context a series of register pops to restore your new context and a return from interrupt instruction

232669
directx	xinput
i d rather not take all of directx -- is directinput and xinput separable from the whole directx sdk

232696
malloc	free
free uses the malloc chain to free the block that was allocated which does not necessarily have the same size as the arrays you requested

232700
rollback	commit
when you rollback a transaction the process will go back to the begining of the begin tran and you can be sure that nothing was made this is the way to commit queries and to safe rollback if the sql encounter an error.

232705
environment	building
depending on your building environment you don t specify you may find that it works in exactly the way that you want

232711
sigaction	signals
nevertheless it has a number of undesirable characteristics that sigaction avoids - unless you use the flags explicitly added to sigaction to allow it to faithfully simulate the old signals behaviour

232711
sigaction	signals
sigaction can block other signals until the current handler returns

232711
sigaction	signals
these are generally good reasons for using sigaction instead of signals

232711
sigaction	signals
afaik both signals and sigaction are ok in multithreading applications

232711
defined	declare
the behavior is undefined if the signals handler refers to any object other than errno with static storage duration other than by assign a value to an object declare as volatile sig_atomic_t or if the signals handler calls any function defined in this standard other than one of the functions listed in signals concepts

232725
display	height
set it on the innermost element will require a display block on your a-rule in addition to the height

232733
environment	building
it s documentation is a bit sparse-matrix and if you change your environment radically you ll need to reinstall it because it building devel cover inc with a bunch of information pulled from your environment at the time you install it

232750
put	get
therefore you could put the items the user has picked into a table then join from this table to the table containing the price then use the set function sum to get the total price

232756
malloc	free
then figure out when the memory that is about to be free d was malloc ed

232763
overwrite	import
next screen i selected no just import new settings overwrite my current settings and click next

232767
perl	php
in interpreted languages like php and perl it s trivial

232773
any	set
smoke testing is a way to run a set of basic tests on a build covering all the basic features but not going in depth on any

232773
any	set
it is also a set of steps that can be run quickly even on a developer build to determine if there are any issues due to some significant or core changes that are about to go in a build

232792
contains	any
however jet ace sql is pure and simple it has no control-of-flow syntax and a procedure can only contains one sql statement so any procedural code is out of the question

232805
average	min
in average the pages of our application take up to 20 mb min of memory

232813
contains	set
this reads a text file contains strings like setting1 value1 and calls set to set them as environment variables

232813
environment	execution
setlocal endlocal are used to limit the scope of the environment variables to the execution of your batch file

232827
contains	elements
so when designing a new site or design you create a page contains the desired html for all the visual elements that will be used on your site

232833
for-loop	loops
in the reviewer s ideal language you just well hack some ugly code crying because you don t have a for_while loops or c s for-loops

232876
selected	listbox
this means that the currently selected row in the listbox becomes the binding source for the two textbox controls

232909
python	ruby
a couple of dynamic languages like ruby and python have language constructs like mixins that solve the same problems

232909
dependency-injection	inject
spring and castle and a couple of other dependency-injection framework have options to add behaviour to the classes they inject

232918
any	set
that means if a methods is named set means any name might follow after set regardless of what the methods returns first asterisk or what parameters it takes third asterisk and it is a methods of mygraphicsclass and this class is part of the package com.company

232918
any	set
and our first code says after running any methods that is a set pointcut run the following code

232918
updating	updates
in the example above we have the aspect of updating the value of a graphical object and painting the updates object

232918
any	set
so a good usage of aop in my example would be to always log if any value has been updated via a set methods

232931
smalltalk	lisp
learn ruby learn groovy learn smalltalk learn lisp learn the difference between then both in theory and in practice

232953
perl	c++
then it generates the corresponding script for the following languages perl php python java javascript coldfusion c c++ ruby vb vbscript j#.net c#.net c++.net vb.net

232960
smalltalk	lisp
smalltalk comon lisp python javascript all have very interesting ways of implementing oop

232975
perl	c++
for example for c kernighan and ritchie s book the c programming language and linus torvalds linux kernel coding style guide or google s c++ style guide and for perl at least perlstyle - perl style guide

232982
ebnf	bnf
does anyone know where can i get the ebnf or bnf for erlang

233004
interceptor	inject
you can leverage inversion-of-control containers like castle-windsor to inject logging auditing into the commands without having to change your application at all using the interceptor pattern

233013
ruby	php
i m very curious how other languages php ruby java lua ocaml haskell handle recursion and why they handle it that way

233018
multiplying	transpose
if we could change it to something else for instance if we were to transpose the matrix and multiplying the other way around then it would be very easy to get a more succint and probably elegant way

233024
gethashcode	equals
or implement your own wrapper that overrides the equals and gethashcode

233027
windows-xp	windows
how to set the turbo c path in windows globally so that i can compile and run my c programs which are in other drives using command prompt in windows-xp

233027
command-prompt	cmd
can any one tell me how to get cmd at every drive in the command-prompt just by typing in

233033
model-view-controller	singleton
here the concreteregistry is a singleton in a poker game that allows the behaviours all the way up the package tree access the few core interfaces of the game the facades for the model-view-controller environment etc.

233047
command-prompt	cmd
and how to generate them using the cmd at ms-dos command-prompt using tcc for turbo c

233119
highlight	selected
i put the original text in a awt textarea component and then call selected 6 10 to highlight the area which was matched

233163
haskell	lisp
haskell caml lisp implementations all typically convert at least tail recursive functions to iterations you basically do this by spotting that it s possible that the function can be rearranged such that no local variables other than the return value are used after the recursive call

233163
pointers	stack
in assembler terms you don t have to preserve caller-saves registers if data-flow analysis tells you they re unused beyond the call and the same goes for anything on stack you don t have to move stack pointers on a call if you don t mind your bit of stack being scribbled over by the next recursion iteration

233166
multiplication	addition
you have an addition in either case but in the second one you have no multiplication you avoid the cpu time needed for one multiplication

233166
nsmutablearray	nsarray
if you use objects on the other hand for example an nsarray or nsmutablearray this is a completely different beast

233168
actionscript	mxml
the difficulty with flex is to understand how a mxml component maps the equivalent pure actionscript class

233170
arrays	loops
that said when iterating over the elements in an arrays taking a pointer to the first element and increasing it each time through the loops will usually be slightly faster than calculating the current element s position from the loops variable each time

233171
swing	swt
is there an example of some functional swing or swt wrapper

233188
display	width
when the windows is resized and also on page load the display is centered and the div s scrollbar positioning to the right of the page by setting its width

233188
display	width
if you go to the link in both ie and firefox resize width until 800 is display in the green box top-right and resize height until the scrollbar at the right is enabled you can see the problem

233189
version-control	git
i m using git as version-control

233195
quirks-mode	doctype
as long as you don t include a valid doctype you can t expect consistent results due to quirks-mode

233196
variables	boolean
if a thread throws an exception it is caught before exiting the thread the exception object is copied into some container in the main thread as in the simple solution and some shared boolean variables is set to true

233197
malloc	free
also make sure you link statically with the runtime libraries and do not try thing such as allocating memory pointers malloc 1024 in a module and then releasing that memory in another module free pointers

233216
tuples	set
i need to open an assembly that contains a set of concrete bll classes and return the tuples businessobjecttype concreteblltype inside a dictionary

233242
communication	messages
so i think that i have to create updates the communication messages to get it to do what i want

233288
put	get
note i have put the t with extra spaces otherwise they get stripped from the question

233333
any	set
there shouldn t be any problems with creating a little bit of javascript code that checks a cookie and displays a lightbox if the cookie is not set

233372
iframe	popup
i use iframe to load content from given strlink and then display that iframe as a child to generated div which is then converted to modal popup using jquery

233453
version-control	git
it is a distributed version-control system like git but integrates far more neatly and easily with windows

233457
directory	folder
it applied on the c windows directory while i called the command from the wwwroot folder

233491
arguments	default
i was not passing this arguments and the default depends on your selected look-and-feel

233503
assign	add
i add rel external or something similar and then use jquery to iterate through all links and assign them a click handler

233507
authentication	logout
is it possible to logout user from a web site if he is using basic authentication

233507
authentication	login
killing session is not enough since once user is authentication each request contains login info so user is automatically logged in next time he she access the site using the same credentials

233526
oracle	mysql
and for free one you can use anysql maestro which has support for oracle mysql sql server and offer anysql maestro for free

233528
configuration	environment
to avoid this you could use the environment variables option to store the configuration file path

233551
logout	login
what you have to do is have the user click a logout link and send a â 401 unauthorizedâ in response using the same realm and at the same url folder level as the normal 401 you send requesting a login

233551
logout	login
in short the logout script inverts the logic of the login script only returning the success page if the user isn t passing the right credentials

233551
logout	login
edit to add in response to comment re-log-in is a slightly different problem unless you require a two-step logout login obviously

233561
oracle	mysql
i m using oracle sql server mysql for different applications and site

233561
postgresql	mysql
i would require you go with mysql or postgresql if you don t need the advanced featuers of oracle

233564
operators	keyword
in this case if the keyword is found in the documenttitle it will not search the documenttext it uses the or operators

233587
visualsvn-server	trac
i m using visualsvn-server and i just got done installing trac

233600
normal-distribution	poisson
it can actually be approximated by the normal-distribution and also by the poisson distribution

233605
any	set
you can set the compiler to generate errors or warnings your choice for any usage of deprecated api

233617
versioning	migrate
we migrate to the same versioning you are on about a month ago and have not experienced the problems you are

233618
keyboard	mouse
edit after peeking at the kernel source actually patch history it looks like linux at least gathers entropy from keyboard presses mouse activity interrupt timing but not all interrupts and block device request finishing times

233618
keyboard	mouse
on a virtualized system i suspect that mouse keyboard events would be pretty low and thus not contribute to the entropy gathered

233640
silverlight	wpf
however a number of demonstration videos that i have come across have used silverlight while i haven t seen a single wpf demonstration

233640
silverlight	wpf
it was my understanding that silverlight was targeted towards website developers while wpf was more targeted towards desktop development

233687
hash	md5
i suppose you re aware of the attacks against the md5 and sha-1 hash

233687
hash	md5
in md5 there s actually possibility of hash collisions where as sha-1 is supposedly still secure but there are also rainbow table attacks against both of the hash

233691
authentication	login
i start as an authentication user on one organization s website convert specific information into an xml document encrypt the document with triple des and send that over as a post variables to the second organizations login page

233691
webforms	asp.net
this is being written in asp.net 2.0 webforms

233702
macros	vba
i had a vba project in outlook with a few email macros - but after a pc crash they are all gone and all i see is a fresh project1 when i hit alt+f11

233702
macros	vba
i m not a vba programmer but had a collection of handy macros for email sorting etc

233719
google-chrome	firefox
is there a similar way of reading the clipboard in firefox safari and google-chrome

233732
visualsvn-server	trac
if you use visualsvn-server installing trac on top of it is made easy with the help and downloads found at

233760
macros	vba
moving forward you might consider exporting your macros periodically in case this happens again either through the vba ide right-click and select export file... or using one of the tools mentioned in the linked article like the office profile wizard

233774
contains	set
you need to build the project contains the control you ve created and make sure your options are set for the toolbox to rebuild

233780
handler	service
i ll go off the track here and say i ve used monolithic wcf contracts functionally separated contracts with a maximum of ten methodss along juval s guidelines in his book and i ve also tried a message handling architecture where a service has a single methods that takes a base message and handler that know how to unwrap and process the message after it crosses the wire

233810
attributes	properties
a container with a strongly typed id properties and then an anonymous typed attributes properties would require code rewrites that don t weigh up to the add an id field requirement

233819
javascript	dom
the only data javascript can access it that contained within the page s dom the original markup plus any javascript-related modifications to the dom

233819
javascript	dom
javascript in modern browsers can parse any xml string into a dom and then access the content using dom-based methods

233819
http-get	get
you could get the svg file contents by issuing an xmlhttprequest-style request javascript performs an http-get on the svg file s url

233819
javascript	dom
the only javascript-based solution would require javascript to perform a get request on the svg file s url as above which is unlikely to be feasible - each page load might result in double-downloading each svg file and the parsing of the svg s xml into a dom by javascript might be too resource intensive

233819
javascript	dom
having javascript retrieve the svg s xml content and parse it into a dom to retrieve only the image dimensions is a bit overkill

233826
any	set
flag set this will include any

233852
product	invoice
then you have invoice line item product etc

233895
versioning	upgrade
the problem reports and solutions suggests that i upgrade to the latest retail versioning of visual-studio team edition for software testers which is not right

233909
decrement	increment
since there are only 4 possible orientations for each shape why not use an arrays of states for the shape and rotating cw or ccw simply increment or decrement the index of the shape state with wraparound for the index

233916
textbox	button
i have a winforms app with an input textbox button and a multiline output textbox

233931
selected	button
once you click that button to show the files in the solution directory that are not in a project you can selected all the files with shift-click and then right-click on your selectedion and selected include in project.

233936
hide	show
i basically want it so that when they click choose option 2 the options 1 div hide itself and the options 2 div show itself and then gives the second link the selected class and removes the class from the image link

233956
oracle	mysql
it may be optional in mysql but it is mandatory in some other dbmss for example oracle

233981
callback	methods
in the interest of code re-use if that s important to you i think it s cleaner to simply have the methods return a list and let the callback methods figure out how to display the data

233996
authentication	login
how can i identify the user arriving on site2 as the same user who already visited site1 and discover that they have already been authentication in order that they need not have to login a second time

234016
type-safety	generics
you can t do it like that - the point of generics is mostly compile-time type-safety - but you can do it with reflection

234024
jquery	.post
i want to .post with ajax in essence i m using a button to call a jquery function and want to pass the fields to a coldfusion page then have the results passed back

234084
perl	c++
do you know of any other implementation in c c++ or perl which i can try out before writing my own

234091
value	field
where a field can accept a null value there is an additional property which indicates if the value is currently null

234091
any	set
this works because the constructor of the class sets all nullproperties to true and the setting of any fieldproperty will cause the equivalent nullproperty to be set to false

234106
svnadmin	dump
1 dump the contents of the entire repository using svnadmin dump

234122
firefox	opera
also i think you ll find that safari and opera behave like firefox in most circumstances

234125
value	field
add more field to the form set their value before submit then submit

234132
triggers	insert
either your code is being executed twice or there s a triggers on the employee table that s attempting an insert following the successful insert

234177
triggers	insert
i know i could always delete all the records from database b s table and then just insert all the records from the text file even if i had to loop through each record in the dataset and apply row.setadded to ensure it triggers the haschanges flag but i d rather have it apply only the changes each time

234180
keyboard	mouse
i need something to capture and record mouse and keyboard events in addition to coded events

234181
sortedlist	sorted
i have a sorted collection of objects it can be either sortedlist or sorteddictionary i will use it mainly for reading so add performance is not that important

234185
linux	unix
from traditional unix and linux window manager perspective you don t control

234200
average	median
note that a true median would average the two numbers in the middle if count is even

234208
python	java
however practically i have to use a lot of java and use python a lot too

234208
python	java
no idea what limit java has but for python i had actually planned but have not yet done it to implement a decorator which would tail call optimize the decorated function

windows-xp	windows
i notice that windows-xp event viewer show a list of typical actions under system logs every time i start or shutdown windows and i can tell when my day starts and ends

234285
firefox	safari
if you don t expect -moz properties to work on safari and filtering on firefox you can ignore that warnings

234318
export	csv
you can get the data into oracle by export it as a csv and using sql loader to import it into the database

234322
constructor	object
put a breakpoint in the exception object constructor

234358
solaris	linux
in solaris you can use elfedit but i think you are really asking solutions for linux

234358
linux	unix
linux is not unix p

234420
constructor	object
not well documented but in vs2008 fstream takes a file object as a constructor

234423
64bit	x86
if you decide to go this route be sure to install opencv version 1.0 and install it to c program files opencv if you are on vista 64bit or mklink opencv c program files x86 opencv from the correct directory or else opencvdotnet will not install

234424
populate	row
how to populate a datagrid whose row order needs to update dynamically

234446
constructor	object
alternatively put the break point on the constructor of your exception object

234465
order	add
i sort the initial list and then add in sorted order which lets me use a more efficient library sort when i first populate the data

234469
sniffing	packets
scapy is a powerful packets manipulation tool and has all of the sniffing and monitoring capabilities as well

234486
ms-access	oracle
you can suck a spreadsheet into ms-access then push it directly into oracle as a table or append it to an existing table

234517
value	field
if so i d create a card class with an enum field for the suit and a numeric type with values 1 - 13 for the face value

234532
oracle	mysql
i saw something that would work using mysql but i need a plain sql or oracle equivalent

234558
selected	textbox
i ve tried placing this code in oninit and page_load but the effect is the same in either location -- viewstate is enabled the dropdownlist maintains selected value and textbox retains text that was entered

234568
value	field
note that other business-objects products order on the total of a summary field when sorting a cross tab by it s value

234580
development-environment	administration
in a corporate development-environment writing mostly administration software should every developer use their own database instance or should they use a central database instance during development

234590
ruby	php
for php scripts and passenger s user switching for ruby scripts

234590
ruby	php
and if any of the previous doesn t make sense - well i m the guy who s supposed to set up the python support not the guy who set up the php or ruby support so there s still some and then some magic happens steps in there from my perspective

234591
toupper	tolower
it is suggested in this so post that c# is more efficient with toupper because microsoft optimized it that way. but i ve also read this argument that converting tolower vs

234591
toupper	tolower
toupper depends on what your strings contains more of and that typically strings contains more lower case characters which makes tolower more efficient

234591
toupper	tolower
is there a way to optimize toupper or tolower such that one is faster than the other

234615
c-strings	c++
in c or when using individually-accessible elements of each string such as c-strings or the stl s string type in c++ it s actually a byte comparison - so comparing upper is no different from lower

234639
toupper	tolower
i can t say whether toupper or tolower is faster though

234648
project-management	project
it should be reanalyzed with a competent team with real project-management processes and lead by a project manager with experience in this situation

234649
contains	set
contains a permission set one or more

234650
sql-server	mysql

234700
internationalization	localization
are you looking for a tool to help you with string externalization alone internationalization or to help you manage the translation localization workflow

234700
localization	translation
are you planning to do the localization translation in-house or outsource it

234702
linux	unix
if you re working with linux or unix this is even less of an issue

234702
licensing	platform
also you can use single user development licences for database platform which can save you the cost of the workstations just in database licensing

234717
javascript	dom
you can use javascript to construct the embeds and insert them into the dom when a user clicks a button or something similar

234720
postback	ajax
otherwise the browser will submit the form and cause a postback even while the ajax callback is in progress

234731
snmp	mib
depending on the library you use and how it hide the details of integration with snmp you may have a hard time finding the correct parts of the mib to change and even knowing what or how to change them to do what you want

234732
put	get
the same as c++ except that the bullets the gun parts the tools you use to put it together the hospital you get taken to afterwards and the ambulance that takes you there are all owned by the same company

234732
perl	c++
there are also two alternate entries for perl and one for c++

234735
attributes	properties
in my specific implementation i added custom metadata attributes to methodss and properties and i had to invoke a securitymanager.test methods in each secured function as a final layer of authentication securitymanager.test was normally invoked to determine whether to show or hide pieces of a form and determine which button were visible in the user-interface

234742
tcsh	bash
what is the equivalent to the tcsh setenv function in bash

234752
telnet	ftp
often heard as in freela casts a tac nuke at shub-internet for slowing her down. a forged response often follows along the lines of shub-internet gulps down the tac nuke and burps happily. also cursed by users of ftp and telnet when the system slows down

234759
dynamic-programming	divide-and-conquer
do you know various techniques to create an algorithm greedy recursion divide-and-conquer dynamic-programming using custom data types like heap in heapsort etc

234768
stripes	jsf
i also came from a struts and jsf background into stripes

234768
stripes	jsf
i went from a large enterprise environment that used mostly struts and jsf on newer projects to a smaller environment that did all their j2ee in stripes

234768
stripes	jsf
if i had to start a fresh new project and i had my say i would choose either stripes or jsf

234802
any	set
the benefit of doing it this way is that it allows you to change the setting for flags.hidden without affecting any other flags that have been set

234816
json	xml
basically you just need a way to build up a graph of objects and then output them to some structured storage format json xml yaml whatever

234845
administration	account
i am looking for a way to change the password of a local user account local administration on a windows-xp in this case machine

234851
jquery	.post
using jquery s document.ready solves the issue of whether the dom is loaded before the .post occurs though there are other ways to do this without jquery

234888
sql-server	oracle
we are building an enterprise application in which we will incorporate multiple platforms for user interfaces asp.net webapp windows application and someday mobile apps and multiple platforms for back-end databases sql-server xml oracle

234892
.net	csla
with asp .net mvc ajax jquery out now would there be any use for the csla framework which is strongly object oriented in web apps

234896
.net	wcf
first the below is what your client would use in .net 2.0 to auth w your wcf service

234896
.net	wcf
the only thing i m not sure about is that to use the first section in the client app you might need the wcf wpf extensions ctp installed because i typically right click and add service reference instead of the asmx add web reference - if so this extension for vs2005 does require .net 3.0 to be installed

234902
enterprise-manager	toad
we put common prefixes on related tables to assure they display next to each other in our db management software toad enterprise-manager etc

234909
hl7	x12
i have some edi messages x12 hl7 etc ... stored in an oracle

234914
bmp	png
standard image formats bmp png jpeg tiff

databound	gridview
i am trying to create a databound wpf gridview whose rows can either be read-only or editable by double-clicking or through a context menu

234935
defined	declare
i have only one column defined in my markup -- column 0 a templates column in which i declare a selected link and another application specific linkbutton

234938
complex-numbers	matrix
this is somewhat confusing as a hessian is a matrix of mixed second partial derivatives and a library that couldn t handle complex-numbers would indeed be a problem

234969
.net	wcf
the problem isn t a mismatch between .net 2.0 services and wcf and the various bindings - they are with a few notable exceptions that shouldn t be a problem in your case very compatible protocols

234969
.net	wcf
i think maybe a good approach would be to look at the requirements from the .net 2.0 and wse side of things first - establish an authenticaion mechanism that fits with your client deployments then work out how to accept that authentication with wcf

234970
.net	csla
in a recent episode of .net rocks rocky lhotka talks about the upcoming version ov csla will have mvc support

234976
directory	folder
it was using the c winnt system32 or the asp.net temporary folder directory

234976
web-config	app-config
what is the best to access this file without having to use an app-config or web-config file

234995
rewrite	rule
rewrite the url dispatch rule to make the name capture non-optional and introduce a second rule to capture when no name is provided

234999
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
let me guess in netbeans it was loading it from the filesystems which is case-insensitive whereas when running it from the desktop it was in a jar file which is case-sensitive

235003
row	col
i have a flip int row int col methods that will flip the adjacent coins according the rules above and i have a issolved methods that will determine if the puzzle is in a solved state all heads

235012
code-readability	readability
i don t buy the argument of consistency for the sake of uniform code-readability especially if your reducing readability for consistency.

235017
controller	routes
if you don t want to configure your routes you ll need the controller in the url like so

235045
windows-xp	windows
you must assume your application will only be deployed on windows-xp or windows server 2003 or later and then you can use what is called registration free com to make this happen

235061
.when	ready
optimization should only be addressed .when the entire project is unit tested and ready for instrumentation

235078
soft-references	weak-references
after you figure out how much memory your objects are actually using with a profiling you may want to look into weak-references or soft-references to make sure you re not accidentally holding some of your memory hostage from the garbage collector when you re no longer using them

235080
hide	show
application c show and hide a form repeatedly

235081
any	set
i m developing a set of controls that can be dropped on a page for instance in sitefinity which is the cms system we use or for any other project we might have

235114
constructor	object
another thing to try if you know the number of object beforehand is to use the hashmap int capacity double loadfactor constructor instead of the default no-arg one which uses defaults of 16 0.75

235114
hashmap	arrays
if the number of elements in your hashmap exceeds capacity loadfactor then the underlying arrays in the hashmap will be resized to the next power of 2 and the table will be rehashed

235116
hashmap	arrays
the hashmap implementation starts by storing data in one of these arrays at a given capacity say 100 objects

235116
arrays	map
if it fills up the arrays and you keep adding objects the map needs to secretly increase its arrays size

235116
arrays	map
usually the code that increases the capacity of the map by copying items into a larger arrays is the cause of such a problem

235116
arrays	map
now your supposedly 50k map has a backing arrays of 100k

235126
keyboard	mouse
and you may find this page of firefox s default keyboard and mouse shortcuts useful another version of same information

235126
safari	opera
keyboard shortcuts for opera and safari

235127
webforms	asp.net
can you do ajax on asp.net webforms without using ajax toolkit

235142
getter	setter
in this i have a sessionvars class which does the grunt work for session state getter setter

235142
getter	setter
i then also add getter setter for specific types especially string since i often prefer to work with string.empty rather than null for variables presented to users

235142
getter	setter
i deploy on a web farm at work so added checks to my code in the core layer to see if the object is serialization another benefit of encapsulating the session getter and setter

235146
button	popup
i need to replace the standard overflow function in a toolstrip to a more... button which would then popup a menu with the overflowed items

235151
ruby	php
i m primarily a linux server-side programmer with experience in python ruby and php

235169
subtract	add
back in school on of my instructors said for business applications all you need to know know add subtract multiply and divide

235183
methods	extend
streamwriter and stringwriter both extend textwriter perhaps you could refactor your methods that uses streamwriter to use textwriter instead so it could write to either a stream or a string

235185
hide	show
the toolkit primarily include fancy controls especially ones with dhtml effects show hide mimic animation

235194
stringbuilder	stringwriter
you can do this with a stringwriter writing the value directly to a stringbuilder object

235198
python	lua
the most common implementation language for a-list games today is c++ and a lot of games embed a scripting language such as python or lua for game event scripting

235238
rewrite	rule
add an htaccess rule to rewrite the trailing slash

235246
python	c++
so 80 of the cpu might actually be spent in c++ code anyway despite the fact that most of your project is written in say python

235254
shell	bash
however i would like to instead be able to run the cygwin bash shell or any other non-windows shell from within emacs

235265
linux	osx
it is also mac osx compatible and has linux versions in the community

235268
detailsview	gridview
if you are using the gridview or detailsview control the datacontrolfield objects that are automatically created for example when the autogeneratecolumns property is true are not stored in the publicly accessible fields collection

235269
moss	wss
i m not sure whether the basic workflows in wss 3.0 will cater for your senario but the moss workflow should be more than adequate

235287
python	c++
as to what people have said about c c++ python i m a game developer and my company encourages c

235306
contains	any
it should not contains any unnecessary implementation details

235310
average	min
show max min average for the time range

235318
javascript	dom
then update the page with what you fetched using javascript the dom

235320
xml-serialization	xml
as suggested in the answer by rob cooper you can use pure xml as web service parameters and xml-serialization but there is a cleaner solution

235336
contains	set
because i guess the last thing you want is to have a set contains

235337
contains	set
must the set contains

235345
queue	fifo
do we create a deamon that churns through a fifo queue

235363
any	set
the problem i ve run into is that any target that sets its own value for compiler overrides the one that i set at the commmand line

235370
contains	set
either use a comparator or use a wrapper type to be contains in the set

235373
google-chrome	firefox
i ve been trying to modify the following menu to make it look indentical in ie firefox and safari google-chrome but i can t seem to get it to look right in safari google-chrome

235373
google-chrome	safari
when viewed in safari or google-chrome notice that the menu is ignoring the padding

235379
configuration	logging
logging configuration files

235384
put	get
stories that get added as the project go on get put into the right grouping and handled as appropriate for that grouping -- if it s current release enough detail to work with if later just the title as a placeholder

235387
postgresql	mysql
both postgresql and mysql are good options especially if you can use those in your production environment

235405
google-chrome	firefox
at least ones with bug trackers firefox google-chrome chromium etc

235408
reflection	runtime
even languages with some degree of runtime reflection .net would not support exactly this paradigm

235418
sequences	unique
the reason i want to do this aggregation is that the next step in the process is to do a sum and count grouping by the unique id s that occur within the sequences so that my final data will look something like

235449
python	perl
study moose mouse - it is modern oo system for perl it is much better that old oo system that was copied from python

235457
authentication	login
i suppose if anything the auth user-interface is neglected because fewer and fewer web sites are still using http basic authentication trending more towards various cookie-related login schemes.

235463
rhino-mocks	nmock
there are several open source mocking frameworks out there i personally recommend rhino-mocks or nmock

235479
iteration	set
each set of pieces would then be handled during an iteration

235492
python	ruby
ruby made this mainstream again but python can do it just as well

235517
sieve-of-eratosthenes	sieve
if this is still too slow for you you may want to pursue the sieve of atkin an optimized sieve-of-eratosthenes

235532
configuration	logging
since it was just a jar not a bundle it didn t make use of any fragments that could specify a custom logging configuration which leads us to the other thing that had to happen

235532
configuration	logging
i needed to set up a bundle fragment to specify the logging configuration

235532
configuration	logging
i finally figured out what was going on when i needed to log in another bundle i had just given up at this point and went back to using logs at the warn level and higher. this new bundle couldn t find a logging configuration

235533
google-chrome	safari
has anyone been able to create container-specific master pages for safari or google-chrome

235540
linux	unix
it s not a c++-style api but the api you aren t finding the linux unix correspondent of dos windows-style findfirst findnext is opendir readdir closedir

235551
defined	declare
i figured out that the only solution with the xsd defined like that was to declare the namespace twice once without a prefix in order to make it the default namespace for elements and once with a prefix in order to use it with the attributes

235553
attributes	properties
this can be specified by either setting the global build.compiler properties which will affect all tasks throughout the build or by setting the compiler attributes specific to the current task

235553
attributes	properties
valid values for either the build.compiler properties or the compiler attributes are

235553
attributes	properties
it sounds as if you can either specify the global build.compiler properties or set a specific compiler attributes

235556
show	next
i originally thought i d make an arrays listing all the elements randomly pick one show that one remove it from the arrays using splice and then randomly pick the next one from the remaining list - etc

235564
protected	public
the messagequeueexception-handling has no public constructor only the standard protected constructor for an exception-handling

235569
any	set
that s because each bit can be a number a month day of the week string a range 2-7 a set 3 4 saturday a vixie cron-style shortcut 60 5 or any combination of the above -- any single regex approach is going to get very hairy fast

235583
configuration	environment
for example back in the days of vss - on a friday afternoon i had to put out a fire and debugging a problem in prod environment so i changed the connection string in the appropriate configuration file

235599
display	width
newer versions of vim allow a value which sets the width of the line number display

235603
button	popup
the basic file upload feature that s in the html specs results in the browse... button that popup a file open dialog and uploads the raw file data as is to the server

235618
.net	wcf
i received an error when an referenced .net framework 2.0 assembly tried to execute the following line of code in an iis hosted wcf service

235618
.net	wcf
edit my question is what is the best way to open a configuration file app.config and web.config from a wcf service that is backwards compatible with a .net 2.0 assembly

235637
data-structures	tree
i do realize that traditionally data-structures like r tree are used for nearest neighbor queries and oct kd bsp are used for collision detection problems dealing with static objects or with very few moving objects

235657
attributes	properties
baz uses the properties built-in to implement the descriptor protocol for the attributes to override

235685
getter	setter
i mean if they re a pojo one class setter should take the other class getter as arguments

235695
button	slide
div id panel holds the form which slides down div class slide and the p tag is replaced by a tab button which hangs down via css clicking on this slides the tab down

235699
multiplying	addition
bit shifts are so simple where a multiplying could be a shift and an addition that this makes sense

235699
32-bit	64bit
it says multiplies are 3 in 32-bit or 4 in 64bit cycle operations where shifts are 1 and adds are 2

235702
naming-conventions	conventions
the best naming conventions set that i ve seen is in the book code complete steve mcconnell has a great section in there about naming-conventionss and lots of examples

235739
instances	private
instances usually private variables

235744
jar	war
the war will get updated and place a jar in the web-inf lib containing the pre-compiled jsps

235744
jar	war
you can also just work with the ojspc jar directly and avoid trying to configure the oracle compilejsp task the code below takes a war file and pre-compiles the jsps in it

235788
hash	md5
to elaborate there are 16 bytes in an md5 hash

235814
kate	kde
there s also kate if you run kde

235828
instances	private
certainly a private db instances should be provided

235828
linux	osx
mysql tomcat osx for one db2 jetty linux for another postegres geronimo winxp for a 3rd etc. if you setup an asp application service provider type shop on an iseries on the other hand then of course you ll likely have a central host with all dev dbmses still each dev should have at least a separate db instance to allow structural changes to schema

235835
pixels	line
computer graphics is simply about filling in pixels on a grid screen so you need to work out which pixels to fill in to get a line that goes from x0 y0 to x1 y1

235841
curly-braces	braces
to indent a curly-braces block put your cursor on one of the curly braces and use

235849
postback	ajax
one of the things that i have done is to record the state of a check via ajax in the session then on postback full or partial via ajax look in the session for the items to perform the selected action on

235852
device-driver	hardware
finally you dive into a device-driver that interfaces with hardware

235852
device-driver	hardware
the direct experience with circuitry and hardware-software integration gave me a good appreciation of the difficult design decisions - to paint rectangles using clever hardware in the device-driver or higher level

235855
background-image	width
i m trying to get a background-image of a html element body div etc. to stretch its entire width and height

235894

solaris	linux
gnu linux or solaris 2 or on

asp.net-mvc	webforms
i would love to kick webforms to the curb and do all my stuff in asp.net-mvc but alas legacy code is a tarbaby and rewriting is almost never the answer so i plug onwards.

236001
malloc	free
my understanding is that in unix when memory is free the memory doesn t get returned back to the operating system it stays in the process to be used again for the next call to malloc

236009
integer	zero
you can save the state in either the registry or on the filesystems by for example attempting to read an integer from a file set it to zero if the file s not there add 1 and write it back to the same file

236012
malloc	free
malloc does not normally return the free memory to the operating system

236027
contains	any
why not write a debugger that will simply tell you whether or not your program contains any infinite loops

236051
sql-server	oracle
ie don t code extra stuff into some business class that stores its data in oracle to enable you to put it into sql-server at some point in the future

236055
linux	unix
neither unix linux windows needs that a free actually return the memory back to the os

236058
protected	public
putting huge java comment section headers for the public private protected fields constants etc throughout your file

236062
perl	ruby
there are exceptions for example it can sometimes treat a as the start of a regex as in perl ruby

236106
document	element
in valid document this would be the end tag for the element

236108
asp.net-mvc	webforms
fdt is made for webforms mainly and it will take you some time to integrate it properly with asp.net-mvc

236111
malloc	free
on linux with glib the memory is actually always returned to the os above a certain size glib malloc uses mmap for big allocations controlled by mmap_threshold and in that case free calls munmap which frees automatically the reserved memory

236137
printf	scanf
for example printf and scanf both are faster then cin and cout significantly the fopen syntax is a lot more friendly for binary types and they also tend to produce smaller executable

236148
put	get
if you put any of their code in your box then you have to make sure you are operating within the terms of their license and they will almost certainly make you jump through some hoops to get yourself approved by them

236151
version-control	git
i recently started using git as my version-control system for some cocoa projects i m working on and wondered if there are best practices for working with version-control systems on cocoa projects

236152
versioning	upgrade
then we had to support several different ecel versioning and upgrade of our content between them

236172
boost	stl
preferably using the stl or boost

236185
export	report
the problem i ve encountered is that the asp.net reporting tools i ve looked at do a great job in creating the report but the export to excel is not as robust as i d like

236186
traffic	packets
netem is a linux tc traffic control discipline which can delay add latency packets leaving a host

236193
standard-library	boost
probably there is a better solution inside boost or using the standard-library

236197
gridview	listview
with the listview + gridview control il quite complex because this control thinks in column so you have to create a template for every column and switch the read-only template with edit template for every cell

236211
subclassing	inherited
the subclassing externaljavascript.class would then automatically get the source variables but i feel it s easier to read the code if all the subclassinges themselves define the source instead of from inherited

236219
quirks-mode	doctype
it s likely something to do with quirks-mode which some browsers invoke in the absence of a doctype or the presence of a malformed one

236221
smtplib	imaplib
you can build one using email for generating and parsing mail imaplib for reading and managing incoming mail from your mail server and smtplib for sending mail to the world

236229
getter	setter
your getter setter should do what they say on the tin

236231
packets	lan
packets will be entirely contains within an administrative domain probably a lan

236231
multicast	packets
if several independent instances of my application are in use on the same network they could each use their own multicast address - but if they don t they will be able to coexist anyway they ll just have a small amount of overhead ignoring each others packets

236278
python	c++
uses gccxml to generate wrappers for c++ code to interface python

236280
abstract-class	subclassing
the whole idea of abstract-class is that they can contains some behaviour or data which you require all subclassing to contains

236320
disposable	dispose
you can - kind of make your object disposable and then dispose it yourself

236323
double	int
i need to compare the int part of two double for inequality and i m currently doing this

236323
double	int
if i used math.truncate instead of a cast to int would it still be accurate to compare the two resulting double values for equality

236335
unsigned	integer
if being signed is the problem i can solve this by making the integer unsigned but this would only be a temporary solution as the next iteration yields 938043756000 which is far above the 4294967296 limit

236337
malloc	free
malloc uses also mmap particularly for large allocations where a whole chunk of memory can be easily returned after being free

236339
bmp	gif
you can try it online provided you can transform your bmp into a gif first

236340
double	int
edit realized that if you are comparing int parts of double casting to int values first runs the risk of overflows should your double be outside the range that could be represented as int

236352
return-value	arguments
since factorials can by definition only be positive and can only be calculated for positive numbers both the arguments and the return-value should be unsigned numbers anyway

236355
multicast	packets
you should have some logic in your application to handle foreign packets to alert the user through logs or some other mechanism that your application has detected multicast packets from another app with instructions on how to change the configuration

236371
log4net	nlog
then you should log with something like nlog or log4net

236387
for-loop	loops
i would ideally like to do it in one while of for-loops but i m not sure how to tell that loops what the order of the fields is going to be so it can fill all 8 or 6 strings correctly

236399
python	java
but does using c++ over other languages like java ruby python for qt development have still major advantages let s say about qtopia

236403
javascript	dom
i have a javascript code where i am creating an xml dom and sending using xmlhttp it to a codebehind page

236407
python	java
in c++ java the compiler will find it for you how do you do it in python

236407
python	java
as you can guess i almost only worked with statically typed languages c++ java but i would like to try my hands on python for larger programs

236410
integer	zero
it rounds to the nearest integer towards zero

236411
integer	digits
is_int returns true if the argument is an integer type ctype_digit takes a string argument and returns true if all the characters in the string are digits

236412
web-config	app-config
when i build and deploy there is no settings file or app-config in the bin directory with the data-access .dll but changing the connection string in the web-config file doesn t change the database accordingly - so the connection string must be compiled into the data-access dll

236420
updating	updates
for example if these parameters are part of the selected command then add them to the selecteding event if they need to go with the updates command then add them on the updating event

236421
python	java
our company use java c++ and python

236439
double	int
the point is i need to compare the int part of two double and i m just casting them to int and then using but as someone pointed out in one of my earlier questions this could throw an overflow exception-handling if the double can t fit into the int

236439
double	int
so the question would be is it correct to use the operator to compare two double that have previously been rounded to 0 or should i stick to the casting to int methods and catch a possible exception-handling

236464
constructor	object
in your web project have a static class that loads your settings including your connection strings and when you create your dal object or data context if creating it directly just pass it in to the constructor

236473
value	field
i never like the idea of serializing multiple value into a single field so delimited strings stored in one field don t appeal to me.

236483
apache-felix	bnd
alternatively the apache-felix bnd plugins also seem popular

236486
web-config	app-config
populate key connectionstring values for your various dev qa prod servers and drop them into your various app-config web-config etc

236496
compression	streaming
how do i know at what the minimun size of the xml that would warrant a performance improvement by compression the xml rather than sending over the regular streaming

236515
python	java
you don t write java c++ python php erlang whatever the same way

236515
python	java
i screwed myself trying to code java like python

236534
google-chrome	safari
i ve just had a look at the webkit google-chrome safari â source

236534
quicksort	mergesort
contiguous arrays of non-numeric type are stringified and sorted using mergesort if available to obtain a stable sorting or quicksort if no merge sort is available

236536
directory	folder
unpacking all .zip files within a single deeply nested directory structure may require only on stack but you need to shorten the threshold a bit to account for folder in the .zip etc

236539
arguments	default
you only can provide the default property in c# with an arguments to model indexed access as in a dictionary

236556
version-control	bazaar
the bazaar version-control system is obsessive about automated testing

236570
python	java
partly it s because i have intellij for quick and easy refactoring when i use java which i don t have for python

236603
children	tree
nested set tree are one parent to multiple children

236616
coalesce	isnull
a particular nasty t-sql example is the use of isnull use coalesce

236631
swing	awt
swing and awt

236652
debian	linux
i am trying to use timerfd_create and timerfd_settime under debian linux lenny

236669
revision	svn
is there any easy way to access the svn repository revision number and store it in a c++ string in a c++ visual-studio application

236671
children	nodes
to get the children nodes use obj.childnodes that returns a collection object

236678
quirks-mode	doctype
not having a doctype makes browsers use quirks-mode rather than interpreting your code in line with the standards

236709
uniq	grep
-name .java | xargs cat | grep import java | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -100

236715
value	field
i want to create a filtering field on a page such that whenever the input-field s value changes i filtering a list shown below via ajax

236718
python	java
this doesn t happen as much in python as it does in java and c++

236737
perl	php
perl and php do this with backticks

236740
ruby	php
the above is also valid php and ruby for example uses the same backtick notation as well

236784
s#arp-architecture	nhibernate
i think that billy mccafferty s s#arp-architecture is a quite nice example of using asp.net-mvc with a data access layer using nhibernate as default dependency injection ninject atm but there are plans to support the commonservicelocator and test-driven development

236793
gwt-rpc	gwt
is there a way to do something similar with gwt gwt-rpc

236796
.when	ready
.when you re ready to tackle process changes bring in imperative development

236822
settings.settings	app-config
the dll s settings.settings and the exe s app-config files this does allow me to change the database connection in yourapp.exe.config before the app runs

236826
onkeydown	onkeyup
in general for text inputs you want to use onkeypress onkeyup onkeydown events not onchange for this type of autocomplete

236826
javascript	dom
here is there page on javascript html dom

236838
solaris	unix
i d like this to be as platform-independent as possible meaning it has info that s relevant for any linux distro as well as bsd solaris os x etc but the unix systems that i use the most are os x and debian ubuntu

236862
javascript	dom
however if you use javascript which actually manipulates the dom sets the x-position offset to -293 if the person has scrolled right 293 pixels just like in css then it will show up as such in printed documents

236873
stderr	stdout
what follows below is just the core runtime.exec plus 2 thread to listen to stdout and stderr

236882
lookup	any
the other is to create the report based on salesline and use displaymethods to lookup any fields you need from inventtable or custtable

236890
shell	bash
learning the bash shell

236905
wordpress	blogs
wordpress blogs provide an easy way in the editing interface for the blogroll to add these tags

236912
average	minimum
in addition by running an all-pairs shortest path algorithm you could find out the minimum maximum and average number of degrees of separation for the entire network

236923
player	movie
i know the xbox already has this ability but i want my custom dvd player to allow users to save bookmarks for parts of the movie they really like and then browse their bookmarks later when they put the dvd back in

236926
export	csv
i don t want to have to reproduce the spreadsheet from scratch to deliver the export nor do i want to manually extract the proper columns into csv before making the import

236957
if-statement	loops
i also appreciate the smart indentation it offers for coding if-statement loops etc

236967
linux	unix
nfs nis for those using or maintaining unix or linux clients

236967
linux	unix
the linux documentation project www.tldp.org has many specific topic guides known as howtos that also often concern third party oss tools and will be relevant to other unix variants

236967
linux	unix
there are many many unix and linux resources on the web

236969
text-editor	editor
you may not be able to directly query the text-editor gui control for its content but you can create your own messaging module and have your own message editor or you can read messages in the draft and outbox folders of the local store

236979
perl	php
i m using preg perl syntax in php

236984
bison	yacc
you could again convolute the heck out of it to avoid that but it s probably even better to avoid regex s altogether here and handle it by parsing one field at a time perhaps by using a recursive-descent parsing or yacc bison or whatever

236992
linux	unix
given that there are valid reasons for selectively updating from a repository when there are a lot of downstream changes available my question would be whether you re trying to do this on a unix linux etc

237001
getter	setter
a simple java class that takes an object and test all the getter and setter methods

237001
getter	setter
i do think you should avoid getter and setter methods as much as possible but as long as they re around and it takes two lines to test them it s a good thing to do it

237002
display	width
so i guess unless you find a fixed width font contains the characters you want to display then you are out of luck

237009
python	ruby
neither python or ruby are a substitute for objective-c via their respective bridges

237009
python	ruby
pyobjc and rubycocoa are a great way to access python or ruby functionality from a cocoa application including building a cocoa application mostly -- if not entirely -- in python or ruby

237022
getline	istream
use getline istream string to read in a full line at a time not including the eol

237025
command-prompt	cmd
try running the following cmd at the command-prompt assuming your server name is sqlexpress

237027
base-class	inherited
here s my problem i have a virtual methods defined in a .h file that i want to call in a class that inherited from the base-class

237027
methods	extend
in the methods above i need to be able to pass in one of many kinds of objects that all extend the ofxbasesndobj object

237028
for-loop	loops
the truth is python performs the above two steps anytime it wants to loops over the contents of an object - so it could be a for-loops but it could also be code like otherlist.extend mylist where otherlist is a python list

237028
for-loop	loops
when the for-loops tries to loops over the generator object the function resumes from its suspended state at the very next line after the yield it previously returned from executes the next line of code in this case a yield statement and returns that as the next item

237038
fileinputstream	filechannel
reading files using java nio s filechannel and mappedbytebuffer will most likely result in a solution that will be much faster than any solution involving fileinputstream

237059
constructor	private
making the copy constructor and operator private is an effective way of preventing this bug from happening again

237069
procedure	records
note in the example test run only two rows are returned to the report for rendering though within the stored procedure it may have been working over thousands or even millions of records in order to collate the result passed back to reporting services

237070
average	median
however the constant factors will be huge and if worst case performance is your primary concern use a merge sort instead which is only a little bit slower than quicksort on average and guarantees o nlgn time and will be much faster than this lame median quicksort

237074
private-members	object
this is because a class is automatically a friend of itself so object of type paragraph can examine each other even each others private-members

237091
enterprise	platform
i have been considering upgrading to sql2008 but because our dev test and production platform are all sql2005 enterprise edition i do not like the idea of deviating my local environment from the current standard

237091
versioning	upgrade
did sql express 2008 just install all the bids bits i need without requiring me to upgrade my local versioning of sql-server

237107
ruby	php
is there a way to send mail directly via ruby and skip all the rails models and complexity just like php s mail function

237111
istream	ostream
for char istream and ostream

237118
required	checked
be required to checked it out from revision control

237140
value	field
the benefits of this are that each subclass doesn t have to define its own set of field and can still access the key and value by their accessors

237140
subclass	accessor
if a subclass truly needs to define its own behavior for the accessor it can implement the map.entry interface directly

237140
superclass	inherited
bloch warns against calling overridable methods item 17 from classes designed for inherited as it leaves the superclass vulnerable to changes made by subclasses

237141
arrays	loops
i d do what ovidiu pacurar suggests only i d use a foreach loops and leave dealing with arrays indexes up to the compiler

237145
radio-button	selected
how can i determine if the checkchanged event occurred due to a user clicking or selected the radio-button vs programatically setting the event with

237151
linked-list	arrays
edit changed reference to linked-list t instead of arrays linked-list. i think this was what was meant based on the context

237155
python	c++
language isn t a huge deal but c c++ and python are preferrable

237176
arrays	loops
as others have said the iteration through the arrays is probably the best way but it has been proven that a decreasing while loops is the fastest way to iterate in javascript

237181
contains	set
i think this is the most clean solution for replacing a certain set of symbols from a string contains a superset of them

237206
value	field
just wrap the existing methods or create a new one breakout synthesize whatever value you need store them in your new field and then super session self .save

237208
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
to hide the uinavigationbar you ll want to use the navigationbarhidden property of your uinavigationcontroller

237209
perl	php
any python libs for parsing apache config files or if not python anyone aware of such thing in other languages perl php java c#

237211
contains	set
i have plone product that uses a custom folder type for contains a set of custom content objects

237215
python	perl
no python libraries exist that i know of but here s a perl one

237216
arrays	map
there are many different collection types like linked list arrays map set etc

237220
display	width
i m looking for an algorithm that places tick marks on an axis given a range to display a width to display it in and a function to measure a string width for a tick mark

237220
display	width
for example given that i need to display between 1e-6 and 5e-6 and a width to display in pixels the algorithm would determine that i should put tickmarks for example at 1e-6 2e-6 3e-6 4e-6 and 5e-6

237222
contains	any
doesn t contains any repetition worth worrying about but it isn t particularly robust

237225
contains	any
another possibility could be to create a log table that stores this information and it could be made to contains keep track of updates for any entity

237249
webforms	asp.net
i m looking at the mvc account controller and it seems to be from asp.net webforms

237254
mouseover	mouseup
the jquery documentation says the library has built-in support for the following events blur focus load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change selected submit keydown keypress keyup and error

237258
installation	building
set up a double-click full building from source control to installation medium ideally on a separate pc

237275
value	field
i m constructing a methods to take in an arraylist presumably full of objects and then list all the field and their value for each object in the arraylist

237291
emacs	vim
this was done for powershell and i was curious if there was any similar functionality implemented for emacs or vim

237291
emacs	vim
a fellow developer i work with wants to use either vim or emacs for the low overhead without running visual-studio

237291
emacs	vim
in essence he would like to be able to write tests edit code in emacs or vim then just run nant scripts to compile the code and run the tests

237296
precompiled-headers	stdafx.h
when using precompiled-headers they are allowed of course - the #include stdafx.h in msvc

237309
32-bit	64bit
how does the jvm handle a primitive long which is 64bit on a 32-bit processor

237309
32-bit	64bit
how much slower are 64bit operations on a 32-bit machine

237316
32-bit	64bit
a 64bit long is basically stored as two 32-bit ints

237316
order	add
in order to add them two additions are needed keeping track of the carry bit

237316
multiplication	multiplying
multiplication is kind of like multiplying two two-digit numbers except each digit is in base 2 32 instead of base 10

237316
multiplication	addition
an addition requires two adds instead of one and a multiplication would i think require four multiplies instead of one

237319
uinavigationcontroller	uiview
you can switch to a uinavigationcontroller uiviewcontroller based hierarchy and hook your current opengl uiview to a uiviewcontroller s view outlet

237323
value	field
you cannot set field value in the row objects and call save to post changes back to the database

237330
32-bit	64bit
generally the benefits of being able to address larger amounts of memory come with a small performance loss in 64bit vms versus running the same application on a 32-bit vm

237330
32-bit	64bit
the performance difference comparing an application running on a 64bit platform versus a 32-bit platform on sparc is on the order of 10-20 degradation when you move to a 64bit vm

237341
boost	stl
i ve used a lot of templates code mostly in boost and the stl but i ve seldom had a need to write any

237341
32-bit	64bit
the company wanted to add 64bit support but the exefile class that i d written to handle the files only worked with 32-bit ones

237341
32-bit	64bit
the code required to manipulate the 64bit version was essentially identical but it needed to use a different address type 64bit instead of 32-bit which caused two other data-structures to be different as well

237343
revision	updates
one of the drawbacks with this approach is that it is more difficult to support upgrading to a new version from a version several revision prior without having to perform each incremental updates

237350
setinterval	settimeout
i am trying to call a settimeout from within a setinterval callback

237350
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval works as expected but settimeout call is failing

237356
boost	stl
templates i regulary consume are a multitude of container classes boost smart pointers scopeguards a few stl algorithms

237356
double	int
bool containsnan double int

237367
postgresql	mysql
or is this just because of the versions i am using php 5.2 mysql 5.0 postgresql 8.1

237387
setinterval	settimeout
as a matter of best-practice try not to use strings as parameters to settimeout and setinterval because that will invoke eval .

237390
contains	any
this will also block out any urls contains anything but an integer and also prevents the need for a nullable int

237404
triggers	insert
i would stick with that approach and put insert and update triggers on each table to populate those columns

237410
keyboard	mouse
i have this vague feeling that beos used to let one pair a mouse and keyboard and have separate active windows and inputs

237432
base-class	subclass
i have a base-class with a property which the get methods i want to overwrite in the subclass

237453
entity-framework	ado.net
linq to sql and the ado.net entity-framework wonderful features.

237472
emacs	vim
also whichever editor you prefer vim or emacs learn it back forth

237475
c++	lua
luabind is a pretty cool practical example quite a nice binding dsl for binding c++ classes to lua

237491
fwrite	fread
i m not sure if it will work to use standard i o functions such as fopen fread and fwrite

237494
webforms	asp.net
asp.net state management and webforms

237502
apache	vhosts
what solutions do you have in place for handling bandwidth billing for your vhosts on a shared environment in apache

237508
arrays	loops
blitz++ does some impressive things with templates for instance a single readable line of code can be turned into a set of loops over a multidimensional arrays automatically optimized for the best traversal order

237541
value	field
you could also do something like changing a flag field value on mousedown for the radio-button then reverting the flag value on mouseclick

237560
boost-function	boost-lambda
i would have to say boost-lambda boost-function and boost.bind and the way that they all work seamlessly together

237601
procedure	records
so for example even if an application or a stored procedure needed to insert updates delete records from a table they d do that against the corresponding table wrapper view not against the table directly

237658
.when	ready
discuss the implementation one piece at a time .when the developer is ready to code it

237659
put	get
if you put this in a class you will need to get the control reference like

237660
google-chrome	safari
since google-chrome uses webkit it has the same rendering engine and dom support as safari not necessarily the same revision of webkit though

237660
google-chrome	safari
by testing in safari you can generally get by without worrying about google-chrome

237660
google-chrome	safari
however because google-chrome uses a different javascript engine there may be a few incompatibilities with safari

237660
javascript	dom
generally though you don t target browsers you target rendering engines with their associated dom support and javascript engines

237675
button	popup
select text from a webpage i pulled up using my web browser control.after clicking a button while this text is still selected i would like a message box to popup displaying the text that was highlighted by the user

237683
value	field
you could set the text field s value from the text field

237695
click	mouse
assuming you are using a modern ide finding the methods you want is rarely more than two mouse click away so i am not sure what having a particular way of organizing your methodss would get you

237715
oxygene	delphi
what i mean are about not the delphi for .net or oxygene tech plugin but clean .net c#

237716
iteration	elements
the chosen elements on each iteration are input to the first elements of the sequence

237716
combinations	permutation
from here i was able to find exact implementations of many of the exact algorithms i needed combinations permutation etc.

237724
deployment	install
re deployment first install the .net on the client

237745
double	int
it would return comparators for stuff like string double int but would have a

237763
integer	zero
i m assuming this is because oledb is treating that column as an integer the data points come through without their leading zero also and that 0004100000007 is greater than the largest integer value

237774
xstream	jibx
finally as others have mentioned if you could it s a good idea to consider an xml marshalling library jaxb castor jibx xmlbeans xstream to name a few

237817
reflection	runtime
as an abstraction note that reflection isn t the only option it is also possible for a type to expose it s properties on-the-fly at runtime like how an untyped datatable dataview exposes columns as properties

237818
directory	folder
this basically adds a .git folder to the current directory

237832
attributes	properties
i have a very simple class with nothing other than properties with xmlattribute xxx attributes

237837
constructor	object
with types that have longer names or types that you have no hopes of having such a nice constructor for sans writing an adapter it might be a nice addition for on-the-fly implicit object creation and initialization

237843
directory	folder
cant i simply just ftp the blog folder to one of my virtual directory and then access it online

237844
.net	wcf
wcf aims to replace .net remoting the alternatives can be net.tcp binding or net.pipe

237859
double	int
it will either double print each string and add the int together or it simply returns the integer depending on how i format it

237862
linked-list	tree
your momma s so fat that when she sat on a binary tree she turned it into a sorted linked-list in o 1

237868
xml-serialization	xml
elements centric xml is more interoperable format in xml-serialization

237868
attributes	properties
this is the reason that the new wcf datacontract serialization serialization every properties as elements instead of attributes

237876
tuples	any
i could create a new tuples or list with the resulting values and then assign them to the individual variables but i don t see how it would be any better than do it this way except that it won t look so copy pasted

237880
authentication	login
of course this method can only be used if authentication is carried out by sending the actual user password to the server at login since database only desirably contains the hash of the password

237914
logfile	tail
ok i am trying to use tail to monitor a logfile but i cannot get the same behavior programatically as when i manually run it through cmd prompt using the same parameters

237938
xsd	xml
we have a few xml based interfaces that is quite well documented in xsd schemas

237955
linux	osx
i regularly use osx windows and linux and the only times i get confused is when i m running xp under vmware on my macbook

237956
buffering	streaming
in most languages and operating systems the standard streaming is usually buffering but the error streaming is not

237961
emacs	vim
to a lot of people this is an issue which prevents them from attempting to use emacs or vim when working with rich large unwieldy delete as applicable apis

237961
msbuild	nant
as an aside if your colleague is working in a team and other members working on the same project are using visual-studio msbuild might offer a better solution for building outside of vs than nant as msbuild reads the same solution and project files that vs uses in fact a lot of the build work in vs2008 is handled by msbuild

237969
cos	sin
the scalar - circle projection is simple as x cos v pi r y sin v pi r where x y is the resulting vertex point r is a radius and trigonometric functions work on radiances not degrees

237970
unique	words
relevance is computed based on the number of words in the row the number of unique words in that row the total number of words in the collection and the number of documents rows that contains a particular word

237977
authentication	login
i m trying to redirect the user after they ve successfully authentication or return them back to the login page

237982
restrict	shared
with shared tomcat access to server.xml file is restrict

237990
drawimage	todataurl
html5 can export its content as png file using todataurl and it s possible to paint any element on canvas using drawimage so it should be possible to create paint it on canvas and export as data url

237991
authentication	login
the resulting url has the form controller action id login authentication again since you are inside login-controller s authentication action

238009
hosts-file	hosts
could use your hosts to trick firefox into looking for springer.com in the right place

238024
contains	elements
understand how these collections are implemented a vector is a sequential arrays of data a list is an elements that contains the data and pointers to the next elementss

238024
subtract	time
so reverse iteration of a vector is exactly the same as for forward iteration - the iterator just subtract the size of the data items each time the list still has to jump to the next item via the pointer

238031
perl	php
and then invoke your process inside php perl python script

238053
contains	any
it s too small to be of any size concern and doesn t contains any useful secrets that you might be concerned about sharing

238057
double	int
we had used in c++ and in c i guess compiler-defined literals to type integer numbers as short or long int real numbers as float or double or even long double and character strings as normal or wide chars

238057
complex-numbers	matrix
we had the possibility to add operators to their types to have them behave like similar built-in types which enables c++ developers to use matrix and complex-numbers as naturally as they would have if these have been added to the language itself

238057
boolean	int
i d guess it s very similar to .net s decision to make every primitive a struct including boolean int etc. and have all struct derive from object

238073
shell	bash
when scripting in bash or any other shell in nix while running a command that will take more than a few seconds a progress bar is needed

238081
logging	trace
at the same time i d like to have some way of logging all those information stack trace and request info to a file on my server - so i can just output it to my console and watch errors scroll email the log to me every hour or something like this

238081
lighttpd	apache
i have the application running as fcgi server and i m using apache web server as frontend although thinking of going to lighttpd

238087
stderr	stdout
some will give you output on stdout or stderr that you can use

238123
haskell	python
that s a very much a pure functional approach and as such is a sensible idiom in haskell but it s probably not so appropriate to python

238123
erlang	python
python only has a very limited concept of patterns in this way - and i suspect you might need a somewhat more rigid type system to implement that sort of construct erlang buffs invited to disagree here

238140
freebsd	linux
an earlier version of linux and freebsd shell scripts appears on my blog

238151
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
because windows is case-insensitive and because svn is case-sensitive and because vs2005 tends to rename files giving them the lower-case form which messes my repositories history i ve tried to add the pre-commit hook scripting from

238178
selected	textbox
i need the selected data source dialog added to my application so that the user can manually selected a range or ranges in excel and the range is pasted in my textbox

238202
domain-object	repository
in my case the breakthrough came as soon as i noticed that it wasn t the test run that was failing it was only runs contains sql database tests - domain-object and mock repository test could run just fine so there had to be something about the code that it was running

238229
revision	utility
we are currently testing this utility against the current release 1.4 of ccnet without any problems it s producing the correct revision and build labels appended to the major minor digits we specify

238262
code-coverage	eclemma
eclemma - code-coverage plugins for unit tests

238267
sql-server	oracle
large collections of sprocs can be segregated into oracle packages or management studio sql-server solutions and projects or sql-server schemas

238322
python	java
the python rule of thumb translated to java is to define any unique exceptions at the package level

238323
defined	declare
in java interfaces can only be used to declare methods not the defined implements them

238395
splitter	panels
use a splitter control on a windows form to split the form into the left and right panels

238400
triggers	insert
then you ll need triggers to run against insert that check the data coming in and the metadata to make sure the data isn t corrupt etc etc etc

238427
ndepend	ncover
concerning the tool ndepend it comes with 82 different code metrics from number of lines of code to methods rank popularity cyclomatic complexity lack of cohesion of methodss percentage coverage extraction from ncover or vsts depth of inheritance.

238433
arguments	default
i ve found the default action third arguments in maproute works whereas your overload of that methods i ve never seen before may be a holdover from a previous release

238437
authentication	login
when the user isn t authentication it returns http 401 sending them to the login page

238445
32-bit	64bit
note however that this doesnâ t work as-is on 64bit because visual-studio is a 32-bit application

238446
perforce	cvs
it integrates with your source control system currently supports cvs svn and perforce and analyzes all your files that way

238465
boost	stl
my apps are mainly stl boost nowadays fwiw

238480
xsd	xml
i haven t used it before but docflex xml is an xml documentation tool with an xsd documentation component called xsd doc that looks interesting

238480
xsd	xml
of couse as pointed out in on of the other answers xsd is just an xml file so a custom xslt could be written to generate any documentation output you like

238488
sql-server	oracle
i don t have trouble executing stored procedures in sql-server or oracle when simply calling them from the .executenonquery command

238511
expression	evaluation
the whole point of expression tree is that they represent the logic as data rather than evaluation the expression

238523
python	c++
if i want to move to c++ and sdl in the future is python and pygame a good way to learn sdl

238535
callback	methods
for example suppose you have a callback methods whose sole responsibility is to receive data perform calculations on it then pass it off to other classes

238535
callback	methods
or just declare local variables each time the callback methods is called

238536
simplemodal	jquery
i tried to override the settings in the default stlyesheet that comes with the simplemodal jquery plugin with containercss which is working fine in ie7 but not firefox or chrome

238538
double-quotes	single-quotes
compilation line beware the single-quotes outside the double-quotes

238544
pointers	stack
both will be constant offsets from a pointers the locals will be from stack pointers and the members will be from the this pointers

238549
pointers	stack
pointers to stack frame + offset

238564
installation	environment
it creates an environment that has its own installation directories that doesn t share libraries with other virtualenv environments and optionally doesn t use the globally installed libraries either

238585
linux	unix
on a unix linux box you could just run wget but this is not really an option if you re writing a cross-platform client

238601
debugging	trace
when you writing a function you should think what trace message will help you to debugging it

238601
logging	trace
and different logging levels error warning trace verbose etc

238601
debugging	trace
i usually start debugging with full trace dumped to the screen and if i lucky and bug reproduced this way fixing the bug is trivial because i already have enough information the fun starts when problem goes away and you need to play with verbosity in order to reproduce the problem

238631
windows-server	windows
i have visual-studio 2008 and the windows sdk for windows-server 2008 and .net 3.5

238643
abstract	extends
for example the source is just a complex type with a sequences where the published versioning extends an abstract base

238648
rdbms	acid
an rdbms has a lot of overhead - for performance acid concurrency etc. storage transaction logs scsi raid-5 drives etc. and administration backups server maintenance etc. - all of which are unnecessary for trace logs

238652
jruby	mri
i run capistrano tasks using mri rather than the jruby interpreter

238662
key-value	key
secondarily cookiecontainer s with a higher count have higher priority if there are two key-value combos for the same key and both from the same filetype we choose the one with higher value.count

238692
duplicates	elements
it only works if there are no duplicates elements in the sequence if there are it misses some permutations and doesn t end in the correct perumtation

238708
32-bit	64bit
are you running a 64bit system with the database running 32-bit but the console running 64bit

238710
jndi	jdbc
by the way the framework can vary like jaas jndi for user authentication and authentication log4j java logging for logging javamail for e-mai jdbc hibernate for database access

238741
png	gif
how can i put a gif png image on a bitbtn component

238744
png	gif
bitbtns don t accept gif or png images

238749
http	ssl
with ssl http the host name will be in the clear obviously as it has to find the server but the other parts of the url should be safely encrypted

238753
arrays	loops
i tend to use foreach over for to loops over arrays in which case i would use a firstdone var like so

238765
value	field
given a nodetype of expressiontype.memberaccess how do i get the value of that field

238767
put	get
my preference would be that the username password only be accepted via post so that it doesn t appear in the url at all but you could conceivably encrypt and encode the password so that it could be put in a get request

238812
click	mouse
when i use the mouse to click on an item it fires the postback but when i click the up down arrow to change entries this is not firing

238853
svnadmin	dump
there are ways to do an incremental copy of a repository via svnadmin dump or svnadmin hotcopy but i doubt that unfuddle will give you access to these

238892
client-server	web-services
i ve been recently hired to a company that previously handled their client-server communication with traditional asp.net web-services and passing dataset s back and forth

238894
subtraction	addition
z is what determines if the adder does subtraction or addition

238894
subtraction	addition
if it s 0 it means subtraction and i want to convert y to two s complement then just do regular addition

238926
configuration	environment
to check if the module is installed you should have somewhere in your apache configuration a line something like this path may differ in your environment

238928
updating	updates
no automatic servicing of shared components no ability to have 3rd party module supplier updates their code to fix issues without recompiling and updating your application

238928
dynamic-linking	static-linking
the inability to easily do remote installation without going through a msi on the remote system is the primary reason why we don t use dynamic-linking but as you pointed out there are many other benefits to static-linking

238932
selected	cells
don t type anything into it but instead selected cells with the mouse and their address will appear in the dialog textbox

238937
base-class	subclass
on the deserialization the parsingr class returns a pointers to the base-class which has a enumerator for the type of the subclass because you don t know which type it is until you parsing it

238959
selected	button
if they do how about providing a refresh button on the page so the users can manually refresh the list just prior to selected an item to avoid the annoying message if they choose

238996
safari	opera
it works as expected clicking the label focuses the corresponding input in firefox3 safari opera and ie6 7 and it passes validation but i m just wondering if there are any known reasons accessibility

239007
quicksort	heapsort
quicksort is really hard to beat if you can hold things in memory and heapsort is quite effective for massive data set order although i personally prefer to use b+tree type implementations for the heap b c they are tuned to disk paging performance

239015
perl	php
for php python perl and ruby development with a web server and a database

239020
python	perl
i want to drive it from a scripting language i m comfortable with python and slightly less so with perl so that we don t have to compile and send out executables to our customers whenever there s a problem found

239020
python	perl
what s a good way of getting python perl to interface to a windows dll

239036
radix-sort	quicksort
if two different elements have the same value the first element in the original collection stays in front good for multi-pass sorting to different criteria first scan for date then for name the collection stays name then date sorted however if you want slightly better constants or have a special data-set it might make more sense to implement your own quicksort or radix-sort specific exactly to what you want to do

239048
directory	folder
the webserver will need the images to be stored in a web folder root or virtual directory to interperet the url to a local file location

239075
contains	any
this will mean that any server logs will contains the usernames and passwords as part of the logging process

239086
onsubmit	onclick
the main thing to notice is the removal of the event attributes onclick onsubmit or onkeypress from the html

239118
stable-sort	quicksort
you might need a stable-sort while the default algorithm uses quicksort

239137
abstract-class	subclassing
an abstract-class is used when you have some base functionality that you want subclassing to inherit but it wouldn t make sense to instantiate the base class

239137
subclassing	base-class
for example if you had something like a shape base-class you could have some built-in implementsation that could be used by subclassing as well as interface methods that you want the subclassing to implements

239138
http	ssl
aside from keeping out eavesdroppers having authentication operations be carried out over ssl allows you to use the secure http cookie flag

239143
implementation	instantiation
use an abstract-class to provide some concrete implementation but not allow instantiation

239143
implementation	instantiation
interface contract only no implementation no instantiation

239143
implementation	instantiation
abstract-class contract some implementation no instantiation

239143
implementation	instantiation
class contract implementation instantiation

239145
hide	show
using expression to hide and show objects is the correct way of achieving this sort of functionality

239167
python	c++
if python is much more natural to you than c++ it might be a good idea to learn pygame first

239180
python	php
here s how i d do it in python sorry i don t know php as well

239181
export	report
the user has the option of export this custom report to pdf

239190
fieldset	labels
semantics legend describes a fieldset just as labels describes a single field

239190
input-field	fieldset
fieldset are supposed to be used to grouping together semantically related fields for instance an address fieldset might have input-field for street city and country

239190
fieldset	labels
assuming you have more than one field in the fieldset then doing what you suggest doesn t semantics make sense -- you need to create separate legend text that describes the fieldset then a labels for each field

239266
windows-server	windows
windows-server 2003 and windows

239294
kerberos	ssl
to put simply kerberos is a protocol for establishing mutual identity trust or authentication for a client and a server via a trusted third-party whereas ssl ensures authentication of the server alone and only if its public key has already been established as trustworthy via another channel

239306
order	add
add peter at positioning 3 in which case the new order would be

239321
duplicates	contains
i assume from your question that you want to duplicates the controls that are contains in a wincontrol as a parent is a twincontrol

239353
c++	lua
if you want a language that embeds nicely into c++ try lua

239354
base-class	inherited
i ve been caught out through this sometimes because i ve added the event wireup manually when it has already been added in the designer or there is some inherited aspect here where the wireup is already in a base-class and you are repeating it in a derived class

239355
basic	vb6
if you really gotta stick to vb6 i m sure you can use some basic socket work in order to download the file directly

239387
administration	account
i discovered that when the web site folder was copy-paste to the server it inherited the security permissions of the parent folder which only had permission for the administrator administration system account

239408
implements	abstract
is there a way to mark the methods so that they have to be implements by subclasses without marking them as abstract

239482
required	checked
the proc could checked the conditional you required and kick off the subscription if they are met using

239486
contains	elements
i want to convert an xml document contains many elementss within a node around 150 into another xml document with a slightly different schema but mostly with the same elements names

239486
document	element
now do i have to manually map each element node between the 2 document

239486
contains	set
the neworder document may contains additional nodes which will be set to null if nothing is found for them in the oldorder

239490
subclassing	base-class
then if any of your subclassing have not overridden them you would get a runtime exception-handling when the methods in the base-class gets called

239493
content-disposition	content-type
i d use the file name the server supplies in the response headers content-type or content-disposition depending on what you expect

239507
swing	swt
swt is an alternative to swing though there is a degree of interoperability between them

239517
ticket-system	trac
tortoisesvn is indeed a very nice client and i use this in combinations with trac on the server to have web access to the repository and a nice wiki ticket-system

239525
tortoisesvn	smartsvn
nice tools are tortoisesvn explorer plugins smartsvn vss-lookalike and command-line flexible

239588
put	get
am i right in saying that the worst that can happen is that new entries may get put into the wrong place which actually i can live with

239609
worksheet	excel
if i am debugging in this case a visual-studio assembly called by excel and the code updates the excel worksheet how do i get excel to redraw the current sheet windows whilst paused in the debugger

239619
deployment	install
imo sharepoint web apps still have a long way to go in terms of the administrative action needed to deploy them versus a straight asp.net application which can be easily install using a wix script or even xcopy deployment in simple situations...

239622
versioning	upgrade
followup #2 figured i d try to upgrade the oracle client drivers but 10.2.0.1 is apparently the highest versioning available for windows 2003 server and xp clients

239645
abstract-class	subclassing
i have an abstract-class monitor.java which is subclassing by a class emailmonitor.java

239653
derived-class	inherited
you cannot do that on that way but you can access a property s setter methods from a derived-class so you can use inherited for the purpose

239655
protected	public
you can achieve to this by making a public property in your settable class that will inherited from the real class that will have a protected property.

239674
scriptmanager	updatepanel
if you re getting that from an updatepanel set enablepartialrendering to false in the scriptmanager for the page and then it should give you the actual error

239676
haskell	python
further to the other answers note that the equivalent head tail operation in python including python3 s extension of the syntax is generally going to be less efficient than haskell s pattern matching

239725
httpwebrequest	webrequest
i can get around this by casting the webrequest object to a httpwebrequest and setting the properties such as but this only works for a handful of headers that are exposed via properties

239728
spring	jsf
there are also a ton of web frameworks for the java language both asp.net-mvc based spring asp.net-mvc is probably the best known here and component based jsf implementations

239744
jface	swt
i m developing a swt jface application using the libraries from eclipse 3.4.1

239772
document	element
i believe you answered your own question every so often ie returns a reference to the document or to the document element the if-statement is simply a quick conditional to fix it if needed

239787
linux	unix
callgrind for unix linux

239804
value	field
they very rarely return field value

239817
directory	folder
for code in the app_code directory it s compiled on a per folder basis

239824
any	set
due to the way templates work you will never be able to change the ordering predicate for a container it is set in stone at compile time unless you are using a sorted vector or something similar to where you are the one maintaining the invariant and you can sort it however you want at any given time

239860
background-color	width
swf width 455 height 200 background-color #123456 framerate 25

239870
solaris	linux
it is available on several platforms too - i ve used it on solaris windows and linux

239872
contains	any
i am aware that you can create your own custom xml dictionary files that contains any words you don t want to be flagged however can anyone tell me if you can configure code analysis to use a different default or additional dictionary from those available in windows

239877
iteration	sorted
then again you could get a sorted enumerator with a hybrid approach yielding the first factors and storing the second one in each iteration of the loop then yielding each value that was stored in reverse order

239906
json	csv
take a look at eric stone raymond s data metaformat at json and maybe csv or xml

239992
any	set
amongst the many other benefits of defining your database services as a set of stored-procedures like any abstraction layer in software are the ability to refactor your database underneath without affecting apps the ability to better understand and monitor the usage patterns in your database with a profiling and the ability to selectively optimize within the database without having to deploy new clients

240013
sql-server	ms-access
i have two databases one is an ms-access file the other is a sql-server database

240018
haskell	python
unlike haskell or ml python doesn t have built-in pattern-matching of structures

240021
quirks-mode	doctype
the main problem is that when you add a doctype to the page ie 6 and up starts rendering the page significantly differently it uses standards mode instead of quirks-mode and the box model is different

240027
contains	any
why not create a class that contains your second collection and any of the previous information and just have a collection of these items

240028
.net	wcf
you might want to consider upgrading to .net 3.0 or 3.5 so you can use wcf

240029
required	checked
if clients prefer a secure connection but don t required one - then 1 has the disadvantage of either requiring overloads or the client to checked if their iobject is really a isecurableobject

240033
organization	naming
normally i use a naming scheme that puts common reusable components into a namespace that reflects our organization and project-specific components into a namespace tied to the project

240033
organization	naming
my inclination is to go the organization naming route and create an organizational project name spaces for this application

240036
getter	setter
simply define the getter in one interface and create a second interface that has both the getter and the setter

240064
punctuation	words
i would prefer to avoid using punctuation and reserved words in table and column names and not use the square brackets

240158
.when	ready
.when you use an interface you re ready in the future .when you need to refactor rewrite the code

240162
asterisk	pbx
an example of this type of approach is used in the asterisk pbx via the ztdummy module

240166
authentication	login
which will force the javax.mail api to do the login authentication

240171
windows-xp	windows
must work on windows-xp and windows vista

240200
base-class	inherited
for example base-class person could be inherited by employee and customer

240205
iteration	elements
in contrast a list comprehension reevaluates the elements expression on every iteration

240212
malloc	free
what is the difference between new delete and malloc free

240213
silverlight	wpf
in wpf you have dependencypropertydescriptor.addvaluechanged but unfortunately in silverlight there s no such thing

240220
malloc	free
malloc free just allocate and release raw memory

240221
malloc	free
malloc free simply allocate memory from the heap

240222
malloc	free
new delete is c++ malloc free comes from good old c

240222
constructor	object
in c++ new calls an object constructor and delete calls the destructor

240222
malloc	free
malloc and free coming from the dark ages before oo only allocate and free the memory without executing any code of the object

240226
malloc	free
malloc and free are c functions and they allocate and free memory blocks in size

240226
malloc	free
malloc and free are nonetheless more low level as they just reserve a chunk of memory space which will probably be associated with a pointers

240239
malloc	free
the only similarities are that malloc new both return a pointers which addresses some memory on the heap and they both guarantee that once such a block of memory has been returned it won t be returned again unless you free delete it first

240239
malloc	free
malloc free only ever allocate and free memory

240253
csv	xml
this could by a database connection a csv file reader and xml file reader or any other kind of mechanism that might want to use crud operations

malloc	free
whether they call malloc free is implementation defined

240308
constructor	object
constructor destructor used to initialize destroy the object

240308
malloc	free
malloc free

240308
malloc	free
malloc free can not be overridden legally

240308
malloc	free
technically memory allocated by new comes from the free store while memory allocated by malloc comes from the heap

240324
malloc	free
the global new and delete can be overridden malloc free cannot

240326
environment	execution
environment variables could work however we could be running parallels tests via a single test assembly so i wouldn t want settings to be overwrite during execution which could break another test

240339
attributes	properties
you also can t create a new namednodemap on its own to write to domnode attributes as that s a read-only properties

240341
sql-server	oracle
the data is in oracle and i am using sql-server 2005 reporting services ssrs for the reports

240352
lookup	any
ruby and actionscript are somewhat similar but ruby has some significant difference in its methods dispatch semantics that require any implementation in actionscript to use a custom methods lookup solution

240367
private-members	object
it s also a way to allow you to expose private-members for use without reflection explicit implementation so it can be a good way to implement functionality while keeping your object model clean

240388
kerberos	ldap
it is using gss api jndi to connect to active directory ldap server using kerberos

240421
abstract	extends
you extends the behavior by sub-classing adesignerhappyimp which forces you to implement all the abstract members

240426

on the faq link above there is a section dedicated to troubleshooting upload including some helful methods to isolate the cause client browser webserver libraries

240442
updating	updates
relational-database excels in massive data store that gives you quick storing updating and retrieval so if your configuration data is updates and read constantly then by all means use db

240462
authentication	login
which will force the javax.mail api to do the login authentication

240467
document	element
of course there are a whole range of possible errors relating to document validity but my immediate stumbling block occurs when changing a paragraph p into an address element

240467
document	element
firebug suggests that a self-closing element has been added to the document for some reason

240471
versioning	upgrade
the client code was also all versioning 1.1 of .net so we d have to upgrade all the client code

240480
javascript	dom
then use javascript dom to create new values for the innerhtml property

240493
shortest-path	np-complete
any optimal type of path smallest direction change at each point on the path shortest-path through all points will likely boil down the np-complete travelling salesman problem tsp

240505

240533
scalability	azure
azure for service hosting and management low-level scalability storage computation and networking

240649
.when	ready
you do not necessarily need to learn all the newest enhancements but they will be readily available to you .when you are ready

240755
put	get
if i put in a value of .5pi or less it works but otherwise i get the incorrect result

240774
deep-copy	object
i will either a assume that the object passed to the modifiable object implementing the interface is already cloned or b make another method called for example copy that would basically do a deep-copy of the modifiable object or maybe the generic solution will work...

240790
uniform	points
note that the distribution of points will not be uniform in that case

240790
uniform	points
however if you want uniform distribution the probability of having a points in one of the triangle must be equals to the area of the triangle divided by the area of the quad

240827
any	set
if you are calling excel cross-process via automation then excel should automatically show any changes as the calls are made unless you set

240830
32-bit	64bit
if i remember correctly this problem is do to the fact that the zend debugger is compiled for 32-bit apache while the apache that comes with max os 10.5 is compiled as 64bit application

240850
user-controls	ascx
i have a super simple user-controls ascx

240864
benchmarking	profiling
as well as the other suggestions which are good - profiling and benchmarking are very important i d say that if jformula is doing anything significant within each methods call then the boxing unboxing when making the call is likely to be insignificant

240881
derived-class	base-class
if the base-class member variables is protected or public than you can just refer to it by name in any member function of the derived-class

240881
derived-class	base-class
if it is private to the base-class the compiler will not let the derived-class access it at all

240881
getter	setter
there is also something to be said for keeping all member variables private and providing getter and setter as needed

240886
versioning	upgrade
files were named after those versionings - so if my upgrade scripting got the database versioning 10 it just took all files from 11.sql to n.sql and applied each one of them incrementing database versioning number at the same time

240888
32-bit	64bit
today that word will max out at either 2 32 -1 or 2 64 - 1 depending on whether your system is 32-bit or 64bit

240893
uniform	points
sample a points p from the uniform distribution on the interval between 0 and a a +a b

240893
uniform	points
then the points xc+yd x+y is a sample from the uniform distribution on the polygon

240896
uniform	points
it s not uniform because rounding errors will aid certain points but it should be close if you are working with floating points value

240899
sqlcompare	redgate
use a tool like redgate s sqlcompare or xsql object from xsql software to generate your diff delta t-sql scripting on the fly

240917
installation	upgrade
another advantage to this is that we can keep various installation at different functionality levels for different customers yet when we do upgrade all the scripting are in place and ready to run

240927
build-system	toolchain
i have a make-based build-system for all my c++ applications both pc-based and for various embedded projects and while i love being able to do a top-level build on a fresh machine and verify all dependencies are in place i check my toolchain in to revision control d i ve been frustrated at not doing the same for interpreted languages that currently have no makefile in my build-system

240927
required	checked
if you choose a methods that required user action to have a scripting checked for dependencies people will forget to perform that action since they will be able to run the scripting even if they don t do the dependency check

240936
downgrade	upgrade
some frameworks that support migrations rely on this to know which migration scripting to apply to upgrade or downgrade the schema

240942
revision	svn
i probably should keep some sort of link between the svn revision of my app and the revision of my model

240945
virtualization	vmware
on a machine that is adequately-equipped vmware or any virtualization software performs perfectly fine

240946
updating	updates
i am raising the propertychanged event after i perform the updates and i thought wpf was supposed to automatically respond by updating the user-interface

240948
google-chrome	firefox
right now i am printing them directly to a webpage and it works properly in google-chrome and ie 7 but not firefox

240948
google-chrome	firefox
does anyone know what firefox would be doing differently than ie and google-chrome

241000
order	add
in order for git to be able to recognise the repository as a git repository you will need to add the .git subdirectory and everything under it to subversion as well

241037
double-quotes	single-quotes
i usually just replace all curly single-quotes with and all curly double-quotes with .

241047
required	checked
if the documentation for keycapture_config.lib says no linkage to mfc checked the source for directives that required linkage to mfc

241055
linux	osx
the ultimate benefit is due to vmware having a presence on many different hosts operating systems thus i am free to select the host os of my choice - xp vista linux osx etc

241095
defined	declare
they defined a new scope which means that everything declare in this scope is not visible outside the curly-braces

241104
temporary	copy
in this case copy serves as a temporary variables so it is a good example

241123
moss	wss
i have an image with wss and the vs2005 toolchain and another image with moss and vs2008 sql-server 2008 when i need to it to the max

target-platform	platform
we ve set the target-platform so we can build against a standard set of plugins but are not able to see source code and javadoc for all the platform plugins

241152
uiscrollview	subviews
each uiimageview is contained within its own uiscrollview which are then the subviews of the parent uiscrollview

241167
dictionary	map
i suppose you could create a map dictionary to maintain an external intuitive mapping

241173
value	field
a table does not have a rowsource but as remou points out access allows you to define field in your tables so that they display a combo box that looks up value from a related table

241190
administration	account
the windows service is running under the same user account that i log into the machine with and that account is an administration

241199
value	field
if for instance you are joining a local jet table with a linked sql-server table on a single field and filteringing the results based on value in the local table it s very likely to be extremely efficient in that the only thing jet will send to the server is whatever is necessary to filtering the sql-server table

241200
target-platform	platform
keep the target-platform as the eclipse platform

241209
value	field
when i look at hashmap in debugger s watch windows i see logical view - keys and value last time i did it in eclipse it was showing entries with hash and next field - i m not really debugging hashmap i just want to look at it contents

241209
defined	declare
you can also use language injection here - defined your own methods that takes string parameter declare in intellilang options dialog that your parameter is regular expression - and it will give you autocomplete there as well

241213
python	java
java has api docs generated by javadoc python has api docs generated by tools like epydoc

241239
pecl	pear
wamp server comes with pecl pear

241239
command-line	cmd
i can actually run the cmd pecl install inclued-alpha from the windows cmd-line and it goes out and tries to grab the inclued extension from the pecl site

241249
desktop-application	client-server
my boss is bidding on a project to convert a desktop-application into one that runs online as a client-server application

241266
click	mouse
so i have to grab the mouse and click to minimize in those panels

241266
click	mouse
in eclipse i have to grab my mouse again and look for the output tab and click it to view my program output because the output windows panels is just another one like all the rest of the windowss but in idea it is treated in a special way if the user want to run his program is very likely he wants to see the output of that program

241275
selected	cell
as long as no other cell s dropdown is shown it should display the selected cell s dropdown immediately

241282
authentication	login
the service then upon authentication the provided credentials will allow or deny login access

i usually use a mix of a spreadsheet program export to csv in event of lock-in fear and a plain text editor with one file per project or a folder for projects with more notes

241373
highlight	selected
anyways - i m also doing the highlight of current menu item on server adding a selected class css to an item

241373
highlight	selected
highlight with javascript is not good option because there is content in datagrid that causes postback and needs to remain the menu in the same positioning as selected value is

241396
put	get
as a first step i am looking for a good way to get a number of ms software products xp vista server 2003 2008 office 2000 2003 2007 ... to put on some vms in my testing setup so i can start to play around

241399
any	set
use a listview control and tell it display no rows or basically set its height to the height of the column header - can t find any way to determine which height should i assign to the control

241403
account	api
how do i get a list of domain user account with win32 api

241414
put	get
you ll have to put it somewhere but you get to keep the original in case like e you mess up regularly on your regexps

241418
document	element
if you can t do it in the document .ready function you might want to try putting the code after the element being referenced

241419
environment	building
we use trac with svn in our company and perform daily rolling building to dev staging stable environment with regular scheduling deployment once a month.

241462
contains	elements
you get back a list contains one undef elements which is true

241463
fogbugz	svn
svn beanstalk permits you to make notes when you check in a build that will in turn affect the status of one or more fogbugz cases

241468
png	gif
if you can t find any on-line crerate a gif or bmp or png image for each char

241492
document	element
obviously this expression isn t using element names but then if all you re trying to do is locate a node within a document you don t need its name

241495
perl	ruby
this is an easy operation in glue languages like perl and ruby but haskell isn t

241514
fogbugz	svn
basically there is a plugin for fogbugz which checks for svn check-ins in the background

241523
margins	padding
realizing you would like to remove the whitespace just adjust the margins padding accordingly

241524
any	set
do not try to use the incoming windows handle and set the parent of any windows shown in the target app to that handle it only makes the shown dialog to appear within the bounds of the calling app windows and cropped if necessary - useless

241527
folder	dir
i believe the minimum you need to have a wordpress show up in the new part of the webpart catalog you need the dll in the bin folder bin in the web dir not the 12 hive or in the gac and a safe control entry

241527
folder	dir
if this doesn t work you can try adding a .webpart file to the wpcatalog folder in your web dir

241539
unbounded-wildcard	bounded-wildcard
this error occurs regardless of whether i use a specific type a bounded-wildcard or an unbounded-wildcard

241551
shell	bash
i ll point out the shell bash korn bourne trap command

241558
dom4j	jaxp
install an instances of this custom configuration class as the com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.xni.parser.xmlparserconfiguration property so it will be initializer when dom4j s saxreader class tries to create a jaxp xmlreader

241568
buffering	streaming
seeking in the streaming without having to buffering the entire video first -- this is accomplished with some server-side trickery

241568
lighttpd	apache
perhaps look into something like lighttpd if apache iis isn t fast enough

241575
turbogears	django
django could be an option but doesn t seem as flexible as turbogears

241575
ruby	php
rails might be another option but i m not too familiar with it and as a python php programmer ruby s syntax drives me crazy

241575
python	php
as i said before my first choice would be python second would be php third would be rails

241594
hardware	monitor
for a in-house hardware monitor utility i need to use gauges and charts to help visualize various metrics

241595
google-chrome	safari
the problem browser at the moment is safari and google-chrome

241595
google-chrome	safari
the problem seems to be webkit based browsers with safari and google-chrome being the problem i d presume that konqueror may suffer the same fate but at the moment i don t have a linux install at my disposal

241595
external	host
does anyone know a way to have safari recognise an embeded image tag to an external host as opening a client context

241614
webforms	asp.net
if you count asp.net i d say the webforms lifecycle is a pretty big gotcha to me

241621
nssplitview	nstableview
i generally use an nssplitview with a single column nstableview in the left panels

241621
nssplitview	nstableview
a pattern i also use is to make the nstableview slightly shorter than the nssplitview and have button at the bottom add delete etc

241622
procedure	records
currently i have one stored procedure which retrieves all quarter of a million records to a dataset using a data adapter and dataset and the dataadapter.fill dataset methods on the results from the stored proc

241624
contains	set
another option is to set a cookie on the client contains the error message

241648
httpd.conf	.htaccess
using your example urls and building on what i said before i d say to use this code in your httpd.conf or .htaccess

241652
python	c++
the python py_initmodule api function allows you to create a module from c c++ functions which can then be call from python

241656
compact-framework	.net
i have used the nlog project with great success before under the full .net and the compact-framework so i ll most likely take the existing framework code and add some logging targets

241674
windows-messages	spy++
i would recommend starting up spy++ and seeing which windows-messages are getting sent to where

241677
firebird	oracle
i am testing a few different databases sybase sql anywhere oracle berkeley db h2 firebird sqlite and possibly a few others

241685
expression	brackets
for brackets expression

241685
expression	brackets
with the exception-handling of these and some combinations using â â see next paragraphs all other special characters including â â lose their special significance within a brackets expression

241691
arrays	loops
according to the description in the link above the loops should be broken out of when the squareroot of the last element in the arrays is greater than the current prime - mine does this one before

241713
google-chrome	safari
it looks like safari on my os x at least - which should be default settings and i assume google-chrome don t allow 3rd party cookies by default

241723
cyclomatic-complexity	lines-of-code
the app will obviously be small in size when it is rolled out because it won t have a high load until the site is heavily promoted lines-of-code cyclomatic-complexity and so forth will be high and the app will be commercial scale with the same considerations as large systemd such as facebook etc

241723
nagios	munin
i want to use nagios with monit and munin as my tools for monitoring my system

241723
linux	unix
the problem is these tools are designed for the linux unix stack

241783
integration	payment
i m integration with a payment gateway and not having any luck with .net ssleay and its post_https subroutine

241787
filtering	sorting
if you are new to .net you will want to learn about the list collection and the flexibility it will give you in respect to sorting filtering and iteration

241813
.when	ready
i would like to know .when java 6 can be considered ready for prime time not the choice of user-interface library

241834
attributes	properties
sometime in the future when you add an properties you won t want to make it an xml attributes

241847
attributes	properties
in dot .net xmlserializationr can serialization properties of objects into either attributes or elements

241853
highlight	selected
or drag out a table view and selected highlight source list in interface-builder

241883
decimal	octal
the fix ahem was to convert the pid to a string representing its value in octal rather than decimal making it impossible to contains a 9 and unnecessary to address the underlying problem

241892
soap-client	suds
i m investigating suds as a soap-client for python

241894
large-files	fread
what is it about fgets implementation that makes it so horrible on large-files vs fread

241897
variables	boolean
i need an int count variables or boolean odd even variables to track the row

241899
.net	wcf
is there a way to do this without wcf and .net 3.5

241908
unsigned	integer
if you want the biggest unsigned number within one of the standard integer types why not

241908
digits	base
anyway base 10 means for each number placeholder you have one of 10 unique digits when you reach the maximum in that place you roll over to the next place

241908
octal	hex
but grouping of four which is another power of 2 gives the humans a lot more mental computing power than octal hex is based on 4 bits which is also a power of 2

241908
octal	hex
octal is rarely if ever used you can tell someones age if they think octal instead of hex

241908
binary	octal
i am from the hex generation but have worked with those from the octal generation that struggle with hex because they cannot get from octal to binary to hex in their mind

241908
digits	base
but to post this answer on stackoverflow we dont use the number we use ascii so 1234 in ascii is 0x31 0x32 0x33 0x34 which is important to know for your euler solution assuming the 1000 digits number was provided as an ascii string which it would have to be or you would have to convert it from binary to ascii since the problem is a base 10 problem and not base 2 by definition

241908
put	get
back to four bits though the biggest symbol for a single bit is 1 put that number in each storage location you get 1111 four ones

241908
octal	hex
just by looking at those four ones you should be able to in your mind easily see the octal and hex version of that same number 17 octal or f hex

241908
binary	hex
so when you want to think big numbers and math on a computer you have to think binary or hex

241908
subtract	add
essentially the add subtract integer math functions in the computer allow you to have n+1 bits

241908
subtract	add
the problem is multiply and divide which even today many processors do not support yes many have no fpu and only do add and subtract sometimes multiply but divide is rare

241908
multiplying	subtract
multiplying and divide take a lot of electronics the trade off is you can do them with adds and subtract in software

241908
unsigned	integer
so when i saw you taking 64 bit integers the unsigned long long is often 64 bits and multiplying four times that means you need 64 5 or a 320 bit integer to store your answer you were trying to put that answer in a 64 big result which quite often depending on the compiler and computer will happily do and will truncate the upper bits leaving you with the lower 64 bits of the result which can easily look smaller than any of your operands which is what i had thought you might have done at first

241908
subtraction	addition
because of the relationships between addition and subtraction and base systems you can play some tricks

241908
subtract	add
well there is no such thing as a subtract circuit you instead add a negative number so instead of 7 - 1 it is really 7 + -1 it makes a difference

241908
unsigned	integer
the compiler first looks at that -1 and thinks ...11111 binary then it looks at the equals sign and the other side oh you want a to be all ones it sees that you have a signed integer and an unsigned but the conversion is to just move the bits over so you are saying above that you want a 0xff

241908
32-bit	64bit
other compilers will look at that -1 and see it as a 32-bit or these days maybe 64bit signed integer constant and then when it evaluates the equals into an 8 bit unsigned you will get a warning that you cannot store -1 in a signed or unsigned char without a typecast

241908
subtract	add
supposedly there are tricks to do add and subtract well duh those are easy but also multiply and divide

241916
.net	wcf
wcf is great but requires .net 3.5

241918
moss	wss
to be honest i am beginning to believe that it is your wss moss configuration settings that is hampering your efforts at the moment

241953
jquery	.post
i m using an edit in place jquery plugin which needs to .post the data to a script that will do the actual database update

241953
value	field
this is of course so the user can t just pass in any old userid field value they want and mess with other people s records

241954
administration	host
the user could point their domain to your server and you would run the application under a virtual host and give them administration access to the application to brand it

241986
cursor	row
to solve this open a cursor to a query and fetch the rows one by one discarding the row objects as you iterate through the result set

241989
restart	reload
when i restart my apache2 and reload a page the log file show

241996
subclassing	base-class
initializer codefor to contains the appropriate function-pointers or object subclassing from a common base-class for each code value

242008
jeditable	.post
since you say jeditable uses get i can only assume you re using the loadurl option since the jeditable uses to save the changes and always uses .post

242008
jeditable	.post
so have you tried switching jeditable s loadtype setting to .post and send the username password like before

242056
data-access	nhibernate
the type resolution process happens transparently to my data-access classes and even to nhibernate itself for that matter

242059
python	c++
since i hate classes in c++ and structs in c seems a little crazy i thought i would give python a try at it

242072
document	editing
both have essentially the same features as word -- at least as far as one goes in a design document images diagrams etc. and both allow for concurrent editing and revision history tracking

242074
spring	grails
if you are doing anything more complicated than a single jsp displaying some database results please consider using a framework like spring grails etc.

242086
python	java
one of the advanteages of protocol buffers is that it can exchange info with c c++ python and java

242115
haskell	scheme
having scheme sml ocaml or haskell on your resume suggests you are a very well rounded programmer and quite a thinker

242121
python	php
more than likely because it is younger than a lot of other languages and on the web side of things isn t as easy to implement as php and python

242142
ms-access	dbase
you can open shapefile .dbf files in ms-access using dbase iv driver or directly in ms excel open as .dbf

242157
common-lisp	scheme
i worked through most of it earlier this year and used common-lisp simply because i didn t have scheme available don t ask

242157
common-lisp	scheme
as has already been noted scheme is a lisp-1 language whereas common-lisp is a lisp-2

242171
sql-server	oracle
unless you spend a lot of time on other sites reddit is a good example you will be unaware of just how .net oracle sql-server etc.-centric stack overflow is

242171
perl	php
some parts of the internet reddit are primarily concerned with free software and its associated languages perl python ruby php

242171
haskell	lisp
some parts lambda the ultimate are concerned with more esoteric languages haskell lisp joy coq

242173
arguments	default
specifically you implement actionforlayer forkey to configure the default animation behaviour of that key and if you want to make the property animation implicitly you implement runactionforkey object arguments

242173
calayer	uiview
additionally on the iphone every single uiview is backed on a layer i do not believe there is anything on the iphone s screen that is not in a layer so i don t understand why you are worried about using animation on something that is not a calayer

242183
contains	set
further to richard s comments if the web page contains the form specifies a character set iso-8859-1 unicode encoding utf-8 then a standards-compliant browser should submit form data using that character set and encoding

242189
factors	digits
the best known method for factors numbers up to 100 digits long is the quadratic sieve

242189
factors	primes
once you ve decided on how to split a number into two factorss here is the fastest algorithm i can think of to find the largest primes factors of a number

242215
selected	checkbox
you can tell if a checkbox is selected because it will have a value

242224
javascript	dom
silverlight allows the developer to offload some processing to a clr on the client using the native language such as c# provide rich interfaces that are not restricted to html css dom differences between browsers and potentially reduce the need for scripting in javascript

242269
children	nodes
copy all child nodes of div#content into a list then delete its children

242274
factors	primes
that is numbers that have no primes factors other than themselves

242274
factors	primes
the second function returns the primes factors of a given number n in increasing order

242274
factors	primes
let p be a primes in that list and ps be the primes factors of n p see step 1

242274
factors	primes
if p divides n then p is a primes factors of n

242274
factors	primes
otherwise p is not a primes factors of n

242274
factors	primes
the largest primes factors of n is the last number given by the second function

242295
revision	svn
i would like to extract the revision number from the return from svn info likeso

242304
windows-server	windows
i know about .net 2.0 software development kit sdk x64 and windows sdk for windows-server 2008 and .net 3.5 but i was hoping to find something smaller as these are quite large downloads

242308
contains	elements
the problem is that in your document the object embed that contains the flash animation is on top of the elements you need to access

242308
attributes	properties
the way to do this is to set the object s wmode to opaque and use the css z-index properties to set it to a z-index lower than the z-index of whatever elements you want to float over it -- you can do this in css or just with inline attributes

242317
malloc	free
seeing as malloc free normally involve extensive data-structures that exist in userspace free ing memory when your program ends can actually be a performance drain

242317
malloc	free
of course free ing at other times is usually beneficial as further malloc s can re-use the space you free and free might even unmap some memory which can then be used by other processes

242324
overlay	z-order
for example if you have a floating div with a higher z-order overlay on top of a selected - the selected element will still render on top of the div

242336
any	set
first set a user variables to zero assuming this is less than any rowid in your table

242356
display	height
for now i have to manually extend the height of the display windows to see all the tab items

242377
python	perl
tidy s options get complicated fast so it s usually better to write a script in your scripting language of choice python perl that calls libtidy and sets whatever options you need

242432
put	get
you may get the uri you submitted has disallowed characters error if you simply put anything the user enters in the uri

242457
hashtable	sorted
that s how you can have sorted hashtable and such.

242479
executable-jar	war
i would definitely just create an executable-jar that embeds jetty and uses your war

242517
contains	set
it s set clause contains the comparison logic

242546
kerberos	ldap
one might want to define kerberos access to more than one ldap server

242551
swing	awt
tools- palette- swing awt components

242552
any	set
i use that term if i want to say that something is feature complete regarding a specific milestone or any other kind of pre-announced feature set

242555
.when	ready
.when you re google it means ready for the public but were continuously going to be tinkering with it

242562
hidden-field	checkbox
i sometimes use an additional hidden-field -array to make sure i have a list of all checkbox on the page

242564
for-loop	arrays
i recommend using plain old for-loop but you should consider different arrays lengths

242571
decrement	increment
although the size of a uint32_t may be equivalent to that of a float on a given arch by reinterpreting a cast from one into the other you are implicitly assuming that atomicity increment decrement and all the other operations on bits are semantically equivalent on both types which are not in reality

242572
interop	regasm
i m trying to use a .net assembly from vb6 via interop without placing it in the gac and without using the codebase argument for regasm

242599
vxworks	qnx
python agents works on qnx vxworks - and most problems we have was to port properly threading and network related parts of our code

242599
difference	count
- finally you will find out that there is a difference between proper embedded software in which every bit count and modern embedded software that is performed on 412mhz xscale cpus with more thatn 128mb and then python just don t match the hardware that you would like to target

242600
loading	gif
i currently have an updatepanel with an associated updateprogresspanel which contains the loading message and gif in a progresstemplate

242653
click	mouse
with this app just right click on the mouse so as to show the contextual menu hit print screen et voilã

242657
logging	trace
add logging to your app with some appropriate unique request id so you can effectively trace how long each operation within a page load takes

242664
deployment	install
that is necessary if you have not explicitely install sql-server ce 3.5 on the target machine which is case for most deployment i think

242680
cvs	git
if you are generating your diff from a version control system then take a look at the vcscommand.vim cvs svn svk git integration plugin

242682
postgresql	mysql
for mysql and postgresql only though

242683
direct3d	directx
i believe directdraw the old school way of doing 2d in directx is obsolete so i guess you must be using direct3d

242684
hide	show
in case you need possibility to hide and show scrollbar dynamically you could use

242687
pointers	stack
that way you re allocating the structure on stack and then passing a pointers to it

242700
classname	inherited
new-style classes inherited from object and must be written as such in python 2.2 onwards class classname object instead of class classname

242705
contains	elements
in it will lack something your example wil only float right if the other class rule contains a display block in it since an a tag is not a block level elements

242731
directory	folder
basically i get the header paths to be equivalent by making a directory named externals in my iphone project root then a directory named with the appropriate name myframework in the externals folder

242735
perforce	cvs
as cvs bonsai or perforce scm bugzilla provides a

242744
document	editing
another feature is that for these kind of functional document it should be locked while editing

242785
constructor	object
i can t answer in place of the language designers but you can use the result of date.parse or date.utc in the date constructor to get such object

242796
fogbugz	trac
trac or fogbugz are looking pretty good

242799
arguments	default
edit revised to print dot by default unless a second arguments is specified in which case the first character of that is used

242810
version-control	cvs
i will never use svn again for a personal project - ya its great compared to cvs but isn t even in the same class as the modern breed of distributed version-control systems

242810
bazaar	git
bazaar vs git

242835
javascript	dom
jquery takes a lot of dom pain away from javascript

242835
radio-button	selected
which returns the value of the single checked radio-button in the grouping or undefined if none is selected

242843
double-quotes	single-quotes
for instances when you are working with html inside your strings it is easier to use single-quotes so that you don t have to escape all double-quotes around the attributes

242860
postgresql	oracle
works also for oracle and postgresql

242864
postgresql	mysql
schemabank a web-based saas vendor can turn your er design into sql statements for mysql and postgresql

242874
command-line	cmd
additionally you can use the logman cmd to manage the log from the cmd-line or a script

242878
document	element
you can design your own information token by either placing it into soap header or even within an element in your return result as long as you document it clearly for third party

242879
boost	stl
stl s auto and shared in boost c++0x pointers may help

242887
.when	ready
.when you execute a stored proc from a .net command the results will start streaming as soon as sql has them ready

242893
arrays	loops
however unless your arrays are huge or you loops them constantly all are fast enough

242894
cublas	cufft
when writing cuda applications you can either work at the driver level or at the runtime level as illustrated on this image the libraries are cufft and cublas for advanced math

242912
profiling	trace
if you attach a screen shot of your query plans and a profiling trace i will be happy to let you know which is faster

242921
row	col
so one way to find col and row is to iterate over possible values of row

242923
persistence	hibernate
this design pattern is called data persistence and there are several tools people use like hibernate or nhibernate being the .net alternative or xpodatasource to name a few

242927
value	field
as the user changes value in this case checks unchecks a checkbox the underlying boolean field in the object changes

242927
rollback	commit
should i be creating a copy of the list for binding then updating manually if the user commit if so how do you create this copy or is there a simple way to rollback changes made to the datasource

242937
configuration	logging
one of the greatest things about log4net is that you can change your configuration without having to restart or recompile the application check the faq so you don t need to worry about having a downtime in your logging

242941
selected	button
the problem is that when i move to the rectangle tool and i start drawing rectangles if i want to change the tool when i click on an other tool such as circle or selected the button won t catch the click event intead the canvas will catch the mouse down and start drawing

242948
factorization	primes
factorization is actually used heavily in encryption decryption algorithms so much so that the rsa regularly conducts competitions wherein the task is to factorize certain large numbers that are multiples of very large primes numbers

242953
32-bit	64bit
on a 32-bit cpu a 64bit integer will be more processor intensive to perfom calculations with

242956
project-management	project
i would like project status reports to be a function of the project-management software that we use

242959
32-bit	64bit
of course calculations performed will also be slower on many systems a 64bit system running in 64bit mode can perform operations on 64bit as fast as on 32-bit but a 32-bit system needs to perform extra work that means adding two 64bit numbers is performed by two 32-bit adds plus some extra code - other math operations will be equally broken down into 32-bit operations

242971
reflection	runtime
i have worked on an application that used sql 2000 and sql 2005 and the only bits of the app which needed version-switching were in some hairy reflection code which needed to use sql-server s system tables to dynamically discover tables at runtime

243011
contains	elements
using csv is probably the simplest way assuming you can be 100 certain that your elements won t themselves contains strings

243011
double	int
as an aside at my company we have a number of these custom types defined as standard for lists of strings double int and so on

243017
http	ssl
if you find an easy way to factorize numbers that large you break email signing and ssl http for example

243049
contains	elements
so i have this large xml file contains 300+ elements for each record and i need to insert these records into a database-table

243058
solaris	linux
i m seeing a lot of installations on solaris x86-64 machines though we also have sparc and linux in production too

243064
python	php
if i get what i need i don t really care whether php or python or c# has sixty bajillion applications and libraries written for them

243071
websphere	ibm
i can t find it in websphere and i m getting tired of googlin around ibm pages

243100
fogbugz	trac
fogbugz jira and trac were on our short list and they all had some great features

243101
.when	ready
turn off validation and call it manually .when you are ready

243112
csv	xml
if the database isn t sql-server and doesn t support xml natively another option would be to use a basic xslt to transform the xml into csv or tsv

243128
ms-access	mysql
ms-access where i was doing a quick prototype to mysql

243128
profiling	trace
only available on sql-server but i may be wrong so i can t attach my profiling trace

243130
filtering	grouping
while on the intranet site we may use a more robust grid control in our case the devexpress grid control this allows the user to sort grouping filtering and add remove columns without putting an excessive programming burden on the developer but delivering a better user experience when it comes to working with the data

243132
key-value	key
i have a key that appears to be an empty string however using does not remove the key-value pair

243145
administration	sysadmin
the other thing is if you are able to log into the machine running sql-server with an account in the administration grouping you will be mapped to sysadmin when running management studio using trusted authentication

243170
keyboard	mouse
at each application tick i query the current state of the keyboard and mouse and wrap them in individual classes and data-structures

243170
keyboard	mouse
for the keyboard it s an arrays of my keys enum one item for each of the keys that are currently pressed and for the mouse it s a class containing coordinate delta s and bools for each button pressed

243179
websphere	ibm
we are running apache ibm http server 6.0.2.0 in front of websphere 6.0 on linux

243197
fogbugz	redmine
i have used jira too hard bugzilla too rubbish and fogbugz too expensive and i think redmine is fantastic

243202
credentials	account
you can run sysinternals regmon sysinternals processmon while the install is running filtering by sqlsevr.exe and failure messages to see if the account credentials are a problem

243207
procedure	records
this is effective in situations when the number of records explored by the procedure changes in the way that the original execution plan is not optimal

243208
value	field
this article discusses how to use a stored procedure to tweak a reporting services subscription and insert your own value into the respective field

243218
constructor	private
but is there some hidden impact when the class has only package private constructor

243230
constructor	private
package private constructor will be just as usable

243235
web-applications	security
you might want web-applications to run that need to run separately from others because of security reasons

243240
conditional	operators
i m sort of like imran with my conditional operators style

243240
conditional	operators
i don t immediately jump to if - else because a lot of the time the conditional operators makes more sense contextually

243240
conditional	operators
also i don t nest conditional operators

243241
conditional	operators
i try not to use a ternary operators to write nested conditional

243246
double-quotes	single-quotes
nowadays i always stick to using double-quotes for html and single-quotes for javascript

243254
output	mode
also and when in development mode i set an error handler that will output an error page at the slightest error even warnings giving me the full backtrace

243255
order	add
which means that in c++ if you need to add a field in the struct or change the order of the internal data you have to go through all these initializations to verify each is still correct

243258
defined	declare
this allows you to defined a layout for your application -- let s call it application.vm -- in which you can parsing in headers footers etc and declare where the main body content is placed using the screen_content declaration e.g

243264
conditional	parentheses
i tend to enclose the conditional in parentheses a b

243274
methods	extend
then only test the methods i override and test the abstract methods in the unit tests for objects that extend my abstract class

243274
methods	extend
should i have an abstract test case that can be used to test the methods of the abstract class and extend this class in my test case for objects that extend the abstract class

243275
principles	lsp
public inherited must model the liskov substitution principles lsp

243276
constructor	private
if your class is package private then the access levels indicated by the modifier keyword public together with the default package private access level of the constructor are equivalent

243276
constructor	private
in that case it looks more conservative to declare the constructor as package private since you do not open all doors at the same time

243293
constructor	object
because the object does not have a constructor

243302
any	set
set the wmode to transparent and if necessary use z-index as you would on any other element that really should work for firefox too

243303
constructor	private
constructor can be private or protected

243311
constructor	private
i believe the httpcontext constructor has been marked private

243319
constructor	private
if you make the constructor private you cannot extarnaly instatiate a class

243327
xsd	xml
we haven t defined an xsd or dtd for our xml messages but we do have a formal document describing their composition so that other teams can use our feeds without bugging us

243328
ruby	php
of the open source ones trac python redmine ruby mantis php and my own bugtracker.net c# all have their fans but i think with the open source ones there is a tendency to pick the technology as well as the application

243356
unsigned	integer
note there is still the issue of signed unsigned which can t always be avoided and the fact stl use its own integer types std vector size_type but all the remaining code should not mixing

243356
unsigned	integer
some bugs are created by comparing unsigned type to signed types mysterious loss of precision or integer under overflow

243368
default	reset
how do i programmatically reset the excel find and replace dialog box parameters to default find what replace with within search look in match case match entire cell contents

243371
csv	xml
xml csv html a simple word or sentence .

243382
inline-code	code-behind
too much inline-code doesn t mix very well with code-behind files you can get unexpected results

243388
put	get
use http methods semantically - get gets put puts delete deletes etc.

243412
webserver	host
this is so you have enough power to host your own database webserver for a good testing environment

243422
sql-server	oracle
i use visual studio 2005 visual studio 2003 sql-server managment studio 2005 and toad to connect to oracle as the most consuming applications

243432
windows-xp	windows
virtual business os like windows vista or windows-xp x64

243433
constructor	private
anyway some classes don t have public constructors - think of a singleton class for example constructor is private and you can call the static getinstance method to get current instance or create it if it is null

243501
mocking	stubs
if your abstract class contains concrete functionality that has business value then i will usually test it directly by creating a test double that stubs out the abstract data or by using a mocking framework to do this for me

243503
vxworks	qnx
use a real time kernel such as vxworks or qnx

243506
authentication	login
what we did was to centralise all login details in one repository active directory for us then wrote a c# library to authentication with wrappers for all the languages we programmed in php c .net etc

243518
put	get
we usually use only two methods of http get and post but there are some more delete put etc

243518
sequences	unique
so if we have resources defined by restful urls each domain-object in your application has unique url in form of and decent http implementation we can manipulate objects in your domain by writing sequences

243525
keyboard	mouse
why are you querying the state of the keyboard and mouse with each tick

243525
keyboard	mouse
a much better and traditional solution would be to capture events fired from the keyboard and mouse

243531
fortran	ada
c c++ ada and fortran yes fortran are supported as well as some others

243646
private-key	rsa
i ve got an rsa private-key in pem format is there a straight forwarding way to read that from .net and instantiate an rsacryptoserviceprovider to decrypt data encrypted with the corresponding public key

243650
diffmerge	winmerge
i tried two different diff merge software winmerge and diffmerge and the files are exactly the same

243687
double-quotes	single-quotes
server-side language vb.net people might choose to use single-quotes for javascript so that the scripting can be built server-side vb.net uses double-quotes for strings so the javascript strings are easy to distinguished if they use single-quotes

243694
arrays	loops
for in loops on arrays is not compatible with prototype

243704
drawstring	draw
an option then is to manually draw it in with a fillrect and drawstring in onpaint

243712
decimal	hex
i am not that good with hex but i found an online hex to decimal and it gave me 128 for 0x80

243712
decimal	hex
the hex to decimal gave me 4294901760 for that hex number

243714
udp	tcp
the internet protocol ip represents a standardization higher up the stack and has several different flavors tcp udp etc

243714
telnet	ftp
the introduction of the transmission control protocol guaranteed packet delivery defined communication contracts that opened us up to a whole new set of services ftp gopher telnet http for the application layer

243716
contains	any
but i feel secure in knowing that each image is self contains albeit taking 10+gb at a hit and that if anything happens to a single image then an issue cannot propagate into any other image

243726
unmanaged	c++-cli
you can also write nunit tests in c++-cli and call unmanaged c++

243727
binary	hex
there s no option for binary constants in c or c++ but it s a bit clearer in hex

243729
binary	hex
hex values make it easy to see the underlying binary representation

243740
pointers	stack
a function may be called from any other function and stack pointers value may have any un-aligned value

243749
bug-tracking	trac
we use trac as our bug-tracking development wiki system and i was wondering if anyone has experience and uses some of the trac agile scrum plugins or functionalities

243750
python	perl
do i need a bigger hammer such as perl python might be preferred since i can guarantee python is on all boxes in a rhel environment thanks to yum up2date

243750
python	perl
i ll settle for perl or python but i just don t know those as well working on that

243755
arrays	loops
i would suggest you actually not to ever loops through native arrays with for in structure

243772
octal	hex
there s a direct mapping between hex or octal for that matter digits and the underlying bit patterns which is not the case with decimal

243772
binary	hex
as a vestige of my 8-bit days i find hex a convenient shorthand for anything binary

243774
build-process	msbuild
you will also need to master some msbuild ninja moves to keep a 1 step build-process and keep yourself sane

243783
binary	hex
generally the use of hex numbers instead of decimal it s because the computer works with bits binary numbers and when you re working with bits also is more understandable to use hexadecimal numbers because is easier going from hex to binary that from decimal to binary

243783
binary	hex
it s much more simple to pass from hex to binary

243788
wamp	php
i m not really a web developer i do mostly java c++ but about 3 years ago i worked on a project where we created a site using wamp windows apache mysql and php with a bit of javascript ajax thrown in for good measure

243790
duplicates	contains
i want to drop the primary key constraint to allow rows with duplicates data for those columns and create a new column id to contains an auto-incrementing integer id for these rows

243790
sequences	unique
i know how to create a sequences and triggers to add an auto-incrementing id for new rows added to the table but is it possible to write a pl sql statement to add unique ids to all the rows that are already in the table

243800
hide	show
i have an area of the screen that can be show and hidden via javascript something like show hide advanced search options

243800
selected	checkbox
inside this area there are form elements selected checkbox etc

243800
javascript	dom
my third possible solution is to recursively travel through the dom in javascript removing the title when the area is hidden and adding it back when the area is shown

243805
remote-debugging	debugging
note this also works when using remote-debugging you do not need to launch weblogic from eclipse you can launch it on its own open the debugging ports and create a remote java application debug configuration for it

243806
any	set
can t set any more options on the tidy wrapper other than making it xhtml

243810
sql-server	mysql
otherwise you may wanna stick with windows iis php mysql or sql-server

243814
directory	folder
i have copied by .net 2.0 web service project to the server and have created a virtual directory to point to the necessary folder

243826
perl	ruby
also scripting languages perl python ruby will not kill your cpu easily

243864
haskell	python
i can do this in python using range 1 n+1 and in haskell using take n iterate 1+ 1

243943
text-editor	editor
vim is a text-editor not a wysiwyg editor

243945
space	input
the cross product is a binary operation on two vectors in a three-dimensional euclidean space that results in another vector which is perpendicular to the plane containing the two input vectors

243949
environment	execution
if you have absurd amounts of variabless in the environment you re creating then foo s execution time might be affected as variables lookup will likely take longer

243977
space	input
implementation 1 returns the magnitude of the vector that would result from a regular 3d cross product of the input vectors taking their z values implicitly as 0 treating the 2d space as a plane in the 3d space

244001
cursor	row
the problem is that the primary table cursor though apparently proceeding and saving the primary key column value fname into a local variables fname but it does not get the row for the corresponding foreign key column in the secondary table

244002
having	select
i am having trouble determining which control is the owner when i select the context menu item

binary	octal
i find it maddening that the c family of languages have always supported octal and hex but not binary

244028
json	csv
xml is probably the most popular along with json a close second - but as others have said in this thread - xml csv json or even html are fine

244036
directory	folder
second test your code on a directory you created under your own user folder

244054
http	ssl
https requests are the same as http only using ssl certificates

244068
curly-braces	conditional
i accept that probably i should just settle for separate if isgood ... conditional for every code part which i want to execute but sometimes that would lead to a lot of curly-braces

244077
python	java
i use j2ee eclipse for python and java development

244088
.net	wcf
vs 2005 extensions for .net framework 3.0 wpf wcf ctp is coming off the ms download center

244088
.net	wcf
for .net framework 3.0 wpf wcf

python	lua
i keep getting an itch to make my own on-chip basic interpretor but i wonder if there s need for basic now that lua and python are easily embeddable and just as approachable as basic

244139
constructor	object
this way as you exit the block through the goto there is no way for you to bypass some object constructor with the goto which is forbidden by c++

244139
exception-handling	try-catch
if you can code it with a try-catch do it to interrupt a complex piece of code throwing an exception-handling is the right solution the fact you can add failure success info inside your exception-handling object should not be underestimated

244139
do-while	goto
there won t be a goto-spaghetti code because the do-while won t let you do that but it is still a semantic goto

basic	vba
i do think it is because of all this vb and vba code that is still being used and maintained that basic still isn t dead

244207
python	lua
i don t know well python but from what i have read it is as easy powerful and strict than lua

244209
linux	osx
first be certain that your client is aware that windows linux and osx all have built-in clocks that are almost always visible to the users or made visible very easily

244217
malloc	free
this can be done safely if you are using heapalloc heapresize and heapfree functions but cannot be done using c runtime library eg malloc free resize

244217
malloc	free
but if you don t have a good reason you should stick with malloc free resize functions

244233
decimal	hex
to be more precise hex and decimal are all numbers

244233
octal	hex
hex and octal have the property that they are powers of two so they map grouping of bit nicely

244287
python	ruby
depending on what you re trying to achieve you might also want to consider a dsl which you can either parse yourself or write in a scripting language like boo ruby python etc.

244294
insertion-sort	quicksort
this would be good anyway - they are excellent - but more programming pearls also include a library of simple algorithms written in awk including insertion-sort heap sort and quicksort

244294
bubble-sort	shellsort
it misses out bubble-sort shellsort and bogosort

244296
keyboard	mouse
if you simply query your keyboard and mouse every tick i can guarantee you ll run into problems

244300
puts	gets
the database needs to be reset before each test for proper isolation - a failing test that puts in bad data could cause false failures on tests that follow and it gets messy if you have to run tests in a certain order for consistent results

244327
order	join
you could use hints to try to affect the access paths join order or join methods

244364
widget	button
todd kloots author of the yui button and menu widget here

244387
shell	tcsh
you can use the earlier responses to change your default shell if you like tcsh

you can run a get on foo to put it into the hibernate session and then replace it with the object you created elsewhere

244705
linux	unix
there is a very cool program called cdecl that you can download for linux unix and probably for windows as well

244709
children	nodes
their web page demos their application which allows you to traverse through a tree with parents children siblings visually displayed around the nodes you are examining

244719
any	set
in general when i use any of the properties of my.log.defaultfilewriter in the code it says object reference not set

244751
configuration	environment
you need to define the different development efforts you want to modelize and then define a coherent workflow allowing your configuration spec to focus only on one of those environment

244755
directory	folder
i can automatically publish the .dll to the bin folder of the virtual directory but i cannot figure out how to push the .aspx pages and images to the server without manually using sharepoint designer

244770
versioning	upgrade
if you re using oracle 10g to store blobs upgrade to the latest versioning since c blob performance is massively increased

244772
implements	abstract
the advantage i m looking for out of using builders and implements all these withxxx methods is to abstract away complex property creation automatically expand our database lookup value with the correct lookup.knownvalue without hitting the database obviously and having the builder provide commonly reusable test profiling for domain classes.

244773
gridview	formview
i usually switch to the design view when dropping user controls and also when attaching events of some of the heavy controls like gridview formview detailsview etc

244783
versioning	migrate
i am seeing issues where we stored a serialization object into a blob field and have to migrate a customer across multiple versioning

244803
scilab	maxima
get scilab and maxima work together or move to python co

244815
any	set
and once you have a decent set of web-services these can be used for any new development which provides a way of moving away from cobol in the longer term

244819
put	get
practical approach write a test for two threads doing put get operations in never-ending loop validating the result on every get

244855
json	xml
if you transmit the permission structure to the client as a json object or xml if you prefer you can manipulate that object with the client-side code and send it back to the server which can do whatever it needs to validate the data and persist it

244861
sharepoint-designer	sharepoint-list
is there a way to change the default pages used to edit create view a sharepoint-list item without using sharepoint-designer

244869
value	field
one solution is to include a version number as one of field value

244876
actionscript	mxml
remember mxml gets converted to actionscript by the mxmlc compiler before the actual compilation commences so a declarative swfloader or any other declarative element for that matter is just a short-hand way of creating something instead of coding it by hand

244884
spaces	output
the output from the tag has no spaces at all

244887
ref	out
in my opinion you won t be able to set those objects to null in another methods btw you would need to use ref parameter instead of out to make it working anyway you would hit the same problem with cannot convert... error.

244892
worksheet	excel
i have a protected excel worksheet without a password

244910
superclass	subclass
the subclass s methods overrides the superclass s methods by definition of inheritance

244918
restart	reload
the browser must be completely restart simply reload the page won t work

244928
dictionary	arrays
imho the dictionary approach will be much faster than linq so if you have an arrays with a lot of items you should rather use dictionary

244935
web-config	app-config
how can i inject the value of an appsettings entry from app-config or web-config into a service using the windsor container

244943
data-structures	dictionary
based on the underlying data-structures the dictionary should still give you better performance

244948
json	xml
you could still do this if your permissions were more granular but you would either have a lot of hidden fields or you would have to encode the information into xml or json or some other format

244953
any	set
is there any way to set it up so the xml serialization will not serialization the element if the value is null

244976
global-assembly-cache	gac
i have 3 versionings of the same assembly in the gac global-assembly-cache but i physically need a specific versioning when going into the framework folder

244978
dictionary	arrays
additional arrays or arrays of dictionary would be added as class methods on that class

244982
triggers	insert
create a triggers on the table that aborts any insert or update that attempts to set the primary key column to a value you don t want

244982
triggers	insert
if you use an auto-assigned primary key as shown above you may need to run the triggers after insert instead of before insert

244985
arrays	loops
i d probably just put them in an arrays and loops through them or combine them by hand

245013
aptana	pydev
pydev was acquired by aptana so you might want to check that one out as well

245028
attributes	properties
properties with an xmlignore attributes and an object properties which gets serialization

245034
value	field
it also handles addition of new field gently inserts default value

245054
hide	show
inject the new content with a hide or animate width methods show in the other answers

245069
constructor	object
java constructor are special functions that can only be called at object creation

245078
boolean	double
dictionary double list keyvaluepair rectangle boolean rectangles

245078
difference	count
you would not actually have to maintain an actual set here either just the count of the rectangles you re inside whenever this goes from 1 to 2 store the y and whenever it goes from 2 down to 1 calculate current y - stored y and sum this difference

245104
delta	diff
we could use the delta between labels to look at what files had changed perform diff to see the actual code changes

245114
contains	set
you set up a etc ghosts file contains your servers in groupinging such as web db rhel4 x86_64 or whatever man ghosts then you use that grouping when you call gsh

245117
constructor	object
then you just need to pass this object as the second argument to the treeview constructor and the tree should appear

245121
perl	ruby
does such a tool command line linux or library perl python or ruby preferably exist

245122
contains	any
this will filtering out any lines that contains a period which is not the last character of a line

245143
any	set
in your working web.xml you have set your servlet to be the default servlet by itself is the default servlet called if there are no other matches it will answer any request that doesn t match another mapping

245154
order	join
optimizing the join order takes exponential time

245154
order	join
each database engine simply picks a small number of possible join order and estimates the best one out of those

245160
reflection	runtime
unless you know you need reflection then componentmodel is a viable alternative with the advantage that you will get the correct metadata even for runtime models such as dataview datarowview

245170
access-control	authentication
if you want to prevent some people from committing to something they are not supposed to be committing to you can use repository-level access-control or path-based authentication

from my quick google search i didn t find anything comparable to matlab s simulink

245208
first-class-functions	lambda
boost bind lambda and function do offer first-class-functions

245237
lighttpd	apache
apache mod_python or nginx lighttpd fastcgi

245248
value	field
one semi-solution that will at least give you the field that were updated though form controls not the new id or anything like that though is to access the value property of the detailsviewinsertedeventargs like so

245267
ole-automation	com
excel exposes the same ole-automation api used by vba to anything that supports com

245268
javascript	dom
you could probably do this by turing off display using javascript but i suspect that you don t want the table to be rendered to the page if not in the correct group as opposed to just being hidden or removed from the dom once on the client

245288
environment	building
in xcode building settings you re not actually referring to an environment variables value

245295
double	int
in java for example there are primitive-types int bool double char that aren t proper objects

245295
double	int
that s why java has to introduce int boolean double and character as first-class types

245297
bazaar	git
you may also consider using a distributed vcs one like git bazaar or mercurial

245303
bazaar	git
having said all this i recommend you also explore some of the distributed vcss like bazaar mercurial and git

245308
svnadmin	dump
all was well until recently when i tried to run svnadmin verify prior to a dump

245323
revision	svn
last time i used svn for branches merges you had to record the revision of the pre-branched file if you ever hoped to merge it back together note i m not an svn expert so this may have changed

245342
macros	vba
does anybody know how to call the import data built-in dialog excel from a macros vba

245355
any	set
is there any way i can detect when my page has been set as the user s homepage in their browser

245357
ref	out
sunny ref and out are a marshalling hints + contract to the compiler

245357
ref	out
ref and out are a carryover to com days - the marshalling hints for objects when sent over the wire between processes

245383
cassini	iis
however when running outside of cassini in the ide the iis process did not have permissions to access to the private key store

245384
background-color	transparency
because the actual silverlight host control has a background-color if you don t set it to be transparency it will default to white which will overwrite your background regardless of if your canvas is transparency

245414
parsing	comma
would parsing each line in myfile.txt ignoring lines that begin with a semicolon passing the 2nd and 3rd token from each line to the for body with tokens delimited by comma and or spaces

245444
shipping	tax
similarly you can export the data once but split it it into system.data that s not frequently changed but is necessary for correct operation stuff like tax or shipping rates etc. test data that s easily identifiable and operational data that needs to be moved from db versioning old to db versioning new last week s order

245451
entity	poco
this assumes you have poco called category not linq entity and a lazylist class

245478

245509
duplicates	sorted
assume there are no duplicates the members can be in any order and that neither is sorted

245512
.when	ready
then .when you are ready to .post it you repopulate the hidden-field s contents from your modified

245520
duplicates	elements
to make this work in the presence of duplicates track how many of each elements has been seen

245520
decrement	increment
increment while looping over the first arrays and decrement while looping over the second arrays

245520
arrays	loops
during the loops over the second arrays if you can t find something in the hash table or if the counter is already at zero they are unequal

245529
hashmap	arrays
since insertion into a hashmap is o 1 building a hashmap from one arrays should take o n

245546
bazaar	git
however you would be remiss not to at least consider what dvcs s have to offer git hg bazaar or if your budget allows there are commercial tools with excellent reputations accurev perforce

245549
any	set
given any particular hashing data structure there would be some set of inputs which would produce pathological behaviour

245557
duplicates	contains
i am looking for an efficient algorithm to find if the arrays contains any duplicates elements between them

245566
compact-framework	.net
will their be a new release of the compact-framework with vs2010 and .net 4.0 and if so what new features will it include

245581
integration-testing	testcase
if your integration-testing is written with the unittest module then you could use self.id within your testcase

245614
where-clause	sql
however there is one slight problem with this and that is whenever you do a where-clause in linq the sql generated is like so

245635
16-bit	8bit
to quickly convert an unicode text file 16-bit char to a ascii dos file 8bit char

245641
command-prompt	cmd
not sure how useful this would be in a batch file but it s a very convenient cmd to use in the cmd-prompt

245651
contains	set
it comes with the jdk looking at the source the hashset which is a commonly used implementation of set delegates the equals implementation to the abstractset which uses the containsall function of abstractcollection using the contains function again from hashset

245660
restart	reload
easy code reloads set it up right and you can just touch the .wsgi file to reload instead of restart apache

245663
arrays	loops
loops over an object s data members like an arrays

245679
textbox	button
the only time you re actually going to be posting form data here is when the user actually types something into the search box and clicks the search button - at that point the controller will pass the search expression to the appropriate view by stuffing it in viewdata and from there the view can pull it out and repopulate that textbox on the results page

245687
32-bit	x86
the key issue right now is x64 versions of windows will plant 32-bit installations into c program files x86 instead of the regular c program files

245705
account	api
this is the most likely case the account creation would fail but i m using an api and i can t be 100 this is why it failed

245705
account	api
after i check with the api provider i ll probably try to detect that it is in fact a duplicate account and ask them to try to authenticate that account with a password

245723
persistence	hibernate
i m currently developping an application in java using hibernate as a persistence manager and jpa as an abstraction of the persistence manage hibernate

245740
16-bit	8bit
similarly if i want to multiply a signed 8bit number with an unsigned 8bit number i will cast them to signed 16-bit numbers before multiplying for fear of overflow

245749
nested-loops	loops
nested-loops of this type can lead to spaghetti code normals loops will not lead to spaghetti code

245776
sql-server	oracle
oracle does not require this but sql-server does

245793
addition	division
this is because the integer division is performed first then the result is promoted to float for the addition

put	get
i even put the assemblies in source control so other new developers get them without having to think about it

245840
directory	folder
rename .html to .htm in a folder which has directory and sub directory

245843

if so you might need to talk with your hosting provider and ask for the uri to be added to the list of allowed connection endpoint

245871
versioning	upgrade
you may need to upgrade to the most recent versioning of jython or eclipse

245881
constructor	object
the call to initializecomponent which is usually called in the default constructor of at least windows and usercontrol is actually a method call to the partial class of the control rather than a call up the object hierarchy as i first expected

245882
macros	vba
i have a vba macros which runs a loop for about 200 iterations using up the ram page file as it runs

245883
children	nodes
in the case where the the nodes to remove has two children what you want to do is find the right-most child of the left child as you are doing

245920
installation	building
.net 3.5 sp1 introduces a new setup package option for developers building ..net client applications called the ..net framework client profiling .this provides a new setup installer that enables a smaller faster and simpler installation experience for ..net client applications on machines that do not already have the ..net framework installed

245921
iteration	set
at the end of each loop iteration set any objects that will be re-created to nothing

245925

maven-release-plugin	release
i would like to release a snapshot project foo-1.0-snapshot using the maven-release-plugin

245935
duplicates	contains
could you be clear on what you are after do you want an exact duplicates of the table definition or a table that contains information about the tables definition

245944
keyboard	mouse
the obvious would be a killer keyboard mouse and multi-monitor rig.

245958
keyboard	mouse
nice to have a couple monitors fast machine good keyboard mouse etc but i usually find i can be a lot more productive in front of the puta if i move away from it first

246014
32-bit	64bit
note you can have a 64bit cpu with a 32-bit kernel installed

246020
32-bit	64bit
you have a 32-bit os note that this does not mean that your cpu is not 64bit

246029
postgresql	mysql
at least postgresql mysql and sql server 2008 have spatial query capabilities

246054
dialog	pop-up
this kludge should pop-up the dialog for you however

246056
delphi	c++
you can do similar things in c c++ with typdef in java with static final or in delphi pascal vb with const but be careful in those and many other languages symbol means something different

246065
macros	let
the macros do things the functions can t and the functions do thing the macros can t so it ll be hard to mix them but let s go deeper

246437
perl	tcl
if you want to do it in code you should use an arbitrary precision library facility like java s biginteger perl s math bigint tcl s math bignum or of the many multiple precision arithmetic libraries that are available for c like gnu gmp or mpi

246451
internet-explorer	google-chrome
this should now work with internet-explorer firefox v12+ and google-chrome 28+

246455

246463
activereports	.net
activereports for .net 3.0 supports many xml-based files for data input.

246471

246489
extended-ascii	codepages
how do i convert tis-620 the extended-ascii thai character codepages string to utf-8 string in java

246496
javascript	dom
a more robust solution is to always send the plain-html compatible control and then have javascript run on page load to add the correct event handlers extra dom elements etc

246520
authentication	login
i m writing a web application which uses windows authentication and i can happily get the user s login name using something like

246530
any	set
you can set your project to target .net 3.5 if you like from project properties|application|target framework which will overcome this problem - your app will then use its currently referenced .net 2.0 libraries as well as any .net 3.5 libraries you want to add to use for new code while requiring .net 3.5 on users machines allowing the use of the dll

246533
entity-relationship	diagram

if in the course of normals expected programming query writers have to write a lot of isnull nv coalesce or similar code in order to substitute a valid value for the null

246641
any	set
is there any way to set the order or to show the launch condition as first dialog while installing the setup

246649
vb.net	vb6
the reason for this is you already know the syntax and that vb.net is not enough like vb6 to make it as easy a move as you might expect

246656
expression	brackets
when i pass images gringo into the regular expression it correctly gives me gringo in the first grouping - i m only interested in what is between the brackets

246661
row	col
before editing setting value the table model is asked via tablemodel.iscelleditable row col whether this cell is editable

246661

and after tablemodel.setvalue row col val you should unlock this

246666
double	int
work with varchar int double other than datetime values

246668
abstract-factory	singleton
the videocasts touches on singleton abstract-factory among others- the difference being that you can watch him code as he discusses the theory

246685
getter	setter
we use the getter to alert us of cases where code that has explicitly flagged what it is going to read in order for the base-class to be able to call it only when those properties change and gets it wrong and we use the setter for property change notifications dirty-flag handling validation etc

246727
contains	any
in databases specifically means that two or more tables do not contains the same data do not have any redundancy

windows-mobile	windows-ce
this was something i was considering doing anyway to make the application go on windows-ce and windows-mobile

246911
udp	tcp
the socket and datagramsocket classes available in the java.net package are implicitly ip sockets for tcp and udp respectively

246947
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
the fact that sharpdevelop s ide is written in winforms and performs fine shows that it isn t too slow regardless of what visual-studio s ide uses

246963
spring	guice
additional info note that when i say dependency injection i m talking about the di pattern ...i am not using any di framework like guice or spring

246966
javascript	dom
when accessing the elements via the dom in javascript there is no element for the image input

246998

i ve done the obvious thing and removed the mamp directory from my applications folder however i don t like wandering files and i have an itching feeling that mamp put some .sock files somewhere or otherwise made a mess in my filesystems

247000
derived-class	base-class
a protected member of a base-class is accessible in a derived-class only if the access takes place through the derived-class type.

247002
javascript	dom
however you should still be able to access it through the dom in javascript using the childnodes property

247026
webserver	host
your webserver can use the host field to distinguish which site the client machine wants

247026
transfer-encoding	chunked
chunked transfer-encoding

247038
malloc	free
make sure you malloc and free the memory correctly using something like -

247056
constructor	object
if you are using a dependency-injection framework then the common way to handle this is to either pass in a permissionsmanager object in the constructor or to have a property of type permissionsmanager that the framework sets for you

247087
dependency-injection	inject
if you are subscribing to the dependency-injection way of doing things whatever classes need your permissionmanager should have it inject as an object instance

247087
dependency-injection	singleton
either way though the classic capital-s singleton is generally seen as an anti-pattern in the context of dependency-injection

247087
dependency-injection	singleton
using dependency-injection to avoid singleton

247098
32-bit	64bit
they then get jitted to 32-bit if executed on a 32-bit platform or 64bit code if executed on x64...right

247098
32-bit	64bit
my understanding is that this means yes it is compiled only as far as il no it s not limited to either 32-bit or 64bit but i m not entirely clear

247102
jquery	dojo
in general both dojo and jquery have been quite careful not to clobber each other s or anyone else s variable names

247120
unique	words
if you stripes short non-capitialised or quoted words and assign weights to words or prefixes that are common or unique you can do a bayesianesque comparision

247129
expression	evaluation
the loop is going to terminate because 0 is effectively 0 and the what the while is evaluation is not a the result of an equality test but the right-value of the assignment expression

247143
double	int
the difference between anint and nint seems to be the return type where anint returns a double precision value but nint returns an int

247154
selection	cell
i have a datagridview in a vb.net app that i have limited to cell selection only

247155
svnadmin	dump
so this naturally led to me doing a svnadmin dump followed by svnadmin verify only to get the same message that you specified

247155
svnadmin	dump
dumped the next previous versioning of the repository and ran svnadmin verify on the dump

247160
any	set
on any other element i would use the scrollheight of the dom object and set the height accordingly

247164
32-bit	64bit
they then get jitted to 32-bit if executed on a 32-bit platform or 64bit code if executed on x64...right

247164
32-bit	64bit
but if your assembly is referenced in a process compiled for 32-bit platform only it ll be jited to 32bit run in wow for 64bit windows

247171
double	int
for aint an explicit cast from double to int will achieve that result

247181
ref	out
you shoul not rely on exception-handling for null ref out of range .

247182
webforms	asp.net
i prefer asp.net mvc to webforms so i would choose that but you need to work out as a team where your core skill set is and whether or not choosing mvc will

247185
double	int
for the other two i think you are right that the only difference is the return type nint returns an actual int while anint returns a double fortran real that happens to have an integral value

247200
external	embed
i am trying to embed multiple external websites into one web page

247216
linux	osx
on windows osx linux etc then chris bunch s answer can be much improved by using

247229
scheme	lisp
but honestly all the useful macros i ve defined are stolen from paul graham s on lisp and are generally easier to write with defmacro define-macro in plt scheme

247229
common-lisp	lisp
so i d recommend practical common-lisp and on lisp

247235
hide	show
instead of dynamically adding columns could you define them at the outset and hide show them as needed either with visible false or setting the cssclass of the control header footer to a class with display none

247244
.when	ready
the problem is that addcontenttemplate just recording its parameters in a hashtable ready to be combined with the master page instances .when it is created

247246
asp.net-mvc	webforms
we just recently released an e-commerce platform with asp.net-mvc running the front end and while there are some gotchas that you may stumble upon say resolving url s with anonymous types is currently far slower than using a routevaluedictionary was a surprise to me it certainly feels like it was a lot easier to build a manageable system in asp.net-mvc compared to our older webforms apps

247258
.when	ready
thus .when you open a connection often you ll just get a ready connection from the pool

247259
getter	setter
write the appropriate getter and setter for these columns

247274
updating	updates
reloading the row when you want to updates it shouldn t be much of a performance hit and it will guarantee that you are updating the latest versioning of the row in case another user process has modified it since you first opened it

247290
conditional	operators
those are operators on the windows-installer conditional syntax

247294
any	set
i know you ve looked at it and you re right it was a hassle to set up but once setup it s run without any intervention for almost three years for us

247317
ms-access	oracle
i am trying to use ms-access to connect to a oracle

247322
any	set
having an e that provides members isn t any more helpful or intuitive than a well-named set of arguments

247329
double-quotes	single-quotes
unfortunately i can t think of any safe way to automatically convert the escaped double-quotes to single-quotes

247329
double-quotes	single-quotes
is there any way to safely replace the escaped double-quotes with single-quotes regex

247357
required	checked
this is important because if you need to have your stored proc use indexes postgresql required that the types match exactly between join conditional edit for equality checked too i think

247373
contains	set
the date field however contains cryptic of 3-digit time entries here s a random sample set

247379
sql-server	mysql
your column should be binary-typed not text character-typed if mysql allows it sql-server datatype is binary n or varbinary n

247405
space	input
i found i can make the match when i input a hard-coded non-breaking space u+00a0 by typing alt+0160 on windows between the two quotes.

247420
configuration	environment
works well in a team environment supports team configuration

247425
versioning	packaging
no built-in packaging support versioning dependency management see rubygems

247429
javascript	dom
dom is a rather bulky api but it s also very consistent and it s implemented in many languages meaning that you can re-use your knowledge across languages in javascript for example

247438
google-chrome	firefox
but even more importantly is that in every browser that it is tested on ie 7 firefox 3 safari and google-chrome the browser completely hangs as it is propagating the dropdownlist items

247438
value	field
they click ok and it save the value to the field

247438
command-prompt	command-line
however i m an old school command-line shell terminal guy and my ideas of acceptable user-interface design might be skewed give me a command-prompt on any system and i m good to go

247445
associations	model
for polymorphic associations you want the xxx_type field to be the base model class not the actual class

247445
single-table-inheritance	activerecord
i think you need to look at single-table-inheritance which is what activerecord uses for storing derived classes in the database

247503
parentheses	keyword
that is of course a bit extreme example but at least with the use of parentheses you can see that order is not a keyword

247516
put	get
regardless of how you end up doing your get request - vanilla javascript prototype jquery etc - make sure that you put a mechanism in place to combat caching

247528
contains	set
better i think is to set padding on your contains element to padding-left 5px

247541
document-ready	.when
any idea why this custom route would stop document-ready working correctly .when put in a masterpages contentplaceholder zone

247548
contains	elements
might be something else like background or border of contains elements peeking through

247558
required	checked
the above required all urls to start with http and will checked not to convert urls that are in quotes which may already be inside an a href ...

247567
kdevelop	cdt
it can generate makefile or project files for visual-studio eclipse cdt kdevelop code blocks etc

247574
any	set
any sessions older than the timeout period are set to status timed out

247596
document	element
it looks like that i cannot attach the methods defined in my svg scripting to a methods in my main html object tag element or the top or document is not available in this case or getelementbyid .. just cannot find my object element in my svg scripting

247597
linux	unix
when you re reading text as a series of logical lines you should always look for all three of the major line-separator styles windows r n unix linux osx n and pre-osx mac r

247598
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
it can generate makefile or project files for visual-studio code blocks codelite sharpdevelop monodevelop etc

247627
hash	md5
md5 generates a 128-bit hash value

247630
firefox	opera
as a side note current versions of opera and firefox will preserve form field content when going back

247634
python	php
i ve rewritten scripts in python because of php s dismal array-as-a-list performance

247634
dictionary	arrays
associative arrays have the standard dictionary hash performance overhead

247659
stateless	stateful
in a nutshell i d say use http for stateless calls which could end up meeting almost all of your needs and whatever proprietary formats you need for stateful calls

247668
command-line	cmd
i m trying to access the cmd-line and execute a cmd and then return the output to my aspx page

247669
linux	unix
on unix linux you can have shared objects and applications import symbols from each other but on windows you can t have a dll import symbols from the application that loads it the windows pe executable format just doesn t support that idiom

247676
methods	extend
extend it and add public methods that call the protected methods internally

247682
bjam	jam
bjam is based on ftjam which in turn is based on jam

247720
methodology	paradigms
the fundamental principle to understand here is that there is no universal methodology paradigms or approach that can be applied to all problem domains

247735
command-line	cmd
here is some asp.net code shelling out to run subversion cmd on the command-line

247759
capacity	storage
storage is always contiguous but it may move as the vector s capacity is changed

247772
key-value	key
and if 3 was the size then both the key and values appeared in the brackets with no way of clearly identifying a key-value pair without counting off

247818
aggregate	grouping
i want a methods by which i could access these individual grouping and get their aggregate value

247818
aggregate	grouping
having stored these value i should be able to iterate this multimap and get the aggregate value of each grouping

247818
aggregate	grouping
can anyone propose a solution as to how i could get the aggregate value for a grouping in the above example

247836
implements	abstract
this class hierarchy implements a simple abstract syntax tree ast

247857
red-black-tree	tree
a treemap has to continually maintain tree balance using the red-black-tree data structure

when is memory allocated in the .net compact-framework

247898
local-variables	function-call
such as a local-variables in a function-call

247901
export	report
i ve tried using the sql import export wizard in sql-server 2005 but it always report primary key violations

247922
value	field
i realize django can tell me which value have changed in my form by utilizing the changed_data list object but i d like to know the new value of the field that have changed

247926
constructor	object
for reference types storage for the object is allocated at the point of entering their constructor

247940
integer	zero
you can overflow a signed integer and in theory though not in practice on current mainstream systems the overflow could triggers a fault perhaps similar to a divide by zero fault

247943
constructor	object
my friend suggested that it is an object where the constructor is public but all the members are static

247943
constructor	object
this seems a little silly to me as it would simply be a static object that would not require a constructor at all

247947
constructor	private
i know you can create a custom enum in java with methods and all the same should be attainable in c# if not directly supported then can be done with simple class singleton with private constructor

247962
dependency-injection	singleton
however i will say that monostates tend to have at least all the same problems and singleton and should be avoided as far as possible considering other approaches instead such as parameterise from above or dependency-injection where appropriate

247973
execute	prepare
fetching the first row may do all the work or execute the prepare query or simply fetch the first buffering row

247984
checkstyle	cobertura
i use a combination of cobertura checkstyle ecl emma and findbugs

247984
code-coverage	eclemma
eclemma is an awesome eclipse plugins that shows the code-coverage by coloring the java source in the editor screenshot - the coverage is generated by running a junit test

247985
implements	abstract
an object that can return a measurement at a requested point is very abstract and perhaps a lot of clients could use your interpolator as one strategy implements a more general interface

247985
hashtable	set
this can work like a set and actually it gives better performance than set implementations which are implemented with hashtable or balanced tree

247995
export	csv
you can export it as a csv comma- separated values file and open it with excel or other software

248005
lgpl	gpl
so if i want to use a graphics library that s gpl and not lgpl could i decide to make it part of a graphics service available on a linux computer as long as i release my code that implements this service with this library

248005
driver	kernel
rather then rolling svg into my several apps and thus opening their source code i create a service or kernel driver even that listens on a socket or implements a graphics device which takes svg data and rendering it to the screen using the library

248005
driver	kernel
i release the service kernel driver code as per the library s gpl

248005
driver	kernel
i do not release code for any of my programs that use that service or kernel driver

248005
driver	kernel
i publish the api for the service kernel driver so others can implement it replace it and still run my binaries with a different service driver or develop reflectors etc

248007
constructor	object
actually in spite of what others have said it can be important whether your initialization is inside or outside the constructor as there is different behaviour during object construction if the object is in a hierarchy the order in which things get run is different

248031
linked-list	nodes
contain all methods of linked-list as adding nodess to the list as i ve learned -- insert deleting nodess from the list as i ve learned -- remove traversing the lists i ve learned -- printlist finding a nodes in the list as i ve learned -- find findprevious the problem i m selflearning and i ve tried to search the .net and read more from the stupid c# that was a disaster

248036
unmanaged	c++-cli
c++ tends to not be so well suited to .net even with the c++-cli variant but it is excellent for native programming as always and for providing an interop layer between managed and unmanaged code

248041
any	set
ignoring how well a browser may or may-not handle a gb-sized xml file the only real concern i can think of off the top of my head is if the execution time to generate all the xml is greater than any execution time thresholds that are set in your environment

248042
google-chrome	firefox
i 4get which is for ie and which is firefox google-chrome

248045
negative-number	zero
when using one s complement or signed magnitude you can have zero represented as either a positive or negative-number which is one of a couple of reasons these representations aren t typically used

248051
nested	order
the inner query results will never be displayed so theres no point in doing the order by in the nested selected

248059
png	gif
i fixed a gif transparency problem by switching to png

248065
licensing	gpl
when i m comparing mysql licensing with this i ve seen many commercial applications that have been distributed with a commercial license and install with the gpl versioning of mysql

248065
perl	php
i wouldn t want to judge if this is legal or not but with a database server and the existing abstraction it s more or less natural applications interface with a generic database interface odbc jdbc whatever perl php ruby equivalents are that is talking via a driver to one of many applications

248077
pascal	delphi
long time ago before there was electricity and auto-mobiles you couldn t simply use c-generated .obj files in a pascal or delphi application and vice versa without explicitly wrapping them in a dll and taking care of the calling method and parameter sequence and parameter compatibility or calling out to another executable

248087
design-patterns	anti-patterns
but there are also many undesirable or otherwise indifferent design-patterns such as design anti-patterns as well as undiscovered and or undocumented patterns

248088
nvidia	ati
ati and nvidia do this sort of thing with their graphics drivers for linux

248093
contains	elements
which was in the elements that contains both images

248099
push	pull
if you start with two datetime instances that differ by 37 minutes and 54 seconds before you push them into xml they will still differ by 37 minutes and 54 seconds after you pull them out of the xml

248104
scons	cmake
if not what are the steps i need to follow to create a project that i can use to just debugging an existing c++ program that is built using makefiles or other tools scons cmake etc.

248106
linked-list	nodes
is a bit tricky if you don t have a doubly linked-list but with a singly linked-list go throught he list from the head till you find the nodes you require keeping the previous nodes in a separate variable

248106
linked-list	nodes
alternatively make it a doubly linked-list and you don t need to keep track of the previous nodes

248113
hash	md5
in addition you may want to md5 hash the file and compare it before initiating the download no need to update if the file has no changes this will help with point #2

248121
installation	upgrade
even though it is cumbersome i actually use a few classes that check the database versions and run the necessary scripting either installation of sqlexpress installing the database or doing upgrade

248122
value	field
i am attempting to insert a value 40.33 into a field in sql-server 2000 that happens to be a float type

248122
profiling	trace
when i run sql profiling against the database while the call is happening the value that i see in the trace is 4.033000183105469e+001

248133
attributes	properties
all of them work pretty much the same way the elements and attributes become properties names the values become properties values etc

248133
json	xml
transforming arbitrary xml to json using xslt is simple enough that you can find a half-dozen examples of it on google

248134
python	java
ideally something in c java or python although the last two are themselves garbage-collected so it seems it d be hard to use them...

248167
logging	trace
if you know exactly what is causing the exception catch it and log exactly why you don t really need a stack trace in this case if you are very clear as to what s causing it and you might mention the class that s logging it if you re not already using log4j or something

248178
keyvaluepair	key
you can bind to the properties on the dataitem which in this case is a keyvaluepair having key and value properties

248243
interpreter	runtime
this situation results in strange runtime errors because both interpreter off_t differently

248252
order	join
you can always swap the table order to turn a right join into a left join

248259
linked-list	nodes
a linked-list is a list mode up of nodes

248263
base-class	subclass
some behavior is unique depending on the subclass so i would like to call a virtual methods from the base-class but since all the methodss are static i can t create a plain virtual methods need object reference in order to access virtual methods

248264
design-principles	principles
in my opinion for a solid oo design you should first be familiar with the main oo design-principles then understand how your problem can be represented in those basic principles

248268
for-loop	arrays
if you initialise your arrays to 0 starting from the end of the arrays that s right make a for-loop to do it the errors might go away

248268
malloc	free
i m not sure about how this can be done portably except of course for using malloc and free

248288
difference	count
if dates are represented as a count of days then the difference between two values plus one day and divide by 7 is most of the answer

248289
perl	ruby
ruby perl shell name your poison

248309
put	get
if the library has an init function then you could put the check there but then the client would have to supply the api to get the size of its off_t which generally isn t how libraries work

248315
firefox	safari
this seems to work perfect in ie however i get strange results in firefox safari the repeater works for n number of times and then the text seems to get cut off disappear in the repeater see the attached image

248332
perl	ksh
how would i execute these tasks in parallel with no more then 6 tasks running at a time using ksh and perl

248332
python	java
java or python are not available -

248361
backslash	regex
however i need the regex here to test whether the preceeding backslash is actually escaped itself

248373
execute	declare
because a virtual methods uses the defined type of the initializer object to determine which implementation to execute as opposed to the declare type of the reference variables

248373
base-class	subclass
bottom line is if you want to change behavior based on which subclass an instance is then the methods should have been virtual methods on the base-class not static-methods

248373
base-class	subclass
add virtual instance methods to the base-class that simply delegate to the static-methods and then override those virtual instance wrapper methods not the static ones in each derived subclass as appropriate.

248378
configuration	environment
also in our environment changing a configuration file if there was an error involves the entire change management process approvals etc. which is pretty painful

248406
swing	swt
for myself gui-builders for swing or swt never worked that well that s why i code layouts myself using layout managers

248417
dynamic-linking	static-linking
besides i think you are talking about dynamic-linking since static-linking certainly would not have different switches at same build time

248418
seam	jsf
seam is fixed jsf based on annotations

248427
interop	vsto
i could use a vb6 add-in to draw the menus and forward the calls via interop but then why would i even write a vsto add-in in the first place

248465
ruby-on-rails	django
now i don t really know django but i know that ruby on ruby-on-rails ships with an own web server that can be launched via a simple script command

248478
any	set
for example i can set the open function to be private without any errors but when i make the write methods private it barks at me

248493
duplicates	contains
second your output will contains duplicates as you re testing and outputting each input number every time it fails the broken divisibility test

248502
streamreader	streamwriter
i thought that a streamreader and streamwriter pointing to the same memorystream might work but it doesn t seem to

248507
ruby-on-rails	django
the honest truth here is that any of the small database programs like access filemaker or bento should be more than adequete to suit your friends needs and will likely be simpler for him to maintain than anything that is targetted at web development like django or ruby-on-rails with active record

248515
contains	elements
can you change the css of the parent elements to make it wide enough to contains the fieldset

248538
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
i used to do buser-interfaceld a lot of user-interfaces using gridbaglayout but for years i ve never seen an office-environment user-interface that couldn t be buser-interfacelt with nested borderlayouts gridlayouts and the occasional boxlayout or flowlayout

248541
stream	send
i parsing message packets from the socket stream and send them via msmq to another process that filtering duplicates and writes the packets into a database-table

248545
listitem	selected
when the listitem is selected but i can t figure it out

248568
any	set
i finally got my source code from my scm but now debugging does not stop on any of my breakpoints i have set

248581
listboxitem	selected
you can style your contentcontrol such that a trigger fires when its container the listboxitem becomes selected

248590
ref	out
do not use ref or out parameters to overload members

248627
any	set
copying the general design and feature set may run afoul any patents they have filed

248634
contains	set
insure that the project is set for a debugging compile and not a release compile as the release compile doesn t contains your debugging information

248662
private-key	rsa
is the base64 encoding of a pkcs#8 privatekeyinfo unless it says rsa encrypted private-key in which case it is a encryptedprivatekeyinfo

248662
windows-vista	windows
update the cryptimportpkcs8 function is no longer available for use as of windows server 2008 and windows-vista

248688
json	xml
just wondering if there are any good server-side libraries for ajax prefer json rather then xml but anything is good for classic asp vbscript .

248693
boolean	double
i m mostly dealing with c++ and a lot of the code they write uses double negation for their boolean logic

248719
contains	any
vice versa the source code should not contains any markup languages like html

248724
session-cookies	cookies
check if your headers allow caching without the correct vary http header if you use session-cookiess for instance and allow caching you need an entry in the vary http header for the cookies header or a cache proxy might serve the cached version of a page intended for one user to another user

248730
external	root
i m developing an application that manages network interfaces on behalf of the user and it calls out to several external programs such as ifconfig that requires root to make changes

248730
wxpython	gtk
i strongly dislike the size of the attack surface presented by gtk wxpython python and my application when it runs as root

248731
having	select
i was just having a look at some sample code that scott gu had and found that it can do the select part that you need

248760
basic	vb6
i m not much of a visual basic person but i am tasked with maintaining an old vb6 app

248761
show	next
so the job_id with the next to_do_by_date task is show first

248769
directory	folder
save this automatically saves a local copy in my default directory which is also the folder i have setup using subversion with tourtise svn

248779
temporary	copy
likewise you can change to to open a temporary file and then copy that file back over the original when the substitution s done

248782
attributes	properties
adding duplicate properties in this way lets you apply the designerserializationvisibilty attributes to them which you can use to force the forms designer to ignore the pre-populated rows and columns

248786
getter	setter
you must have a getter and a setter even if you never intend to use deserialization to turn xml into an object

248805
comma	words
then run it you ll get the words separated by comma

248812
logging	trace
for logging we have used scott hilliers code here to create a trace provider to log with

248814
inlining	inline
note that in the last two links about criteria for inlining the one about struct not being inline is out-of-date

248818
any	set
this means not adding anything to the compiler to help your implementation work and not relying on any non-standard implementation details such as a particular stack layout or a means of switching stacks or non-portable system calls to set a timed interrupt to produce a thread library that works only on a particular c++ implementation

248822
ftp	ssh
eclipse has a plugins called rse allow you to work on remote sources thru ssh ftp etc

248833
sql-server	oracle
i don t do oracle and i don t have a sql-server handy - but this should get you fairly close

248833
show	next
so the job_id with the next to_do_by_date task is show first

248836
rollback	commit
once you have reverted your working copy then simply commit the changes and you will effectively rollback the accidental commit

248836
rollback	commit
in a case like yours specifically i would probably check out the revision that i wanted to rollback into a new working copy and then commit the working copy to the head revision

248850
revision	svn
you may need to use the command line but you can use the svn merge command and specify the revision in reverse to effectively revert a commit

248852
updating	updates
if there is an updates you can do your single instance application checks before actually updating by calling

248861
sftp	ftp
lastly both aptana and eclipse provide ftp and sftp support

248864
database-table	mysql
i have a mysql database-table with a couple thousand rows

248873
perl	ruby
extract to flat file and then use your favorite quick language perl python ruby etc to process the flat file

248931
textchanged	textbox
the postback processing makes some decisions about what events to raise based on more than just the event target value if any testing control state values against the values posted by the form such as for a textbox determines whether events like textchanged should be raised

248952
.when	ready
.when the process is finished we overwrite the hash file ready for the next day

248983
selected	button
next i added a button to remove the selected item from the object collection

248983
selected	button
selected an item in the middle of the collection so that the scrollbar is centered and press the remove button

248992
perl	php
ftp is much better suited for large data transfer and can be automated easily via php or perl

249007
shopping-cart	cart
for instance i am building a shopping-cart system and i think that allowing the adding removing etc of items to from a cart could very easily be exposed via gets since even though you can change data you cannot do anything critical with it

249010
selected	cell
but i can only see it when i selected that cell otherwise it s not visible.and it work perfectly when background is white

249011
processor	cpu
i hear a lot of people talking about the revolution that is coming in programming due to multi-core processor and parallelism but i can t shake the feeling that for most of us cpu cycles aren t the bottleneck

249012
subtract	add
one that lets you subtract the tail byte and add a head byte to get the checksum of a block 1-byte forward

249012
subtract	add
if the strong checksum didn t match or if the weak checksum wasn t in the hash roll the weak checksum that is add the next byte after the bloc and subtract the first byte from the tail

249012
subtract	add
add the byte subtract from the tail to the list of new bytes in the patch

249030
entity-framework	ado.net
check the ado.net entity-framework and linq to entities you can look here also a sample entity-framework provider for oracle and here are more examples about creating data providers for ef

249039
triggers	insert
the problem with a is that it s potentially invasive to all of your code though if you re using an rdbms you could do some logging perchance via database triggers to keep track of insert updates deletes and write the information in to a table then export the relevant rows as your differential log

249057
constructor	private
by hiding public constructor adding a private static field to hold this only instance and adding a static factory method with lazy initializer to return that single instance

249064
python	ruby
it seems natural that we would look at some of the nice dynamic web languages ruby python etc and with things like ironruby and ironpython i started seriously investigating

249085
external	root
show log on the project root folder will not show changes for svn external folder yet funny enough commit and update will work with svn externals

249100
external	host
i haven t delved deep into the details as yet i need to do something similar in a few months but i think the easiest way to manage which database a session is connected to is via a custom isessionfactory implementation that can determine which connection to use based on an external aspect such as the host portion of the request url

249115
foundation	cocoa
next go to the frameworks and libraries grouping under the project and add the foundation framework which is the necessary framework for cocoa touch

249115
selected	button
now under the targets selected the gdataiphonelibrary you created and click on the i button or just double click it

249115
linker-flags	linker
then add -lgdataiphonelibrary omitting lib prefix and .a extension to the other linker-flags option which you can find by searching linker in the search box

249125
python	ruby
sneaking a language in is often done by automating tedious manual tasks especially dynamic scripting languages like python ruby etc

249132
linux	aix
we ship java applications that are run on linux aix and hp-ux pa-risc

249146
revision	svn
note that the svn externals definition can include a specific revision

249153
awk	ksh
you can use the ksh builtin pattern-substitution syntax to do this you don t need to use sed or awk or anything

249158
directory	folder
as long as the local directory exists i ve got my working copy svn or working folder vss set up

249168
python	c++
2 try doing this launching firefox from c c++ ruby python and see if that is succeeding

249173
user-input	output
transcript of an interactive j session user-input is indented 3 spaces text in ascii boxes is j output

249173
duplicates	elements
effectively duplicates the first elements of y and lops off the last elements

249173
duplicates	elements
similarly takes all but the first elements of an arrays behead and takes the last tail so is all but the first elements of y with the last elements duplicates

249176
exception-handling	try-catch
in this scenario i would be handling the exception-handling so i have no choice but to add in that try-catch i might as well put in the finally clause and save myself another nesting level

249188
selected	textbox
or a textbox overlapping a html selected with some javascript to fill values from the selected to the textbox

249200
ruby-on-rails	django
i don t need mvc ruby-on-rails django

249200
python	lua
i can use php python or lua for basic scripting and even could do basic c

249233
webserver	nginx
i ve had a good experience with nginx that said when choosing a webserver you should look closely at your requirements and make an informed decision as these things can be very application specific

249258
python	java
well here s a view of why python programmers make better java programmers

249269
any	set
when i set up three forests in the configuration foresta - forestb - forestc foresta was not able to see any credentials from forestc

249273
.net	wcf
this is perfectly possible in .net 2 you do not need 3.0 or wcf

249275
webserver	nginx
it ll also run via your favorite cgi if you want to pair with a standard webserver behind nginx fastcgi -- and i ll second the recs of nginx for massive concurrency on static files

249303
text-editor	editor
the last editor you used for a file is remembered so if you opened a particular xml file prior to installing an xml editor you ll still end up in the plain text-editor when you go to open the file again

249309
return-value	return-type
if by return-type polymorphism you mean overloading based on the return-value type i m not sure about other languages but for c++ here s the answer pretty much from the horse s mouth

249314
inlining	inline
now i like vb in all it verbosity but i m just a bit worried that writing sub...end sub inline could get a bit messy i can see some merit in inlining when you are writing c# when you only have to use something like c .... and you can cut out a lot of code

249319
hide	show
i ve always been curious to see if i can show hide or change a notifyicon created by another application via a c# application

249341
double	int
the above is ambiguous if there are versions of foo that can return double int float etc

249381
subtract	time
calculate a single digit at a time and subtract to get a remainder which you multiply by 10 to get the numerator for the next step

249389
command-line	cmd
the command-line would send cmd and the gui would interpret them

249400
decrement	increment
they can be increment and decrement by any processes

249400
decrement	increment
also because semaphores can be decrement by one process and increment by another they do not have the ownership aspect--so no priority inherited no priority inversion avoidance is possible

249401
aggregate	grouping
you can use an alternate containser that can contains the aggregate sums of each grouping

249404
time-complexity	binary-search
time-complexity of a binary-search is o log n which is considerably faster than a linear search of checking each element at o n

249409
google-chrome	safari
it s good to have ie6 7 8 ff2 3 and google-chrome safari

249409
google-chrome	firefox
you can use ie developer toolbar for ie or firebug for firefox or the integrated inspection tools in google-chrome to inspect which rules are applied to particular element or modify the style of an element on the fly

249422
x11-forwarding	xming
you can also enable x11-forwarding in ssh and use say putty to open up different x applications running on the suse box this if i remember correctly required some sort of a x server to be running on the windows box and for which i have been using xming

249439
double	int
i would love to see this feature in some language not only so that function foo could return a double or an int or a string but also so that foo could return a structure or objects of different classes

249453
xrdp	rdp
you could also try xrdp if you for some reason need to use the rdp protocols

249463
terminate	timeout
timeout can handle the hang situation and waiting on the other process s handle using waitformultipleobjects along with both the process and event handle can determine if when the other process terminate

249477
subtraction	time
in oracle you d use to_date for the conversion and the result of the subtraction will be a float representing the time in number of days

249482
unsigned	short
unsigned short is 32-bit

249494
denied	root
access to the path c windows microsoft.net framework v1.1.4322 temporary asp.net files root 8c91a6b5 649b28ba is denied

249494
denied	root
the access denied was not to the .. temporary asp.net files root 8c91a6b5 649b28ba folder it was to the temp folder that i hade just moved due to a suggestion from the exchange analyzer tool

249498
double	int
int are stored with the right-most bit being 1 and each bit to the left being double that 2 4 8 ...

249513
subtract	add
for lower uppercase you need to add subtract 32

249529
revision	svn
i d very strongly recommend against using svn externals at all without a specific revision

249532
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
if the 3rd party component does not support the standard asynchronous programming model i.e it does not use iasyncresult you can still achieve synchronized using autoresetevent or manualresetevent

249542
arguments	undefined
the text || syntax that ensure that the function will always work even if the arguments passed is null or undefined

249548
common-lisp	lisp
franz makes available for allegro common-lisp and ported to other lisp

249589
perforce	cvs
however the company i worked for at the time switched from the free cvs it was using to perforce

249597
prerequisites	installshield
the install is made using installshield but we use vbscript to check some prerequisites

249600
32-bit	16-bit
however all code is 16-bit code which is not binary compatible with 32-bit code

249617
perforce	cvs
i ve worked with perforce for years as well as clearcase sourcesafe rcs pvcs cvs and subversion

249617
bazaar	git
for many of the cases where subversion trumps perforce many people seem to prefer the distributed systems like git bazaar mercurial these days

249618
silverlight	wpf
in silverlight it work but not in wpf

249652
multiplication	addition
assuming addition and multiplication are both counted as a single operation this function performs o m n operations

249664
protected	public
start with public methods and when code-coverage is given by higher level tests turn them protected and remove the tests

249664
protected	public
inherited a class with a testable interface making protected methods public

249664
protected	public
it seems that junit automatically changes protected methods to be public but i did not have a deeper look at it

249671
selected	listbox
all i want to do is set the fontweight to bold and the foreground to white when an item is selected in the listbox

249684
required	checked
which required the client to checked which member of child is populate and is horribly ugly i know

249703
stderr	stdout
is there some way i can figure out what they re writing to stdout and stderr in a readable way

249703
stderr	stdout
this question is only focused on getting access to stdout and stderr of the running process after starting it

249710
contains	any
make sure the forms unit in the uses list comes after any prior unit that contains a symbol called application

249720
children	nodes
now i have a need to calculate the dominator tree of the direct children of the root nodes and possibly recurse down the graph to a certain depth repeating this operation

249720
children	tree
but sometimes lots of junk floats to the top of the tree so you have a root with thousands of children directly below it

249720
children	tree
for such cases i would like to experiment with calculating the dominator tree rooted at each of the direct children in the original graph of the root and then maybe go to the next level down and so on

249749
administration	account
the service can then use its service or configured account level permissions to either impersonate an administration or do other tasks on the behalf of the user without ever giving the user any kind of elevated permission - even temporary

249752
stderr	stdout
seeing what is being written to stderr and stdout is probably not going to help

249752
stderr	stdout
if it is useful you could use tee 1 before you start the scripting to take a copy of stderr and stdout

249776
superclass	subclass
if you use inheritance you can see a superclass as providing an interface for the subclass

249792
linked-list	arrays
these contain immutable arrays and resize them when needed list t is not a linked-list implementation

249843
default	reset
but you ll have to reset the positioning to bottom-right it default to top-right

249848
buffering	streaming
dataavailable simply means there s data in the streaming buffering ready to be read and processed

249866
click	mouse
mouse click add line elements which appear immediately

249881
dependency-injection	singleton
personally i would go for a dependency-injection framework like unity all of them are able to configure singleton items in the container and would improve coupling by moving from a class dependency to interface dependency

249883
xsd	xml
i have two xml files with two different xsd schemas and different namespaces

249891
reserved-words	keyword
what are all of the standard ansi sql keyword reserved-words functions

249901
ruby	php
specifically i d like to know about java php and ruby on rails

249916
host	dns
the java.net.inetaddress.getbyname string host methods can only return a records so to lookup other record types i need to be able to send dns queries using the dnsjava library

249923
macvim	vim
i didn t get it to work with vim in the terminal and i haven t tested it with macvim

249936
credentials	account
the local system and local service account do not have any network credentials and thus can t be authenticated on the network

249936
credentials	account
if you cannot rely on the network service account being available then you might consider creating a dedicated domain account storing the account s credentials somewhere reading them from inside your service then loging in and impersonating that user prior to accessing the network share

249939
dependency-injection	singleton
why do you need a dependency-injection framework to get a singleton

249949
webforms	asp.net
asp.net web controls are a hodgepodge of and html elements put together to make use of the asp.net webforms page lifecycle

249982
switching	screens
apart from the above at the absolutely lowest level excluding chip-level that you can go is to call the interrupts that switching to the various graphics modes available - there are several - and then write to the screens buffering but for this you would have to use assembler anything else would be too slow

249990
pixels	line
it s stored horizontally pixels by pixels with some dirty regions of pixelss that aren t mapped to screen at the end of each line which you have to compensate for

249991
attributes	properties
i am trying to read a custom non-standard css properties set in a stylesheet not the inline style attributes and get its value

249991
firefox	safari
so i tried getcomputedstyle in firefox 3 and safari 3

249994
debugging	trace
so i could put try catches debugging trace information

250000
show	next
solution instead of showing an alert box when user click ok next submit show a clearly styled eg

250018
message	alert
work in a similar way to what you describe placing a star next to the input with an optional message or summary of messages display on the page rather than the in your face alert way

250029
solaris	debian
there are some solaris versions floating around but there is a debian package for example

250038
emacs	vim
in my project pysmell i have some support files for vim and emacs

multiplication	division
complex multiplication and division follow fortran rules

250103
multiplication	division
range reduction is done as part of complex division but there is no checking whether the result of a complex multiplication or division is nan + i nan with an attempt to rescue the situation in that case

250109
internet-explorer	firefox
i think the only difficult thing was the difference between the way that internet-explorer and firefox require the cancel navigation flag to be set

250117
solaris	linux
one compromise solution might be to have vms either virtualbox or vmware or parallels so that you can fire up a virtual solaris windows mac and or linux box to test it - that will show you how your site looks in the default browsers on each plus you can make sure things actually work through a non-local connection

250120

250949
vb.net	vba
i have used vba only so you need to think around it s limitations it will follow the same scheme in vb.net

250971
pointers	stack
run mode usually means that the debugger hasn t paused execution so stack pointers is constantly going up and down and changing scopes

250973

251085
pointers	stack
and i am glad i started with memory-management lists queues stack and most important pointers

251086
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort and mergesort will always compare neighboring elements

251181
sql-server	mysql
is there something like if exists for sql-server 2000 like in mysql

251202
sql-server	oracle
a large part of my opinion of oracle s stuff comes from my background with sql-server asp.net but oracle is just plain harder to set up and administer and keep running and that applies not just to the database but also to auxiliary stuff like oracle portal their soa suite their mobility server etc

251209
attributes	properties
use attributes on properties like stringlength 25

251238
ip-address	hostname
if you don t know the ip-address for your remote server you can easily get it using the server s hostname like this

251281
hide	show
why dont you just show hide the trs with javascript

251295
callback	methods
your startelement and endelement callbacks could test element name and attributes to decide whether to call specialized methods on the elements to be modified but by default just reconstruct and output the event on which the callback was called

251313
callback	methods
suppose you want to make an async request in javascript but you want to pass some state along to the callback methods

251314
double-quotes	single-quotes
and the key property needed to use single-quotes instead of double-quotes because it was using an eval expression

251327
hosts-file	hosts
alternatively the etc hosts sets the wrong ip-address for example.com

251328
extends	super
it talks about a mnemonic called pecs producer extends consumer super which explains why you use

251329
command-line	cmd
of course you don t want to reveal it here so you might have a bit to do but i guess the sanity check would be that you can access that url via a web browser or cmd line tool such as get if you re cmd-line only

251329
traceroute	ping
you could also just ping and or traceroute to the domain - the results may well be illuminating

251332
tapestry	wicket
reinventing the wheel many web frameworks like tapestry wicket try to address these issues and have done a commendable work

251350
contains	any
once you get that down and understand it you ll probably want to make the sieve function a function templates so that it can take a contains any type

251371
double	int
unsigned int are a lot smaller and easier to process than double

251372
perl	ruby
it s also lesser known than python perl or ruby

251401
assembly	lua
compiling the lua c source code didn t work as when i went to include a reference to the dll in a c# project visual-studio complained that it wasnt a valid assembly

251423
contains	set
the downside of this approach is that it opens up the handle class es to maintenance every time you change the set of types that can be contains

251439
attributes	properties
and then added the attributes to my properties

251439
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

251460
32-bit	64bit
is it possible to run the 32-bit version of visual-studio 2008 professional on a windows-vista 64bit system

251476
jquery	.post
so as an example if you had a comment form at the bottom of an article blog post page and you wanted to add the comment via a jquery .post call you could create the comment object in your controller return it using return json thenewcomment

251484
typename	typedef
instead of value it deals with types there s a list of input types the type arguments and there s a â œreturn valueâ the typedef that declares the typename â œtypeâ

251484
boost	stl
this code construct is an often-used idiom in libraries such as the boost libraries and even in the stl at one place accomplishes the same thing with the only difference that the typedef type is called other

251488
bin-packing	np-hard
i understand that this is related or is possibly defined as a bin-packing problem np-hard

251495
32-bit	64bit
it s been my impression that 64bit windows is designed such that 32-bit programs that live entirely in userland just work

251505
textarea	textbox
we put the textbox textarea in the updatepanel and call a simple save to the db and all of our wysiwyg toolbar disappear leaving us with a bunch of html in textbox

251509
getter	setter
the validation code for getter n setter only fires if the domain-object is modified from the user-interface

251554

251565
user-interface	drawing
the presentation of a mock-up prototype drawing or sketch of the agreed user-interface does not constitute a nearly completed task application nor project

251567
syntax-error	syntax
the object and arrays literal syntax was introduced in javascript 1.2 so is not available and will produce a syntax-error in versions of netscape navigator prior to 4.0

251576
increment	reset
once you ve altered the row then you need to reset the increment to a number guaranteed not to interfere with any other records

251582
gridview	listview
i would think you could define the accordianpanes in the itemtemplate then bind an inner gridview or listview inside each row

251586
qmainwindow	qscrollarea
the qscrollarea is just a widget that you put in a frame or qmainwindow

251590

as others have said vs is a 32-bit app so whilst it runs fine on a 64bit os it will only see the registry and parts of the filing system through the magic mirroring windows provides

251591
contains	elements
the form input name xamt means selected any elements inside a form that contains the term xamt

251597
dictionary	arrays
you can also use an arrays a list in python of size b instead of a dictionary which will be slightly faster not in terms of asymptotics but in the constant factor

251603
any	set
i am leaning toward letting the methods set it up as to not have to check the state of the connection before using it and just having the caller pass any needed data to the calling methods that would be needed to setup the connection

251619
gethashcode	equals
as the dictionary adds and checks existence of each item it uses both equals and gethashcode functions but has to rely on the equals function when the hashcode is less unique

251619
gethashcode	equals
by providing a more unique gethashcode function it excerises the equals function far less often

251625
sftp	scp
there s no scp module yet but it fully supports sftp

251632
python	java
python got a good start in the java world as jython for unit testing

251632
ironpython	ironruby
i d have to say that it isn t so much about the individual language ironruby or ironpython as it is about the style of development that they enable

251641
project-management	scrum
scrum as a pure project-management approach gives you a lot of rope to hang yourself and the necessary feedback to notice early that you are doing so and start corrective actions

251643

a login authentication service may be centralized ldap based

251702
perl	c++
prettyprinter.de an online beautifier for php java c++ c perl javascript css

251711
contains	set
i would like to to execute a linqtosql query to extract all of the item entities which contains a specific set of meta links

251725
execution	jobs
i would tend to be wary about using jobs like this to control execution

251725
message	alert
if an alert was received you could pause the code either until another alert resume_yearend_job was received or a fixed period of time or based on the message the dba sent with the pause_yearend_job alert the message could be a number of seconds to pause or a date to pause until etc.

251726
connection-pooling	pool
it will leads to a really bad situation where it is both hard to manage transactions throughout the application and too many connections are opened and closed i know about connection-pooling it is still more expensive to look up a connection from the pool than it is to reuse an object

251739
procedure	records
another idea would be to write your procedure to process all records but commit every 1000 or so

251739
.when	ready
the dbms job.cancel command could be used by your dba to cancel the job if they wanted it to stop and then they can resume it by rescheduling or rerunning it .when they re ready to go

251741
deployment	install
the main difference here re deployment is that the client must have the framework install - but past that clickonce deployment is very pain free

251753
arrays	loops
- loops through arrays and build an xml string using concatenation

251753
arrays	loops
- loops through arrays to build a datatable

251756
dialog	pop-up
in visual-studio 2005 the modal dialog that pop-up remember their position relative to 0 0 on the windows virtual desktop

251756
dialog	pop-up
if you change your multimon configuration for example removing a monitor and the pop-up dialog restores itself to a position that no longer is a visible part of the virtual desktop you can have a modal dialog existing off screen

251768
administration	enterprise
you could deny the delete privalge from administration through delegation at the root level and then you would need to be an enterprise admin to perform deletions

251780
json	xml
json.net - - has support to convert any xml document to json

251784
testdriven.net	code-coverage
just a suggestion try the code-coverage tool from testdriven.net and compare the results

251785
vxworks	qnx
many posters have already commented that the os is a key element in this respect which is very true most because it must be deterministic see qnx or vxworks

251787
required	checked
this methods is not as efficient as my previous methods - this required 3 checked every time and more than one swap

251798
versioning	upgrade
deploy schema changes as ddl upgrade scriptinging and if you haven t already add a table to contains the schema versioning number which you update at the end of each upgrade scripting

251801

2 when you have two or more entities linked together customer invoice invoice product

251803
keyboard	mouse
most embedded systems are headless no keyboard or mouse or any other hid

251816
textbox	button
my problem is that all the textbox s my formview are getting cleared when i hit the submit button

251816
gridview	formview
to the left of this form there is a gridview that is tied into the formview

251816
gridview	formview
so if i click on an item in the gridview its contents fill the address section formview with the correct data

251816
gridview	formview
i have already done this many times in other pages but none have had the gridview tied to the formview and they have all worked

251822
persistence	stateless
something to the effect of can t initialize persistence context. so left with no other options i added a stateless bean utilmgr to my application and let persistence inject the correct sessionfactory

251825
.when	ready
thus .when people enlist on new machine they get a full set of sources plus external dependencies ready for building the product

251826

251836
groovy	java
groovy script easy enough to throw into java demonstrating the point bobince made about simpledateformat

251883
arguments	default
when a methods overload normally performs the same thing with a different number of arguments then default will be used

251904
value	field
i haven t checked how the defaults are going to work but i d assume that the default value will be baked into the calling code much the same as references to const field

251909
selected	cells
i m using microsoft s dsoframer control to allow me to embed an excel file in my dialog so the user can choose his sheet then selected his range of cells

251909
worksheet	excel
this may work for other ms office objects but when it s excel the class is for the worksheet

251911
firefox	opera
opera and later firefox 1.5 do not consider loading a page from the cache as requiring to trigger an onload event as the complete dom state is also cached

251911
firefox	opera
this is trivial to standardise across browsers as opera and firefox do not exhibit this behaviour if you define a window.onunload event

251951
buffering	streaming
where possible try to streaming data rather than buffering it - you need to be careful here when it comes to linq to objects understanding which operators buffer and which streaming and which do both with different sequences

251960
any	set
any ideas on how to set this up in microsoft sql 2005

updating	updates
is there no way we can tell nhibernate to ignore the updating of the country object and just updates the user

251969
linux	unix
git is very unix linux centric however

251995
getter	setter
the only one besides the aforementioned singleton and its partner in crime the factory wouldn t be a gof it would be setter and getter when applied to an object s native properties

251995
getter	setter
setter and getter applied to member variables are functionally identical to public member variables

251995
getter	setter
a getter without a setter is more like a public final member variables--but at that point why not just use a public final member variables they do no more harm.

251995
getter	setter
with a setter and or getter you are still exposing your inner member structure to the outside world for instances you ll have to refactor other classes if you find you need to change a int to a long and you are almost assuring that some code that should be inside your object is instead being placed outside

251995
dto	dao
dao dto bean objects

251997
listitem	selected
i don t know if there is a one line solution to this but what i was doing before is not using databind and first create the listitem object that will have selected as the text then loop through the collection returned from customer.getall and create a listitem object for each item in the collection and add it to the drop down list using dropdownlist.iems.add myitem i know it doesn t look very brilliant but it does the job after all this is what databind is doing in behind

252014
managed-code	unmanaged
how would you describe the difference between managed-code or java byte code and unmanaged native code to a non-programmer

252034
malloc	free
unmanaged clean up after yourself malloc free

252053
versioning	upgrade
if a new versioning of the 3rd-party library is released it s usually easy to apply your customizations to it allowing for critical upgrade

252055
unbounded-wildcard	bounded-wildcard
what is a bounded-wildcard and what is an unbounded-wildcard

252061
contains	elements
normally elements have unique names if they contains distinct data

252061
output	mode
all this makes me think that to get the exact output you need you might have to use explicit mode

252086
runas	cmd
you can use the runas cmd to run ie as a different user for running your app

252086
credentials	integrated
if you want to just change the credentials for integrated authentication try the setting in the update below

252086
authentication	login
tools internet options security custom level for your zone user authentication login prompt for user name and password

252097
pointers	stack
the frame pointers is a pointers that points to the location on stack of the current function call s context

252097
pointers	stack
anything writing through a bad pointers can cause garbage to end up on stack

252097
pointers	stack
one way a thread can get a pointers into another thread s stack is if the address of a local variables is passed to an api that ultimately deals with the pointers on a different thread

252098
compact-framework	.net
specific to .net compact-framework you have to dispose all graphics related objects graphics pen solidbrush bitmap explicitly or otherwise they will hang around in memory not great when you re working with low-memory devices

252115
lan	wan
it looks great for inter-machine cluster lan wan communication between applications but i m not sure if it is suitable in architectural and current implementation terms for use as a software bus within one machine

252115
communication	messages
would it be worth pulling out a current high performance messages passing framework to replace it with amqp or is this falling into the same trap as rpc by blurring the distinction between local and non-local communication

252127
native-code	unmanaged
unmanaged or native-code

252127
windows-server	windows
also before anyone points out that the .net doesn t support multiple operating systems i need to point out that technically windows 98 winxp 32-bit winxp 64-bit winvista 32-bit winvista 64-bit and windows-server are all different operating systems but the same .net app will run on each

252127
linux	osx
and there is also the mono project that brings .net to linux and mac osx

252132
hide	show
also once a new update is generated show the update toast for about a minute then hide it automatically and change your systray icon to something different

252153
malloc	free
malloc and free

252163
jquery	.post
not sure if this will matter to you but microsoft recently announced support for jquery in the next update for vs 2008 here is the blog .post

252170
web-services	security
there is no reason for a web application to call web-services within itself for data access unless they are intended for client ajax calls or if you need to run the business data layer on another server for extreme security concerns

252185
device-manager	emulation
basically emulation when you go to device-manager and disable a device that way

252187
value	field
if your get set methods do nothing but simply copy verbatim the value onto from a hidden private field you ve gained nothing over a public member and only complicate unnecessarily your class and depending on the intelligence of the compiler slow its usage a bit

252187
value	field
for instance for a simple point class that only holds a couple coordinates and colour and methods to plot it and hide it on screen i would see no point in not allowing the user to directly set the value for its field

252191
udp	tcp
while there are use cases i would guess they re much less common than guaranteed delivery - just like tcp seems to be used significantly more than udp

252193
solaris	unix
we are an all unix shop solaris linux

252231
any	set
placeholder won t have any display anyway set the visibility of that placeholder using css

252245
windows-server	windows
you download it as part of the windows sdk for windows-server 2008 and .net 3.5

252245
order	add
once you ve created your own certificate and have used it to sign your executable you ll need to manually add it as a trusted root ca for your machine in order for uac to tell the user running it that it s from a trusted source

252250
put	get
if you do get them to specify their own smtp server make sure you put a send test email button on there so they can test it

252252
background-color	width
if i apply a background-color to the list item the highlight stretch the full width of the page

252282
selected	cells
i m working on an import from excel dialog that uses automation to allow the user to selected ranges of cells for import

252285
postgresql	mysql
asp.net pretty much requires windows server 2003 but if you re feeling adventurous you could probably use linux or macosx with mono free for your database engine you can use mysql free postgresql free ms sql 6000 or one of many others

252287
virtual-machine	parallels
windows-xp running in a virtual-machine parallels

252293
difference	zero
there are 2389 zero difference between them

252302
32-bit	64bit
for a full explanation 32-bit and 64bit application data in the registry

252303
preserve	copying
not using const everywhere possible to preserve ram and reduce boot time no copying init of variables

252307
javascript	dom
this javascript is manipulating the html dom

252355
.when	ready
notification .when results are ready to use without any blocking delay on i o

252360
pointers	stack
it s not hard to mangle the frame pointers - if you look at the disassembly of a routine you will see that it is pushed at the start of a routine and pulled at the end - so if anything overwrite stack it can get lost

252360
pointers	stack
stack pointers is where stack is currently at - and the frame pointers is where it started at for the current routine

252360
pointers	stack
as i remember the frame pointers is the last stack pointers - so anything logically before the frame pointers shouldn t be modified in the current stack frame - so maybe record this and copy it elsewhere and compare upon return

252370
forwarding	port
you can use ssh s port forwarding to do this

252370
forwarding	port
this will forwarding port 3306 on your local machine to port 3306 on remote.mysql.host.com

252393
getattr	setattr
then iterate them explicit and use setattr new attr getattr old attr

252404
subtraction	time
example of string subtraction on date and time to get file named yyyy-mm-dd hh mm ss.txt

252417
python	c++
specifically how can this be done without writing any additional wrapper c++ code to expose the functionality to python

252451
show	next
every jsf example i can find only show a form submission with dynamic results on the next page

252518
malloc	free
the way it stands now a new or delete will behave as efficiently as malloc and free

252553
any	set
our projects are all related different interlocking modules which form a set of dependencies for any given app

252558
carbon	cocoa
for the mac version carbon and c++ throughout used to be an interesting option that is now not supported anymore so you would want to use cocoa using objective-c in the view and objective-c++ in your controllers to bridge the language gap

252564
struct	unions
unions are used when you want to model struct defined by hardware devices or network protocols or when you re creating a large number of objects and want to save space

252580
contains	set
myunion will only contains an int or a float depending on which you most recently set

252587
versioning	upgrade
ultimately though you ll want to check out your specific versioning information regarding upgrade to make sure you ve considered any versioning specific compatibility issues

252589
windows-vista	windows
windows-vista or windows server 2008 or windows server 2003

252679
global-variables	call
the only reasonable uses i can think of would be to call attention to a particular local variables that overrides say a global-variables with the same name or as an interview question

252680
gridview	listview
on my team we connect our middle tier to objectdatasources and then all of our gridview listview etc.

252680
gridview	listview
then from there you can connect any of your data-view controls gridview listview etc... to the data source

252681
antivirus	mcafee
my conclusion here is that mcafee antivirus is active with at lot of memory in use

252689
any	set
it doesn t seem like there s any drawback to having the doublebuffered property set to true

252691
display	width
finally the windows that display the tagcloud could be in a windows that is 200 pixels wide or the full screen width

252703
methods	extend
what s the difference between the list methods append and extend

252738
gethashcode	equals
for what it s worth that s not the only mistake along the lines of being too close to java personally i d rather equals and gethashcode weren t in object and that you needed specific monitor instances for locking too.

252740
swing	awt
as i said java gui toolkits might not feel native inside osx or even on windows but they sure work on both platforms you could use either swing or awt

252752
return-type	arguments
you can only assign the addresses of functions with the same return-type and same argument types and no of arguments to a single function pointers arrays

252755
glib	gtk
just have a look at anything within glib or gtk

252768
command-prompt	cmd
help for explains the difference the first form is used in a batch file while the second one is used when typing pasting the cmd directly at the cmd-prompt

252783
typedef	struct
using a typedef avoids having to write struct every time you declare a variables of that type

252792
malloc	free
the malloc ed buffer is returned to the caller hence the need to run free on the return-value

252802
malloc	strdup
if the allocation failed it sets errno to enomem and returns null immediately setting of errno to enomem is something malloc does so we don t need to explicitly do it in our strdup

252810
typedef	struct
as greg hewgill said the typedef means you no longer have to write struct all over the place

252810
typedef	struct
update note that there are also highly-regarded c projects where this use of typedef to hide struct is considered a bad idea the linux kernel is probably the most well-known such project

252817
integer	numeric
i know i can tell the compiler if i want a value to be interpreted as a certain numeric type as integer 32-bit signed this way append an i type character to the constant value

252825
hash	md5
so using a secure hash like sha256 md5 has collisions and is slow by comparison i can process about 30mb sec on my ho laptop

252825
updating	updates
the logical and efficient approach to updating the data warehouse involves some form of incremental updates strategy

252852
postgresql	mysql
support for oracle hsqldb mysql db2 postgresql mssql and derby

252860
extends	super
josh bloch also has a good explanation of when to use super and extends in this google io video talk where he mentions the producer extends consumer super mnemonic

252867
typedef	struct
gtk+ aside i m not sure the tagname is used anything like as commonly as a typedef to the struct type so in c++ that is recognised and you can omit the struct keyword and use the tagname as the type name too

252874
remote-debugging	debugging
if it s on your local network setting up remote-debuggingging should be trivial and should also allow you to debugging exceptions that occur prior to your first line of code executing which may very well be the case if the error is binding-related...

252900
python	lua
although lua is not so difficult to write everything about lua is designed to be efficient.and what s more there are little modules for lua but there are so many modules for python

252900
python	lua
finally i chose python rather than lua

252921
magento	cart
magento shopping cart is built on the zend-framework in php

252951
python	c++
i need to find all occurrences of a function call in a c++ file using python and extract the arguments for each call

252962
integer	numeric
how do we scanf or otherwise parsing this numeric string into an unsigned 64 bit integer type in c++

253024
integer	short
every database has a versions table that contains the version simply an integer and a short comment of what has changed in this version

253024
versioning	upgrade
maybe you could distribute a new software versioning and then you want to upgrade the database when a client is actually starting to use this new software

253046
click	mouse
however using firefox s firebug plugins you can click inspect then move the mouse and highlight what your interested in

253064
contains	any
are there any libraries out there preferably a self contains text edit control for .net that have spell check capabilities

253070
nested	order
in gcc you might need auto to declare nested function in order to be able to define it anywhere in function body - see

253083
implements	extends
you have to use explicit interface implementsation in order to implements both and the generic form extends the non-generic form

253085
.net	wcf
in .net 3.5 there is built-in named pipe binding for wcf

253104
javascript	dom
as others have already mentioned gmail uses large portions of obfuscated javascript to manipulate the dom

253110
rad-controls	telerik
link telerik rad-controls in microsoft asp.net-mvc

253116
order	add
in addition i had to add reference the nunit.framework dll in order to write the tests

253121
margins	padding
i could also make a div for example the first child of every table cell and using either padding or margins to get the desired results but that is a lot of extra markup just to accommodate the style

253123
any	set
as expected with any eav architecture this flexibility comes at the cost of reduced performance since any lookup requires multiple self-joins one for each column in the pivoted result set

253160
any	set
in any case if you do set up dummy account and host them on just a few providers you will end up wasting the bandwidth of those providers and maybe dosing them

253194
linux	unix
linux and some versions of unix symlink vi to vim

253196
application-pool	was
my first though was to store these settings in user profiles but there are problems with access permissions for programmatically creating user profile properties boiling down to you either have to give every user manager user profiles permission in ssp or you have to run the application-pool under a domain user not network service

253211
callback	methods
the nested action is the asynchronous callback methods

253227
required	checked
the assert statements aren t required for the code to run but they checked the validity of the input and output

253256
postback	ajax
depending on what screens your users will see if you load the detail views dynamically ajax or postback you may have trouble persisting any information that the user has entered and you will incur a wait users dont like to wait

253259
credentials	account
it will pass the credentials of the windows account under which the code is running

253299
arrays	loops
as far as a cleaner way to output all the values goes you can loops over the result arrays like this

253303
nhibernate	ado.net
whether it s linq2sql or ado.net or nhibernate you will get the same set of benefits problems whether your pk is autoincrement identity or guid

253306
python	java
c c++ java python ruby etc

253306
python	ruby
in the case that there is a significant portion of common code i would suggest looking into python and ruby as implementation languages as there are cocoa bindings for those languages on the mac and on windows with the use of ironpython and ironruby you could use reuse that code in a .net application as well

253316
error-code	hresult
error ranges can be of help here because if the only thing we are interested in is if we are in the presence of an error or not it is simpler to check an hresult error-code greater or equals to 0 is success and less than zero is failure

253324
integer	numeric
obviously i can ignore the columns for integer precision of 10 and scale of 0 but there are other types i would be interested in such as numeric

253331
defined	declare
also image.h doesn t need to forwarding declare the graphic class since you #include the file that defined that class as you must

253333
selected	listbox
you could create your own custom listbox component that descends from tcustomlistbox and add a datasource property for your list and another property such as tstrings to be used as a container to hold selected values

253362
any	set
configure content it can be set on any element in the same project and you might currently selected an element from the project

253375
stderr	stdout
i had to resort to using popen and checking stdout and stderr and then parsing those

253424
entity-framework	ado.net
the basic gist appears to be comments made on the ado.net blog that state the entity-framework is the only thing getting major developer time for visual-studio 2010 and dot .net 4

253426
switching	screens
i want to pass in the strategy for printing output in a tcl function so i can easily switching between printing to the screens and printing to a log file

253430
input-field	fieldset
you could have all of the input-field for a shipping address in one fieldset with a legend of shipping address and the set of all input-field for a billing address in another fieldset with a legend of billing address

253436
contains	elements
the arraylist contains only one elements alert the elements alert contains three strings alerts

253449
contains	elements
the elements is the semantic equivalent of a headline or title for the grouping of form controls contains by the

253454
directory	folder
for .net i set the configuration file to deliver mail to a folder then you can have the automated test inspect the directory and files

253458
entity-framework	ado.net
the basic gist appears to be comments made on the ado.net blog that state the entity-framework is the only thing getting major developer time for visual-studio 2010 and dot .net 4

253463
redmine	trac
i previously used trac to manage my projects but i switched to redmine

253463
redmine	trac
redmine uses textile markup but trac uses markdown so i had a couple of troubles there

253473
python	ruby
calling into dynamic languages such as ruby python

253477
put	get
if you want to get super fancy about it put this in your .vimrc

253522
sql-server	mysql
sql-server mysql

253540
any	set
however you can deactivate this set identity_insert on on sql-server and put any number you want in the column as long as it doesn t violate the uniqueness constraint

253544
postback	ajax
has anyone tried to hook when the postback ends from asp.net-mvc ajax to know when to unblock the ui

253545
oracle	mysql
our systems are a mish mash of mysql oracle sqlserver php asp.net etc etc systems though i guess that that does not matter too much

253587
code-coverage	emma
i ve recently started using code-coverage tools particularily emma and eclemma and i really like the view that it gives me as to the completeness of my unit tests - and the ability to see what areas of the code my unit tests aren t hitting at all

253587
code-coverage	eclemma
i feel like i would be adding a unit test for this methods simply to bump the code-coverage up and get rid of the glaring red highlight that eclemma adds to these lines

253592
contains	any
this will match any string such that if it contains page it must be followed by a number not consisting of only zeros

253603
json	xml
you might need some extra methods or functions to deal with the specifics of your application as well specialized xml json parsing but that should be about it

253614
code-coverage	emma
i m trying to generate code-coverage reports with emma using tests of which some use jmockit as a mocking framework

253616
sql-server	mysql
sql-server mysql

253625
getter	setter
it can also be arguably valid to turn off coverage calculations for trivial getter and setter those that simply set or return a member variables with no other checks or side-effects

253628
udp	tcp
monitor a variety of services on tcp udp

253636
methods	extend
a category allows you to extend an existing class by adding you own methods without subclassing

253640
innodb	myisam
i think exactly what happens will be dependent on which database engine you re using there may even be difference between innodb and myisam in mysql

253679
sql-server	oracle
also i ve previously worked in oracle and sql-server

253684
perl	ruby
i would think this is a fairly easy python perl powershell ruby vbscript program

253685
textbox	button
you could try a flash-based solution that allows you to display whatever text textbox button or anything else as part of your own file upload control

253691
base-class	inherited
i have an abstract base-class which inherited from user-controls and which is then used to derive a number of classes

253695
textchanged	textbox
i tried writing the textchanged ontextchanged into the textbox in the datatemplate but it is not triggers

253700
telnet	ssh
if you write apps for unix and you need to handle users who telnet ssh to your box then you will need command line interfaces

253700
ftp	ssh
but sometimes we have utils that have to be deployable through ftp and run ssh

253701
selected	button
the best option i came up with is to use a namevalue collection of each of the selected paramters and store that to session or a cookie when the user presses the search button

253703
administration	account
this could leave you open to a dos attack against a well-known administration account but you could exempt certain account from the lockout policy or have an alternate way -- using a security question answer -- to logon to a locked out account before the reset period has elapsed

253722
google-chrome	firefox
the replace is for cross-browser compatibility opera and ie add quotes to the url and firefox google-chrome and safari remove quotes

253755
python	lua
lua has fewer libraries than python

253757
subclassing	base-class
in following code i want to extends the behaviour of a class by deriving subclassing it and make use of an event of the base-class

253760
perl	ruby
this is a perl regex question and guys helping people out with ruby python c# javascript--or any pcre client implementations-- probably can t help or see it as a waste of space for the tags they normally read

253761
value	field
i am looking for a scripting to allow users to add a text field to a .dbf table landuse categories and allow them to input update the rows basing on what value in the gridcode numeric categories field they think should be assigned into text categories

253761
value	field
if gridcode value is 4 the corresponding field value of landuse landclass is â œforestâ etc

253763
subclassing	base-class
if you make initializecomponent virtual and you override it for all subclassing the base-class will call the right methods for each of the subclassing if you call the base constructor from the derived constructor

253765
rewrite	rule
you have to put the conditional and the rewrite rule in the virtual host like the arcticle said but for some reason inherited didn t want to work

253768
standard-library	boost
this is written using the standard-library and boost so most of it should work cross platform

253775
exception-handling	error-handling
but going in the other direction using exception-handling allows you to build even higher level abstractions to your error-handling that can make your code even more expressive and natural

253814
linux	unix
the reason is that this will make it possible for perl to run anywhere pcs macs windows linux unix vax bsd.

253820
emacs	vim
next i wanted to learn vim or emacs

253837
dbase	dbf
when you say dbf table are you referring to esri shape file dbf files which are in fact dbase files

253872
user-interface	drawing
so long as you keep the background logic distinct from the user-interface and from the platform-specific stuff like file handling networks drawing to the screen etc

253903
togglebutton	expander
you need to retemplate the togglebutton within the expander s template .

253903
togglebutton	expander
so that you can template bind the background brush set on the expander all the way down through the expander s visuals and into the togglebutton s visuals using two templatebindings

253913
value	field
i have a function i ve written that was initially supposed to take a string field and populate an excel spreadsheet with the value

253913
value	field
if i put anything in for the where-clause the recordset comes back either totally empty or the description field is totally blank where the other fields have value

253925
sql-server	sqlcommand
i have a winforms application created in visual studio 2005 pro it connects to an sql-server 2005 database using the sqlconnection sqlcommand sqldataadapter classes to extract data

253926
value	field
also are you sure you are using the same value in the where-clause - because it is a left join so the description field will be blank if there is no corresponding record in dbo_part

253981
managed-code	unmanaged
the product has a large number of pieces some managed-code some unmanaged

253990
textmate	gedit
setup gedit to be almost like textmate

253993
attributes	properties
get all the properties of a class that have attributess on them versus having to loop through all properties and then check if attributes exists

253993
protected	public
if i want all public internal and protected properties but not private properties i can t find a way of doing that

254003
order	join
this is where the join option is the only option available because a construction like this is not available say multiple order with identical timestamp

254004
code-coverage	emma
i am using the emma tool for code-coverage yet despite my best efforts emma is refusing to see the original .java files and generate coverage on a line-by-line basis

254005
ubuntu	debian
if you are on ubuntu debian plain old emacs with ruby-elisp package isn t bad

254026
punctuation	words
it just replace bounds start end of string transition from words chars non punctuation by single quote

254073
ref	out
use return value or ref or out parameters for that

254086
addition	division
there are no trig functions just some multiplication division and addition

254092
version-control	cvs
tailor a python program which lets different version-control systems interoperate simply calls the external programs cvs and svn when working with repositories of those formats

254094
static-assert	assert
this doesn t address the assert facility which has come down to us from early c days but you should also be aware of boost static-assert functionality in the event that your projects can use boost

254094
static-assert	assert
the boost static-assert facility enables you to make some classes of assert at compile time catching logic errors and the like even earlier

254105
expression	brackets
just brackets your query expression and call take on it

254130
keyboard	mouse
however i think most flash developers and especially those who make games rely on the fact that keyboard input is caught by the flash application regardless of where the mouse is

254135
redmine	trac
trac or redmine are both pretty good

254146
bugzilla	fogbugz
bugzilla fogbugz anything

254152
value	field
suppose that the server put a undefined value could be anything into the field for a null value

254152
value	field
if the meta-data indicates a null value and if the query doesn t have field is null

254160
linux	minix
this book is written by tanenbaum the main guy behind minix which is what linux was based on

254184
dialog	pop-up
i know validation is possible using javascript but i would like the user to only see .drp files in his pop-up dialog

254194
prototypejs	extjs
i ve been using extjs+prototypejs for a while now and it helped me a lot to work into the extjs code with having the more familiar prototypejs along for the ride as well

254195
value	field
just check the extension of the file field s value to see if it is .drp

254205
value	field
grab the value of the form field in your submit function parsing out the extension

254226
having	select
i would use an inner join and select the first record having ordered the records in reverse chronological order based on table2.servicedate

254229
stream	send
the real program is more complicated where it peeks in the stream to see if anything is waiting if not it will skip that process likewise if it doesn t need to send a command to a certain process it doesn t

254229
execl	fork
the hard part is that my popen2 uses fork and execl to start the process and assign the streams to stdin and stdout of the child processes

254244
linux	osx
i can reproduce it on the macs running osx leopard in the office but the linux boxes parse it fine

254250
typedef	struct
to prevent these problems it s a good idea to typedef your classes and struct in c++ too even though at first glance it appears to be unnecessary

254255
penetration-testing	security
i do also have a company do penetration-testing social engineering every year or so as well but with dotdefender i m at least happy that i ve got a baseline security blanket to protect my sites

254261
javascript	dom
the javascript html-only solution still requires single-file input s but essentially you attach an onchange event to your input adding a new input to the dom whenever a file is selected

254279
command-line	cmd
when running the following cmd at the cmd-line

254281
primitive	int
what if you have primitive like int

254299
safari	opera
what about opera safari chrome..

254300
struct	unions
anonymous struct and unions

254300
struct	unions
the problem i run into with this is that when i try to compile those files using msvc either for testing or because the code is useful on more than just the embedded platform it ll choke on most of them i m honestly not sure about anonymous struct unions

254354
uitableview	uiview
drag a uitableviewcontroller to the top level of the existing xib in interfacebuilder delete the uiview uitableview that are automatically created for this uitableviewcontroller then set the uitableviewcontroller s class to match the new subclass

254361
stderr	stdout
the trick here is that createprocess has a parameter where you can pass stdin stdout stderr of the newly-created process

254368
32-bit	64bit
knuth recently objected to 64bit systems saying that for programs which fit in 4 gigs of memory they effectively throw away half of the cache because the pointers are twice as big as on a 32-bit system

254368
32-bit	64bit
my question is can this problem be avoided by installing a 32-bit operating system on a 64bit machine

254374
hash	md5
for larger files you could compute a md5 or sha hash of the files

254403
environment	restart
rule engines usually allow you to change rules without restart your system or deploying new executable code regardless of what promise you receive from a vendor do make sure you test your changes in a non-production environment because even if the rule engine is flawless humans are still changing the rules

254431
groovy	java
groovy is just a wrapper script for the groovy jar that sets up the java classpath

254435
32-bit	64bit
imagine that you have a 16kb l1 data cache if you re purely storing pointers you can store 2 14 2 2 2 12 4096 32-bit pointers but only 2048 64bit pointers

254437
directory	folder
for recursive directory uploads your best solution is using google-chrome 11 s new folder upload api

254441
persistent	transient
it turned out that if a dataresult was created with a transient subobject and the subobject was persistent the dataresult hashcode was changed

254455
aggregate	grouping
grouping in sql have a row column shape grouping keys + aggregate

254461
any	set
so is there any way to get the type of an object that is set to null

254488
any	set
so is there any way to get the type of an object that is set to null

254493
organization	naming
the advantage to this is visual organization in sql management studio you can get the same thing by putting everything under one schema and naming tables with a single identifier

254504
dump	temp
you might use a temp table to dump print statements and return it alongwith results

254506
python	perl
also checkout this previous stackoverflow.com question emulation of lex like functionality in perl or python for similar answers

254516
.when	ready
however both miss the most important metrics to a user .when is the page - above the fold - ready for use to the user

254518
hash	md5
i would use a hash of the file s contents using md5

254521
driver	kernel
configure and launch kernel using the cuda driver api since the execution

254529
shell	bash
his solution will force the shell to be interactive if it accepts -i to mean that and bash does

254539
object-reference	instances
error was object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

254569
reliability	scalability
seven joins makes it tougher for reliability but more important are performance and scalability

254578
configuration	logging
adding a configuration file and logging to an app increases its objective complexity yeah only a little bit sure but simplifies maintenance

254594
32-bit	64bit
i ve seen somewhere that the best mix on x86 cpus is to use a 64bit os and 32-bit applications

254594
32-bit	64bit
but it doesn t offend me to run 32-bit firefox on a 64bit kubuntu machine like i ve seen on some forums

254609
svnadmin	dump
if you re really desperate do a dump of the repo look at svnadmin dump and then grep through it

254635
executable	upx
pythoninstaller comes with built-in support for upx and uses it to compress the executable but they are still really huge about 2 7 mb

254641
protected	public
it only operates on public properties though no protected or internal members and no fields

254643
where-clause	sql
then write another sql statement that only includes the tables necessary to generate those key columns hopefully this is a subset of the tables in the main sql query and the same where-clause with the same filtering predicate values.

254647
32-bit	64bit
let s assume you have a 64bit capable cpu that can also run in 32-bit mode like some intel core duo

254647
32-bit	64bit
so you have 32-bit pointers but you can not use the extra registers instructions that are available on 64bit mode

254647
32-bit	64bit
the abi runs in a very strange way that all the code data pointers kept in memory files are 32-bit wide but they are loaded into 64bit registers as zero-extended

254647
32-bit	64bit
this way pointers are 32-bit but appz can be 64bit meaning they can make use of the 64bit registers and instructions

254673
base-class	accessor
what i have really gone and done is add non abstract accessor methods to the base-class

254688
any	set
it seems from at least what i can tell a full fledged architecting set of tools.it seems you really dont need to use .net to take advantage of it its just the code that could be generated will not do you much good if its not for .net but the use case diagrams activity diagrams user stories flowcharting process diagrams aspects could still be very usable for any project

254695
authentication	login
i have a login page where i authentication the user

254695
authentication	login
when the authentication pass i then redirect the user to another page via response.redirect with the url defined in login control s destinationpageurl

254713
derived-class	base-class
basically the default non-virtual multiple-inheritance will include a copy of each base-class in the derived-class and include all their methods

254726
string-length	integer
is string-length stored as a private integer attributes of the string class

254743
json	xml
i decided to take the json plunge and i ve never regretted leaving xml behind

254743
json	xml
sure there was the one-time pain of converting my data transport from xml to json but it paid for itself rather quickly

254748
for-loop	arrays
my own recommendation would be to use an indexed collection then use a for-loop with an appropriate index calculation here one could use a random number generator if necessary with an integer arrays or some other technique for verifying that the same index value is not used twice if you have to do this in actual practice

254781
groovy	gsp
i haven t done this in a while for jsp but frequently use a similar technique in gsp groovy grails server pages

254787
webforms	asp.net
in asp.net webforms we have server components that can be encapsulated into an external assembly and shipped as product

254787
controller	routes
and if the component needs some logic a http module that add some new routes and a controller defined in the same external assembly to handle the ajax calls

254808
order	join
however at least in oracle 7 is a special number as any more than that and the optimizer can no longer test every join order due to factorial growth in the number of possibilities

254823
value	field
if they click on one of these it ll take them back to the page they were on #nav1 3 focus on that field and let them type in a new value if they need to

254846
arrays	loops
wrap your head around arrays and loops to get started and you ll be well served

254858
linux	unix
so with any posix system linux unix mac os you can simply set it when calling the script like this

254864
curly-braces	include
so i know it s considered somewhat good practice to always include curly-braces for if for etc even though they re optional if there is only one following statement for the reason that it s easier to accidentally do something like

254864
getter	setter
i ask because i don t believe i ve ever seen this style before for if or loops but i do see it used for getter and setter in c# properties like

254883
ref	out
i modified it a little bit to get it also compile under linux with winegcc to produce native linux elf out of win32 code and to handle by ref calls automatically stock disthelper required the programmer to setup his her own variant

254904
alignment	spacing
the whitespace in form of new lines indentation spacing alignment and so on is an important aspect of typography and is widely used to improve readability of the text in articles books and web sites

254956
triggers	insert
i m not sure if you can do this in mysql but you could have an insert update triggers on the table that encrypts the data as it s saved to the database and then have a view on the table that automatically decrypts the ssn

254965
contains	any
i think you can do gdi+ drawing in just about any windows in a .net windowss forms project but what do you recommend as the best built-in control for contains custom drawing

selected case ctype sender radio-button .command

254993
hide	show
in other words just hide the button that the user presses and show the other two

254999
any	set
the only effective way is to set and check some access-token at the server it is trivial to manipulate any data at the client therefore plain javascript and html are not enough

255005
bmp	gif
just like gif jpg emf wmf bmp

255008
spaces	output
i am using controls which are not owned by me and it produces output with white spaces

255009
ruby	php
you can better make pure html javascript components and that are usable on multiple platforms ruby on rails php python java and with a tutorial how to integrate them on several platforms

255030
attributes	properties
you use attributes to let .net know which properties match which elements

255067
windows-xp	windows
tested on different computers running windows-xp without a sp also on windows-xp sp 1 sp2 sp3 and on various vistas not sure which types but should work all the way from vista home basic to vista enterprise super-mega-premium-extended edition and windows 7

255073
typedef	struct
then for each pointer you ll need to use marshal.ptrtostructure to dereference the pointer into a pcredentials struct instance sorry i cannot find the typedef for pcredentials anywhere i ll assume you have it - and if you do don t forget the correct marshalas attributes and structlayout attribute when you do define it

255082
codeigniter	cakephp
i have narrowed it down to cakephp and codeigniter

255095
coverity	klocwork
so it depends on whether your priority is quality checking findbugs coverity or security vulnerability analysis klocwork or fortify

255117
coverity	klocwork
we use findbugs pmd coverity and klocwork because they all have different strengths and we are paranoid

255124
solaris	linux
you can follow tpgould s link to the solaris source or it s easy to find the source online from any linux or bsd distribution

255129
any	set
the disable flag on that button would not be set until the button event handler completes and any additional clicks will be queued in the windows message queue behind the first click

255133
click	mouse
this one seems very inefficient you ll add and remove an event listener every time the mouse is click anywhere inside your app

255205
spaces	output
it produces a 512 bit output and thus has equal spaces requirements to sha-512

255212
configuration	environment
that the article quoted above is the theory for external tool defined through configuration file not through environment variables

255212
diffmerge	winmerge
which illustrates the concrete settings of diffmerge and winmerge for msysgit and gitk

255217
parentheses	braces
if you use parentheses instead of braces you ll get the linux behavior on the other ksh implementations

255235
factors	matrix
the matrix can scale down by a factors of ab.mag 2 remember the matrix are only calculated once per a b meaning that it s better that finding them is slower than the actual check itself

255252
contains	any
in .net any delegate is in fact actually a multicast delegate it inherits from this built-in base class and therefore containss an internal linked-list which can contains any number of target delegates

255254
.when	ready
it is a drag .when you are programming one part of an application but need data that can only be added with another part that is not ready yet or very cumbersomely by directly inserting it into the db

255316
bugzilla	trac
i also like mylyn and tasktop to work with bugzilla trac to manage projects

255360
derived-class	base-class
md.invoke was only able to call base.x because a base-class s methods are accessible within the derived-class through the base keyword

255369
assign	add
basically start at the top left of the image for each pixels add the error the difference between the original value and final assign value for the pixelss to the left and above before comparing to the cut-off value

255370
command-line	cmd
however each of the approaches above results in the same issue the java ant task cmd-line cmd that issues the build or should trigger the test generates no observable side effects and returns the value 13

255417
shell	bash
when you fire a shell script it runs a new instance of that shell bin bash

255430
groovy	java
since you can pretty much write full scale java code in a groovy class you can have the cake and eat it too

255474
quirks-mode	doctype
if your doctype is absent or is incomplete the browser will likely be rendering in quirks-mode

255474
safari	opera
mozilla safari and some recent versions of opera actually implement an almost standards mode which is dedicated entirely to transitional pages

255474
enterprise	legacy
in an enterprise production environment for a highly-demanded web-based service there are inherently more complicated dependencies on legacy systems and 3rd party code products which themselves may be on a roadmap for removal or redesign but the execution of such changes must be done methodically and incrementally

255476
wxpython	pyqt
it would simply be a browser gui instead of a wxpython pyqt gui

255481
versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade the application easily and all users have the same versioning of the app running

255481
configuration	environment
you know the environment that your application will be running in the server hardware os which makes for easier testing and support compared to the multitude of operating system hardware configuration that a gui app will be installed on

255481
swing	awt
qt gtk wxwindows java awt java swing xul -- they all suffer from the same problem the resulting gui doesn t look native on every platform

255485
bug-tracking	bugzilla
3 a bug-tracking system bugzilla

255492
export	csv
export to csv

255501
installation	upgrade
easier to manage no installation required on user machines upgrade need only be performed on server side and are immediately available to all users

255507
typedef	struct
if a future standard allowed you to declare a struct elem without a struct qualifier or appropriate typedef the above program would fail because elem is being used as an identifier for an int

255509
any	set
i ve heard that projects developed using tdd are easier to refactor because the practice yields a comprehensive set of unit tests which will hopefully fail if any change has broken the code

255512
linux	unix
n is a linux unix line break

255514
versioning	downgrade
using netnewswire a desktop-application if i don t like a change in the newest versioning i can quite easily keep using this one or try it and downgrade

constructor	object
use arrays or common container for object only if they have default and copy constructor

255639
access-control	authentication
in some databases you can still use the database access-control by careful use of views so that each authentication user gets a different view

255644
principles	lsp
this conflicts with my long-time believing in lsp liskov substitution principles

255659
difference	count
it doesn t take into account the difference between the best case worst case cycle count for each operation the costs of cache misses pipeline misses potential automatic parallelisation etc

255720
export	report
the web interface is fairly user friendly and you can export generated report in a variety of formats

255726

constructor	object
the constructor of your a object allocates another object dynamically and stores a pointer to that dynamically allocated object in a raw pointer

255741
pascal	ada
i m a complete ada newbie though i ve used pascal for 2-3 years during hs

255747
quirks-mode	doctype
quirks-mode used when no correct doctype is found correct from the browsers point of view try to render the document as some old version of ie would do one of the most important differences affects rendering the most is that some browsers exploits the ie box model bug in this mode

255759
textmate	vim
her is the fuzzyfinder textmate vim plugin that the post refers to

255769
any	set
i dont have a copy of delphi to hand but i m fairly certain if you set the wordwrap property to true and the autosize property to false it should wrap any text you put it at the size you make the label

255790
textbox	button
so say you have a textbox on your dialog called usernametextbox and a button that ends the dialog with the ok result

255796
any	set
you can use a fact that you can set any additional properties to string object like to all others so you can create string.0 string.1 .

tic-tac-toe	pong
graphical programming is the most fun and even a fairly large program like calculator tic-tac-toe or ping pong can be explained to children

255981
groovy	java
edit another thing to think about based on vonc s point about let s try ... - perhaps start with an interactive language such as groovy which is very like java or find a java shell of some description to allow your son to explore the language by executing things immediately

255988
simplemodal	jquery
i ve been quite happy with the jquery plug-in simplemodal

256019
arrays	map
you should create a file large enough for the arrays suitably padded according to getsysteminfo and the map the file with createfilemapping mapviewoffile

256024
selected	cells
first of all you will need to get a list of all the selected cells

256024
selected	cells
so programmatically selected cells could be a double edged sword

256037
pixels	line
qbasic had sucky graphics but it had fairly simple calls to turn pixels on and off and draw line and when i was 12 or 13 a lot of us would just make weird effects with the graphics in qbasic using loops etc.

256037
python	java
if java s verbosity is too much to keep your kid s interest try python

256038
contains	elements
in my situation the map will always contains 15 elements but it is being queried non stop and performance is critical

256046
hash	md5
insert into example hash value md5 hello

256059
data-access	nhibernate
however i would reccommend using an orm solution like nhibernate if your application is not very simple because there are little differences in the sql language between access and sql-server that can make your data-access code more complex

256063
contains	set
the testdecorator defines a special suite which provides a setup and tear_down methods which run only once before and after the running of the set of test-cases it contains

256092
version-control	bazaar
i have used bazaar a.k.a bazaar for some time now and have found it an excellent and free version-control tool check it out here

256092
bazaar	git
bazaar is a distributed version tool just like git but is imo simpler to setup and use

contains	elements
you can always contains the event binding to specific elements so as not to bind events multiple times to the same elements

256222
python	java
i know that in java there exists java.lang.illegalargumentexception -- is it well understood that everybody will be creating their own badvalueerror s in python or is there another preferred method

256225
double-quotes	spaces
this gets really tricky when you have file names such as with quotes and double-quotes and spaces

256225
contains	any
on unix a filename single component can contains any characters except

256225
command-line	cmd
cmd-line to see what arguments are actually passed to the cmd

256241
versioning	upgrade
not the latest versioning but that s easy enough to upgrade

256243
profiling	debugging
first turn off all the profiling and debugging switches

256245
json	xml
json is much better than xml for browser application and the size is smaller than xml as well

256245
internationalization	translation
the recent gwt is also great for building weblication with ajax it translation the java code into javascript with internationalization features etc

256254
scala	java
looking over the scala examples the code seems more familiar my background is c and java but it seems decidedly more oo procedural and less functional

256254
scala	java
a huge advantage of scala would be that it gives me another language tool to use side by side with java and could become another arrow in my current professional quiver as opposed to solely being a learning exercise

256254
haskell	scala
in other words will haskell challenge my preconceptions harder and faster than scala

256287
partcover	gallio
i am trying to run partcover to test the coverage of some tests with gallio on windows x64

256294
32-bit	64bit
the problem is caused by partcover trying to load a 32-bit dll when it is running under the 64bit .net vm

256298
any	set
it has a significantly reduced feature set no branching tagging or repository revision - but doesn t need a central repository or any server setup either

256310
.net-cf-3.5	.net
if you re doing .net cf development check out the power toys for .net-cf-3.5 for utilities that can help you pinpoint bottlenecks especially memory-related ones

256322
compact-framework	.net
at work i use mostly the .net compact-framework 3.5 for developing applications that run on smart devices

256326
put	get
get the last 24 hours of logs count the number of requests to each article and put those numbers in the database

256351
constructor	object
that is because an unnamed temporary object is created using a copy constructor the compiler may not use the return value optimization

256359
put	get
put is often described as the edit methods as by replacing the entire resource with a slightly altered version you have edited what clients will get when they next do

256359
http-get	get
the keyword get mapping to the state get indicating the http-get methods

256359
http-post	post
the keyword post mapping to the state post indicating the http-post method

256367
contains	set
i ve got most of the code figured out to fill the dataset at runtime but part of my object contains a dynamic arrays of tpoint records and i have no idea how to set up the dataset and the loading code to make that work

256434
json-rpc	xml-rpc
json-rpc and xml-rpc in c++

256444
tree	trie
a search on the boost main page suggests they have a splay and avl tree but not a trie

256447
equals	getter
if you re dealing with an orm make sure to always use getter and never field references in hashcode and equals

256453
project-management	project
your best bet is to go and get a good book on software project-management the recommendation for the software project survivial guide is a good one and go from there

256498
brainfuck	scheme
at this point it s more important that you understand the concept of what these abstract data types are because they can be implemented in any language c# php scheme brainfuck etc.

256498
data-structures	dictionary
look in nist s dictionary of algorithms and data-structures as a secondary resource to your textbook to understand what these things mean

256498
dictionary	map
and the interface of a dictionary data structure in java is map

256511
binary-search-tree	skip-lists
my question is - why would you ever want to use a skip-lists over a binary-search-tree

256517
pascal	basic
when i was learning java coming from a background of some 20 years of procedural programming with basic pascal cobol and c i thought at the time that the hardest thing about it was wrapping my head around the oop jargon and concepts

256547
haskell	erlang
languages like haskell whose programs are easily parallelizable since any function that has side effects must be explicitly marked that way and erlang which i unfortunately don t know that much about

256580
sql-server	oracle
the schema i referred to was in-fact deployed on oracle and sql-server

256580
sql-server	oracle
they did diverge in a few places between oracle and sql-server but for the most part they used a common schema between the databases to minimize the development work needed to support both dbs

256582
compatibility	platform
maybe they started on a different platform or wanted cross platform compatibility

256584
sql-server	oracle
they probably were used to using oracle and didn t properly read up on the available datatypes for sql-server

256591
communication	messages
i drew on experience writing a complex multi-process communication system using the real-time messages based system qnx

256591
protected	public
using reflection it is further enforced that child object has no public methods nor any package or protected methods except those inherited from isolatedobject nearly all of which are final

256591
getter	setter
no getter returning stale cached thread data and no setter changing object state while another methods is acting on it

256598
erlang	scala
this is something that erlang first brought to the grid iron but which has been carried forward by newer languages like scala actors on the jvm

256605
linked-list	skip-lists
i find that implementing in-order traversal forwards and backwards is far simpler because a skip-lists effectively has a linked-list inside its implementation

256609
visualsvn-server	trac
visualsvn-server + trac + tortoisesvn + ankhsvn

256622
xsd	xml
retrieve xml content format has been defined in an xsd file and store into objects

256625
python	ruby
not to offend anyone please post code samples in a language like c# python javascript ruby etc

256628
iteration	set
i m trying to set up a loop where an animation runs a certain number of times and a function is run before each iteration of the animation

256628
scriptaculous	jquery
i ran into this problem with scriptaculous before i switched to jquery and discovered a beforesetup animation callback

256630
environment	execution
you seamlessly refer to that environment from inside the execution part the lambda

256631
revision	updates
one isn t for instance firefox 3.01 revision 3 updates 6 service pack 9 and the other well you get the picture

256634
for-loop	loops
but if i put the services in a loops a simple for-loops

256638
variables	boolean
so if i want to assign to variables boolean value of whether flag is found i have to do like below

256639
powerpc	arm
look at bundling on ia64 dual instruction sets on arm thumb register windows on sparc the count register on powerpc

256643
python	lua
in lua and python it s a very natural thing to do when just coding because the moment you reference something that s not a parameter you re making a closure

256667
websphere	ibm
ibm is now trying to implement a technology called embedded websphere with java

256670
32-bit	64bit
mixing 64bit and 32-bit is something mac os x does much better. 7.04 worked fine running 32-bit applications on the 64bit kernel

256672
coalesce	isnull
i think coalesce function partially similar to the isnull but try it

256674
quirks-mode	doctype
if the document don t have any doctype quirks-mode is selected

256674
quirks-mode	doctype
official w3c doctype without the correct url the second string in the tag selects quirks-mode

256674
quirks-mode	doctype
edit of course it is more complex than that and it even differs between browsers which of the recognized doctype triggers quirks-mode

256678
implements	extends
this architecture scale extremely well and is very easy to implements and extends as soon as you understood the basic principle

256698
postgresql	mysql
i m a postgresql fan too and this is something that has always frustrated me about mysql when i have had no choice but to use it

256730
.net	wcf
not about measuring - but about improving i ve been working on protobuf-net an implementation of google s protocol buffers a compact low-cpu binary serialization format for use with .net - including a wcf hook to replace the datacontractserializer

256735
perl	php
php toyed a bit with ruby now going manically into perl

256761
emacs	vim
a hack that would end the vim emacs flame war

256778
instrumentation	profiling
of course using a profiling makes your code slower but that is unavoidable when adding any kind of instrumentation

256785
jmonkeyengine	java-3d
there are also a couple of java-3d engines out there jmonkeyengine is only one of them

256826
put	get
rest is a principle and atom-editor is how you convey bulk of data when it needs to for post put requests and get responses

256826
json-rpc	xml-rpc
xml-rpc and json-rpc are especially good match

256826
json-rpc	xml-rpc
xml-rpc and json-rpc don t bother defining one

256826
http	ssl
it is obvously ssl http

256826
http	ssl
i can t currently remember how xmlrpc deals with but with jsonrpc implementation that i have it is trivial - you merely change http to https in your urls to jsonrpc and it shall be going over ssl enabled transport

256833
twisted	pyro
use a python-specific rpc library such as pyro or what twisted provides twisted.spread

256850
value	field
a field that only has 2 possible value will never use that index

256852
32-bit	16-bit
does it store a 16-bit 24bit or 32-bit unicode char

256872
arrays	loops
even with something like an arrayslist or vector where get is a simple arrays lookup the second loops still has additional overhead that the first one doesn t

256893
driver	kernel
since the driver executes in kernel mode blam

256893
driver	kernel
except for kicking off don t use beginxxx outside of the callback handler and don t call beginxxx until you ve called endxxx because you ll induce a race conditional in driver code that runs in kernel mode

256899
web-services	security
what s the best way to go about implementing security through web-services in java jboss and where can i read about it

256911
web-services	security
for web-services security in jboss i would start by reading 8.4 ws-security of the jbossws user guide

256914
expression	evaluation
immediate evaluation means a jsp page evaluates the expression when the page is rendered

256914
expression	evaluation
deferred evaluation means that the technology using the unified el takes over the responsibility of evaluating the expression from the jsp engine and evaluates the expression at the appropriate time during the page lifecycle

256914
value	field
the following example shows a jsf inputtext tag which represents a text field component into which a user enters a value

256914
attributes	properties
the inputtext tag s value attributes references an expression that points to the name properties of the book bean

256914
expression	evaluation
during this phase the expression merely accesses the value of quantity from the book bean as is done in immediate evaluation

256919
linux	aix
the code could be built on various platforms aix linux hpux vms maybe windoze using different flags - so results should vary

256938
background-color	height
the footer has a different background-color than the rest of the page and will have a height that depends on how much content the database throws to it

256953
markup	xhtml
and what if i mix html 5 markup with xhtml 1.0 trans

256998
markup	xhtml
because of that creating xhtml is connected with more restrictions in the form of markup than html is

257001
openoffice.org	uno
in 2007 my project successfully used openoffice.org s universal network objects uno interface to programmatically generate ms-word compatible documents .doc as well as corresponding pdf documents from a java web application a struts jsp framework

257001
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
openoffice.org uno also lets you build ms-office-compatible charts spreadsheet presentations etc

257001
openoffice.org	uno
uno is include within the openoffice.org suite

257001
openoffice.org	uno
an openoffice.org software development kit sdk is available contains example applications and the uno developer s guide

257001
openoffice.org	uno
i have not investigated whether the latest openoffice.org uno can generate ms-office 2007 open xml document formats

257001
openoffice.org	uno
the important things about openoffice.org uno are

257001
linux	unix
it is platform-independent windows linux unix etc.

257001
openoffice.org	uno
openoffice.org uno developer s guide

257020
children	nodes
there are some implementation details like when you move a nodes in the hierarchy you have to change all children too etc. but it s not hard

257057
constructor	object
you can have an object that changes the cursor to hour-glass in the constructor and back to the previously saved value in idispose and then the resource is the changed cursor

257059
versioning	migrate
you should be able to run them against your migrate test database for every versioning which is still deemed to be possibly live - which may well be every versioning ever in some cases

257072
simplemodal	jquery
two using jquery simplemodal plugin

257072
simplemodal	jquery
jquery simplemodal plugin demo

257085
firefox	safari
i got a javascript that runs very well on firefox and safari but refuses to run on ie

257090
project-management	project
i don t think any of the project-management tools tasks wbs gannt charts etc are much good at the management of the detailed tasks that happen when you re into the main software development phase - i usually end up in excel for the project i m involved in

257101
workitem	fogbugz
collective team discussion may be managed by above - discussion on workitem like fogbugz for example

257115
continuous-integration	teamcity
not sure about hobbit but teamcity is another nice continuous-integration server

257122
variables	boolean
it can t be easily done but so what if you just passed an extra boolean variables to the function

257133
unique	words
i d say your best bet is to look for key words - articles that kind of thing - that are unique to the languages you re looking for

257141
python	ruby
you can do alot of it with the subversion command line client and some scripting ruby or python but don t expect people here to write the code for you

257141
command-line	cmd
when processing data from the subversion command-line client you may find it easier to use the --xml option accepted by the log and info cmd which outputs the data in xml-format

257152
binary	hex
if i have two things which are hex can i someone how append their binary together to get a value

257164
contains	elements
there is likely a function called filtering which takes a function that returns a boolean and a list and returns a new list contains only those elements in the first list that when passed to the function returned true

257166
haskell	scala
in other words will haskell challenge my preconceptions harder and faster than scala

257169
authentication	login
at the very least the online system would need a very basic profiling to represent you so that you could login authentication against.

257180
iteration	elements
in each iteration you create an elements with add_elements and then try to access that elements with

257184
buffering	capture
by default echo will send data to stdout but you can set a buffering which will capture the output into a variables instead

257189
web-applications	web-services
i ve heard a lot of people touting success using linux based proxies to handle routing for high availability of web-applications but what are others doing with web-services

257221
url-rewriting	query-string
i don t want to keep language parameter in query-string all the time so i need to use url-rewriting maybe

257232
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
after going through google searches i found out a solution that should work 1 but i cannot compile the source i guess that is because i use sharpdevelop not ms visual-studio

257242
haskell	scala
no way is scala going to bend your mind anywhere near as much as haskell will

257242
haskell	scala
the main reason to choose scala over haskell when learning fp is to give yourself a more gentle introduction to the dangerous wilds of monads functors and higher-order goodness

257247
any	set
you can use the range object in vba to set the value of a named cell just like any other cell

257259
linked-list	nodes
the code give above is the popularly wrong version of a function for adding a new nodes at the head of a linked-list

257276
getter	setter
default snippets suck but customizability shines searching for usages and going to declarations eclim grep ctags generating getter and setter java_getset or eclim automatic imports eclim

257279
firefox	safari
firefox safari and co

257304
decimal	hex
it doesn t matter if you initialized it with hex or decimal literal in either case the value of the char will be the same afterwards

257305
keyboard	mouse
you ll need to create a windows with sdl_setvideomode to get mouse and keyboard events

257305
keyboard	mouse
i don t think you ll have luck trying to sdl_wm_grabinput the mouse and keyboard without a windows

257321
firefox	safari
when firefox and safari encounter this ambiguity they return the text of the selected option

257326
boost-function	boost-lambda
boost.bind boost-function and boost-lambda are your friends

257336
any	set
if any are set to false check the gac for old builds of your libraries

257359
64bit	x86
on an x86 platform usually double is 64bit and long double is either 64 or 80 bits which gives you 19 significant figures if i remember right

257363
selection-sort	quicksort
however when we get to the scale of thousands of numbers or more typically we say that selection-sort is the naive algorithm because it has the quality of o n 2 time which would be too slow for our purposes and that the non-naive algorithm is quicksort because it has the quality of o n lg n time which is fast enough for our purposes

257363
selection-sort	quicksort
in fact the case could be made that in the context of sorting a list of ten numbers quicksort is the naive algorithm since it will take longer than selection-sort

257370
display	width
if you also float left set a width and display inline the other input-field the should appear on the same line

257381
insertion-sort	selection-sort
the intuitive algorithms you normally use to sort a deck of cards insertion-sort or selection-sort both o n 2 can be considered naive because they are easy to learn and implement but would not scale well to a deck of say 100000 cards d

257385
arbitrary-precision	bigint
there are also some various bigfloat bigint libraries around for c++ that allow arbitrary-precision math

257386
decimal	hex
since hex on a computer is nothing more than a way to print a number like decimal you can also do your comparison with plain old base 10 integers

257400
uiimage	nsimage
i am trying to load uiimage object from nsdata and the sample code was to nsimage i guess they should be the same

257400
uiimage	nsdata
but just now loading the image i am wondering what s the best to troubleshoot the uiimage loading nsdata issue

257401
selected	checkbox
using the prototype method adds support for checkbox and selected multiple inputs

257408
32-bit	64bit
its floating-point functions have unlimited mantissa and 32-bit or 64bit depending on the native word size exponent

257410
unsigned	short
unsigned short s

257415
solaris	linux
most linux and solaris servers will already run an ssh service for administration so if your python program use ssh then you don t need to open up any additional ports or services on remote machines

257417
jedit	emacs
i think you re either stuck with some emacs variant or jedit

257442
linux	aix
i have a db2 table that contains values in many languages including right-to-left languages. when i export this table on a linux box using cli s export command i get a good looking comma delimited text file del file but when i try it on aix it replaces all characters that are not in ascii with 0x1a

257472
enterprise	platform
it s an open source platform for building ecm enterprise content-management applications and you can write your own rich client applications if you want to

257489
any	set
and once you have a decent set of web-services these can be used for any new development which provides a way of moving away from cobol in the longer term

257512
any	set
for example they might say if a set of images contains any good photos and out of several random sets and i then want to determine which photos are good

257524
margins	padding
like eoin said you need to put a non-breaking spaces into your empty spans but you can t assign a width to an inline element only padding margins so you ll need to make it float so that you can give it a width

257531
display	width
unfortunately inline elements or elements having display inline ignore the width property

257533
versioning	upgrade
there s no upgrade path to newer versioning of windows-mobile for this device and i doubt i ll be getting any newer devices any time soon

257537
display	width
the tag will need to be set to display block as it is an inline element and will ignore width

257544
compact-framework	.net
as long as you can install the .net cf you will be able to run programs compiled under the compact-framework

257544
windows-mobile	windows-ce
supported device operating systems windows-mobile software for pocket pc 2003 windows-mobile 5.0 for pocketpc and smartphone windows-ce .net 5.0 and higher

257561
contains	set
your tests should contains a specific set of inputs with the pre-computed expected output values for those inputs

257577
joomla	drupal
i do a lot of work on sites that run joomla oscommerce drupal etc and so i have created a lot of custom components plugins and hacks etc

257578
compact-framework	.net
if it s just a .net compact-framework application you will be fine as long as the right .net cf version is installed on the device

257598
click	mouse
this is doable but it does require a fair bit of stuffing around with mouse click and focus events

257623
associations	model
the command objects have algorithms to update the state and associations among all the various things in your model

257631
bubble-sort	heapsort
other examples would include writing a bubble-sort to test a heapsort against or using a known working sort function to find median and comparing that to the results of an o n median finding algorithm implementation

257633
ruby	php
with oniguruma you can use the exact same regex as in php including the u modifier to force ruby to treat the string as utf-8

257644
default	reset
path is an environment variables and as such is by default reset by sudo

257644
contains	set
env_reset if set sudo will reset the environment to only contains

257658
configuration	installation
i ve automated my ubuntu installation - i ve got python code that runs automatically after a clean install but before the first user login - it s in a temporary etc init.d script that sets up everything from apache its configuration to my personal gnome preferences

257709
multicast	packets
this is done for scalability reasons - it wouldn t be a good idea to allow one host to originate multicast packets which are propagated to every ip-address on the internet

257712
ruby	php
i m looking for something similar to symfony for php and ruby-on-rails for ruby

257730
python	ruby
considering the criteria listed below which of python groovy or ruby would you use

257739
myeclipse	subclipse
i recently got involved in a java project at work we re using myeclipse for the ide and subclipse for source control integration

257746
python	java
if java is your host environment you should look at jython an implementation of python inside the java environment vm and libs

257753
reliability	scalability
questions about reliability and scalability come into play with both of these solutions

257754
groovy	java
it uses groovy which is dynamic language but uses the java vm

257776
groovy	java
groovy give you access to java

257776
groovy	java
groovy is embeddable although easiest in java

257776
groovy	java
i ve done some python programming but being more familiar with java groovy comes a lot easier to me

257779
spring	jsf
spring asp.net-mvc is my personal favorite for more content oriented sites but i d use jsf if it s more the traditional web application application with a web interface

257790
tapestry	wicket
there s also wicket a very decent comparison of wicket and tapestry is available here

257790
tapestry	wicket
tapestry and wicket in particular seem to be gaining ground while everyone seems to have a horror story about jsf

257795
compiler-options	dev-c++
check that in dev-c++ tools compiler-options directory c include and c++ include have the path to c dev-c++ include

257801
textbox	button
i have a textbox and a button on a web page

257801
button	popup
when the button is clicked i want a popup windows to open using thickbox that will show all items that match the value entered in the textbox

257809
value	field
i want to search a table to find all rows where one particular field is one of two value

257809
value	field
i know for certain that there will be no other value in that field which has points at the end so the two queries i m considering are

257821
constructor	object
adding tracing outputs to the constructor and destructor for this class show that every object created is destroyed even with the memory manager reporting otherwise

257827
logging	trace
a better solution would be to use the trace and assert capabilities in the system.diagnostics namespace to selectively trace the program state or to use a logging facility log4net enterpriselibrary nlog roll your own simple one to dump thread stack variables information as you go

257831
python	ruby
i m sure ruby has everything python has

257831
python	ruby
since python is 56 and ruby is a 51 python just barely edges out ruby

257849
filesystems	xfs
linux and some filesystems ext4 xfs btrfs and ocfs2

257849
solaris	sunos
os x solaris sunos and probably other unixes

257849
filesystems	xfs
most linux systems have xfs_mkfile which works exactly the same way and not just on xfs filesystems despite the name

257849
ubuntu	debian
it s included in xfsprogs for debian ubuntu or similar named packages

257849
filesystems	xfs
most linux systems also have fallocate which only works on certain filesystems such as btrfs ext4 ocfs2 and xfs but is the fastest as it allocates all the file space creates non-holey files but does not initialize any of it

257852
textbox	button
basically you update the button alt tag every time the textbox loses focus

257855
fieldset	labels
in my fieldset i have labels next side to my textbox but for some reason they are towards the top and not middle

257877
children	nodes
of course the problem here is that it returns all text nodes that are children of all p-tags

257890
enterprise	legacy
while i cant point toward any existing system directly there are massive amounts of legacy enterprise systems written pre-oo cobol

257944
profiling	trace
use sql-server profiling on the tools menu in ssms to create a trace that logs these events

257944
profiling	trace
you now have a sql script that creates a trace that has much less overhead than running through the profiling gui

257944
profiling	trace
you can load the trace into profiling or use cleartrace very handy or load it into a table like so

257952
vsts	tfs
vsts 2008 test edition home btw there s a link to a trial vpc w tfs vsts suite on the right-hand side

257957
textbox	button
just handle the onclick of your button to run a function that calls tb_show passing the value of the textbox

tokenize	parsing
i ve written tokenize and parsing for a couple of little indentation-centric domain-specific languages in the past couple of years and what you have there looks pretty reasonable to me for whatever that s worth

258167
tokenize	parsing
still i think you d agree that allowing and preserving all manner of crazy-looking whitespace in the tokenize layouter and letting the parsing decide what s a literal and what s code is a bit of an unusual requirement

258177
output	mode
so one trick you could try using to print but not to actually validate your file would be to use ghostscript s postscript output mode there is a wrapper called ps2ps for it which mainly adds

258338
stderr	stdout
there is an example on msdn here stderr and here stdout

258338
stderr	stdout
if you need to read from both stderr and stdout and use waitforexit then things get more interesting - usually involving either a few threads or async methods

258338
stderr	stdout
one other final option is to use pipe redirection in the command - - this pipe stdout into out.txt and pipe stderr into stdout so this also goes into out.txt

note that what is happening is not related to any kind of implicit string-conversion etc but because the exception-handling class implements __getitem__ and uses it to return the values in the args tuples ex.args

258930
tuples	any
instead strings were thrown with usually a tuples argument for any details that should be passed to the handling block

258957

textbox	button
masterpage with textbox and button

259099
textbox	button
data is entered into the textbox and button is clicked

259109
json	xml
when it comes to php the one reason i choose xml over json is because even in php 5 there is no officially supported api for traversal

259120
selected	button
note to clarify you click on the ... button and you get a dialog that allows you to selected a folder from the device location of output on device and enter an additional subfolder subdirectory

259130
double	int
i cast an unsigned int to float then to double and back to float

259144

textbox	button
i would like to write a wrapper page that will render and auto fill the username and login form textbox with a constant and force the onclick event for login button

259181
json	xml
i would go with json myself simply because xml is very bloaty and excessively difficult to parse

259185

on linq to sql s datacontext i am able to call submitchanges to submit all changes

259230
raw-sockets	packets
in the worst case scenario you could go one level lower raw-sockets where you have better control over the packets sent but then you d have to deal with all the nitty-gritty of tcp

259249
scriptaculous	jquery
i ve also developed ajax applications using javascript frameworks such as jquery prototype and scriptaculous

259280
required	checked
have you checked that you have integrated windows-authentication switched on for the required web site

259409
sql-server	oracle
there may be other customers of the same application in the future with a requirement to use a specific db platform such as oracle or sql-server due to in-house dba expertise

postgresql	mysql
if you aren t sure if you want to use mysql or postgresql i suggest trying them both out

259460
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is more compliant but if you re comfortable with mysql and you re using an orm you should probably use that

259461
getter	setter
it would use an inner class to hold its properties and i would require all data-access to pass in and out of getter and setter

259461
getter	setter
these would in turn call the getter and setter on the inner class

259464
shutdown	exit
if you want the ability to reboot or shutdown entirely you could test the exit status

259477
callback	methods
the event occurs such that the methods that is used in the callback automatically happens on the primary thread

259517
attributes	properties
you can use such attributes for a id properties

259517
sql-server	oracle
seeing native generator option with sql-server nh will assume that it s an identity field autoincrement and for oracle it will assume that this property uses sequence with the same name you can change sequence name if you want

259517
postgresql	mysql
i cannot propose any db not knowing your specific needs but if you want to use a free software which excludes oracle and you re not already experienced with mysql you should try postgresql which is more powerful than mysql

click	mouse
as far as i can tell there is nothing getting done in the gui thread besides basic non-cpu intensive mouse click handling

259568
perl	ruby
take your strings that you are using on the server c# side and process your javascript files using something like perl python ruby replacing the ids of the strings with the strings themselves

259678
entity-framework	ado.net
how do i extend ado.net entity-framework objects with partial classes

259688

it looks like you are redirecting stdout to your log file but not stderr - would suggest adding 2 1 to the end of the command-line to ensure you re not missing any error information from the log

259689
temporary	copy
con debugger will link to the temporary copy not the official version

259693
temporary	copy

those other directories are what svn uses to keep track of revision they re not actually in the repository

259723
any	set
you may want to check to see that any fields in your database tables which are set by the db server when inserting a new record have that reflected in the linq to sql diagram

259723
value	field
if you selected a field on the linq to sql diagram and view its properties you will see a field called auto generated value which if set to true will ensure all new records take on the default-value specified in the database

259880
windows-vista	windows
looking in my windows directory in the microsoft.net framework directory which is where the frameworks all live on my windows-vista pc i have the following directories

259901
any	set
objective-c is simply a set of extensions to c and a supporting library and api in libobjc so you have access to everything that any other c program would have

259930

259982
sql-server	mysql
been running mysql 5 and sql-server simultaneously on my dev laptop for over a year both as nonstop services

259985
constructor	object
it probably wouldn t be too hard to use reflection.emit to make a class which will generate an implementation of any given interface taking a dynamic object in the constructor and just proxying each call through to it

259987
nested	order
as jacob_c pointed out i should be using element.nodes to replace it properly and as panos pointed out i should reverse the list in order to handle nested replacements accurately

259989
order	add
from the perspective of the sessions that are reading the data sessions that are doing inserts aren t really adding any overhead updates might add a bit of overhead as the reader would have to look at data in the undo tablespace in order to reconstruct a read-consistent view of the data

260000
checkbox	textbox
the details form has a collection of databound controls to display the data mostly textbox and checkbox

260000

dictionary	map
i m trying to figure out if there s a reasonably efficient way to perform a lookup in a dictionary or a hash or a map or whatever your favorite language calls it where the keys are regular expressions and strings are looked up against the set of keys

260056
dictionary	hashmap
i can think of a naive way to implement this in which i iterate over all of the keys in the dictionary and try to match the passed in string against them but then i lose the o 1 lookup time of a hashmap and instead have o n where n is the number of keys in my dictionary

260058
html-email	mhtml
microsoft has mhtml -- basically a file encoded exactly as a mime html-email message

260058
firefox	safari
firefox and safari with a cumbersome extension

260058
zipfile	archive
mozilla has mozilla archive format -- basically a zipfile with the markup and images with metadata saved as rdf

260058
firefox	opera
firefox opera and safari support it without gaffes

260062
dialog	pop-up
i d like to create a pop-up dialog box in silverlight in which i can manipulate controls enter data and return a value

260077
tree	trie
if the class of regular expressions you ll be using is more restrictive you might be able to use a data structure such as a trie or suffix tree

260094
value	field
also i ve noticed that calling .getsubmittedvalue on a form field sometimes results in a null pointers exception-handling because that value has not been instantiated in the component object in which case-when i call .getvalue in that circumstance i get the correct value for example

260096
managed-code	unmanaged
i have an unmanaged c++ library wrapped with managed-code that worked fine in vs2003 with .net 1.1 framework

260118
windows-server	windows
there is a microsoft kb article 224829 description of windows 2000 and windows-server 2003 tcp features that describes just how to do that

260123
data-uri	data-url
with data-url s i don t know how difficult the implementation would be

260129
video-streaming	streaming
i would like to set up some wmv video-streaming using windows 2003 s streaming media server and silverlight

260142
worksheet	excel
a sample i m working on calls cocreateinstance for class microsoft_office excel worksheet

260142
worksheet	excel
other excel classes excel.application are registered on the system but not the one for worksheet .....is it possible to register this class

260142
worksheet	excel
this may work for other ms office objects but when it s excel the class is for the worksheet

260148
libxml2	lxml
if you have libxml2 and libxslt install then also install lxml

260148
libxml2	libxslt
it provides a nice easy-to-use binding for libxml2 and libxslt and it also implements the elementtree

260148
libxml2	lxml
libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well

260149
pattern-recognition	detection
any language can be used for image-processing pattern-recognition and object detection which is what you re trying to do here

260150
perl	php
i am trying to use an xml-rpc server on my drupal php backend to make it easier for my perl backend to talk to it

260154
python	java
jython s pyobject provides a method to cast a python object to java

260159
base-class	inherited
entitybase would be a base-class that each entity object would inherited something like

260161
contains	any
if the spam you are receiving is link-heavy you could assume any comment that contains 2 links is a spam comment and not post it to the blog unless the blog author approves them

260168
binary	hex
you can add attachments as binary but you ll have to manually do that with a hex editor or create a tool and support for it by clients might not be as good

260193
versioning	migrate
i have install ruby-on-rails on each server when i need to update the database schema i copy the migration files to the server and run rake db migrate which updates the database to the latest versioning or rollbacks it to a desired versioning

260197
dialog	pop-up
using pop-up to create a dialog class

260200
microstrategy	obiee
the top contenders are obiee oracle bi enterprise edition formerly siebel analytics and microstrategy

260233
entity-framework	ado.net
how do i extend ado.net entity-framework objects with partial classes

260236
hash	md5
i know that php has md5 sha1 and the hash functions but i want to create a hash using the mysql password function

260236
perl	php
so far the only way i can think of is to just query the server but i want a function preferably in php or perl that will do the same thing without querying mysql at all

260266
order	add
you need to add a constraint in order to use methods

260272
python	java
you could use java python ruby etc with a cross platform ui framework air etc etc

260275
python	c++
qt either on c++ or python is fully portable between mac win linux

260277
binary-search-tree	tree
the most frequently used implementation of a binary-search-tree is a red-black tree

260277
data-structures	skip-lists
this is what makes skip-lists special other lock based data-structures tend to croak under pressure

260280
perl	php
you can use md5 for example wich is present in almost every programming language php and perl included

260295
subtract	add
currently you add subtract 5 whenever the event fires and that s not really predictable

260297
contains	any
if the url contains any tables those will be formatted appropriately

260308
version-control	git
it supports other distributed version-control systems notably git it s easy to configure and it works as much like the default vc mode as reasonable

260311
.net	wcf
making this abstraction allows you to wrap it by other projects like a wcf web service for example and expose it openly to not only .net systems -- but potentially other systems

260323
doxygen	epydoc
because epydoc performs both object introspection and source parsing it can gather more informations respect to static code analysers such as doxygen it can inspect a fair amount of dynamically generated classes and functions but can also use comments or unassigned strings as a documentation source for variables and class public attributes

260335
geocoding	geocode
geocode all the addresses with google s geocoding service

260335
proximity	distance
is it better to have a proximity table that lists the distance between every business and a few reference locations

260351
value	field
these operations - copying assignment creating locations field locals parameters arrays - are the only operations that are guaranteed to be available on all possible value of the type parameter

260351
haskell	c++
in the future generics in delphi for win32 will likely be extended along similar lines to c++ 0x concepts or haskell type classes such that type parameters may be constrained to have certain methods functions and operators available

260364
floating	margins
i d advise floating the #leftcontent element to the left and then setting the margins of the #centercontent element to compensate

260390
required	checked
it is always good practice to checked to see that indexes are used when you expect them to be and that the query doesn t required extra work to be done

260393
derived-class	base-class
if the base-class isn t going to use the methods then just define it as a virtual methods in your derived-class

260394
pipe	tail
rather than opening the file directly open a pipe from the command tail -10 filename

260396
derived-class	pure-virtual
if you can t provide a correct implementation then my advice would be to make a pure-virtual function and leave it up to the derived-class to provide an implementation

260404
internet-explorer	firefox
for problem #2 you need to url encode the file name for both internet-explorer and firefox

260404
internet-explorer	firefox
this applies to firefox 3 and internet-explorer 7

260405
emacs	vim
for keyboard centric apps like vim and emacs the fact that i can use them comfortably unaltered should be fairly impressive

260413
any	set
we re not exactly linux networking whizzes we re a .net shop normally but we ve so far held our own attempting to set proper ulimits inspecting kernel messages and tcpdumps for any irregularities

260415
silverlight	wpf
i see this of growing importance with the advent of wpf and silverlight

260416
silverlight	wpf
as another answer below has mentioned since this question and my answer were written the wpf toolkit has incorporated some free themes in particular the themes from the silverlight toolkit

260420
pure-virtual	base-class
i put all of that in the base-class which has a couple of pure-virtual as well

260420
virtual-functions	base-class
i implement two empty virtual-functions in the base-class init and cleanup

260423
eclipse-tptp	visualvm
for runtime metrics use any profiling such as visualvm netbeans profiling or the eclipse-tptp tools

260430
distance	polygons
though if you want to calculate within a certain distance from a zip you need to think about if you are going to use the zip centroid or a polygons representation of the zip code

260453
innodb	myisam
you have to specify that the tables are innodb because myisam engine doesn t support foreign key

260461
contains	any
if your search feature allows the user to search based on other properties of the user it is clear that there is no single shard or subset of shards that can satisfy a query because any shard could contains users that match the query

260485
direct3d	directx
since managed directx is not being supported any longer by microsoft this is a good way to use managed code with direct3d

260487
double	int
you can process these however you need depending on whether you re intending it for double or int or whatever

260504
integer	digits
the exact operation performed depends on the operator but all bitwise operations evaluate each binary digits bit of the 32-bit integer individually to compute a new value.

260521
value	field
i let my users enter a sql query into a memo control and then i want to let them go through the field that will return and do such things as format the output sum column value and so forth

260523
selection	cell
i am developing an iphone application in my table view i wanted custom color for cell selection style i read the uitableviewcell class reference but there are only three constants defined for selection style blue gray none

260543
contains	elements
it doesn t seem like a big jump for someone that understands one dimensional arrayss to be able to grasp the concept that instead of an int or a string that each arrays elements contains another arrays instead

260547
digits	base
if you are looking at c type non-ragged arrays comparing it to numbers the base 10 part and there digits might help

260582
boolean	int
int real or boolean is converted

260582
put	get
i would read that as varnull cannot be converted to a tdatetime to put into the field and hence you get the exception-handling that you re experiencing

260591
contains	any
if you don t have a lot regexes that will match almost anything like or d+ and instead you have regexes that contains mostly words and phrases or any fixed patterns longer than 4 characters in as in your examples

260614
javascript-engine	spidermonkey
for complex usage and if you re using c++ you could also consider using the firefox javascript-engine spidermonkey to execute the javascript on a page

260653
value	field
so if there are any value supplied via viewstate or any other mechanism that is what the field will be reset to not blank

260663
ruby-on-rails	django
i started web programming with raw php gradually moving on to its various frameworks then to django and ruby-on-rails

260665
web-services	soap-client
how do you handle a timeoutexception that is generated when calling web-services using the soap-client

260673
ruby-on-rails	django
from what i understand it provides the same sort of functionality that you would get django and ruby-on-rails

260678
return-value	arguments
type-safe means that programmatically the type of data for a variables return-value or arguments must fit within a certain criteria

260684
factors	primes
1 given n find the list l of n s primes factors

260684
duplicates	contains
restating #2 given collection c contains k items such that item a has a duplicates and item b has b duplicates etc

260697
uilabel	uiview
override didselectrowatindexpath and draw a uiview of a color of your choosing and insert it behind the uilabel inside the cell

260698
windows-vista	windows
as a resource for designing user interfaces in windows i d say that the windows-vista user experience guidelines offers great tips and examples on designing user interfaces

260699
selected	button
i have a listview inside of an update panel and wanted to change the selected query from the code behind fired by a button click event and then reload the listview inside of the update panel

260710
abstract-class	subclassing
except that abstract-class can t be directly instantiated only extended so the use is therefore always from a subclassing s constructor

260722
hash	md5
this will hash mystring and store the md5 sum in md5str

260731
launchd	daemons
this will launchd the gconf daemons

260731
launchd	daemons
if the dbus environment variables are not set the daemons will not launchd

260732
groovy	java
groovy is very similar to java but with a lot of nice dynamic language additions simplifications

260733
keydown	keyup
the keydown event happens as soon as the user presses a key the keyup event happens when they release the key after pressing it

260733
keydown	keyup
note i know nothing about .net i ve just used keyup and keydown events in other libraries.

260734
macros	vba
i have a macros in excel which calls a few other functions in vba

260741
keydown	keyup
keyup is usually a good time to respond to any action that is going to have an effect on a document but keydown would be better if it s a game where the user wants immediate effect

260742
difference	zero
the problem is i ve set both of those to false and or zero and it doesn t seem to make any difference

260744
abstract-class	base-class
an abstract-class can only be used as a base-class which is extended by some other class right

260744
constructor	private
the constructor s of an abstract class can have the usual access modifiers public protected and private for internal use

260744
protected	public
which of protected and public is the correct access-modifiers to use since the abstract type seems to indicate that technically a public constructor will act very much protected

260746
rollback	commit
another thing to consider is that the service could be something like an ejb which may have the role of transaction management so that multiple calls to the dao hibernate can be wrappered in a single transaction that will automatically commit or rollback on success exception-handling

260755
abstract-class	subclassing
abstract-class the constructor used in subclassing must explicitly call

260766
keydown	keyup
if you handle something on keydown that changes the windows or changes user-interface component focus then the new user-interface element may sometimes get the keyup event

260767
integer	short
for example a program may have a variables yearofbirth which is the year a person was born and it is tempting to type-cast it as a short integer

260767
integer	short
however it is not a short integer

260767
perl	lua
languages that use dynamic typing or duck-typing or manifest typing such as perl python ruby sqlite and lua don t have the notion of typed variables

260768
ruby-on-rails	django
the call looks exactly the same from the controller the difference is that with java hibernate i had to write it myself and with django ruby-on-rails symfony cake it was already there for me

260774
contains	elements
in fact this is one of the few differentiators between what you can do with attributes and elements the other main one being that elements can contains other tags while attributes cannot

260779
protected	public
since the abstract type seems to indicate that technically a public constructor will act very much protected

260779
protected	public
actually the abstract-class s constructor can only be called from the implementation s constructor so there is no difference between it being public or protected

260792
background-color	width
the 100 width on the body element is in relation to the view port which is why you re background-color is cutting when you scroll

260792
contains	set
either set a width to your body at 1520px to encompase the contains div or add another div and do the following

260826
protected	public
since the abstract type seems to indicate that technically a public constructor will act very much protected

260826
protected	public
for abstract-class this constructor scope public or protected is not of much difference since the initializer is not allowed even if public

260826
protected	public
since it is meant to be invoked by the subclass it can invoke either public or protected constructor seamlessly

260827
powermockito	easymock
powermockito is an extension to easymock that allows mocking of static-methods

260830
lotus	ibm
this ibm redbook discusses ibm lotusâ dominoâ access for microsoftâ outlook the software solution that allows outlook client users to easily access mail and calendar data that is stored on lotus domino servers

260830
lotus	ibm
if you want to improve the reliability and scalability of your messaging infrastructure and to add collaboration upgrading from microsoft exchange to ibm lotus domino access for microsoft outlook damo provides the solution

260830
directory	folder
familiar microsoft outlook features are supported including rich text folder and directory catalog

260838
lotus	ibm
you should definitely consider ibm lotus domino

260847
build-process	msbuild
i have written a few msbuild custom tasks that work well and are use in our cruisecontrol.net build-process

260851
python	java
i am trying to convince my colleagues to stop using it and learn c c++ python fortran java ruby

260878
png	gif
you may fall foul of file formats ie reportedly only supports it s .ico format whilst most everyone else supports png and gif images and possibly caching issues both on the browser and through proxies

260886
hash	tie
there is a perl module that does just this tie hash regex

260891
opensso	cas
i would look at a system such as cas or opensso either of which will redirect users to the login page without any need to enter a url

260915
malloc	free
firstname is a pointers to an arrays of char which is not being allocated by the malloc only the pointers is being allocated and after you call free it doesn t erase the memory it just marks it as available on the heap to be overwrite later

260950
realloc	malloc
if you want to grow the arrays dynamically you should use malloc to dynamically allocate some fixed amount of memory and then use realloc whenever you run out

260951
constructor	private
another option is to make the constructor private

260972
strcpy	memcpy
standard c provides strcpy strcat strcat strncpy memmove memcpy etc

260972
strncpy	strcpy
it makes sense to use strncpy over strcpy for safety if you don t know the source string will fit inside the destination buffering

260976
affinity	cpu
the only exception-handling is when you set a thread affinity mask to a single cpu - then you can be certain that if the thread executes at all it runs on that single cpu

260981
realloc	malloc
if you re using c things are a lot harder yes malloc realloc and free are the tools to help you

260982
driver	kernel
kernel driver stuff - cause those blue screens are a pain

260983
static-typing	type-safety
many answers here conflate type-safety with static-typing and dynamic-typing

261013
binaries	install
i have a whole host of binaries and libraries that i ve install locally under my home-directory

261013
binaries	install
i can run binaries install in local bin just fine by adding that dir to my path variables but what about linking to libraries in local lib and local lib64

261021
pointers	stack
if i replace the calll to iolog with the corresponding number of nops inside the device driver kext the kernel crashes with what looks like a smashed stack backtrace terminated-invalid frame pointers 0

261037
attributes	properties
then you can do stuff like this to put the values from existing properties into your properties the condition attributes acts as a filtering

261037
attributes	properties
or you can do it manually the include attributes uses the existing properties outputpath but it indicates a path that inclues all files

261045
arguments	undefined
is undefined for the arguments type s number string

261053
linux	unix
i can run itunes most modern browsers and don t need to allocate 50 of my time maintaining it on a laptop like linux with a unix foundation

261055
shell	bash
leveraging the shell bash

261063
richfaces	gwt
the only caveat for now is that it somewhat limits your choice of view framework it works only with richfaces gwt and something else that i cant remember now

261067
.net	wcf
for instance i don t believe many people have the time to achieve a reasonable to good understanding of all of even the main .net peripheral apis by which i mean the ones outside the core asp.net winforms wpf wcf wf asp.net mvc linq to sql entity framework etc

261079
double	int
you can think in bytes int double and other higher level data types

261082
attributes	properties
did you set the enableclientscript attributes properties to true

261095
debugging	exit
on debugging i found out that due to a bug my c++ code was throwing first-chance exceptions for access violations objects referenced via a dangling pointer on exit

261107
any	set
server backend can be programmed in any technology you want just set common data format at server and browser side json format may be suitable

261115
tcp-ip	ppp
your modem may also have a built in tcp-ip stack in which case you also have at commands to initiate the ppp session and then tcp connections with internet servers

261138
mbunit	nunit
on the other hand i seem to remember that asp.net-mvc has unit-testing options for ms test nunit and mbunit

261163
fflush	stdio
fflush only fflush the buffering added by the stdio fopen layer as managed by the object

261173
configuration	environment
or am i missing an environment configuration step

261189
png	gif
for image to be able to construct itself from a stream the data must be in one of the supported standard image formats gif png jpeg etc

261216
value	field
note this php code doesn t require any knowledge of the field in the form that submits to it it just loops through all of the field including multiple-choice field like checkbox and spits out their value

261219
python	java
i also understand that this isn t java c++ ruby python it s a different language

261225
installation	environment
look at sqlite it has bindings for many programming languages and environment available and is like the berkeley db a database on disk without the need for a database engine installation

261227
bitwise-and	complement
to unset my state i use the bitwise-and operators with the complement operators

261228
identity-column	sql-server
if you re allowed to modify the table you could add an identity-column sql-server naming - your database may differ to autogenerate unique ids - existing code should be unaffected

261254
revision	svn
so maintaining the revision in the svn external prop will need constant updating

261268
value	field
this php code doesn t require any knowledge of the field in the form that submits to it it just loops through all of the field including multiple-choice field like checkbox and spits out their value

261277
boost	stl
i recommend nicola bonelli s answer to be accepted. that s part of the stl and doesn t require using boost if your code doesn t use boost thanks to the commenters for pointing this out

261280
perl	c++
i m also working on article about using emacs as development environment for many languages - c c++ java perl lisp scheme erlang etc.

261290
mstest	nunit
does mstest have standalone gui similar to nunit that lets me use it and run test without visual-studio

261364
revision	svn
what may help is to restrict the write commit access to the tags folder and than use tags in the svn externals instead of revision numbers

261366
base-class	inherited
i have a base-class called party and classes called individual and organisation which inherited from it

261367
revision	svn
using svn externals is fine with revision but it sounds as if you need to use a build server such as hudson which builds automatically when things are checked in

261378
installation	upgrade
i have a tool which automatically creates installshield installers installscript not msi and my main problem at the moment is that when upgrading an installation i need a way to prevent features from being upgrade

261378
installation	upgrade
during the installation i want to check the version of a exe-file installed on the target system and depending on this i want to be able to exclude a specific feature from the set of files being upgrade

261381
double-quotes	single-quotes
in mysql by default double-quotes are also used for string literals although this is incompatible with standard sql and you should stick to single-quotes in your code

261381
any	set
if you need to - and you don t for any of yours - then quote them with a backquote or set it to strict ansi compatible mode ansi_quotes and use double quotes

261408
ubuntu	debian
what ubuntu debian packages do i need to install

261410
getter	setter
getter and setter are a bodge to get around this

261410
getter	setter
this isn t just a best practice thing either serialization in c# will rely on properties not getter setter so not using properties could lead to all sorts of problems in the future if you need to serialization your classes

261418
winmerge	utility
another great utility is winmerge

261434
getter	setter
i made a custom valueobject class with properties getter setter and i need this class for data binding of elements on form

261435
attributes	properties
prior to that it used a slightly different naming scheme for getters and setters which naturally can still be used with properties or for plain old attributes

261435
getter	setter
the typical getter has the same name as the attributes the setter is the attributes prefixed by set as per java s convention

261436
swing	awt
where have you been writing a run method what kind of application are you writing swing awt console etc and what s your development environment

261457
postback	ajax
you have to handle this client side in javascript then either postback the page or call an ajax method to do something

261464
function-calls	main
there are three main reasons for that to occur recursion the function-calls itself multithreading and interrupt

261471
value	field
sometimes it makes a lot of sense to name a field key order or value .

261490
perl	ruby
my current thoughts are to have a separate setuid script perl ruby

261498
hosts-file	hosts
obviously each machine has a different name but this setup also allows you to test individual servers by spoofing the hosts - for example by editing your hostss-file to point your farm name to test server ip

261507
ruby	php
ss would do most if not all of what you requested unfortunately it is based on php and not ruby so i m not sure how much help that is

261515
contains	set
i have a large set of files some of which contains special characters in the filename ã ã and others

261522
emacs	vim
what is the command to match brackets in emacs the equivalent of the command in vim

261538
authentication	login
login via an html form instead of using http authentication

261553
substitution	replace
use nt s set s string substitution to replace or remove characters anywhere in a string

261558
value	field
if you re creating your own form field from scripting onload then the browser has no way of knowing that the new input control is â the sameâ as the old instance so it can t fill it in with the previously-submitted value

261564
worksheet	excel
the alternative is to open the worksheet using excel automation but that is not recommended in a web project

261576
worksheet	excel
2 roll your own excel document - probably easiest if your users version of excel supports xml worksheet open the excel sheet server side then using something like xpath queries find the relevant cell in the worksheet and insert your data

261586
radiobuttonlist	datalist
how to get the values of the radiobuttonlist which will be selected in nested datalist to use it in multi insert later

261596
hide	show
edit you can also use toggle instead of .show to show hide

261598
constructor	object
however the const reference way has some drawbacks as well it prevents several optimizations that the compiler may make because of aliasing issues also for object with trivial constructor the extra level of indirection a reference is implemented as a pointer may outweigh the benefits of avoiding the copy

261603
xstream	jibx
i am trying to weigh up whether to use an automatic binding program like the one supplied in jaxb or jibx or whether to manually write my own classes and use something like xstream for marshalling unmarshalling

261614
button	popup
then when i click the launch server monitor button it should just popup a new windows

261621
execution	jobs
given that this is a scheduling of jobs i suspect that at some point you are going to sort them into a proposed order of execution

261639
constructor	object
instances created with the new operator are just object which have been created by a particular constructor function and have a particular prototype chain

261639
constructor	object
this is why a.shared won t be able to access constructora.shared - property access involves looking at the object in question for the named property and failing that walking its prototype chain looking for the property but the constructor function which created the object isn t part of the prototype chain

261648
external	embed
so the final question is whould you rather embed documentation in code or write external documentation files for example html for different languages and parsing them on runtime

261674
csv	xml
so a property file may be an xml or a csv with id-message pairs

261686
execution	jobs
if you need a test only mode just add a dry-run flag which disables the execution of the actual jobs

261691
defined	declare
you cannot declare implicit-conversion on enum types because they can t defined methods

261712
curly-braces	parentheses
these commands will work for parentheses square brackets curly-braces angle brackets etc. and can be customized to recognize other delimiters

261715
value	field
if you re working with a limited set of possible value it s worth specifying the field as an enum - mysql will then store it internally as an integer and make this sort of lookup much faster and save disk spaces

decompression	on-the-fly
by a day number and is decompression and filtering on-the-fly by the application

261745

261800
order	join
an update - we ve had the most success with more intelligent order of data at import time aggressive indexing more than doubling the size of the db file in the process tuning settings in windows to get xp to behave more like a server than a desktop changing the order of join you can t solely rely on the optimizer and by measuring your progress by creating a performance test suite just a harness for running queries and taking measurements

261802
sql-server	oracle
oracle and ms sql-server and others i m sure support grouping the data in a table physically by some value in this case date time stamp

the most obvious solution to changing system-settings would be to have a daemon running as root which accepts a few very limited and strictly sanitised inputs such as a new hostname or the new ip-address for the server

261938
actionscript	mxml
if everything that can be accomplished in mxml can also be accomplished in actionscript and many things are easier to accomplish in actionscript loops conditionals etc why take the time to learn mxml

i ve read about the arguments between tcp udp so i don t want to start a war like that here

261958
any	set
i was planning on having a lab whereby you could set up the robots and test them in realtime on the client this has nothing to do with the actual game world and thus shouldn t require any networking - although i don t fancy writing a vm in both languages

then retrieve the system.data.linq.mapping.column attributes of the properties

262077
attributes	properties
then parsing the dbtype properties of this attributes eg nvarchar 255 not null to get the column length

262080
bazaar	git
5 - git bazaar hg - bazaar and hg have their tortoises so good for windows even though i m not sure about maturity git would be linux only for the time being even though it is very good and much better and easier to use than a couple of years ago

262269
decimal-point	zero
remove zero at end - todo only do if decimal-point in string

262303
triggers	insert
insert can triggers a sort of the items or not according to the programmer s choice

.when	ready
in terms of data again leave the old database alone rewrite your database and write a migration scripting that can programmatically copy all the data across .when the time is ready

262322
linked-list	nodes
this approach requires a lock per linked-list nodes however it s not a must

262323
linked-list	arrays

entity-framework	ado.net
as explained in the answers to another question i cannot extend ado.net entity-framework objects with partial classes and use my custom methods in linq queries

262339
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework partial class

262346
integer	numeric
i am storing a dash and an x so that explains the char and anyway you won t be doing integer arithmetic on the phone numbers i guess so it makes little sense to try to use a numeric type

262347
vb.net	vba
when vba is not an option is it allowed to use vb.net or c#

262358
.when	ready
.when i m ready to push to production though i publishing to another directory on my workstation and use beyond compare to push the compiled site to production

262426
virtual-machine	vmware
but the strange thing and we stumbled upon this on pure luck is that if a vmware virtual-machine is running the code running in the host os will take the expected less than a second

262427
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested in firefox 3.0.1 and google-chrome 0.3 and just as a disclaimer i know this is not cross-browser functionality no ie

262436
meta-inf	jar
i believe if you add to the jar a meta-inf manifest.mf file containing a classpath attribute with a value specifying the relative paths to the jars you need i m not sure whether they are space or comma separated that might work

262439
malloc	free
hey i am trying to create wrapper functions for free and malloc in c to help notify me of memory-leaks

262439
malloc	free
does anyone know how to declare these functions so when i call malloc and free it will call my custom functions and not the standards lib functions

262440
order	join
if i have a large table variables - already order in a favorable way for merge join i can specify a merge join be used by applying a query hint

262441
value	field
but since we have varchar field today the only value of varchar 16 over varchar 255 is that the db will enforce the 16 char limit on the varchar 16

262441
value	field
if the db model is supposed to be actually representative of the physical data model then having field lengths can be of value

262442

262476
grouping	sorting
when your query implicitly generates a temporary table for instance while sorting or grouping by this can use a lot of memory

262479
malloc	free
if you define your own functions for malloc and free and explicitly link that with your applications your functions should be used in preference to those in the library

262479
malloc	free
in other words you d have to implement the internals of malloc and free yourself

262481
malloc	free
not only it lets you specify custom malloc and free but will also identify the caller by the return address on the stack

262481
malloc	free
define malloc and free as wrappers to the original allocation routines in your executable which will override the version from libc

262486
versioning	upgrade
i don t know if there are readily available versionings of stl that do this already but it s worth sticking to the library functions so that when you upgrade to a versioning that does this optimization is there for you without you needing to make any changes

262537
macros	vba
i recently inherited a vba macros that needs to have validation logic added to it

262547

how are you export the report to ms-word

262614
webserver	upload
many many times there are environment specific paths and variables such as db names image upload directories webserver paths etc

262623
firefox	safari
if you only need it to work in a couple browsers you could use -webkit-border-radius and -moz-border-radius which would let it work in safari and firefox respectively

262629
decrement	increment
you can also overload the increment decrement operators for your enumerated type

262633
restrictions	userid
macos 10.5 tightens restrictions on input managers it won t run them in a process owned by root or wheel nor in a process which has modified its userid

262633

most significantly 10.5 won t load an input manager into a 64bit process and has indicated that even 32-bit use is unsupported and will be removed in a future release

262637
attributes	properties
at that point a tooltip attributes appears in the label s properties in the designer and is accessible in the code

262667
memory-access	lock-free
since memory-access is atomicity even this can usually be lock-free

262674
postgresql	mysql
for off-the-shelf software say mysql postgresql instead of sql server oracle you still have to do many considerations

262684
common-lisp	lisp
in common-lisp and emacs lisp association lists are linked lists so they have linear search time

262691
any	set
this will bind to any defaults i give the classes just fine but if i try to dynamically set the objects in code as i show below i don t see any change

262702
jquery	dojo
i use tbs with the xajax libraries and it works a treat but you could mix whatever your preferred libraries are with it - i ve had it running with dojo for instance quite nicely and i m looking at jquery next up

262706
shell	bash
it s probably best to stick with bash simply because it s the most widely used as a shell and any tutorials or help you may receive from someone will most likely use bash

262706
bash	zsh
however i have started using zsh for all of my scripts and i have found it to be far superior to bash in terms of scripting

262723
xsd	xml
if you have a java object and an xml schema xsd what is the best way to take that object and convert it into an xml file in line with the schema

262723
contains	elements
is there a way of creating a mapping that will say if the object contains an int totalcountvalue create an elements called counttotal and put it into the xml

262729
sql-server	oracle
fortunately it s possible to mimic oracle sequences using sql-server

262755
command-line	cmd
see here for the cmd-line usage of status cmd

262768
command-line	cmd
vss command-line cmd

262798
innodb	myisam
does anyone know how much memory myisam and innodb use

262798
innodb	myisam
i know innodb is heavier than myisam but just how much more

262824
triggers	insert
if this resonates with you then i would suggest having your triggers simply insert a row into a special table and then have a job that executes as often as you need for your purpose every minute

262826
scheme	lisp
i d like to generate these in scheme or a lisp of your choice

262827
synchronous	.when
.when you want it to run synchronous

262846
rtos	qnx
my suggestion is to review the message passing primitive that qnx rtos www.qnx.com supports before making any decisions

262861
perl	php
i prefer to use select when the language or db driver returns a dict python perl etc. or associative array php of the results

262878
tapestry	jsf
if you re writing a web app use the contextloaderlistener in web.xml so that it creates the applicationcontext and you can later get it from the servletcontext regardless of whether you re using jsp jsf jstl struts tapestry etc

262881
perl	php
you could be a good perl player and use perl to generate your html templatey crap that gets loaded in php i m still new to perl but php reeks and i ve used it for far too long surely there has to be a way to write a site in perl that runs on php

262886
racket	scheme
use racket formerly plt scheme

262886
racket	scheme
the racket ide is an excellent starting point for all things scheme including sicp

262897
selected	button
user selected an image from their machine hits an upload button or better yet the following fires on the onchange event of the file input and is able to see a preview of the image they are about to upload

262899
linux	unix
i want to be able to zip files from my non-gui c c++ application on several versions of windows linux unix and macos

262919
persistence	hibernate
well hibernate handles the persistence part jsp handles your gui struts controls the flow between pages actions etc and spring can manage all your beans which contains the main business logic instead of using ejb

262924
export	csv
there seems to be no simple way to export a table to a tab-delimted or csv outfile including its column headers

262931
credentials	security
often it s security credentials being used or it can also be something like enabling allow service to interact with desktop as the app in this case mspaint might need that

262931
ghostscript	libtiff
the other is to look into something a little more sophisticate then mspaint with libraries such as libtiff or even things like like ghostscript to handle the formats that may not be supported natively inside .net such as pdf

262934
for-loop	arrays
i know that in javascript creating a for-loop like this is costly as it computes the arrays length each time

262935
cobertura	emma
code coverage tools cobertura clover emma etc can identify holes in your branches but not in the quality of your test datasets

262935
static-code-analysis	pmd
static-code-analysis such as findbugs pmd cpd can identify problem areas in your code before they become an issue and go a long way towards promoting better development practices

262935
logout	login
as functional tests are created they are matched up against one or more requirements login as fred update account details for password logout again

262956
arrays	loops
mostly it depends on whether the compiler is clever enough to be able to tell whether the length of the list or arrays might change whilst you re in the loops

263003
derived-class	base-class
use dynamic_cast to downcasting a base-class to a derived-class polymorphism types only

263007
contains	any
php can create arrayss with references to other places in that arrays and can contains objects with likewise recursive referencing and any purely recursive algorithm could be considered in such a case a dangerously naive one in that it will overflow stack depth recursing and never terminate

263011
http-post	post
an http-post which is different from an http get is a separate logical call to the webserver but it still defines a uri that should process the post

263013
jprogressbar	progress
the thing is i m gonna have a gui for it and i will be using a jprogressbar widget which i would like to show the current progress of the download

263020
combinations	permutation
then for each combinations pick the lowest value and generate all permutation of the remaining items

263020
duplicates	sorted
it assumes that the input list is already sorted and that it contains no duplicates

263035
malloc	free
if you are only talk about memory that you have under control that you malloc and free on your own you can take a look on rmdebug

263037
contains	any
any http response is supposed to contains a content-length header so you could query the urlconnection object for this value

263056
any	set
i had tried with the set character set utf8 mysql way and the set names utf8 and nothing happen there isn t any information about none of this commands in the query language understood by sqlite

263068
stderr	stdout
you have to spawn a new copy of the shell that uses the upgraded environment and has access to the existing stdin stdout and stderr and does its reinitialization dance

263075
build-process	msbuild
i am looking for any and all suggestions of the best and effective resources that the stackoverflow community has used to better learn msbuild with an emphasis on integrating unit tests and later static code analysis tools such as fxcop and stylecop into the build-process

263079
multiplication	division
use integer division and multiplication

263088
implements	final
when you re writing quick and dirty apps you can implements some simple dao using jdbc or some simple framework which you won t end up using in the final versioning

263117
ubuntu	linux
i m not a great linux expert but i m comfortable running my ubuntu desktop

263117
solaris	linux
at work we re considering switching away from our current solaris based setup to something linux based

263117
sysadmin	centos
our sysadmin is pushing for something like redhat enterprise or centos

263117
ruby	php
essentially we ll be serving ruby on rails and php web apps from it

263118
lookup	any
keep in mind i am new to development on a mac and would appreciate any guidance as to where i should lookup such information be it through the use of delegates or perhaps i am missing something obvious in the structure of the templates

263119
contains	sorted
before linking do nm on all object files extract the global symbols and generate a c file contains a preferably sorted hash mapping of all symbol names to symbol values

263142
greenfoot	bluej
it has links to bluej alice and greenfoot all already discussed as well as a couple of other resources

263151
conditional	operators
generally when using the conditional operators here s the syntax

263162
shell	bash
i would use the bash eval statement and have the python script output the shell code

263164
ubuntu	debian
but if your team has ubuntu experience maybe debian would be better choice for server infrastructure if you do not need the bleeding edge set of applications

263165
background-color	transparency
to solve this in the past since our images are modified less than once a month we call the images through a caching-php scripting which automatically applies the shadow using a pre-defined background-color so we don t have to rely on any transparency

263173
ubuntu-server	ubuntu
if i recall ubuntu even has a server-oriented variant ubuntu-server

263173
ubuntu	debian
also ubuntu basically just grabs the existing versions in debian unstable and polishes them a little before releasing them

263175
couchdb	hbase
problems with hbase solution as i see it -- ruby support is not very strong and couchdb did not reach 1.0 version yet

263188
value	field
the ftp process has done an ebcdic to ascii translation of the byte value in the comp-3 field which isn t what you want

263188
value	field
a packed field stores each digit in a half byte with the lower half byte as a sign f is positive and other value usually d or e are negative

263188
numeric	digits
this stores the number as a string of ebcdic numeric digits with the sign as a separate negative - or blank character

263206
http	ssl
also if your site will be using any ssl certificates you want to plan for this by calling the script via google s http connection

263208
python	java
teamcity is not limited to just run java test we use it to run python unit tests as well

263228
build-process	ant
i need to get the entire build-process implemented under ant and more importantly i need to understand what the flex part of the project depends on

263237
web-deployment	web
we don t use publish to deploy our web projects but we used to use web-deployment projects

263240
contains	elements
note if you pass a classname argument that contains whitespace it will be matched literally against the collection s elements classname string

263250
arrays	loops
but as i said i would keep an arrays that is easy to loops through then once you have all the values you know you will use just concatenate them at the end

263251
linux	unix
in case it s not clear this is an aspect where windows differs from unix linux

263267
directory	folder
is there a way within the .net to check to see if two different shared folder are actually pointing to the same physical directory

263274
installation	packaging
i ve got an msi based install that i ve wrapped in an exe file as per my installation packaging software which is wise package studio 7.0 sp2

263283
mbunit	nunit
edit the guide by carel lotz uses mbunit for unit tests see his earlier document version for nunit though you can replace the mbunit with nunit pretty easily if you follow the nunit help files

263286
struct	unions
this will work if the supplier and the consumer are effectively using matching unions so that casting of the struct to char and back works just fine

263292
duplicates	contains
necklaces can contains duplicates

263292
duplicates	contains
if you were only looking for necklaces of length n drawn from an alphabet of size n that contains no duplicates then it s pretty easy there will be n-1

263292
duplicates	contains
but if you want to find real necklaces which may contains duplicates elements then it s not so simple

263305
pixels	line
to give you an idea for what i m thinking about here s a poor-man s implementation where the rendering just uses a black rgb value whenever it encounters a pixels that intersects a contour line

263320
oracle	mysql
the comments have taught me that mysql has similar behavior and oracle does not it will learn about changes to the table

263333
firefox	opera
don t care if it works in firefox opera ..etc

263344
linux	unix
the only case in which you might need to do some conversions is to deal with line endings if you were moving between unix and windows but between linux unix boxes no problems

263345
any	set
and make sure you set proper permissions on the file so that you don t get any additional unauthorized entries

263350
rhel	suse
i think if you intend to install software from oracle ibm or other big vendors they may require you to use rhel or suse for support

263350
ubuntu	debian
assuming you do not want to use 3rd party or big vendor software then you should take advantage of your familiarity with ubuntu or debian and stick with it

263350
ubuntu	debian
if your sysadmin is any good he should be able to learn ubuntu debian in no time

263351
32-bit	64bit
i ve had similar problems when running a 32-bit windows binary for the server on a 64bit machine

263380
detect	move
one thing my boss has asked a few time is if there is any way we could detect if any of the photos are showing too much skin and automatically move flag these as adults only before the editors make the final decision

263381
base-class	inherited
- more realistically after future refactoring we will probably find that we should inherit from a base-class like asset but if we ve already inherited from list then we can t

263386
compatibility	platform
delphi 2007 2009 makes for one of the best native dev platform for vista 2008 whilst maintaining seamless backward compatibility in older win32 platform

263389
expression	evaluation
how many evaluation expression do intend to have

263402
any	set
set any in foo baz 3

263410
ncover	fxcop
as for the automating of your tests with reporting and integration with nunit fxcop ncover fitnesse etc - i think the best free tool out there is cruisecontrol.net .net

263411
smalltalk	lisp
you should learn those patterns that are useful in your language many gof patterns aren t needed in lisp or smalltalk for example learn their advantages and disadvantages understand the constraints of your system and make the choice that best fits your needs

263416
value	field
fnv is also designed for variables lengths of data whereas the way we re using it here is always for the same number of field value

263434
processor	cpu
processor type intel r pentium r d cpu

263435
constructor	object
to return a non-copyable object from a function indeed it is sufficient to implement the move constructor as follows

263435
constructor	object
such constructor is supposed to transfer the ownership to the new object leaving the one being passed in a default state

263435
move-constructor	std
while std stream does not support move-constructor it seems that stl containers shipped with gcc 4.3.2 do already support it

263441
administration	account
basically administration can hijack a user s account with a simple button click

263441
administration	credentials
because of this it becomes necessary for either the administration s session to be hijacked or for their authentication credentials to be captured in order for someone to ever exploit the hijack function within the application

263471
tcl	lua
i have used tcl in the past but you might try lua which is designed for embedding

263471
python	ruby
ruby and python are two other embeddable interpreters that are easy to embed but aren t quite as lightweight

263501
authentication	login
markc s idea is the best augment your authentication logic to allow superusers to login as a particular user by supplying not the user s credentials but the user s name plus their superuser credentials

263501
authentication	login
in other words if the username and password don t authentication if the password has a colon then it s actually the admin username and admin password joined by a colon so login as the username if they are the right admin username and password

263512
javascript	dom
you may want to give the img tag the correct src attach you dom ready handler to run your javascript clear the image src give it a fixed with and height with css to prevent the page flickering then set your img load handler then reset the src to the correct file

263522
delphi	basic
basic xml parsing in delphi

263526
configuration	logging
if you need logging it is highly unlikely that you don t need other functionality exposed by enterprise library you d be on the microsoft road map benefit from regular updates have tool support configuration tool and there is always the much maligned documentation which is far superior than you will get with open source

263569
textmate	vim
vim with the help of a few plugins rails.vim project and fuzzy file finder textmate really makes for a good--and cross platform--editor

263584
selected	button
under component|install packages when you selected a package the components button shows you which components are installed in that package

263604
constructor	object
or create a mutable object and pass that in to the constructor

263614
display	width
so how do you calculate the display width of a string in c# .net

263623
python	ruby
is there any ruby equivalent for python builtin zip function

263636
pixels	line
the trick i used to anti-alias the contour line is to mix the contour line color into both pixels proportional to their closeness to the idealized contour line

263636
pixels	line
suppose that the current pixels is at an elevation of 12 ft a neighbor is at an elevation of 8 ft and contour line are every 10 ft

263636
pixels	line
paint the current pixels with the contour line color at 50 opacity

263647
dialog	pop-up
in access you could hit shift-f2 and it would pop-up a nice dialog to edit your text in

263676
iteration	set
each iteration computes a set of statistic variables double precision and the number of variables can be up to 1000 typically 15-50

263680
memmove	memcpy
you chould be able to easily create a couple of apis that use memcpy memmove and take char s which will work everywhere and likely be faster than the non-std

263682
highlight	cells
you can say use red bold text to highlight any cells which are different using a validation formula like this

263689
push	pull
as i understand it regular twain is a pull not a push from the scanner

263735
selection	highlight
if you highlight the first 5 characters the font pt selection drop down display 9

263739
administration	account
it works now after adding a service account to sso administration and restart all biztalk related services

263758
median	min
you might keep around max min mean median and possibly compute error bars for the data you display to the user

263766
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsview
you should try using a qgraphicsview qgraphicsscene qgraphicpixmapitem instead of the scroll area and label

263766
qgraphicsview	qimage
for example you have a .ui file with a qgraphicsview on the gui called qgvimageview and a qimage called image .

263791
directory	folder
in this case the export directory doesn t need to be in the www folder at all

263796
firefox	gecko
with firefox safari and other gecko based browsers you can easily use textarea.selectionstart but for ie that doesn t work so you will have to do something like this

263797
any	set
when you are using an objectdatasource or any other datasource you set the datasourceid for your gridview not the datasource

263820
command-prompt	cmd
the first batch file launches a cmd-prompt i need the second cmd to be in the ccontext of the first

263843
put	get
you might get an error with the call to put but calling it a second or third time should make it work

263859
chmod	sudo
instead of chmod u+s ing the shutdown command allowing passwordless sudo access to that command would be better

263861
type-safety	generics
think of generics as a static helper to a better document your code and b enable some limited compile-time checking for type-safety

263892
shell	bash
i m running ubuntu and bash is my shell

263895
xlsx	xls
maybe have look on csvreader it reads csv xls and xlsx

263937
capacity	storage
and once x starts to get unreasonably small you ll know its time to increase your storage capacity

263938
firefox	opera
it works with ie but not with firefox or opera

263953
buffering	streaming
for example you could send the length of the message before the message then read the whole message from the streaming into a buffering then parsing the buffering using xmlreader or create a special inputstreaming that takes that reaches its end after the specified amount of data

263965
value	field
this form contains some field which represent boolean values and are dynamically populate with an intrinsic boolean value

263965
value	field
the only way i could find to determine the field s boolean value once it was converted into a string was to depend upon the literal value of its string representation

264026
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
codeigniter is a significantly smaller framework than ruby on ruby-on-rails as far as features go

264029
forth	ada
ada and forth

264036
contains	elements
say you had a linked-list and the first elements in the list contains a variables that you will need to access frequently

264036
machine-code	relocation
then there s the ubercoolness of self-modifying code and as a related issue mechanisms for things such as relocation and applying patches to code this needs investigation of machine-code as well

264043
actionscript	mxml
i find it much easier to write mxml classes with embedded script than trying to make an actionscript file

264084
g++	gcc
calling gcc as g++ or in your case mingwin32-g++ will also get the right language and will link the needed library

264088
member-function-pointers	member-functions
the advantage of it is that it also works for overloaded member-functions and also for const member-functions remember using as the member-function-pointers type then

264097
value	field
using would just be silly in this case as the field s value will always be a string

264140
json	xml
i ve a web service running on server which return data either in xml format or json format

264146
sql-server	oracle
i currently work with oracle and sql-server db s and i started with cullinet s idms database 1980 where we packed all kinds of data into records and worried about bits and bytes

264156
profiling	debugging
this is a good thing to do once you get into debugging and profiling your project since you can really see where the compiler is doing the right or wrong thing

264163
wait	hang
my problem is that when the dispatcher invoke methods is called it seems to hang every single time and the callstack indicates that its in a sleep wait or join within the invoke implementation

264165
boolean	int
it only accepts return values of type boolean int floats arrays structures dates or binary data

264180
google-chrome	firefox
won t work in older browsers of course and firefox shows false while opera google-chrome safari and ie show true

264198
buffering	streaming
i would read the input streaming into an internal buffering

264198
buffering	streaming
the only real difference then between handling a streaming with one xml and a streaming with multiple xmls is the buffering and split logic

264215
execution	jobs
i would not recommend thousands of quartz jobs triggers when used as part of a framework execution an application in the same jvm the jobs triggers will be competing for resources with the rest of the application

264216
google-chrome	firefox
here is the weird part in firefox and google-chrome - everything works

264222
firefox	safari
that s very strange - it looks like firefox safari are expanding the draw area of the embed but somehow flash is not getting the message that it needs to render the new pixels

264244
passthru	exec
the exec function only returns the last line of output but passthru returns all output

264281
user-interface	tray
i want to iterate through the items in the tray i would guess through the processes but i don t know how to determine what is actually in the tray and what is just a process and also represent the items with their icons in my own user-interface

264284
similarity	distance
if you want to actually correct them you probably want to use the concept of edit distance to compare the similarity of misspelled strings to those in your reference list

264293
arrays	loops
first load the correct city names into an arrays then loops through the city names in your file

264293
metaphone	soundex
if it isn t in the arrays try comparing the soundex or metaphone value of the misspelled word with the words in the arrays of correct names to find the correct way of spelling it

264320
libcurl	openssl
edit actually i m pretty sure it was the ssl library in my case in that libcurl was using an older version of openssl

264320
command-line	cmd
i think if you run the equivalent curl cmd on the cmd-line you may see the error there immediately

264320
libcurl	openssl
i fixed it by updating the openssl library libcurl was using

264321
getter	setter
i also prefer classes with simple constructor and property setter getter for configuration over classes with lots of parameters in the constructor

264331
required	checked
last i checked the gzipping was something that iis does when setup correctly - and of course when the browser sends the required headers

264344
python	java
it s actually a conspiracy perpetuated by the american association of retired programmers against today s young whippersnappers who cut their teeth on python and java

264345
directory	folder
this will find all matching files folder starting in the current directory and perform the action on them svn delete

264367
homescreen	icons
how can i write an asp.net c# application that will render a page can be permanently cached on the iphone when it is bookmarked as a homescreen icons

264395
command-line	cmd
i ve found the open cmd in mac os x very handy in the cmd-line

264395
command-line	cmd
so is there a simple equivalent of the open cmd in the linux cmd-line

264400
linqdatasource	datalist
basically i am binding a linqdatasource to a datalist

264406
put	get
you can t because there s no installer redist for the debugging runtime and in fact the software license forbids distributing it so you d be breaking the eula even if you did get something put together

264406
pointers	stack
i make a lot of use of builds that use have symbols zi and link debugging and asserts ddebugging but are still optimized o1 or o2 or whatever flags you use but with stack frame pointers kept for clear backtraces oy- and using the normal runtime library mt

264414
sqldatasource	gridview
i ve got a repeater and its sqldatasource nested inside a gridview templatedfield

264414
where-clause	sql
because i have already used the single and double quotes i am having trouble delimiting the string in the sql where-clause

264417
constructor	object
in the constructor as it is actually part of constructing the object

264427
value	field
why not just use the rowdatabound event and check the value of your field then

264453
dialog	pop-up
there s a google grouping and ruby-on-rails plugins which replaces the basic confirm pop-up with a modal dialog box

264488
.when	ready
.when you do this in an override of form.onload you re assured that the user-interface is ready to go initializecomponent has been called .

264489
dictionary	arrays
the binary plist format allows them to be uniqued the issue is that it is expensive to actually walk through and unique arrays and dictionary

264489
dictionary	arrays
if you have a lot of identical arrays or dictionary in your content you may see a significant size reduction by uniquing them

264497
any	set
that way you get back a working set set of projects view allowing you to reopen any project of your choice in a new windows

264516
credentials	account
this has to do with the fact that only the farm credentials account has access to the farm configuration database

264516
credentials	account
run the stsadm command as the farm credentials account

264516
credentials	account
change the farm credentials account to your logged in user

264518
processor	cpu
an external interrupt line connected to a timer circuit will wake the processor back up at regular intervals and which point the cpu checks to see if it has been asleep for long enough and if not it goes back to sleep

264526
windows-vista	windows
this worked perfectly fine but on windowss-vista it does not work if another windows is occluding the windows

264579
python	java
i don t know much python but from a .net java perspective if they re references to some data structure a map or whatever then making them references to the same object as you do at the start will mean that any changes made through one variable will be visible through the other

264581
continuous-integration	teamcity
i ve some experience with using star team for continuous-integration - though using teamcity not cruisecontrol

264608
environment	execution
it depends to some extent on the execution environment that your vb6 code is running in

264615
publishing	release
when we release new functionality for acceptance-testing we make a publishing in visual-studio zip up the changes and apply them on the test server

264615
directory	folder
this is a lot of manual labour creating backup folder release folder recreating the directory structure and try to track what functionality that goes into what release

264615
versioning	staging
i ve discussed this with our developers and they can t see any problem with using subversion for versioning and backup of the test staging production environment

264622
sftp	ftps
you can edit files over ftp ftps sftp scp

264626
webforms	asp.net
i can t seem to get javascript debugging working for my asp.net mvc application even though i can for a traditional asp.net webforms app

264628
environment	building
you can then deploy the packaged building to the other environment

264631
constructor	object
creating objectdataprovider in xaml in both cases just creates object of type applicationpresenter through default constructor

264633
put	get
the session id will get put into the uri but the custom data will stay in memory on the server

264640
value	field
i d like to create a text field with a dropdown list that lets the user choose some predefined value

264654
google-chrome	firefox
just to let you know firefox and google-chrome consider all ajax request as non-cachable

264678
url-rewriting	query-string
as long as each page has a unique url either by url-rewriting or by query-string parameters and uses that to drive the content being displayed seo will work

264738
google-docs	spreadsheet
edit another thought - if you really want to stay using a spreadsheet - google-docs supports simultaneous editing of a spreadsheet

264743
convention	standards
use a sensible naming convention and stick with the standards for all the gui object put all the forms inside a common package and use the .svnignore directive on java files in it

264743
environment	building
fabrizio giudici has a nice tutorial on how to building a netbeans project yes using matisse inside a continuous-integration environment

264751
child-process	spawn
the simplest and most portable way would be to spawn a child-process have it execute a wrapper written in c which changes the uid drops all the privileges be careful writting a wrapper to do that is tricky - it is as hard as writing a setuid wrapper and execute another java instances to which you talk via rmi

264758
getter	setter
you have to use concrete types instead of interfaces in setter and getter

264766
firefox	safari
my code works great in ie8 firefox and safari

264771
selected	button
i want the user to be able to selected the browse button and selected the file path rather than putting up dialog boxes all over the place

264787
getter	setter
why setter and getter are evil

264812
triggers	insert
it seems to me you should have a unique index on your id column so a repeated insert would triggers an error instead of being blindingly accepted again

264815
configuration	logging
i m trying to find out why a java ee client stand alone java program that uses jbossall-client.jar is failing to connect to a java ee server so it would be good to enable logging that occurs from within jboss as classes such as org.jnp.interfaces.namingcontext - presume there is a configuration file i can set up

264835
attributes	properties
we put a suppressmessage attributes on the id properties and everyone is happy

264843
versioning	upgrade
when you upgrade the versioning of your current containers

264860
json	xml
the intermediate format could be anything like a pickle or json or xml

264861
dictionary	arrays
alternatively you could throw them into a dictionary but this doesn t help the caller any more than an arrays does

264869
getter	setter
of course you don t have to make the value publicly accessible you can make them only accessible via setter getter methods and by only having getters you can avoid them from being altered after object creation

264869
base-class	inherited
of course different calls to db.readparams should return different objects you can create an abstract base-class and inherited all possible results from db.readparams of it

264874
spring-mvc	dwr
i couldn t imagine coding a front end in something like yui backing onto dwr spring-mvc without it

264891
datagridview	databound
since the data is databound you should be able to iterate the .rows of the datagridview obtaining the .databounditem of each

264917
contains	any
the original header.jsp does not contains any i18n and i don t know how to do it especially how to get the actual locale

264943
export	csv
is there a way to export only certain colums from the access database to csv

264950
samba	root
i am using a machine on which i do not have root access and would like to access files on a samba server in random access mode

264950
samba	root
the problem as noted is that i don t have root access to this machine a linux box so i can t mount the remote samba file system

264957
jndi	jms
if i understood your problem correctly mymdb listens to a topic on weblogic and you want to use an additional jms destination provided by jboss defined in a deployed configuration file and identified by its jndi name by default deploy jms jms-ds.xml only contains the configuration for the jms provider and connection factories -- no data sources

264957
jndi	jms
the easiest way is to let the container inject the jms destination and a connection factory via its jndi name in jboss the jms destinations are configured by deploying xxx-service.xml files

264959
udp	tcp
i run mono servers dealing with giga-bytes of udp tcp data processing related tasks and couldn t be happier

264966
webforms	asp.net
regarding a future direction i wouldn t aim for asp.net webforms instead i d go for microsoft s new mvc framework an add-on to of asp.net it will be much simpler migrating to this from classic asp

264971
contains	any
i highly doubt any official mono build contains a functional xbuild

264997
compatibility	platform
while mono has its share of problems i think it has a better cross-platform compatibility story especially if you have reliance on native platform invocation

265000
jndi	jms
i think what you are asking is how do i specify the jndi location of the jms datasource to use for an mdb

265002
glassfish	weblogic
if you tell me which container you re using i may be able to help you specifically i have done this successfully before on weblogic websphere glassfish and jrun

265007
silverlight	wpf
edit i am especially interested in silverlight solutions since the most obvious wpf solution - splitting things up into resource dictionary - is not supported in silverlight

265035
jms	jmx
if you switch to apache activemq which is a much better more popular open source jms provider which also fully supports jms 1.1 and j2ee 1.4 you get a number of alternatives for monitoring and browsing queue in particular you can just use the web console or jmx

265041
affinity	cpu
set thread affinity to a specific cpu so you don t get switched between cpus

265042
textbox	button
you can decide to combine a form access form or a generic microsoft form with 2 controls 1 textbox 2 browse button which will finally use the filedialog command or a windows api

265079
worksheet	excel
i ve never used this format for writing out office documents from php but i m using it for reading in an excel worksheet naturally saved as xml-spreadsheet 2003 and displaying its data on a web page

265086
deployment	install
this will create the deployment utility in the bin folder you can then copy all that to the new machine run the install and all should work fine

265109
database-agnostic	rdbms
entity client ultimately spits out a representation of the esql command in a canonical database-agnostic form which the ado.net provider for the specific rdbms is responsible for converting into store specific sql

265109
entity-framework	ado.net
as entity-framework needs to work with many stores and therefore many ado.net providers there is less scope for them to easily optimise what the entity client generates on a per store basis at least - thats where we are with v1

265132
parsing	comma
you should have a look at fgetcsv it automatically parsing the comma seperated line into an arrays

265135
duplicates	contains
update there is a duplicates bug of mine which also contains a workaround

265141
triggers	insert
you would need to add a triggers on insert update delete that sets a value in another table to sysdate

265146
versioning	upgrade
i m now trying to compile a 64bit versioning without having to upgrade to c++-cli

265151
swing	swt
at first when i read gui framework i thought you meant swing or swt but i see you mention struts so i guess you mean presentation framework

265151
tapestry	jsf
it is quite easy to get up and running with struts+spring+hibernate or jsf or tapestry and so on

265151
appfuse	spring
i use struts2 with spring and hibernate and sitemesh which was an appfuse project to start with and it has served me well

265154
order	add
i would like to know the steps to add session support in order to have the login information available

265157
value	field
you can simply add a rule and assign any field you like the value from this xpath xduser get-username

265164
vb.net	vb6
the short answer is that vb6 and vb.net and consequently c# are separate but related languages

265164
vb.net	vb6
how to switch a large app from vb6 to vb.net

265168
naming-conventions	conventions
the naming-conventions and project conventions are must-reads

265189
methods	extend
with anonymous methods the data can stay where it is - you don t have to unnecessarily extend its scope or copy it to some helper object

265189
callback	methods
just write your callback code in-place as an anonymous methods and it can fully access and manipulate all local variables at the site where the anonymous methods is defined not where it s called

265198
32-bit	64bit
according to there are no 64bit integers signed or unsigned ...only 32-bit

265213
motorola	sony
on other phones like nokia sony ericsson etc the same image only takes about 16k to load and store in memory.i dont know what smart optimizations they use but for some incomprehensible reason motorola s jvm does not

265221
any	set
it didn t need you to set any time outs and you could let the current page that called it continue and output some more details

265259
execute	prepare
you might need to copy a set of statements from profiling due to the prepare + execute steps involved

265272
primitive	int
the longest normal primitive int format is usually only 64 bits

265304
any	set
i d really like to be able to set up a basic debugging configuration and then three more specific configuration underneath it but i can t find any option to do this

265319
project-management	scrum
ken schwaber in his book agile project-management with scrum covers the topic of bidding on fixed length fixed price projects in an appendix at the end of the book

265319
implements	final
the client would have to be okay with a lot of uncertainty about the final cost and the final delivery date in return for getting something much sooner that may be usuable and the possibility of not having to implements every feature could save them money

265326
put	get
i do not use a parameterised query - i just get the parameter values from the user and put them directly into the sql

265334
delphi	basic
if you just want to learn and understand how to do it just google for delphi outlook addin i m pretty sure addin should give you much more relevant results than plugin in this context and you should come up with a number of slightly dated but still formally correct sample addins the babelfish addin from dmitry streblechenko which is no longer useful because the web service it relies on no longer exists but still shows the basic or the sample addin from paul qualls which is unfortunately no longer available from the original site

265342
required	checked
it would also be useful to be able to checked the required checkedout flag as well

265347
numeric	zero
also not directly relevent but you shd know you still have to do n to enter nulls in the db and empty strings in input file can turn into zero s in numeric fields

265373
postback	ajax
using ajax techniques and the webrequest object a short validation stub in the client can quite easily call a server-side validation function with no need for a postback

265380
factors	primes
except for pure mathematical requirements like say factors primes numbers for cryptology or .

265380
integer	digits
on the other hand if you are doing something that requires perfectly accurate integer values with that many digits then you should probably get specialized software designed to handle large numbers.

265395
expression-blend	silverlight
i have expression-blend 2 service pack 1 and cannot create a silverlight 2 project

265411
sequences	subset
for example i may pass three value into a function but depending on the sequences of conditional expression only a subset may actually be used

265438
apache	squid
how do you do this in the apache config file or do you need to use squid

265449
32-bit	64bit
it s a 32-bit native app and it was running on 64bit windows

265449
32-bit	64bit
i ve tried 32-bit windbg from debugging tools 6.9 on 32-bit windows 2003 and 64bit windbg also from debugging tools 6.9 on 64bit windows 2008

265476
textbox	button
i m looking for dialogs windows button textbox combos drop downs menus etc etc and the ability to extend the components to make new ones

265478
hide	show
i have some html jquery that slider a div up and down to show hide it when a link is click

265488
32-bit	64bit
are you debugging on a 32-bit or 64bit system and with the 32 or 64bit version of windbg

265488
32-bit	64bit
the 32-bit version of debugging tools for windows is the best choice unless you are debugging an application on a 64bit processor

265488
32-bit	64bit
also take a look at this article where he is debugging a 32-bit app running on a 64bit platform

265512
versioning	migrate
finally we are about to release versioning 1.11 which can generate .net dlls that are binary compatible with the original com dlls so that you can migrate one component at the time starting with the most basic ones that are used by all others portions of your app without having to re-compile them

265513
cassini	iis
apparently iis handles this but cassini doesn t

265530
hide	show
my problem is that everytime i drag one groupbox on top of the other hide show groupboxes upon listview catagory selected the base groupbox auto-parents the second groupbox i just dragged on top

265536
sql-server	oracle
second the closest equivalent to the sql-server sp_spaceused procedure is likely oracle s dbms_space package

265539
endpoint	uri
incidentally if you just want to refer to endpoint you ve defined use the ref name attributes rather than uri ...

265552
directory	folder
in particular notice the use of the web-inf directory folder

265559
procedure	records
however when i execute the following procedure and set the radioservicegroup to null it returns no records

265562
sharpziplib	dotnetzip
since there are two different open-source libraries sharpziplib and dotnetzip library to handle writing extracting files from a zipfile why worry about doing it yourself

265573
soft-references	weak-references
if you want to implements a cache soft-references are definetly a better idea than weak-references but it puts your entire cache removal policy in the hands of the garbage collector

265582
attributes	properties
afaik you can not change it at least with simple means at runtime because it is auto-generated as attributes in the properties of the domain classes

265585
nested-class	inherited
i always figured a nested-class behaved just like a regular class except with special rules concerning accessing the outer class s private-members but i guess there s some implicit inherited occurring between the two classes

265589
alignment	layout
also available in the layout toolbar are the alignment and sizing button

265593
versioning	upgrade
the company i work for uses an asp.net grid component from a commercial vendor but won t upgrade the buggy old versioning we have to a newer versioning because of cost

265620
jquery	dojo
there s an implementation of what you re looking for in jquery ui and in dojo

265620
jquery	dojo
jquery is more popular but dojo allows you to declaratively define widgets in html which sounds more like what you re looking for

265637
aggregate	grouping
with that in mind it doesn t make sense to order by something that s not in the aggregate grouping

265639
buffering	capture
i ve tried using the .net streamreader class to accomplish this which provides very easy to use readline functionality but there is no way to capture the true positioning of the file the positioning in the basestream property is skewed due to the buffering the class uses

265660
communication	messages
that server will communication these xml messages to another company s server

265665
.net	wcf
we may at a future date move to wcf but taking baby-steps at the moment and want to get our existing services running under all the .net 3.5 goodness

265679
subversive	javahl
i use subversive 0.7.5 with the native javahl 1.5.3 r33570 connector

265679
revision	svn
svn syntax error in revision argument working

265686
postback	ajax
how can i tell if a method is running in the context of an ajax postback i.e as the result of a updatepanel asynchronous postback

265688
value	field
it s good practice to find out where the nulls are coming from and stop them - give field default value use nz on inputs

265689
dialog	pop-up
they should pop-up up a dialog informing the user that administrative rights are required to complete whatever task it was that they were attempting

265692
macports	fink
also if you re building postgresql from source you might have better luck using a os x package from fink or macports

265707
put	get
it has been awhile since i used that particular setup but subclipse will automatically add a new non versioned file - one that hasn t been versioned or put in the repository yet meaning you shouldn t get your error

265714
short	base
short answer here is the list of base controls

265714
textbox	button
long answer yes there are many controls such as button textbox combo boxes etc already built into flash flex

265726
virtualization	vmware
i ve used vmware effectively in the past for development and testing purposes but i was wondering if anyone had any other virtualization tools they have had good experience using

265742
vmware	esx
we use vmware esx 3.5 and are very pleased with it

265752
any	set
save an option set in a file and apply it to any configuration that you like at any time

265764
superclass	inherited
mostly xml but when i have a bunch of beans that inherited from a common class and have common properties i use annotations for those in the superclass so i don t have to set the same properties for each bean

265765
payment	billing
does anybody know of a working open-source ruby-on-rails application that makes use of paypal website payment standard for billing and can you point me to that code

265784
project-management	scrum
i do see a lot of logic in other parts like small iteration contiguous integration having product project-management to be very close to development process and i think that we are doing a lot of things by scrum already without knowing it

265802
xml-serialization	xml
another solution would be to use xml-serialization to create an object graph from the xml and bind to that

265811
execution	jobs
note that you can configure what quartz should do with a triggers if it does get too far behind in execution jobs

265823
binary-tree	tree
what is said in one of the sites about an internal node having to have two children is for the tree to be a complete binary-tree not for the node to be internal

265846
16-bit	8bit
i don t like 8bit would cut it for processing or memory but 16-bit would definitely be a contender

265857
textmate	gedit
here s an excellent guide on how to turn your gedit into a linux textmate

265876
put	get
you could put the connection string in the connectionstrings section of the web.config and then have nhibernate get it from there

265889
antivirus	security
mostly i ve seen this with antivirus software that attempts to do transparent proxying of post requests coming from the browser to scan them for private information like social security numbers

265889
antivirus	mcafee
are you using mcafee s antivirus by any chance

265905
abstract-factory	facade
so most people do call it design-patterns but call the patterns with translated names fã brica abstrata instead of abstract-factory fachada instead of facade

265907
populate	row
they both create a working table in memory based on the columns being grouping on or selecteded in the selected distinct clause - and then populate that working table as the query reads data adding a new row only when the values indicate the need to do so.

265907
difference	count
the only difference is that in the grouping by there are additional columns in the working table for any calculated aggregate fields like sum count avg etc

265907
aggregate	grouping
in the special case where you grouping by only to get distinct-values and there are no aggregate columns in output then it is probably exactly the same query plan..

265915
contains	any
an empty string is a value a piece of text which incidentally happens not to contains any letters

265922
directory	folder
i generally create a new working directory named branch set up the source control to monitor the branch and pull to the new folder

265922
put	get
i also put in an exculusion filtering on the trunk build so it does not get kicked off by a check in to the branch our branches usually reside within the trunk realm of checking for changes

265922
configuration	upgrade
one very helpful thing you can do is if you will only ever have one branch active simply name it branch that way once you have your configuration all set you only have to comment or uncomment those parts in the config file as needed instead of having to upgrade it in all the places like if one time it is branch 6.1 and next time it is 6.2 it saves a lot of cut and replace and i only have to changed the project name and the label the next time we use a branch

265952
put	get
form methods get will put all the form s input into the url

265958
required	checked
exception-handling code is required whether or not you checked for the permissions of the file in advance

265979
malloc	free
the last argument to safearraygetelement is a pointers to the memory that will hold the result so the contents of l the pointers returned by malloc will just be overwrite which is why free gives you a crash

265981
assign	add
you should add your own domain to this list or assign it to this variables

265982
worksheet	excel
whereas the excel worksheet function round always rounds .5 up

265982
worksheet	excel
i then finally discovered that you can use the excel worksheet round function like so

266002
value	field
i m using this xpath to get the value of a field

266010
contains	any
server serverkey and command not contains any spaces s+

266010
contains	any
transfermode not contains any spaces s+

266057
margins	padding
you may also need to add a right margins to the blue containers or left-margins to the red containers to get consistent spacing between them rather than using padding which relates to the spacing inside the div not around it

266075
perl	tcl
some nice examples in ruby perl and tcl can be found at

266078
javascript	dom
http requests creating a dom for each page and running javascript using mozilla s rhino

266082
32-bit	64bit
how do i tell if my application compiled in visual-studio 2008 as any cpu is running as a 32-bit or 64bit application

266097
perl-module	lwp
you could use the perl-module lwp with module javascript

266111
python	perl
python like perl 5 was not designed from the ground up to be thread safe

266127
reflection	runtime
there is no way to create generic instances based on runtime values without the big hammer of using reflection

266134
apache-fop	docbook
the docbook stylesheets plus apache-fop work well but i finally decided to spring for renderx which covers the standard more thoroughly and has some nice extensions that the docbook stylesheets take advantage of

266143
ubuntu	debian
in my experience the following should work the debian family including ubuntu and the red hat family including fedora and centos

266143
configuration	installation
it uses perl and maybe shell for its installation and configuration so you might see the approach that it takes

266143
ubuntu	debian
building .debs for debian or ubuntu debian maintainer s guide

266145
toolbar	tabs
and out of that 12 inches overall perhaps two full inches are taken up with browser toolbar tabs rows of bookmarks and the statusbar none of which have anything to do with the web app i m interacting with

266153
sql-server	oracle
i wonder if sql-server has a feature like oracle s materialized views

266161
stderr	stdout
try making sure stdout and stderr have somewhere to go

266168
methods	extend
i m looking for actual c++ thread objects that i can extend run methods on or something similar as opposed to calling a c-style thread library

266182
installation	building
the wix installer tool creates a way to manage this - you would define them as a part of the installation building instructions

266198
boost	tbb
intel thread building blocks contains a tbb thread object that closely approximates the c++0x standard and boost has a boost thread library that does the same

266199
mouseover	mouseout
i m trying to do a very simple button that changes color based on mouseover mouseout and

266199
mouseover	mouseout
click i m doing this in prototype and the weird thing is if i used mouseover and mouseout

266223
click	mouse
do you mean that you wan the mouse click to cause a permenant change in the style that is not replaced by mouseout

266225
web-config	app-config
in web-config or app-config

266228
click	mouse
assuming you want the button white if it has been click or if the mouse is over it

266228
click	mouse
this has the advantage of separating the state - click not-click and mouse over not over - from the style - black or gray

266238
authentication	impersonation
if you must use windows authentication remember to enable impersonation in the web.config

266244
google-chrome	firefox
currently i m using the api for screen readers to scrape from ie but that doesn t work for firefox or google-chrome or etc

266248
pointers	stack
of course it crashes when you call realloc on a pointers that s pointing into stack

266255
administration	account
i also made sure that the account running myapp.exe is site collection administration

266258
binary	hex
well you can always write code in binary or hex or some other representation

266289
binary	hex
these raw hex binary values are the machine code

266294
perl	c++
personally i m happily using scite for c c++ perl and python development on windows

266331
updating	updates
well you can sometimes but you need to know what you re doing. this is equally true in the .net world - once a control is visible you need to use a delegate to updates it so that the updating action occurs on the correct thread

266364
hash	md5
i ve got a db table where we store a lot of md5 hash and yes i know that they aren t 100 unique... where we have a lot of comparison queries against those strings

266364
binary	hex
my question is this is it wise to keep the data as hexadecimal strings or should i convert the hex to binary or decimals for better querying

266393
triggers	insert
a dictation can run several pages so we also have a hash column that s populated on insert via a triggers

266403
any	set
if it is set to true for either the whole assembly or any classes then the dll will already be callable from com without any wrapper code

266422
environment	building
assume that you have a continuous-integration environment with source control and automated building

266427
stderr	stdout
well you could probably extend replace the existing console view and add an option to write to stdout stderr

266427
stderr	stdout
if you re talking about a java-program and you want it to open a new console windows for stdout stderr you will probably have to modify the jdt launcher

266427
stderr	stdout
i find it much more convenient to have stdout stderr in the eclipse console

266466
versioning	upgrade
even upgrade in vista between versioning is pretty much a complete reinstall

266505
processor	cpu
i seem to vaguely recall that in old versions of windows early xps and 2000s cpu utilization was considered from total of two processor so a single thread wasn t able to make it past 50 unless it was the idle process

266506
linqdatasource	datapager
using a standard asp.net listview with a linqdatasource and pagination enabled with a datapager what would be the best way to default to displaying the last page of results

266509
configuration	environment
if you put your application in a host that does the environment configuration for you like webfaction you should not have problems moving from development to production

266526
document	editing
to the best of my understanding in order to use insertadjacenttext or any of the other editing methods the document object should be in the design mode

266570
arrays	loops
is there any performance difference between the for loops on a primitive arrays

266572
arrays	loops
just create the arrays and execute each loops 1000 or more times and measure the amount of time

266575
dialog	pop-up
when i click on the configuration tab i get a pop-up dialog for the password

266585
google-chrome	firefox
the error doesn t occur in firefox or google-chrome

266620
children	nodes
. s become wildcard insertions covering all children of the current trie nodes

266625
defined	declare
the way templates get initializer required you to be careful about how to declare and defined your templates when you share them across translation units

266628
document	element
nested exception-handling is org.xml.sax.saxparseexception-handling document root element beans

266668
show	next
for example a user submits a simple html form and then an gwt app show up in the next page how can i get the form submission info into the gwt nicely

266689
constructor	object
i ran into a problem where an object constructor was relying on some default initialization for its data members

266689
data-members	constructor
the result was that a data-members was not initialized in the constructor and used before it was initialized

266727
arrays	loops
line 1 might seem unnecessary but it s boilerplate to cache the result if the arrays is computed by a method before entering the loops

266743
unmanaged	c++-cli
this would be best down with c++-cli code that could work with the dataset and convert it to a data structure that your unmanaged code understands

266753
default	reset
they reset in applicationhost.config and by default the list is

266755
csv	xml
see the question linked below for help generating the excel document there are several options that require no interop at all including html tables xml openxml csv or 3rd party component and most of those support formatting formulas etc

266756
mstest	nunit
it allows you to right click on a test methods mstest nunit mbunit etc and selected run in debugger

266785
malloc	free
that said memory-leaks are caused by those system calls that allocate memory by means of malloc and leave the application the responsability to free the memory once the returned data has used

266786
required	checked
and the string checked failed to compile inconvertible types found t required string

266814
sql-server	oracle
in some most rdbms you can just designate a maintenance plan and schedule a job to do this at q quiet time sql-server for instance but in others you might have to do it manually - for example in older versions of oracle the recommended approach was to export the data drop the table and recreate then re-import again from backup - the export reload process would clean up the data as per any fresh load

266816
select	union
union all - select only the columns you want to pass through - delete any others

266820
static-classes	static-class
it works for static-classes too so once the static-class is in scope it doesn t need to even call the is file include yet test of require-once because the class is already in the symbol table

266823
any	set
is there any way i can set the maximum number of rows a dropdownlist should display

266868
getter	setter
this results in obvious performance gains for simplistic functions such as getter and setter

266871
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
openfiledialog savefiledialog etc

266871
directory	folder
will cause the current directory to change if a different folder was selected

266887
modifiers	final
if a parameter is never changed the compiler will already detect that as part of it s normal operation even without the final modifiers

266890
getter	setter
and being less readable is quite a stretch if it s limited to things like getter and setter

266906
put	get
edit workaround - if you put on the you can get the border to appear but it has to be a different colour - just use one that s as close to the others as possible

266910
administration	integrated
i often had to deal with this in cross-departmental database situations where things could get out of sync because disparate systems were not fully integrated yet or security concerns required them to have separate administration

266927
entity-framework	ado.net
i receive an error message when exposing an ado.net data service using an entity-framework data model that contains an entity called case with an internal setter on a property

266931
ruby	php
it seems that nginx is used with php ruby and python

266938
account	userid
as mentioned elsewhere this is suitable for a test and see approach taking into account the if-statement an userid is null and two separate procedures

266963
low-level	hardware
this board will be of the most benefit if it exposes all of the interfaces in a way that allows for debugging and verification - so that the low-level routines can be at least partially tested before the real hardware comes along

266966
credentials	account
we are trying to set the application up to pass in credentials of a service account so that we can avoid giving all users access to the moss site

266980
any	set
now that the open id connection is set up it is no more difficult than any other site i deal with and the magic is that i did not have to add yet another account to a site that i had no idea i was going to use ever again and would probably forget the username or password for

266981
modifiers	final
there is a lot of arguments over whether the final modifiers on the methods itself has any performance gain since the methodss will be inlined by the optimizing compiler at runtime anyway regardless of the modifiers

267003
sqldatasource	formview
inside each of these user controls is basically a formview control and a sqldatasource control that displays values from the database

267003
click	mouse
so now my question how can i stop the extra mouse click from being necessary

267016
integer	zero
this capitalizes on the fact that sql-server s internal representation for datetime and smalldatetime values is a two part value the first part of which is an integer representing the number of days since 1 jan 1900 and the second part is a decimal fraction representing the fractional portion of one day for the time --- so the integer value 0 zero always translates directly into midnight morning of 1 jan 1900.

267030
environment	building
i am trying to copy some files from the building environment to the deployment folder

267030
directory	folder
i repeat all the files from the directory tree end up in one folder

267030
directory	folder
i need it to copy the tree of folders and directory into the destination folder

267032
g++	gcc
try using g++ instead of gcc

267033
put	get
i am ordering by number of projects in each category to show the categories with the most projects on top - thus i would like to split projectsbycat in two - if i put all the odd numbered categories on the left and the even numbered categories on the right i think i will get a reasonably sane view

267039
g++	gcc
gcc is the c compiler while g++ is the c++ compiler which also links in the required c++ libraries

267045
implements	abstract
is it proper to create an abstract base login class that implements the ilogin interface and have all of my concrete classes just inherited from the abstract-class and override when necessary

267058
implements	abstract
i usually code against abstract-class when it makes sense and implements and create in an external contracts assembly library an interface in every class abstract or not so i can more easily implements windows communication foundation or inversion-of-control when necessary which is almost always for mocking

267062
udp	tcp
i would use a local socket with negative acknowledgment udp if the bit rate is going to be too high for tcp although i would try tcp first and confirm that it is a problem

267065
put	get
put your files some that sharepoint can get them

267072
forwarding	port
nginx can forwarding via http protocol so just point it to the correct port and you re set

267079
system.out	system.in
how about using system.out and system.in

267088
versioning	migrate
here is the fixed versioning of the migrate target from above

267099
g++	gcc
gcc serves as a frontend for g++ when compiling c++ sources

267099
fortran	ada
gcc can compile c c++ objective-c fortran ada assembly and others

267099
g++	gcc
by default g++ does this but gcc does not

267101
contains	any
is there any way to at least allow existing git commits contains submodule data to be committed to svn without the submodule data

267111
methods	extend
you could extend the functionality of subclasses by creating a new interface with a different set of methods

267117
javascript	dom
generally though the doctype has little effect on javascript and dom support there are exceptions though especially with ie8

267118
abstract-class	subclassing
both mosquito and eagle classes can both be subclassing of the abstract-class animal and implement the interface ifly and be able to eat breathe sleep and fly without having some type of odd ancenstral relationship between the two classes

267124
google-chrome	firefox
it s slower than i would like at 2-3 seconds in firefox and google-chrome for each popping up but it s entirely unworkable in ie taking easily 7-8 seconds for each time it pops up and loads

267124
google-chrome	firefox
i m thinking it has to do with ie s handling of the updatepanel because the same code is much faster in firefox and google-chrome

267149
markup	xhtml
xhtml markup and provides better

267154
inline-assembly	assembly
are you dealing with pure assembly files or inline-assembly inside c sources

267165
children	nodes
generally an internal nodes is any nodes that is not a leaf a nodes with no children

267165
children	nodes
in extended binary tree also comparison tree internal nodess all have two children because each internal nodes corresponds to a comparison that must be made the art of computer programming taocp vol.3 sorting and searching discussion and figure in section 5.3.1 p.181 ed.2

267165
children	nodes
it is useful to notice that binary search tree where internal nodes also hold single values as well as having up to two children are somewhat different taocp vol.3 section 6.2.2

267191
hide	show
bascially i want to know the best way to hide show an asp.net control from a javascript function

267191
hide	show
also is that the best way to hide show a asp.net control from a javascript function

267197
hide	show
also is that the best way to hide show a asp.net control from a javascript function

267216
hide	show
you want to set the display style property to none to hide or null to show

267220
linux	unix
traditionaly with unix systems like linux you d have an mta a mail transfer agent on the computer that deals with sending e-mail

267231
constructor	object
i can only think of four places where an abstract object s type is unambiguous in the constructor in the destructor when declared locally and within the same scope as a dynamic allocation

267231
derived-class	base-class
other than those points the object being accessed through a base-class pointers could be pointing to a derived-class and the current translation unit has no way of knowing so static binding is not possible

267231
derived-class	base-class
the function could be called with a pointers to the base-class in one instance and a pointers to a derived-class in another

267237
protected	public
i ve got several methods that are protected or private for good and valid reasons these private protected methods are moderately complex and the public methods in the class depend upon these protected private methods functioning correctly therefore i need a way to test the protected private methods

267245
hide	show
you can t hide show the asp.net version of the control as that only exists in a server context

267246
linkbutton	onclick
however you run that bit of javascript a postback will happen and the onclick event will fire on the server just as if you d clicked the linkbutton

267253
code-coverage	ncover
here s a tutorial on how to tell team build to fail a build when ncover reports code-coverage below a minimum threshold

267261
administration	account
if i need to run something under the limited account but with administration privileges i use a makemeadmin renamed and tuned as consolemeadmin .bat scripting that creates an administration console session

267261
administration	account
if i really need to be an administration in order to do install and do first-time-runs so my security software can conditional itself to allow network access to the new code or not etc. i will elevate my limited user account to administration long enough to get all of that done then restart the account as limited user again

267261
administration	account
because i only have a small workgroup lan with no active-directory the only useful account types are administration and limited user on xp

267269
textbox	onblur
to give an example you can use this function to get reference to postback event of button click and add it to onblur of a textbox

267269
textbox	button
this would simulate the button click whenever the textbox looses the focus

267275
click	mouse
so looking at an image i want to click the mouse and have a 200 image windows show up where the mouse is

267275

nmake	scons
i state nmake but really it s any build system scons bakefile nmake ant vcproj

267307
svnadmin	dump
changing the source repository structure during a dump load is hazardous but doable through a combinations of svnadmin dump svndumpfilter hand-editing or additional text filtering and svnadmin load

267307
svnadmin	dump
request svnadmin dump files for each of your repositories

267312
dictionary	hashmap
what is the difference between a hashmap and dictionary adt

267318
logout	login
i m currently using an application to register my service thinking that would be more straight forward - eventually i d like to create a .service however even after a logout login my service still doesn t appear in the list of services in the menu

267328
revision	updates
updates your working copy of repository a to revision 2 and perform steps 3 and 4 and repeat with each successive revision until you reach the head

267333
dictionary	hashmap
in java the hashmap implements the map interface while the dictionary does not

267333
dictionary	hashmap
that is they both do a similar function so you are right that they seem very similar...a hashmap is a type of dictionary

267360
assign	add
just assign a degrafa programmatic skin to the border of your canvas and you can add all sorts of funky gradients paths shapes whatever

267371
linux	osx
hint osx and linux are not the same as windows

267371
linux	unix
to get to a point where a single key-stroke can be read and the program terminated cleanly you have to do a good deal of work on unix osx linux

267392
foundation	cocoa
first you don t really need to link to cocoa for this just linking to the foundation framework is okay

267397
firebird	oracle
i ve only worked with sql server oracle and interbase firebird

267408

alternatively you could modify the metaclass of your test object to make the private protected methods public just for that object

267412
boost	stl
as for stl as well as boost their goal is to provide portable and reasonably efficient data structure and algorithms

267424
web-services	security
one way i would solve your problem is to write some web-services that check security and does your crud via datasets etc but again it depends on the app and environment

267427
python	c++
this is the python equivalent of what i would like to have in c++

267434
quicksort	timsort
with quicksort and timsort directly available there s no reason to write a sort

267437
keyboard	mouse
here s a ms kb article about a mouse hook in c# which appears to be expanded to a keyboard hook in this article

267469
malloc	free
you could use the macros preprocessor to redefine malloc and free to use the mem package ones but i recommend against it because it won t redirect library calls to malloc like what strdup does

267471
display	width
you could format all numbers as n-character strings with spaces and then display them in a fixed width font

267479
response	timeout
the timeout counter is reset when you get a valid response

267486
tokenize	parsing
if your tokenize needs are more complex check out my open source cocoa string tokenizing parsing toolkit parsekit

267493
radix-sort	quicksort
the field of theoretical programming is the one that gave us quicksort radix-sort djikstra s algorithm and many other things absolutely necessary to the advance of computing

267526
value	field
i prefer null unless the field is not nullable then i prefer zero unless zero is a valid limit then i prefer -1 unless -1 is a valid value in which case you need another field say a bit field to signify unlimited

267561
constructor	object
these are never called during normal operation but would be used in the case where the constructor for an object being constructed with placement new throws an exception

267563
value	field
this is a trivial example i m using pretty much identical code to extract tags and optional value from a database field the only major difference is the regular expression

267580
32-bit	64bit
if the caller is 32-bit and not 64bit or set to msil programfiles will resolve to c program files x86

267589
value	field
in our new product we have a few data entry fields that require you to search for the correct value to place in this field

267589
value	field
when you enter this data entry field i would like to provide a search option via something on the view perhaps an ajax implementation and have it allow searching of the database for the value but when the result returns i want to keep the existing values in place for other fields not affected by the search

267594
constructor	object
object created using convenience constructor nsstring s stringwithstring are considered autoreleased

267594
constructor	object
the 2nd bullet says if you use a convenience constructor and you need the object to hang around as with an image to be drawn later you need to retain and then later release it

267650
oracle	mysql
mssql oracle mysql

267654
vb.net	vb6
they re for vb6 but they should be easy to translate to vb.net

then load up the document and let the macros run

267656
radio-button	button
went into the security settings office button file word options trust center trust center settings macros settings and clicked the disable all macros with notification radio-button which will prevent macros from running unless you click the button to allow them to run

267656
macros	vba
opened the .docm document and the macro didn t run but i was able to go to the view tab on the ribbon control and click the macros button and view macros and then edit the macro to open a vba ide to see the macro code

267669
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
but please investigate sql-injection before implementing dynamic-sql

267680
python	java
if you really wanted to use python you could use jython to interface to java and do it that way

267680
groovy	java
alternatively you could just write the plugin in java or another scripting language for the jvm like groovy

267682
32-bit	64bit
the exception-handling to this are functions returning types larger than 32-bit specifically 64bit integers long long double s and struct or classes

267716
panels	grid
if you re really masochistic and or have lots of free time you can even have multiple fisheye panels on the same grid allowing you to compare one or more regions of the grid simultaneously

267724
constructor	private
the parameterless constructor can be private or internal

267727
constructor	private
you can make your constructor private or internal if you want just so long as its parameterless

267733
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql you use the trunc function but i m not seeing it for mysql

267734
constructor	private
i think there is a workaround to make constructor private

267740
keyboard	mouse
oh yeah one last thing in addition to the pound it as fast hard as you can tests have the ability to do exactly what a real user who was perhaps deranged or a baby bounding the keyboard mouse would do. that is if you re doing random user-events

267754
textbox	button
my requirement is to type rough address info with no comma separators into a simple textbox press a find button wait a few seconds and then observe a result picklist

267756
instances	private
private read writable for any instances of the class

267758
slimdx	xna
slimdx since managed directx 1.0 is out of the question where as 2.0 never leaves the beta and later replace with xna which has quite different from directx itself and require you to install xna game studio

267769
reflection	runtime
and all of these are compile time protections they can be readily overridden through reflection at runtime

267823
document	editing
is there anyone who makes use of the microsoft open xml sdk 2.0 for editing excel spreadsheet i edited open xml document already by only using xml methods but as there exists the sdk does someone know if there are really easy methods for some essential functions

267837
python	c++
use the simplest tool that solves the problem in my current environment that s bash - grep - awk - python - c++

267840
windows-xp	windows

267852
text-editor	editor
â text-editor â c# â advanced â underline errors in the editor

267857
freebsd	aix
alternatively you can use lsof - available for linux aix freebsd and netbsd according to man lsof

267859
unique	words
except that if you add a unique index it doesn t need to be the primary key to words then it ll only need to lock the relevant pages

267862
python	java
please also relate this to something i would understand from the worlds of python java c# or c development

267875
python	c++
a write the critical pieces of the code as c or c++ libraries and then use sip or swig to expose the c c++ apis to python namespace

267885
contains	elements
the code is trying to store n bits by an arrays where each elements of the arrays contains bitsperword 32-bit

267888
pyopengl	pyglet
you can use opengl from python either with pyopengl or pyglet

267893
keyboard	mouse
i love being able to step through javascripting code using firebug s scripting panel but it looks like i m limited to either using the default keyboard shortcuts for stepping over into out of code or using the mouse to click the appropriate button

267904
constructor	object
update if you really want to know binaryformatter et al use formatterservices.getuninitializedobject to create the object without invoking the constructor

267904
constructor	object
constructor are run the object might

267913
type-safety	generics
i inserted the workaround for the mentioned javac bug. but this does not enhance type-safety or anything so in this case it is probably better to use the more understandable non generics method and live with a suppresswarnings unchecked

267926
apache-poi	jxls
one library is jxls which internally uses the already mentioned apache-poi

267929
logout	login
to logout the session value is deleted and the client redirected to the login page

267933
project-management	project
for project-management bug tracking git or subversion repository i also use unfuddle free for small personal project

267935
any	set
for sql-server 2000 and any other 32-bit edition of sql-server there is xp_pcre which introduces perl compatible regular expressions as a set of extended stored-procedures

267962
font-size	display
i have some text display in a larger font-size than what it is supposed to

267992
configuration	environment
the site module provides a space for site-specific configuration hooks you can use it to tailor your environment

267995
having	select
where they shouldn t be used is when each option doesn t nicely fit a sequence or the user can t guess straight away what option to select - when selecting different states which will usually require the user having to select the dropdown and reading through each option before they can determine what to put in

268001
selected	button
radio button are quicker and easier to use because you can immediately see all options without interaction and you can selected you choice using a single click

268014
postgresql	mysql
i d go for at least one of oracle ibm db2 ms sql server mysql postgresql all of which have free versions that you can use to start the learning process

268021
radio-button	selected
and while radio-button allow you to easly see aviable options drop-down list allow you to easly see what is selected

268024
bug-tracking	trac
trac for bug-tracking

268030
webforms	asp.net
webforms winforms is an example of the n-tier architecture while asp.net mvc is an example of mvc in the microsoft space

268036
controller	routes
if you put this in a controller action - say show on a picture controller then all you need do is include the following in your view assuming restful routes

268037
archive	corrupt
but the archive is corrupt

268039
bug-tracking	trac
are you maybe even using an entirely different bug-tracking system that offers all of trac s functionality plus multi-project support

268040
bug-tracking	workitem
encompassing sourcegear-vault workitem bug-tracking and integration with cruisecontrol for build

268066
python	c++
regarding fruity loops you could write a vst plugin that can take an input from a scripting language vb python or whatever but in order to write such thing you would have to use delphi or c++

268093
contains	elements
this could be achieved without the third requirement if the sidebar is before the main content in the markup and is within the same contains elements a simple right float does the job

268093
positioning	sidebar
if the sidebar had a fixed height i could put a containing element before the main content float it right and give it a suitable width and height and then use absolute positioning to put the sidebar on top of the pre-made space

268099
required	checked
this would required a table mycombitations which lists all of the combinations you actually have and want to checked against the full list

268104
credentials	account
after setting up the delegate account on the server i set up the exchangeserverbinding using the credentials of the delegate account

268105
any	set
now i want to set all the players playedvisited to null for player whose nationality is england any idea on how to do this

268113
procedure	records
a sign of someone who has not fully grasped sql is the use of procedure and the like which operate by looping through records when set operations would be simpler and faster

268113
having	union
otoh i find a good sign is the appropriate use of union and having clauses - both a little outside the beginners statement set

268129
jndi	jmx
exposing the objects using jmx or jndi or using ejb3

268129
jndi	jmx
however we were unable to bind the jmx entities to the jndi tree so we couldn t lookup the objects from the web apps

268131
triggers	insert
so there is a v_emp view which just looks like a normal table you can insert and update into it fine when you do this though the triggers handle actually inserting the correct data into the base table

268150
arguments	default
what s happening from what i can see is that the ticks property is being incorrectly identified as a compulsory parameter because it belongs to the constructor with the least number of arguments even though all value types have a default parameter-less constructor

268152
administration	account
the item.subject comes out as administration if the administration account was used to book the resource

268176
iostream	boost
i would also suggest memory-mapped files but if you re going to use boost i think boost iostream mapped_file is a better match than boost interprocess

268181
positioning	sidebar
unfortunately absolute positioning will take the sidebar out of the flowing layout and the content of #content will not avoid #sidebar as you desire

268252
implements	abstract
but basically i think you should do what you intended that is end the loop or function not create a complex code path just to implements some abstract notion of correct code

268263
reflection	runtime
runtime reflection can make inheritance assumptions about sealed classes when looking for types

268266
class-members	base-class
because they can never be used as a base-class some run-time optimizations can make calling sealed class-members slightly faster.

268270
pixels	line
i need to make this editor display a rectangle of the dimensions by pixels of the tickets can even be actual size and have a resizable grid which can toggle between superimposition and invisibility on top of the ticket rectangle and represented by dots rather than line

268270
droppable	draggable
these fields should be selectable draggable and droppable in a snap to grid fashion

268279
hide	show
this is how i ve used them to show and hide applications

268320
javascript	dom
without using a webbrowser control how could i execute a javascript function that is decoupled from any browser dom dependencies in a c# application

268333
python	ruby
you can try pyobjc to write cocoa apps in python or macruby if you are interested in ruby

268335
fwrite	fread
how long does it take to write read using just big fwrite fread calls

268365
administration	host
windows scripting host wsh is a windows administration tool

268375
one-to-many	entity
i can do it using named sql queries but the probem is i have to use this entity in a one-to-many relation this entity is on the many side

268376
constructor	private
the other thing i should mention is that if you are using getinstance as a singleton you should have a private constructor to stop the possibility of additional caches being created using new inmemorygeocodingcache

268398
value	field
yes you can really trust .net to initialize field to their default value

268417
value	field
the initial value of a field whether it be a static field or an instance field is the default-value â 12.2 of the

268417
value	field
it is not possible to observe the value of a field before this default initialization has occurred

268448
put	get
usually if you don t put settings in registry you use it mostly to get current windows settings change file associations etc

268450
build-process	nant
in all of my other .net apps my build-process a mixture of nant and custom tasks automatically updates the assemblyversionattribute assemblyinfo.cs with the current build number before the call to msbuild stamping in the build number in the version number

268450
updating	updates
the problem comes when i updates the versioning numbers as updating them even from within visual-studio does not updates the pipeline components references to the schema

268462
space	input
white list input validate input so that it can only contain a-za-z0-9 w alpha numerics and white space bad if you need to support unicode chars

268472
protected	public
i don t think there are any public protected methods that would let you get at this directly

268490
javascript	dom
i m refactoring some old javascript code and there s a lot of dom manipulation going on

268507
constructor	object
simply supplying the html of elements you want to add to a jquery constructor will return a jquery object from newly built html suitable for being appended into the dom using jquery s append method

268507
createelement	classname
this gives you the ability to specify any arbitrary html you like including class names or other attributes which you might find more concise than using createelement and then setting attributes like cellspacing and classname via javascript

268526
firefox	opera
all pages are working fine in ie7 firefox 3 safari and opera

268536
ref	out
the alternative is to use out ref parameters letting the caller decide whether or not to keep the value together - but i prefer the keyvaluepair approach when there s an obvious relationship and the caller is likely to want to keep them combined

268541
click	mouse
minimizing mouse click is always a good idea

268588
textbox	button
i m trying to get a specific asp button onclick event to fire when i press the enter key in a specific asp textbox control

268614
buffering	streaming
using getline may be inefficient because the string buffering may need to be re-sized several times as data is append to it from the streaming buffering

268659
quicksort	heapsort
in turn that always meant that vbscript scripters were forced to write their own sort routines be that a bubble sort routine a heapsort a quicksort or some other type of sorting algorithm

268673
scriptmanager	updatepanel
then put a scriptmanager on your page and wrap your ddl in an updatepanel

268674
selected	listbox
the user could click on the representation of the object in the listbox but it could also be that an object is selected via code

268674
selected	listbox
if the user selects an object via the listbox i cast the the selected item to an iselectable and set the selected property to true

268674
selected	listbox
my problem is that when i select the object using code i can t get listbox to change the selected item

268674
selected	listbox
but the listbox has the last object the user clicked as the selecteditem which means that item can t be clicked without first selected another object in the list

268674
keyboard	mouse
i pretty sure i can accomplish what i want by writing some custom code to handle the mouse and keyboard events but i rather not

268700
duplicates	contains
set â a collection that cannot contains duplicates elements

268700
duplicates	contains
lists can contains duplicates elements

268706
facebook-page	facebook
i m currently developing a facebook application which will eventually end up on a facebook-page

268767
revision	svn
this needs to fetch at least one new revision from svn

268781
spaces	output
these could operate in image spaces where you render the model into a texture assigning unique color for each logical polygon and then do a postprocessing pass using pixel shader and detect any changes in color color changes output black otherwise output something else

268803
return-value	arguments
i think you should use a ilgenerator.emitcalli and you should pass a type of return-value i think null in this case and pass the types of arguments - i think new type typeof eventargs

268824
web-services	api
we re working now on the design of a new api for our product which will be exposed via web-services

268838
sequences	unique
you can create a unique id db generated - sequences autoinc etc for the table that references items and create two additional columns tblsystemitemsfk and tblclientitemsfk where you reference the system items and client items respectively - some databases allows you to have a foreign key that is nullable

268850
implements	abstract
going down the line we get the distinction between ford and toyota probably implements as difference in the type of emblem on the car again probably an abstract class.

268882
json	xml
fetch data via ajax calls i find easier to use json so you don t have to reformat xml it s only data

268891
dictionary	arrays
i ve got this python dictionary mydict containing arrays here s what it looks like

268900
ref	out
we don t actually need them any more then we need abstract on classes or both out and ref

268902
internet-explorer	firefox
this works ok in internet-explorer but firefox always opens a new tab windows

268906
click	mouse
i am trying to figure out how a library works and i would like to be able to visualize which methods and lines of code are executed in response to user input a keypress or mouse click

268909
value	field
initiates the class field to their default value numerics to 0 boolean to false objects to null

268955
silverlight	wpf
i ve been able to find xaml object mapping specification wpf xaml vocabulary specification and silverlight xaml vocabulary specification documents online but no wf xaml vocabulary specification document for windows workflows

268959
constructor	object
if the constructor argument is not a string literal i assume it calls the argument object s .tostring method

268961
detailsview	formview
the data component like formview and detailsview are so generic-looking that it s ridiculous

268972
ref	out
this follows a very similar pattern to requiring the out or ref keyword at both the calling site and the declaration site

268981
sql-server	oracle
first off if you re connecting to a non-generic database sql-server oracle etc. try using a database connection that s specific to it

268982
constructor	object
everywhere i use the linq datacontext i use a using statement and pass in a result of a function which returns a sqlconnection object which has been opened and had an sqlcommand executed using it before returning to the datacontext constructor

268985
directory	folder
it is insecure unless perhaps you ask the user to point to the wanted directory with a folder browse dialog if we remain in the above logic.

268994
attributes	properties
attributes on the element for each properties when they are a reasonable length

268994
xsd	xml
if you write a sample version of the xml file in visual-studio there s a toolbar button to click which will have it automatically create a xsd schema for that file

268994
xsd	xml
add a targetnamespace attribute to the xsd and copy it to c program files microsoft visual-studio 8 common7 packages schemas xml varying slightly by vs release

268996
constructor	object
if you give an already-open sqlconnection object to the datacontext constructor it will not close it for you

269008
value	field
one idea you could explore is instead of storing each field in a name value pair table you could store the data as a blob either text or binary

269009
webserver	nginx
i ve been researching modules for nginx my preferred webserver to serve a lisp webapp but i haven t been able to find anything

269015
firefox	opera
neither firefox nor opera at least provide this info

269015
hidden-field	input-field
actually i know some people needed this info for some reasons so they used javascript to pick up the path from the file input-field and put it in an hidden-field

269023
selected	listbox
when a visual element button listbox etc is selected on a form and the property panel is displayed vs will bold the values of properties which are set to something besides the value given in defaultvalue

269098
registration	login
just make sure that the folder containing the login form registration form etc all the content that anonymous users can get to and yes login needs that as they are anonymous until they have actually logged in is set to allow anonymous users

269113
contains	elements
admitted it would be kind of confusing and misleading to have the propertychanged fire on the collection when the property that actually changed is on a contains elements but it would fit my specific purpose

269113
contains	elements
kp noted that the event was fired with the collection as sender and not with the elements when the a contains elements changes

269117
swing	swt
swt is more simple to use than swing especially if this is your first ui

269117
swing	swt
swing is available anywhere swt is not

269134
order	join
for these purposes i ll use the following definition makes effective use of indexes and join in a sensible order which is probably as good as any

269134
sql-server	oracle
wrapping it up in a function would allow a function-based index where the result of a calculation is materialised in the index oracle supports this and you can get equivalent functionality in sql-server by using the sort of tricks discussed in this article

269138
swing	swt
you might want to use the swing control with the awt swt bridge

269142
unsigned	short
did you try to use ushort unsigned short

269148
baud-rate	parity
in addition to the baud-rate you may also need to set other options like character_size flow_control parity and stop_bits

269152
unsigned	short
the value of ffff for a short is -1 but the value of ffff for an unsigned short is 65536

269152
unsigned	short
in this case you should make sure you are using an unsigned short if you are sure that all of your values will be positive

269159
formatting	import
it is perfectly acceptable to have a two-step process in which you clean the formatting before you import the data

269173
modal-dialog	blockui
blockui - awesome modal-dialog

269180
error-code	hresult
i think we inherited our exception-handling classes from comexception-handling and set the correct error-code which should be translation as hresult in unmanaged code

269181
managed-code	unmanaged
how can i get an error message that pinpoints the specific unmanaged file that failed to load when p invoking from managed-code

269184
meta-inf	jar
for this to work driver jar files must include the file meta-inf services java.sql.driver

269193
selected	listbox
the issue is that when changing the selected item from the gui it s changing the position in the bindinglist and then the bindinglist signals the other listbox to change its selected item

269193
selected	listbox
so i ve got the two listbox selected item also synchronized which is not good for me

269207
implements	extends
i have implements a sax parsing in java by extends the default handler

269209
meta-inf	jar
arguably jdbc driver jar files should be able to specify protocol name and driver class within their manifest or elsewhere under meta-inf

269215
keyevent	keydown
i allmost allways use keydown because then i can use e.handled true and stop the keyevent to travel from textbox to containers and down in the eventque if i want

269223
contains	any
if the header were to contains only the public interface theoretically any change in class implementation would not have necessitated a recompile for the rest of the program

269235
mapper	dozer
if the goal is to translation the axis generated to your business-objects you can try a tool like dozer that is a mapper to copy from an object implementation to another implementation

269240
xsd	xml
actually xml is self-documenting when used with a dtd or an xsd and that is one of its advantages when compared to plain-text files

269240
xsd	xml
i found the xml tutorial and xsd tutorial at w3schools.com to be helpful

269241
defined	declare
i don t want to declare copy assignment and construction protected and to defined them and to maintain in-sync with changes unless i have some special thing to perform

269251
private-members	object
if the private-members are not given in it then you would not know how large an object to new

269253
authentication	login
is there a way to restrict a specific sql 2005 login on a microsoft sql-server 2005 standard version sql is in mixed mode to specific ip addresses while other login windows authentication ones are unaffected

269262
bison	yacc
it s a yacc bison like implementation for c#

269268
multiplication	addition
my main concern is how i would implements things like addition and multiplication

269269
jms	jta
you can have most j2ee features such as jta jpa jms jsf with no full stack j2ee server

269277
multiplication	addition
once you have the digits of the number in an arrays you can do addition and multiplication exactly as you would do them longhand

269285
object-reference	instances
nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an

269289
double	int
could be an int float double etc

269289
user-input	output
create your class from user-input and how to format it for output as well

269298
display	width
i have a list of items that i am display in a floated list with each item in the list at a fixed width so that there s two per row

269299
multiplication	addition
if your target architecture supports bcd binary coded decimal representation of numbers you can get some hardware support for the longhand multiplication addition that you need to do

269314
solaris	linux
on linux or solaris is there a better way than hand parsing proc self maps repeatedly to figure out whether or not you can read write or execute whatever is stored at one or more addresses in memory

269314
ptrace	mmap
furthermore is there any way to know when those permissions change when someone uses mmap on a file behind my back other than doing something terribly invasive and using ptrace on all threads in the process and intercepting any attempt to make a syscall that could affect the memory map

269315
copy-constructor	data-members
i can put in my root base class or i can create a small interface class with no data-members and perform multiple inheritance the protected copy-constructor that here is empty

269324
any	set
instead of worrying about adding your objects to a duplicate-less list add them to a set any implementation which will by nature filtering out the duplicates

269324
duplicates	contains
i think that the solution you posted with the noduplicateslist has some issues mostly with the contains methods plus your class does not handle checking for duplicates in the collection passed to your addall methods

269326
hosts-file	hosts
i ve got 1 2 working by editing the windows hosts and adding a virtual directory in xampp s apache conf extra httpd-vhosts.conf file

269341
sql-server	mysql
classes from the system.data namespace rather than the sql-server specific classes sqlconnection sqlcommand from system.data.sqlclient or the corresponding mysql specific classes

269347
iteration	elements
first of all use generics and get assign each elements for the iteration to a statically typed local

269357
code-coverage	ncover
you could use a code-coverage tool like ncover even without any unit-testing frameworks

269366
administration	account
i made the account an administration temporary and apache 2.0 starts fine

269384
contains	set
i want a large panels that will contains a list of other panelss boxes which each then contains a set of text fields

269406
show	next
the document should be show next to the image

269417
perl	php
i ve used ruby and php a reasonable amount in the past but wonder whether i might be better off going with python or even perl

269430
perl	php
the only thing i can really comment on is this php is bascially a dsl for the web whereas the other three perl ruby python are more general-purpose languages that have no specific domain although all are definitely web-capable

269434
python	c++
edit you can implement the number-crunching part in c or c++ and make it a module to use in your python code

269463
adplus	dump
you could also use adplus to get a dump of the process and then use that dump in windbg to help tracking down the problem

269491
put	get
i m trying to get data from a sharepoint list and put it into some flex graphs

269496
inherited	subclass
inherited extend the functionality of a class by creating a subclass

269496
subclassing	superclass
override superclass members in the subclassing to provide new functionality

269496
subclassing	superclass
make methods abstract virtual to force subclassing to fill-in-the-blanks when the superclass wants a particular interface but is agnostic about its implementation

269499
any	set
i can t seem to find any trace of the cookie using request.cookies.allkeys there must be a reason why because when i check to see what the details of the cookie are it is still there and the path is set to which means i should be able to access it

269520
shell	bash
closed as duplicate of how can i run cygwin bash shell from within emacs

269523
entity-framework	ado.net
removed dead imageshack link - ado.net entity-framework hierarchical page class

269525
getter	setter
if a property is of type or address you can make it dirty without calling the setter methods calls only the getter methods

269540
windows-server	windows
signtool is available as part of the windows sdk which you can download as part of the windows sdk for windows-server 2008 and .net 3.5

269541
order	join
i m trying to build a hql that can left join values from a collection in order to give me the chance of checking is null on it

269543
python	perl
i m currently using it for c inform python perl html and vb.net with surprisingly few issues when shifting gears

269553
inherited	subclass
when a subclass inherited from a subclass it typically inherited both the implementation and the interface

269570
triggers	insert
i am told by someone that when calling oracle from ado.net when calling multiple inserts in a loop where each insert causes a triggers to fire that includes within it s pl-sql a commit statement that it is impossible to stop that commit from actually commiting the transaction

269571
shell	bash
you ll find the sh-syntax shell sh bash ksh etc are more consistent and much easier to debug

269588
perl	ruby
and python ruby perl for everything else like the web parts

269588
perl	php
php seems to really shine on the web and for web related things but once you need non web uses it seems to be more cumbersome than anything although i have seen references to php being used like a perl python etc

269588
perl	ruby
the choice between python ruby perl is almost a matter of taste

269588
perl	ruby
except that perl has cpan which is beyond anything python and ruby have right now

269588
python	perl
personally i like python over perl i find perl s object system to be ugly when building your own objects and sometimes it takes me a bit to figure out how code i wrote months ago works

269588
perl	ruby
i should also add that perl and python i m not sure about ruby but i think that to can call c code rather easily

269588
perl	c++
you could also try writing the whole thing in perl python ruby and if it is too slow rewriting that part in c or c++ and calling it from the scripting language

269600
derived-class	inherited
basically i agree with other folks use inherited only if your derived-class truly is the type you re extending not merely because it contains the same data

269600
inherited	subclass
remember that inherited means the subclass gains the methods as well as the data

269611
any	set
there has really been no code changes and no where in the application is the datasourceid ever set on any of the gridview

269614
low-level	hardware
this is extremely useful for applications which need to work with low-level data-structures like custom file formats hardware control data-structures and the like

269619
hide	show
and furthermore why do you load a second page when all you seem to want to do is to show hide content dynamically

269627
.net	wcf
the thing to remember is that .net 3.5 is a set of additional libraries on top of .net 2.0 so unless you are planning on taking advantage of any additional features provided by .net 3.5 or .net 3.0 like linq or wcf the code would be identical

269627
base-class	inherited
try looking at the documentation for servicebase which is the base-class that you will need to inherited to get things started

269630
perl	ruby
all three of ruby python and perl are good for quick development prototypes and web apps

269630
python	ruby
i don t know much about the ai library options for python or ruby

269630
perl	ruby
my recommendation is to take a day or two and do some serious research on the libraries for each of perl python and ruby

269632
contains	set
would i set an event listener for the img or the contains span

269652
order	add
i would like to add client logging capability that qa could later use to playback client events in order to analyze bugs or other workflow the client used in production

269682
shell	bash
see question how can i run cygwin bash shell from within emacs

269700
superclass	subclass
just switching from a superclass to an interface means changing nearly every subclass in the system

269712
value	field
underneath the covers through code sharepoint allows us to modify the field as well as value in the field and site list content types

269714
graphics2d	java-2d
from spritegraphics2d javadoc spritegraphics2d is a swf specific implementation of java-2d s graphics2d api

269719
hide	show
allain is correct it is better to operate only on the parent then use css selectors to show or hide the children flip + - images etc

269749
getlasterror	createfile
what is the value of getlasterror after the call to createfile

269750
linux	unix
i have found some references that the tab-completion feature in mysql client works only on unix linux

269762
32-bit	64bit
mov itself regardless of whether it is 64bit or 32-bit has a latency of 0.5 and a throughput of 0.5 according to intel s specs

269762
32-bit	64bit
that means unless the memory bandwidth becomes the limiting factors 64bit mov s are equally fast to 32-bit mov s and since it takes only half as many mov s to move the same amount of data from a to b when using 64bit the throughput can in theory be twice as high the fact that it s not is probably because memory is not unlimited fast

269782
selected	textbox
now i can select the first textbox on both th instances of my usercontrol but the second txtdatabase textbox cannot be selected neither by tabbing or clicking

269801
shutdown	restart
this is more work than my other solution but is theorectically a better one since as part of your restart your jar may want to do other things as well clean restart other resources log the fact that it s being shutdown stuff like that

269802
web-applications	webserver
is there a way to run a project inside a solution that has more one project read web-applications and avoid the autostart feature of the integrated asp.net webserver in visual-studio

269802
web-applications	webserver
i have a big solution that has windows forms projects windows services projects web-applications windows libraries etc. sometimes i just want to debug the desktop application but each web application project starts a webserver and that slows down the execution process when starting the application of course and i would like those webserver to be disabled since im not using debuging those projects but some other developers in my team are

269811
constructor	object
if there s no way for you to pass the referred-to object into the constructor or there s a possibility that you need it to not refer to an object then use a pointer instead of a reference

269821
bug-tracking	workitem
obviously a big advantage your organization would have is if they also moved the bug-tracking system over to tfs then when you check in the files you could associate that check-in with the workitem bug task etc and the associations would be taken care of for you

269835
linked-list	tree
in the same vein you don t need to learn how a linked-list or binary tree works in order to maintain a list of names and search them

269845
constructor	object
error creating context spring.root error creating object with name theclientobject defined in file c test testapp bin debugging my.config.xml unsatisfied dependency expressed through constructor argument with index 0 of type testclasslibrary.targetobject could not convert constructor argument value thetargetobject to required type testclasslibrary.targetobject cannot convert property value of type system.string to required type testclasslibrary.targetobject for property

269847
constructor	private
of course if you go through the trouble of having a private anyway you might as well put it in the constructor

269852
any	set
you can set up any number of database connections under the database references node in the solution explorer and choose the one you want to run your query against

269878
order	add
in order to use the system.security.cryptography.protecteddata class you must add a reference to system.security to your project

269878
click	mouse
right mouse click on the references folder choose add reference... find system.security on the .net tab

269913
python	lua
will lua get so popular that there will soon be enough libraries to be able to use it like python ruby or something similar

269934
python	ruby
i like ruby and python and other more full-featured scripting languages but they re not nearly as convenient for embedding in small applications to give users more options for customizing their environments

269946
simple-form	erb
i m constructing a simple-form in erb but the html produced by the text_field tag makes the for attributes in the label tag invalid

269969
rewrite	rule
turns out i had a bad apache rewrite rule

269986
put	get
i need to from within vbscript get the latest version of all files in a set of folders and put them into a local directory so that other operations can be performed on them

269989
contains	set
one set contains values like these

269989
contains	set
the other set contains values like these

269989
any	set
a match is made when any string in set 1 begins with a string in set 2

269996
libpng	zlib
i ve incorporated libpng and zlib into my c software for a microcontroller project due to their nicely liberal license which permits such use without requiring me to disclose any of my code it s very similar to bsd mit apache but with no attribution requirement

269996
lgpl	gpl
the jpeg code i ve found is either gpl lgpl or not c

270000
contains	set
more specifically for scrolling wxscrolledwindow should help use wxscrolledwindow- setsizer with your top level sizer the one that contains your controls to set up a scrolled area also check out the samples called scroll scrollsub and vscroll include in wxwidgets in the samples directory of your wxwidgets install

270009
put	get
the closest you can get is to put a delegate on a queue for the other thread to execute but that assumes that the other thread is cooperating about this

270029
constructor	private
an alternative way is to make the constructor private and add a static method like this

270034
constructor	object
yes typically a constructor is something quick it is designed to prepare the object for use not to actually do operations

270046
any	set
for now i really need the simplicity of re-using the metadata set for the amf3 serialization which we are using in any case remoteclass transient

270080
binary-search-tree	linked-list
what are the main differences between a linked-list and a binary-search-tree

270090
binary-search-tree	tree
in computer science a binary-search-tree bst is a binary tree data structure which has the following properties

270090
data-structures	linked-list
in computer science a linked-list is one of the fundamental data-structures and can be used to implement other data-structures

270090
linked-list	tree
so a binary search tree is an abstract concept that may be implemented with a linked-list or an arrays

270092
linked-list	tree
notice that a linked-list can be thought of as a degenerated binary tree a tree where all nodes only have one child

270094
binary-search-tree	tree
in a binary tree each node can have 0 1 or 2 subnodes where in case of a binary-search-tree the key of the left node is lesser than the key of the node and the key of the right node is more than the node

270094
linked-list	tree
as long as the tree is balanced the searchpath to each item is a lot shorter than that in a linked-list

270095
linked-list	tree
a binary search tree can be implemented in any fashion it doesn t need to use a linked-list

270095
linked-list	nodes
a linked-list is simply a structure which contains nodess and pointers references to other nodess inside a nodes

270095
linked-list	nodes
given the head nodes of a list you may browse to any other nodes in a linked-list

270095
binary-search-tree	tree
a binary-search-tree is a tree that splits up its input into two roughly-equal halves based on a binary search comparison algorithm

270095
linked-list	tree
linked-list from wikipedia and binary search tree also from wikipedia

270096
binary-tree	nodes
a binary-tree is a special case in which each nodes has only two children

270096
linked-list	tree
thus in a linked-list each node has a previous node and a next node and in a binary tree a node has a left child right child and parent

270097
c++	lua
it is very easy to add the lua interpreter to a program of your own one written in c c++ or objective-c and with just a few lines of code you can give lua access to any system resource you can think of

270098
binary-search-tree	nodes
a binary-search-tree is different in 2 ways the binary part means that each nodes has 2 children not one and the search part means that those children are arranged to speed up searches - only smaller items to the left and only larger ones to the right

270099
linked-list	nodes
linked-list is straight linear data with adjacent nodes connected with each other a- b- c

270099
children	tree
you can use bst to represent a data such as family tree but that ll become n-ary search tree as there can be more than two children to each person

270104
linked-list	nodes
to avoid the need to scan the whole list you need additional references to nodes within the list in which case it s no longer a simple linked-list

270104
linked-list	tree
this provides something akin to a linked-list but with extra references to allow search performance comparable to a binary tree

270106
variables	boolean
have an additional boolean variables m_formunderconstruction which you test for before constructing the form and which you set as soon as you ve decided to construct it

270107
linked-list	nodes
a linked-list is a sequential number of nodes linked to each other ie

270107
binary-search-tree	nodes
a binary-search-tree uses a similar nodes structure but instead of linking to the next nodes it links to two child nodess

270107
linked-list	tree
it is important to note that if you insert sorted data into a bst you ll end up with a linked-list and you lose the advantage of using a tree

270116
binary-search-tree	tree
a binary-search-tree is a binary tree in which each internal node x stores an element such that the element stored in the left subtree of x are less than or equal to x and elements stored in the right subtree of x are greater than or equal to x

270116
linked-list	nodes
now a linked-list consists of a sequence of nodes each containing arbitrary values and one or two references pointing to the next and or previous nodes

270133
subtract	add
yes you d always have to add one though you may be able to add one to the end date or subtract one from the start date to also get this effect

270154
for-loop	loops
just create a simple for-loops count from 1 to 1000 and read the file inside the loops over and over but do not create and destroy the objects inside the loops just focus on the reading part

270156
instances	private
the problem as much as there is one is that class declarations in c++ have to define everything public and private that an instances needs to have in order to work

270160
arguments	default
the int is coming from the fact that ctypedptrmap has a constructor that takes an int arguments that is default to 10

270177
fadeout	fadein
i have a bunch of images that need to rotate in and out one at a time every 2 seconds with fancy jquery fadein and fadeout

270188
filtering	grouping
the results need to be filtering ranked sorted grouping and the results merged from all the shards

270221
testdriven.net	gallio
testdriven.net cannot load or run or allow vs2008 to open test projects and gallio does not run within the vs2008 ide although i appreciate the suggestions greatly

270235
mstest	nunit
testdriven.net can run nunit xunit.net and mstest

270235
mbunit	nunit
supports multiple unit-testing frameworks including nunit mbunit and ms team system

270248
testdriven.net	gallio
try gallio as explained best in this blog post by richard dingwall and for visual-studio support use testdriven.net to runs it

270248
mstest	nunit
at present gallio can run tests from mbunit versions 2 and 3 mstest nbehave nunit xunit.net and csunit

270248
msbuild	nant
gallio provides tool support and integration with ccnet msbuild nant ncover pex powershell resharper testdriven.net typemock and visual-studio team system

270258
multiplying	subtract
but before going into any algorithmic details about adding subtract multiplying let s find some data structure

270258
multiplication	division
you can also implements multiplication and division by using your plus and minus operators but that s very slow because that would recalculate results you already calculated in prior calls to plus and minus in each iteration

270258
ostream	std
then make your class useful by befriendig std ostream

270265
subtract	add
a better analogy would be we don t teach our kids to use calculators to add and subtract why teach programmers to use an ide to program

270266
constructor	object
conceptualy a constructor is a function mapping an object representation to the object it represents

270266
constructor	object
in either case this concept also means that all the cosntructor arguments and only the constructor argument should define the equals behavior of an object

270269
selected	listbox
this way when an item in the listbox is selected unselected the corresponding selected property will be updated

270269
selected	listbox
likewise setting the selected property in code will be reflected in the listbox

270286
bytearrayinputstream	fileinputstream
wherever they re using fileinputstream use bytearrayinputstream instead

270294
textbox	button
i have a panel that has a textbox and a button in it

270300
subtract	add
edit i have got a surprise discovery the add subtract and multiply operations for short s actually return int

270307
worksheet	excel
i don t have an immediate solution but a common problem in excel is files bloating because one some all of the worksheet have saved all 64k rows instead of the ones being used

270317
global-asax	web-config
if you change the web-config early enough in the load cycle global-asax events the site may never load or fail in unpredictable ways

270329
visio	dia
i was just wondering how many experienced programers out there actually map out their process or algorithms in a program like ms visio or gnome dia

270333
account	userid
it still generates a 403.7 forbidden ssl client certificate is required. i suspect that the reason is that the subject field of the client cert does not match the userid of the account running ie thus perhaps not sending a mismatching client cert

270354
pointers	stack
all that is on stack is a pointers to this object

270370
push	pull
if you want to ensure that every changelist gets reviewed after checkin then you could see if code collaborator will play nicely with your source control system and automatically make a review task after each checkin push or pull

270374
any	set
the methods that the timer calls is internal so i don t think there s any way to set up your own timer to call it more often ignoring reflection

270381
attributes	properties
so regardless of whether your source range is hidden the destination will not need to have its visible properties explicitly set - the hidden attributes is ignored when copying

270398
directory	folder
for eclipse typically all you need to do is set up a folder somewhere within your source code directory

270398
directory	folder
for instance if the directory containing your source is src then you can create a src resources folder to place your images files in

270398
directory	folder
you can also place the image file within the same folder package as the class trying to access it if you wish example place the image.png in the com.mycompany package with the com.mycompany.foo class that needs to access it and call getresource image.png but i ve found it s easier to keep resources like images and other files in their own special directory outside of the class folders -- they re just easier to manage that way

270399
32-bit	16-bit
there s no language independent way to measure this except for the obvious fact that a 32-bit integer uses twice the memory of a 16-bit integer

270403
contains	set
the buuf icon set contains a subdirectory things weda with 15 weather icons in it

270409
contains	elements
the username and password sections of the binding file are not exported unless they have been configured so the simplest thing to do is configure a msmq send port with username and password manually and export the bindings - this forces the elements contains username and the masked password to be generated into the binding file

270424
binary-tree	nodes
however when adding elements to the structure rather than just append them to the end of the list the binary-tree is reorganized so that elements linked to the left nodes are less than the current nodes and elements linked to the right nodes are greater than the current nodes

270435
double	int
it used to be generally recommended best practice 1 to use pass by const ref for all types except for builtin types char int double etc. for iterators and for function objects lambdas classes deriving from

270435
constructor	object
for large object that implement proper move constructor such as vectors strings â the second case is then vastly more efficient than the first

270435
ref	out
in fact any modern compiler should be able to figure out when passing by value is expensive and implicitly convert the call to use a const ref if possible

270435
constructor	object
2 this is especially often true for object constructor which may take arguments and store them internally to be part of the constructed objectâ s state

270436
callback	methods
3 in the ready callback use a selector to grab the div you want to effect and call the corners methods

270443
google-chrome	safari
this thing does not work in safari google-chrome

270443
.when	ready
this will execute the inner function .when the page is loaded and is ready to be manipulated

270467
constructor	object
you are probably better off defining a copy constructor or a static factory method that explicitly clones the object according to your semantics

270469
pointers	stack
if that value has been optimized to be stored in a register then if you want to pass it be reference it first must be stored in memory and then a pointers to that memory placed on stack to perform the call

270494
textbox	button
i have a form with a textbox and a button

270494
google-chrome	firefox
ie is the only browser that will not submit the form when enter is pressed works in firefox opera safari google-chrome etc.

270499
duplicates	elements
what you really want to avoid is passing some gigantic class by value and having it all duplicates - this will make a huge difference if you re passing say a std vector with quite a few elements in it

270506
hosts-file	hosts
note that it is best to use an ip here as i ve described rather than a domain name because domains can be easily forged using a hosts

270523
deployment	migrating
we have started migrating that to .net for some months we have to deploy it it will easier if it is xcopy based deployment

270530
versioning	migrate
i do not know how to migrate from sourcesafe to tfs and keep the comments and versioning

270539
python	java
code in any popular programming language will do python c# java matlab etc.

270545
32-bit	x86
you can use the corflags cli tool for instance c program files microsoft sdks windows v7.0 bin corflags.exe to determine the status of an assembly based on its output and opening an assembly as a binary asset you should be able to determine where you need to seek to determine if the 32-bit flag is set to 1 x86 or 0 any cpu or x64 depending on pe

270545
32-bit	64bit
even better you can use module.getpekind to determine whether an assembly is portableexecutablekinds value pe32plus 64bit required32bit 32-bit and wow or ilonly any cpu along with other attributes

270556
logging	trace
that s how you get the most benefit out of it logging stack trace etc.

270561
value	field
i am trying to do something similiar but i am rubbish at sql - so how do you construct an sql statement that could potentially look at 2 columns place and postcode because you can t query both field for the same value e.g

270578
put	get
if i put in york and somewhere that happens to be a valid postcode i should get that result

270590
listbox	textbox
i have a web form that has multiple listbox textbox dropdowns

270594
deployment	install
ant for both build and deployment install

270598
environment	building
the building environment is running on x86 hardware but the application is being cross-compiling for another platform

270606
derived-class	base-class
the base-class default constructor will be called automatically in the same order that the base-classes are declared before any member of the derived-class is initialized

270610
cross-compiling	binutils
for example if you build gnu binutils for cross-compiling a cross-nm will be provided as well along with a cross-objdump

270614
32-bit	64bit
all else equal targeting 32-bit vs 64bit loads in half the time

270617
python	perl
but you will never get an official big distribution with batteries included like python or perl because it is just not the philosophy of the authors

270619
perl	php
lisp has been mentioned but i think scheme in particular plt-scheme is in some respects as good a choice as ruby python perl php

270629
ubuntu	linux
i have a windows xp machine and a linux machine running ubuntu

270629
keyboard	mouse
i share the keyboard mouse from the windows machine via synergy

270637
interop	regasm
it is possible to make com interop with .net assemblies work more like com dlls see the codebase option of regasm but by default .net assemblies are searched for in the usual way - ie in the gac or application directory - even when used via com interop

270638
contains	set
have each node contains a set that the string references are added to in passing or just keep a count

270640
compact-framework	.net
i d like my .net compact-framework app to delete itself after it finishes executing

270661
change-password	registration
the feature set isn t very large but it covers all the basic registration change-password and recover password

270665
floating	margins
if you want the logo to take spaces you are probably better of floating it left and then moving down the content using margins sort of like this

270670
binary	hex
the .net byte arrays contains no bom so i did some ghetto python that turns the utf16 into hex removes the first 4 characters then decodes it to binary

270721
itextsharp	itext
for microsoft we use itextsharp which is actually a c# port of the original java version of itext

270721
itextsharp	itext
you can use adobe acrobat to insert fields in the pdf address phone invoice number line item 1 line item 2 etc... and then use itext itextsharp to populate these fields at run time

270726
value	field
oracle seem to have a keywod called returning which can return a given column of the inserted row however that might require you to set the autoincrement field manually by invoking the next value in your sequence

270735
tcpdf	fpdf
i ve tried very hard to get fpdf tcpdf the r os pdf class and even codeigniter s recommendation to work but nothing with stable output for anything beyond the most basic bland html files

270736
web-hosting	hosting
if this doesn t solve your problem and the web-hosting can t fix things on their until the new year i d seriously consider switching hosting providers

270749
environment	building
however i would go for a solution that you can integrate nicely into the plattform you re building but i wouldn t go in a html- pdf solution since you won t have any clue about what would fit on a piece of paper regarding sizes in that kind of environment meaning you won t know when you should split the content into two separate templates

270754
xsd	xml
it allows you to create xsd s from xml doc s and then generate classes from the xsd that should be ripe for xml deserialization

270764
xsl-fo	xslt
you can also use apache fop if you prefer xslt and xsl-fo

270770
callback	methods
if it has a methods called invokerequired then in your callback test the boolean return value of this methods

270770
invokerequired	begininvoke
if it has invokerequired methods and it returns true then the active-x object will also expose a begininvoke methods

270778
gwt	dwr
we looked at some other packages - dwr gwt but either there was too much dependency on javascript or requser-interfacered user-interface components to be present in the java classes

270798
windows-xp	windows
the framework does not have to work with xbox360 - it only has to work with windows-xp and windows vista

270801
logging	trace
personally i want logging to find out what work has been done by my program and i want trace statements to verify the execution path and for figuring out what went wrong

270801
logging	trace
logging a message at the end of a method is kind of optional usually you will be interested in looking at the trace sort of like a stack trace

270810
double	int
i think the original poster is trying to create an object wrapper around simple types int double etc etc so constraining t to class would perhaps not work for what he wants

270835
actionscript	mxml
the regular way is to do it in your mxml file but i want to do it in my actionscript file

270863
metaphone	soundex
the hash strategy could be soundex metaphone or what have you

270867
webforms	asp.net
it allows you to use asp.net without using webforms

270875
any	set
any other solution will require an html interface to the database either by including the data inside the sharepoint webpages themselves or a custom set of pages

270880
contains	set
an instance of occurrence keeps the set of indices which contains a given string

270882
traffic	packets
in particular wireshark www.wireshark.org is great for getting a network traffic trace and it will highlight problems such as packets loss in its output

270890
macros	vba
you can use vba macros to do this.

270890
macros	vba
here is one vba macros that might be better if need lots of cases

270902
contains	set
i don t have the book with me to verify but the wikipedia page on suffix tree says that page 205 contains a solution for your problem finding the longest substrings common to at least k strings in a set

270903
httperf	jmeter
jmeter ab or httperf

270926
abstract-class	derived-class
if you do not give your interfaces abstract-class virtual destructors then every time you delete a derived-class instance via a base class handle your derived-class destructor will not be called

270944
.when	ready
3 .when a client wants a connection give them one of the ready ones making it active then immediately open a new one if there s now less than n ready but don t make the client wait for this to complete or you ll lose the advantage of pooling

270944
.when	ready
if none are ready .when the client wants one they will have to wait around while you create a new one

270944
.when	ready
4 .when the client finishes with an active connection return it to the ready state if there s less than m ready connections

270960
push	pull
the tests push and pull data through the mock facades only to test that the data successfully made it to the other side

270967
value	field
each successful call to mysql_fetch_row will return a mysql_row which you can use to access the individual field value

270967
value	field
since the field value are not nul-terminated you will need to add your own nul character when you make the copy if you want to use it as a string

270967
value	field
be aware that the field value may contains binary data so if you do treat it as a string functions that expect a c string will stop processing data if it encounters a nul-character in the data

270979
constructor	private
just don t forget to make the copy constructor and assignment operators private

270991
python	ruby
i do a lot of parallel-program dev so i ve found that using a simple wrapper in python ruby that allows me to have gdb attached to all processes on all nodes and communicating back to me is extraordinarily helpful i haven t found a better way if anyone knows of one not to hijack the thread though...

271015
procedure	records
but how to design the stored procedure to get records for the cnode which is a subtree which has 3 or more dynamic separate nodes in it for each record in addition to the normal anode and bnode

271029
versioning	upgrade
i would have upgraded but they only have upgrade pricing for versioning 4.5 and after

271043
jquery	.post
i m using jquery to .post a form to a php file simple script to verify user details

271044
any	set
so given the desire to mock a call to some external service that may not even exist yet without needing to actually make any external call and wanting to have the ability to set expectations for that service call and to specify the nature of the response the only methods i can think of is to develop a custom adapter

271044
contains	elements
schematron is a schema language that allows a much richer level of file inspection that xsd so you can check things like if elements x contains this content i expect elements y to be present

271056
environment	building
in this case i d recommend building a virtual-machine with sql-server 2008 and then you can play around as much as you like without jeopardizing the environment you need to get on with your normal work

271072
keyboard	mouse
in the keyboard mouse system preferences in the keyboard tab click modifier keys... at the bottom and then change caps lock to behave like control. then train yourself to use the caps lock key to the left of the a instead of the control key down in the corner

271074
perl	ruby
textmate seriously does-not-suck for editing all sorts of things especially collections of things like projects of c ruby java html perl bash etc. if it had subethaedit s ability to do cooperative editing it d be the only editor i ever use

271087
32-bit	64bit
for example under windows they are the same but for example on alpha systems a long was 64bit whereas an int was 32-bit

271090
authentication	login
this server mounts my home-directory after it authenticates me so using public key authentication does not work since .ssh isn t available until after the login is successful

271092
32-bit	64bit
gcc uses the lp64 model which means that ints are 32-bit but longs are 64bits under 64bit mode

271092
32-bit	64bit
msvc for example uses the llp64 model which means both ints and longs are 32-bit even in 64bit mode

271104
constructor	private
note you also need to make the constructor private

271106
subtraction	addition
i am trying to get this program to give me an out put that when i do an addition subtraction multiplication or division problem it will give me the answer

271107
environment	execution
the execution environment

271107
contains	any
contains any value in the range of

271115
contains	set
is it ok just to have a set area of memory i was thinking toward the end of virtual space that contains most basic functions process specific memory that the program can call

271134
exception-handling	error-handling
obviously this doesn t do any kind of error-handling or anything so you should make sure that you handle any errors or exception-handling in your real application

271143
environment	execution
as kevin haines points out ints have the natural size suggested by the execution environment which has to fit within int_min and int_max

271146
expression	brackets
if the expression inside the brackets after the if evaluates to zero it will not execute the code underneath

271146
subtract	add
because of that and your chain of else if-statement i m assuming you want to give the user a choice of whether to add subtract multiply or divide

271149
selected	listbox
how do i check if an item is selected or not in my listbox

271149
selected	button
so i have a button remove but i only want that button to execute if an item is selected in the list box

271164
selected	button
on the callback for the button click just check if the selected index of the list box is greater than or equal to zero

271176
credentials	security
this breaks the security of the web service since anyone can reuse the cached credentials

271191
python	java
if created in language such as c# python or java will make the code unit testable and more maintainable

271200
linux	unix
this header file might not actually cover every compiler but it covers several compilers i have used on windows unix and linux it also doesn t yet define 64bit types

271204
put	get
all the types get converted to ansi strings before they are put into the ostringstream buffer

271218
xsd	xml
this is a known issue and all they tell you is something like don t have nested table references...edit your xsd to stop having that. unfortunately this means that we have to apply xslt to make the xml conform to the hacked xsd since the files are coming from a third party vendor

271229
processor	cpu
newer processor have other faster ways to do it and which ones are available depends on whether the cpu is from amd or intel and on the specific cpu model

271243
user-interface	drawing
i m also curious as to what windowss forms has that you can t do in xna other than the obvious of drawing user-interface windowss which you can do in xna just not for the main windows

271252
arguments	default
if the first pattern matches the page function will use its default arguments for num 1

271253
rollback	commit
you can gain more control of commit and rollback if you use committabletransaction so you may want to consider that

271255
.when	ready
.when a client wants a connection give them one of the ready ones making it active then immediately open a new one if there s now less than n ready but don t make the client wait for this to complete or you ll lose the advantage of pooling

271255
.when	ready
if none are ready .when the client wants one they will have to wait around while you create a new one

271255
.when	ready
.when the client finishes with an active connection return it to the ready state if there s less than m ready connections

271284
browser-cache	caching
with proper caching settings must-revalidate you could check to see if each image request is going to be a fresh load or one from the browser-caching

271297
ruby-on-rails	rspec
it s not that rspec clears the database it s that ruby-on-rails s rake db prepare task copies the schema but not the contents of your dev database into your _test db

271309
pointers	stack
note that the returned string must be valid after the function returns so it can t be a pointers to a string allocated on stack

271324
any	set
when you go through the property the value gets set according to the setter logic so you get any business rules or validation you want over values assigned to that field

271329
subclassing	superclass
one superclass and two subclassing

271334
command-line	cmd
just click on start - help and support then search for cmd reference and you will get the command-line reference a-z page in full-text search matches

271334
command-line	cmd
it s a complete list of all cmd commands some of the are only available in batch scripts and other command-line applications

271335
value	field
also using the property enables you to apply business rules on the value of the property instead of having to enforce the same rule at each location where you d directly access the field

271344
temporary	copy
the idea is that sometimes one wants to make a copy in case the argument can t be modified and sometimes one doesn t want in case one wants to use the argument itself in the function if the argument was a temporary anyway for example

271345
stderr	stdout
i d always assumed that the file names emitted by tar go to stderr but that isn t always the case only if you write your tar file to stdout do the files written by -v go to stderr

271368
communication	messages
soap the standard also doesn t really define what goes in the messages body so in the case of wcf-to-wcf communication a soap envelope is used but the content is binary so there s your primary advantage at least in terms of performance

271368
.net	wcf
i m no expert in wcf but what i do know has been from .net user group presentations by juval lowy who wrote the o reilly wcf book his site has a decent amount of information in the way of screencasts and samples in the resources section in addition to the microsoft sites have you checked channel9

271419
dictionary	map
a map is a dictionary and you retrieve from this dictionary a or in the case of multimaps a collection of value s you re interested in

271427
switching	screens
note that they use a handheld type stylesheet that kicks-in when you re viewing on a handheld or switching to small screens mode

271462
exception-handling	try-catch
there is a problem with them of sneaking exception-handling out of try-catch blocks by way of delayed execution

271475
telnet	tcp
if you are looking to do real telnet and not just a simple tcp server then indeed rfc 854 is your starting point

271482
constructor	object
ah yes my idea was that i intended to run its constructor in the initializer list and thus have the object be constructed at all times

271488
perl	c++
the consensus seemed to be that if i want it to be fast i need to use a language like java or c++ but that python perl ruby would be good for the interface bits

271501
python	ruby
you can build your program in one of the higher level languages for example python or ruby and then call modules that are compiled in the lower level language for the parts you need performance

271501
python	c++
for example if you want to do c++ for the speedy stuff you can just use plain python or ruby and call dlls compiled in c++

271503
hsqldb	mysql
i mostly use mysql and when the tests run the driver class and url is changed to org.hsqldb.jdbcdriver and jdbc hsqldb mem test

271507
url-rewriting	query-string
most engine crawl the entire website if it is all properly hyperlinked with a crawl-friendly urls use url-rewriting instead of a topicid 123 query-string and that all pages are easily linkable a few clicks from the main page

271512
naming-conventions	conventions
information on how to handle namespaces assembly project solution naming-conventions nameing conventions of files

271514
linux	unix
how do linux or unix based clusters compare with them in these respects and others

271518
contains	elements
the first http call to the webservice throws a exception-handling with the message message did not contains a valid security elements

271552
lookup	any
generating name lookup traffic is simplicity itself -- in fact wireshark itself might try to lookup names in order to include them in its output unless you ask it not to so you might not need to take any explicit action at all depending

271569
selected	textbox
when i selected the item i want the combo box to just show a textbox with the name of the image

271582
joomla	drupal
for a complete technical overview you can also tick drupal and joomla in

271590
python	c++
these compile python into c c++ and from there you can access c c++ libraries without too much ado

271605
silverlight	wpf
or for a simpler approach try wpf silverlight

271609
any	set
is there any control panels to set the appropriate java version for different applications or any other way to set up what version of java will be used to run that particular application

271621
integer	numeric
if you have your heart set on mucking with the numeric or integer etc class to get unit conversion then at least do it logically and with some real value

271642
python	c++
boost.python provides an easy way to turn c++ code into python modules

271646
subclass	accessor
hiding the filtering logic in your business logic layer but kicking off the query in the display logic layer. then write a custom resultset subclass that has an accessor that runs the query and does the desired filtering

271648
unsigned	bigint
as you mentioned it limit is required so you need to use the biggest limit possible which is 18446744073709551615 maximum of unsigned bigint

271649
strchr	atoi
if you want to use an elegant ie ugly minimalistic approach you could make a loop of sorts to parsing each line basically using strchr to first find the character then the next spaces then using atoi to convert each number into a real int and then using some pointers hackery to push them all into the structure

271649
value	field
so for something that would be more maintainable and readable but result in more code you could just push each value into a vector and then go through the vector and copy each value into the appropriate strucutre field

271664
required	checked
in sbcl there s a hook on required that checked for asdf systemd so you end up with something that is about as convenient as python-import but somehow i suspect that is not what you meant

271673
having	select
another approach would be to select an autoimcremented column and then filtering it using having

271690
linux	unix
i am currently working in c c++ in a unix environment and am new to linux environments

271690
ubuntu	linux
i decided to put ubuntu linux on my laptop

271725
comma	words
the problem is that words that that are preceded by an html-tag are not found searchterm is not found when searching on like searchterm.. also words that come after a comma or end with a period etc.

271729
python	c++
i agree with the idea of coding first in a high level language such as python profiling and then implementing any code that needs speeding up in c c++ and wrapping it for use in the high level language

271729
python	lua
python ruby java lua

271733
punctuation	words
the second column is the text that has been pre-preprocessed just words no punctuation normalized so as to be easier for your like approach

271739
filtering	grouping
you could try to grouping your tests into folders are they called filtering

271752
constructor	object
for a.getclass a.clone .getclass to return true super.clone should be called instead of simply new subclass since super.clone presumably would correctly instantiate the class of this object even in subclasses and copy all internal state including private fields which couldn t be copied by subclasses using a copy constructor due visibility rules

271752
deep-copy	object
deep-copy is usually used when dependent object are mutable like calendar and the copy must be completely independent of the original

271780
webforms	asp.net
a traditional asp.net webforms control encapsulates both the controller and view aspect of an mvc application and that would be a violation to the pattern

271781
getter	setter
think property getter setter

271782
select	union
i would first select 10 distinct users then selecting images from each of those users with a limit 3 possibly by a union of all those and limit that to 10

271785
json	xml
i think i would offer a view which contains the items as xml and another that returns json that way you have the best of both worlds

271785
jquery	.post
i have a small .post about how to call and return something using mvc jquery and json here

271794
vb.net	vb6
vb.net has little in common with vb6

271800
multicast	packets
i am using multicastsocket to receive udp multicast packets

271800
multicast	packets
i really want to distinguish if the packets was really multicast

271800
multicast	packets
updates currently it seems like unicast packets just sent to that port also end up in the multicast sockets receive binding to devices also gives me no better results

271814
publishing	release
when i release i just publishing the interface which doesnt reference tests so it doesnt get compiled in

271814
msbuild	nant
however you can have it in the same assembly but then just not compile that code if you re using nant or msbuild

271821
positioning	fluid
at that stage i d hope to be moving away from a absolutely positioning approach to one that is more fluid - so this question is about what to do in the interim and also as a general question of style

271825
python	c++
one thing to note is that we have full access to our client api via the python language courtesy of swig which is a lot easier to work with than c++ for this kind of work

271835
instances	destroy
i tend to find that you end up referencing the instances methods deliberately early in the app s initialisation to make sure they re created when you want and then playing all kinds of games with the tear-down because of the unpredictable or at least very complicated and somewhat hidden order in which things get destroy

271854
contains	any
i know that you can create a web application on 80 and then not have a root site collection sharepoint applications consist of a web application that runs on a certain port and any number of site collections within that each of which has it s own directory path and can contains lists libraries other site collections and so on just creating one on a different path but i don t know for sure how that would work alongside an existing web site on the same port- it may not play nice

271863
crystal-reports	birt
there are several oss reporting engines jasper reports pentaho and birt to name three that you could use in much the same way as you have historically used crystal-reports

271864
webserver	security
my question is if mysql will be run on the same machine of the webserver then which method is best for security and performance

271874
show	next
this means that you can validate code with the assertions while developing and testing and disable them in a production environment although my testing has show next to no performance impact from assertions

271880
constructor	object
what your object does in constructor that might require them

271890
entity-framework	nhibernate
i may eventually move to something like nhibernate entity-framework or something else but for now my linq solution offers pretty much all i need and is much simpler than my old solutions

271892
arrays	loops
right now i loops through the options arrays and look for the option i want

271904
default-value	default
note the difference between being initialised with an explicit default-value and being left to it s implicit default-value myotherint will be initialised to 0 by default

271906
arrays	loops
you could loops through all the options once and put all items into an associative arrays

271908
having	select
i would suggest not having thousands of options in your select

271913
multicast	packets
i m a bit fuzzy on the details but a multicast packets will have been sent to the ip port combo you subscribed to and this info will be in the packets somewhere assuming you managed to have a clear path of intermediary router that understand multicast

271913
multicast	packets
i don t think you have any way of knowing if the packets was really multicast someone could always forge one since there s no real security built-in

271916
click	mouse
i ve seen advertising banners which annoyingly do this when you mouse over them although i d want to ask the user to click a specific more button

271917
expression-blend	designer
if you want a designer you need to try expression-blend

271917
silverlight	wpf
visual-studio 2010 is supposed to include a designer for silverlight that should be similar to the wpf designer in 2008

271927
methods	extend
you could extend or wrap jtextfield and overwrite the settext methods to replace null with an empty string

271929
value	field
note the ldc.i4.7 and stfld int32 dummycsharp.myclass myint seems to be instructions to set the default value for the myint field

271929
constructor	object
note that the extra assigment on myotherint that i added was addded after a call the object class s constructor

271929
constructor	object
any assignment done before the call to object class s constructor in il is a default value assignment

271931
default-value	default
some property values have default so they are not stored if the default-value is kept

271933
any	set
if its a small environment and you want to prevent any usb devices from being used then you can disable the usb ports in device manager make sure no users are set up as adminstrators on the machines and that should prevent all usb use

271952
debian	linux
you can find more commands at the debian gnu linux faq

271956
springboard	simulator
if you simply relaunch the app from within the simulator springboard it will keep using the same directory

271963
methods	extend
as ruben said i would extend the jtextfield to overwrite the settext methods and replace null with the empty string

271965
glut	sdl
there is a similar function in sdl sdl_warpmouse but i want to stick to glut

271968
contains	any
also since your contains data type is just an basic type int chances are good that you ll never see any synchronization problems until after your code is in production

271983
json	xml
what might make difference is what data is returned and what format it is in xml html or json

271983
json	xml
for example it might be more efficient to return a lightweight json object from an ajax call rather than a big xml document you can always monitor the size of the ajax response using firebug or something similar

271992
windows-xp	windows
in windows-xp if you go the control panel in category view on the left hand side you have some see also options windows update help and support other control panel options

271998
json	xml
the web service i m developing supports multiple representations xhtml json xml help handles as many possible errors as i could find and supports post overloading

272012
forwarding	port
delphi projects have always been extremely easy to port forwarding to new versions

272043
punctuation	words
it returns all records that contains words term whether it is surrounded with spaces punctuation special characters etc

272045
sql-server	mysql
nb this has to work on both sql-server and mysql

272049
configuration	logging
so changing the classpath after jvm startup doesn t change anything for you app itself because the jvm is already initialized and changing some logging configuration after you have already obtained a logger instance or whatever typically won t have any effect either

272062
any	set
you can certainly set any system properties you want at any point of time

272092
hosts-file	hosts
to answer your question you cannot use wildcards in the hosts under windows

272092
hosts-file	hosts
however if you want to only change the hosts to make new sites work..

272101
selected	checkbox
i want to have a website navigation menu where whenever someone clicks on it a treeview with checkbox appears where they can selected nodes in the tree

272103
configuration	logging
why not just turn logging on or off at the start of your app based on the configuration file setting and then just turn it on or off dynamically while the program is running

272120
web-config	app-config
although it is possible to add your log4net configuration settings to your projectâ s app-config or web-config file it is preferable to place them in a separate configuration file

272146
lookup	any
obviously if any of those have changed you do take another printf hit but overall it may not be more than what you are currently witnessing when combined with the arrays lookup

272149
constructor	object
long actions in a constructor are fine if they are actually building the object so it is usable

272149
derived-class	base-class
this is bad since once someone uses you as a base-class and overrides one of those functions you will call the base-class s version not the derived-class once you get into your constructor

272153
value	field
so behind the scenes the compiler must be generating a default constructor that sets the value of the field that the developer can t see

272161
defined	declare
i know that static-members except for const ones must be defined outside the class they were declare in

272162
sendmessage	message
sendmessage is a very widely used routine that simply dispatches a windowss message to a windows so i d expect that the error is associated with how the recipient windows handles the incoming message or not rather than with sendmessage itself

272162
sendmessage	message
rather than thinking of sendmessage as being just a windowss function you ve got to think of it as a function that will end up calling further application code in whatever application owns the windows that you sent the message to - in particular the return code from sendmessage tells you how the windows s application got on trying to process the message

272163
perl	ruby
following the advice from others in this question i d write the whole thing in a single dynamic language perl python ruby etc and then optimize the bits that need it

272163
perl	c++
with perl and inline you can optimize in c c++ or java

272164
value	field
this makes sure that the field are definitely assigned as far as the compiler is concerned - it sets all field to their default value

272187
constructor	object
a constructor is something that should be used to initialize an object a method should be used to do something have a function

272188
ironpython	cpython
an interesting option for me is to integrate cpython unit-testing of python code and code-coverage of python code with visual-studio 2008 through plugins something similar to ironpython studio

272197
wordpress	mediawiki
one option is openid which you can integrate into phpbb wordpress and mediawiki

272197
wordpress	mediawiki
a second option is to set up an ldap server which you can also integrate into phpbb wordpress and mediawiki

272197
logout	login
if the sites are all on the same root domain a third option is to modify the registration login and logout code so that these actions are replicated on every site at the same time

272200
environment	building
i can t look past teamcodeigniterty as a codeigniter environment - among other features it allows multiple building agents to be linked together in one building grid

272212
boolean	int
votes table id int vote boolean voteable_type string name of the class being voted on voteable_id int id of the class being voted on voter_id identifer for the user voting

272212
ip-address	proxy
the ip-address captured is not necessarily unique if they re coming from a corp proxy etc

272229
contains	elements
from there if you stuff the list into a contains elements and fiddle with the padding and margins you may be able to get the list to line-warp like text again i ve never tried that so i don t know

272230
constructor	object
i think it s not only okay for a constructor to take as much time as needed to construct a valid object but the constructor is required to do so

272233
windows	ms-dos
if i type this line in an ms-dos command prompt windows

272261
postgresql	mysql
i m not sure off the top of my head if mysql does this but postgresql certainly does

272274
configuration	logging
this code is written to take several legacy issues into account such as the database logging and database configuration management

272274
debugging	trace
i don t write try catch blocks almost anywhere else now because the stack trace from the query gives me all of the information that i need to debugging the problem and fix it

272277
implements	extends
i ve had good luck with bitmap indices when manipulating a lot of data in memory using custom data-structures but they are kind of awkward to implements over a third-party database that doesn t have a good postgresql-like api for extends their index structures

272283
windows	ms-dos
in ms-dos command prompt windows returns the same response

272338
object-reference	instances
system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances

272339
having	select
for each major clause in a sql statement select insert delete from where having grouping by order by .

272339
sql-server	oracle
finally if your database supports it many of the keywords are optional like inner outer as for aliases etc. into from insert into is optional on sql-server - but not on oracle so be careful about using this if your code needs to be platform independant.

272343
rollback	commit
it is not simply a log of events for your sake but a vital part of the way the database handles transaction rollback as well as memory commit

272345
reliability	robustness
one of the criterion we selected is reliability and or robustness - are these the same

272375
python	php
i m doing something similar using javascript as my core parsing library and then using it within python dotnet and php

272386
reliability	robustness
robustness and reliability cross in their relationship to each other but are not necessarily the same

272396
required	checked
i often find that if my code required me to write checked for specific types i m probably doing something wrong

272409
directory	folder
i know i can use a virtual directory to reference an includes folder outside of web root but doesn t that still allow direct access to that directory via the url

272422
promise	future
its a pretty basic variation on a lazy future or promise

272428
put	get
given 2 classes animal and elephant which inherits from animal my understanding is that you would get a run-time errors if you try and put an elephant into an arrays of animals and this happens because elephant is bigger more specific than animal

272447
authentication	login
so in order to access a file say mysite.com mydoc.pdf they would have to be authentication first go through the login page

272448
reliability	robustness
reliability and robustness are two different attributes of a sytem

272458
value	field
when the value conversion is selected from the moverchangetype dropdown i was hoping that the empfdservicestartdate field would be checked for nulls before being saved

272459
sql-server	oracle
i assume that there is a query for oracle specific and sql-server specific at the code below

272474
javascript	dom
content is not only not displayed when javascript is active it apparently is also not in the dom

272476
build-process	msbuild
you could specify this in your build-process via switches to msbuild csc but not really at runtime

272492
grouping	sorting
i ve been able to get my dynamic grouping down and then the sorting except now my generated linq-to-sql sql order by statement is backwards from what i want it to be

272492
grouping	sorting
i think i need to figure out how to get at the result returned from the linqdatasource when the sorting event is fired in the listview so that i can then append my grouping order by clauses

272492
grouping	sorting
currently i m overriding the linqdatasource selecting event to provide it s result and do the dynamic grouping there but then the result is modified by the sort on the listview and i was thinking there must be some way to get at that result during the sorting or sorted event

272522
postgresql	mysql
mysql + postgresql

272526
express-checkout	paypal
as noted in the document you must also offer express-checkout the redirect to paypal if you use direct payment

272528
default	reset
reset settings to default

272590
object-reference	instances
message error object-reference not set to an instances of an object

272614
c++	lua
lightroom plugins are written in the scripting language lua photoshop plugins are written in c++

272619
order	add
what i d like to do next would be to add a bit of javascript in order to add a link button to be able to toggle the display of the warnings

272623
export	report
i want to know if we have some other way to export all the report from the older server and then deploy it to the new server

272631
directory	folder
also in vs2005 it s under the platformsdk folder inside the vs2005 directory whereas there doesn t appear to be any such directory on for msvc6

272643
checkbox	textbox
how do i flag a column as being either a radio a textbox or a checkbox

272653
protected	public
making it protected instead of public will at least prevent outside objects from calling it

272657
sql-server	oracle
i just worked on a different project that ported a home-grown o r layer from oracle to sql-server and it ran into significant problems because of too many oracle assumptions locking mostly

272662
row	col
if row col dbnull.value || string.isnullorempty row col as string .

272694
.doc	xls
i ve got my web application storing file contents in this table with no problems and am able to use full-text searching on .doc xls etc with no problems - the only file extension not working is pdf

272694
execution	restart
after this i restart the sql-server and verified that the ifilter for the pdf extensions is install correctly by execution the following command

272694
contains	any
this returns doc files which contains this term but not any pdf files although i know that there are definitely pdf files in the table which contains the word house

272698
python	ruby
the python and ruby bridges work but it s not what apple is pushing or using itself

272698
python	c++
not in the way that ruby python are perhaps but it s certainly not like c++

272721
children	nodes
it will selected all of the nodes that are children of your list

272728
signals	sigint
while you cannot protect against a hard abort sigkill on unix you can protect against other signals that cause your parent process to shut down sigint and clean up your child process

272730
profiling	trace
how do i limit a sql-server profiling trace to a specific database

272744
python	ruby
ruby and python are both viable for real mac apps

272752
contains	any
i used the page.clientscripting property to register a scripting block to contains any id s i need to access with jquery

272759
pascal	basic
the basic argument for this style is that in languages like c and pascal an if governs either a single statement or a block

272762
put	get
you can do that if you have the correct hibernate ids of the objects you re working with calling a get and then merging your copy with the one hibernate just put into session

272764
32-bit	64bit
this executable has to run on xp vista server 2003 and server 2008 versions of windows in 32-bit and 64bit on x86-64 architecture as well as itanium chips

272775
executable	upx
in general if you want to keep the size of your executable down you can use upx to perform exe compression

272791
twitter	tweets
i thought of developing a wpf client that will just output to the screen the last 5 tweets by a certain twitter user

272796
file-descriptor	fclose
for stdin you can just fclose the stdin file-descriptor to interrupt the read

272803
methods	extend
now there are already several parsing which all extend the same class but were designed to read logs from a single threaded application no fragmentation - from original system and use a readline methods in the super class

272816
enterprise-architect	visio
i ve been using visio 2002 2003 enterprise-architect to do my database-schema design visually and then forward-generate the ddl to create the database

272826
python	php
i ve done this before in python using os.execvp but i can t get the same thing to work in php

272828
versioning	upgrade
most of the time testing is an exact copy of the live system except that errors are turned on when a new versioning is about to be moved live it s replaced with the new versioning before live is to detect upgrade issues

272847
selected	cells
i can selected individual cells by getting a single item cell from the range and calling its selected but i can t selected the range

272854
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework hierarchical page class

272868
implements	abstract
the hope is that we get to see some clever techniques to solve abstract problems that we may be able to implements in practice

272869
fogbugz	svn
fogbugz also integrates with svn although it is not free

272877
compact-framework	.net
i ve got a iseries to .net compact-framework project

272890
fogbugz	svn
it lets me add fogbugz case number through tortoise svn and then i can see code changes from fogbugz

272891
firefox	safari
css transforms safari and firefox

272891
svg	vml
alternatively i would recommend a mix of canvas vml or svg vml

272941
vb.net	vb6
i ve done development in both vb6 and vb.net and i ve used adodb objects in vb6 to handle recordset navigation the movefirst movenext etc

272945
sendmessage	message
the value that sendmessage returns is the same as the value that is returned from your message handler

272966
itemtemplate	itemscontrol
since the treeviewitems that it generates are also itemscontrol they would need to have the itemtemplate set as well

272966
any	set
the easiest way to achieve what you are hoping for is to put the hierarchicaldatatemplate in the resources of the treeview or any of its parent visuals and set the datatype of the hierarchicaldatatemplate so it is applied to all of your items

272973
sqldatasource	formview
in the past pre-linq i ve accomplished this with my own extensively customized formview and sqldatasource objects which take care of temporarily persisting the data changes getting the event id from the formview etc

272995
user-interface	look-and-feel
in the past there apparently has been concerned about the look-and-feel of tcl tk user-interface s but this has been addressed by a new framework named tile that supports the native look-and-feel of the user s os

273044
prototyping	methodology
this works great for an iterative prototyping methodology

273054
javascript	dom
traditionally we create a new xml dom document and add the input parameters as xml elements for the transform via javascript

273060
python	java
i would prefer testing frameworks that are written in java or python

273081
constructor	object
is a user object that gets passed around to each form s constructor just as bad

273090
message	alert
doing so is actually counterproductive because your users get an error that will never change and you don t get an exception-handling message that would alert you to the problem

273095
python	ruby
you could also create a configuration specific to this scenario in your projects and pass that to xcodebuild and you should be able to script this in your favorite supported language applescript python ruby etc.

273103
base-class	inherited
i have a class that inherited from a base-class and implements the following.

273103
base-class	inherited
now the base-class it inherited from also implements this system.icomparable.compareto so i m getting the following compiler warning

273112
hosts-file	hosts
if your hosts contains a line with 127.0.1.1 yourhost.example.com yourhost which is a common configuration getaddrinfo is only going to return 127.0.1.1

273116
python	java
the grinder is right up your ally with both java and python that handles most web services soap rest corba rmi jms ejb etc

273144
numeric	digits
if you need to include any numeric representations other than just digits like decimal value for starters then see tchrist s comprehensive guide to parsing numbers with regular expression

273154
mapping	unique
so to do it in perl you d want to manually create a cookie and store a unique key in it have a server-side mapping of those unique keys to session state dictionary and pretty much do what i described above

273188
udp	tcp
assuming that it s a tcp rather than udp port that you re trying to use

273200
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework hierarchical page class

273203
any	set
are there any options to access the second result set using sql or some other work-around

273204
arguments	default
cdll default to int return types on all platforms should be a long long on 64bit systems and just expects you to pass the right arguments in

273205
virtual-machine	vmware
also using a virtual-machine like the free vmware server is very helpful for this kind of work

273211
order	join
now i need to join some lists in order to present the content grouping by some specific fields

273248
virtual-machine	vmware
additionally if you are doing malware analysis or use sice i wholeheartedly suggest running everything inside a virtual-machine namely vmware workstation

273279
hardware	monitor
i know there are standalone applications such as hardware monitor by cpuid but again these are standalone and i require something that i could interface with

273285
contains	set
will set to a node-set contains every node in whose text value starts with the text value of a node in set2

273320
credentials	security
however given that you re talking about in effect caching a user s security credentials you may want to carefully think about security loopholes

273322
g++	gcc
in gcc g++

273330
while-loop	cursor
no cursor while-loop or user-defined function needed

273337
put	get
get db data and put into a table

273347
g++	gcc
but 12 years later i can t persuade either gcc or g++ to give me any kind of warning for assigning a literal to non-const char so it isn t all that loudly deprecated

273415
perl	ruby
note that because argv array is empty before first gets ruby won t try to interpret argument as text file from which to read behaviour inherited from perl

273425
selected	cells
however i need to selected all the cells in the range but i haven t been able to find a way to specify this in the get call for the item property

273448
for-loop	loops
you see a while loops that iterates down is faster than a for-loops that iterates up

273465
user-interface	drawing
you mention the speed of the code but for most windows user-interface operations the difference is not noticeable as the main bottlenecks of drawing and disk access are no different for either approach

273477
mediawiki	tiki-wiki
user-interface -- one of the most frustrating things for users is that they have to learn one user-interface for mediawiki one for tiki-wiki and one for any of the other myriad of wiki s out there

273504
virtualization	virtualbox
sure and the best way to do this is to use virtualization technology such as virtualbox

273528
selected	cell
not familiar with that kind of code in vb it s much much easier to do automation i think in your example you are selecteding one cell from a range using the item property and the selected method

273528
selected	cell
the problem is item property only returns one cell - you have to apply the selected method to the original range

273534
hide	show
my question is are there more generic better ways to handle permissions applied to a form element on the page than writing a security methods check per page to enable disable hide show proper controls depending on the permissions allowed

273535
children	nodes
when the windows loads the root nodes and its children are queried from the database and inserted into the tree

273535
children	nodes
each time a nodes is expanded that nodes s children and grandchildren are queried from the database and inserted into the tree

273536
firefox	opera
for several browsers like firefox or opera it is just a matter of copying the original program directory elsewhere and upgrading

273542
sql-server	oracle
some systems on the other hand store fractional numbers in decimal sql-server decimal and numeric data types and oracle number datatype for example and then their internal representation is therefore exact for any number that is a power of 10

273543
versioning	upgrade
at least they did include an upgrade wizard to upgrade source from one versioning to the next it worked for most of our code

273549
windows-vista	windows
starting with windows-vista and windows server 2008 the .net is installed as part of the operating system

273549
windows-xp	windows
it is also part of windows update so almost any windows-xp system will also have it installed

273555
webforms	asp.net
what are some helpful things that asp.net mvc developers could suggest that would help us asp.net webforms developers to write better code web apps

273555
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m a webforms guy but with all the new hype around asp.net-mvc i d value some comments on helpful tips tricks and strategies that might be able to be used in a webforms app

273571
python	perl
of course python is beating perl to that particular finish line by releasing first

273571
python	perl
it should be noted however that perl s changes are much more extensive than python and likely will be harder to detangle

273571
forth	lisp
the early languages tended to either be so low-level and married to assembly c or so utterly dynamic in nature forth lisp that such a mid-stream change wouldn t even come up as a consideration

273578
updating	updates
when i run this code i get the following exception-handling i updates all of the fields including the primary key of the record that i m updating before passing the object to this updates methods

273617
installation	environment
altough the author seems to not recommend using the gac since some sharepoint installation are on a hosted environment and you can play with gac

273639
variables	boolean
i added a private boolean variables to the form called isprimary and added the following code to the form constructor

273650
virtual-machine	vmware
if you want to run the program to see what it does without infecting your computer use with a virtual-machine like vmware or microsoft vpc or a program that can sandbox the program like sandboxie

273651
machine-code	disassembly
disassembly is simply this a program reads through the binary the machine-code replacing the op-codes with their equivalent assembly commands and output the result as a text file

273660
error-logging	logging
i am designing a error-logging feature so our servers each donig different things can have a central data store for logging errors

273662
environment	building
so if bob is building the app should be install in bob s test environment maybe bob1 or something like that

273671
homescreen	icons
in an attempt to hide the safari user-interface components for an web-app bookmarked as a homescreen icons

273673
perl	awk
he also claimed that if larry wall had known how powerful awk was he wouldn t have needed to invent perl

273675
any	set
that seems odd to me since i can send the the file to the printer i just don t have any nice dialog before hand to set the printer etc

273685
scheme	lisp
the lisp to scheme thing involved a rename

273695
cvs	git
i ve been using a local git repository interacting with my group s cvs repository for several months now

273698
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux

273703
having	union
the point is that with one table num you can generate large numbers without having to resort to very long chains with one union per value

273704
rewrite	rule
you should be able to access site.com vip and no rewrite rule should take place

273705
webforms	asp.net
i m also coming from webforms but have been learning asp.net mvc since around preview 3

273705
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m not exactly sure how to bring anything from asp.net-mvc into webforms they are two entirely different frameworks

273705
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc pretty much replaces webforms with it s own framework

273729
png	gif
printing a png or gif would be much easier -- just extend the printdocument class and use the normal print dialog provided by windows forms

273734
fogbugz	mantis
i prefer a website bug tracking system like mantis or bugzilla if you want to host it yourself or something like fogbugz if you want to outsource it

273777
oracle	mysql
rdbms - mssql oracle mysql

273788
ms-access	oracle
it gives examples in both oracle and ms-access and is geared toward the beginner

273791
selected	cell
you can then highlight a range in a sheet and run the sub from the tools macros macross menu item to color each cell in the selected range

273816
relational-database	rdbms
2 learn what a rdbms is relational-database management system

273823
silverlight	wpf
look at wpf and silverlight

273845
environment	building
i wonder if cc.net is building with different environment variables such that the necessary library directory aren t properly added to the path

273852
panels	grid
you can put all the controls in one panels grid stackpanels etc. and leave the cancel button in another panels

273854
double	int
obviously that number is going to exceed the size of an int float or double

273893
python	ruby
the one i know best is python but i think that languages like scheme and ruby support large numbers too

273893
maxima	sage
if you want free mathematics software look at maxima or sage

273909
shell	bash
i use bash but example are welcome in your favorite shell as well

273953
quickbooks-online	quickbooks
yes you can send qbxml requests to quickbooks-online edition just as you can send qbxml requests to regular desktop editions of quickbooks

273955
any	set
you can use distinct but if any column in your result set has a distinct value it forces the row to be duplicates

273964
background-color	transparency
but this results in a bad-looking gap at the bottom on image links and what s even worse if i have transparency images the link s background-color can be seen through the image

273967
file-permissions	filesystems
you should check the relevant file-permissions and if the server is chrooted whether your module directory is mounted within the virtual filesystems

273994
vb.net	vb6
wouldn t vb6 to vb.net be the biggest example of this

274020
processor	cpu
it all starts with the cpu or processor

274020
addition	division
the instructions cpus can execute are fairly basic and simple addition division negation read from ram place in ram read from register and so on

player	movie
the next question is how can these simple instructions over numbers generate all the wonders we see in computing internet games movie player etc.

274024
internet-explorer	google-chrome
this works in internet-explorer and in google-chrome but does not work in firefox

274024
google-chrome	firefox
and now it works fine in firefox as well as continuing to work in ie and google-chrome

274056
checkbox	textbox
what i m trying to achieve to translate that snippet into a single textbox and a checkbox control

274120
macros	basic
you can write basic programs in the raw machine language and then there s a system of macros so you don t have to repeat yourself so much and that s the first step towards a full-featured language

274142
.net	wcf
the latest improvements to wcf in .net 3.5 sp1 make many restful interfaces easier

274144
constructor	object
by changing the data access object dependencies to properties rather than constructor dependencies windsor will autofill them after instantiating each object fully

274145
selected	button
i think the following code basically does what you re after -- creates a new frame when the button is clicked menu item is selected

274168
joomla	drupal
there are sites with drupal and joomla that receives million of visits month after month and do not need special configuration like data clustering

274181
integer	modulus
calc does the arithmetic operators + - as well as exponentiation modulus and integer divide

274191
png	gif
i m looking for some image library that can work with multiple formats jpg gif png and is fast at display the images to the screen

274202
8051	8bit
with 32-bit arms meeting and beating the price of the tired 8bit micros like the pic and 8051 and z80 other than the msp you should avoid stopping at anything below a 32-bit core

274215
integer	numeric
if you have various bits differing you still may have largish difference but if you re more likely to have large numeric difference that correspond to usually one or two bits differing you may be better off with a scheme where you create ahebyte arrays - use the first 4 bytes to encode the first integer and then for each subsequent entry use 0 or more bytes to indicate which bits should be flipped - storing 0 1 2 ... or 31 in the byte with a sentinel say 32 to indicate when you re done

274246
xsd	xml
if your document is small you may just want to generate the xml then re-parse it with xsd checking on and let that be your checking

274265
positioning	sidebar
if i have 3 divs a left sidebar a main body and a footer how can i have the sidebar and main body sit next to each other without setting their positioning as absolute or floating them

274267
build-process	msbuild
i m fairly certain that you re going to need visual-studio installed either way if you re planning on automating your build-process using things like msbuild and mstest

274272
value	field
another benefit is that if your viewdata contains a value matching the name of the field it will be populate

274284
javascript	dom
since ihtmlwindow and javascript have the same dom maybe someone knows how from javascript

274285
unix	bsd
macports - - decently sized library of bsd unix apps for your osx machine

274302
handler	service
so first off we add a facility which will detect when a handler is created for a type and at the same time will register any of the forwarded service so they point to the existing handler

274306
export	csv
if your problem is that you ve exported csv from access jet and it s not in the expected format then maybe you need to fix the csv export from access to use a format that mysql understands

274307
associations	model
just as an example if i have a book model and a bookscontroller autotest part of the zentest suite will pick up the associations between the two and load test unit book_test.rb and test functional books_controller_test.rb into the test suite

274312
debian	linux
the winner is gnu linux debian ubuntu in a landslide

274320
web-services	api
if the client app has enough stuff to call web-services why not create the uuids locally using a built-in api

274345
silverlight	wpf
some of what you learn with wpf is transferable to silverlight as well

274351
bug-tracking	bugzilla
bugzilla isn t pretty but has nearly everything i want in a bug-tracking system to be able to quantify bug metrics

274371
scriptaculous	jquery
i d learn to use jquery or even go directly to the prototype library check out scriptaculous

274384
registration	login
app-a has a database associated with it powering the registration and login at app-a.com

274395
integer	zero
best case is a file of identical integers no bit changes for every integer just the 2 zero bits - this will tend towards 2 32 of original size 93.75 compression

274398
asp.net-mvc	webforms
there you will learn the differences between the webforms postback model and the way that asp.net-mvc directly routes your urls to actions methods

274399
oracle	mysql
in general i believe oracle s implementation here breaks jdbc and is not used elsewhere mysql mssql etc

274410
background-color	transparency
the problem is that sometimes the background-color i read is just 0 transparency black and sometimes it is 0xff000000 opaque black

274430
sftp	ssh
sgtatham putty - ssh sftp client

274433
malloc	free
a memory leak is when memory is dynamically allocated eg with malloc and all references to the memory are lost without the corresponding free

274440
binary	hex
the correct utf-8 encoding of those is unicode binary hex

274457
selected	button
now if i hook-up my button to selected first view controller by clicking on the appropriate tab and dragging the iboutlet to the uilabel that label now has multiple referencing outlets

274473
administration	account
i ve found that the built-in authentication scheme work great for simple situations where you only need to basically authentication who can enter and who can leave but fall short for custom situations such as having special administration account etc

274477
virtualization	virtualbox
virtualbox free and open source virtualization that creates new vm s

274482
any	set
the problem is that the system_folder and application_folder which will be set based on which server the code is running on are set first thing in the index.php file before any of the configuration have loaded

274484
getter	setter
if i am exposing my dto type in a service how do i use the getter and setter without creating a round trip for each get set operation on the client

274484
domain-object	repository
when implementing the repository pattern do i pass in the dto or the domain-object

274487
double	int
the closest is system.math.round which is only for rounding numbers of types decimal and double to the nearest int value

274493
progress-bar	progress
i have put together something that works - it uses a simple progress-bar class which simple returns a simple ascii progress bar as a string and a loop of open .read and .write to do the actual copying

274497
progress-bar	progress
for modularity it might be better to have the copy_with_prog function not output the progress-bar itself but call a callback so the caller can decide how to display the progress

274500
insertion-sort	quicksort
when sizes smaller than the limit are reached it does everything serially and for smaller still you would obviously want to change from quicksort to insertion-sort

274522
asp.net-mvc	webforms
something that occurred to me a while ago when learning about the new asp.net-mvc framework is that webforms was i think an attempt at asp.net-mvc in many ways

274524
default-value	default
you can ask for default calls blank constructor or 0 for numerics on failure specify a default-value i call it other or ask for null where t class

274530
httplistener	http.sys
2 as you say an embedded webserver - herhaps httplistener - but note that this uses http.sys and so requires admin priveleges or you need to pre-open the port

274536
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if not is this in scope or is it possible to somehow leverage the webforms capability in asp.net-mvc

274564
initializer	getter
if however you initializer a new foo inside the instances getter then you would need to write your own thread safety ie

274582
keyboard	mouse
it makes it very easy to give someone access to your desktop including allowing them to share control of your mouse keyboard and it works well through firewalls you just get an access code from the other party you paste it bang

274605
mstest	nunit
that s why we use nunit instead of mstest

274606
host	dns
an even better way would be to create another alias cname in your dns for your server just set a different host header for each web site

274628
compatibility	entry-point
i m not sure there s anything it does that your simple entry-point does not but it is probably best to use it to be safe and for future compatibility

274630
superclass	subclass
so it s when you assign an object of a subclass to the superclass

274630
superclass	subclass
the superclass knows nothing of the additional information in the subclass and hasn t got room to store it so the additional information gets sliced off

274634
derived-class	base-class
slicing is where you assign an object of a derived-class to an instance of a base-class thereby losing part of the information - some of it is sliced away

274636
derived-class	base-class
if you have a base-class a and a derived-class b then you can do the following

274647
directory	folder
step 2 change directory to extensions folder within the profiling folder created in step 1

274696
implements	abstract
as i started to wade into the problem i realized that i would need a solution to abstract concerns that could be implements in steps because they obviously weren t going to go for a complete rewrite

274709
asp.net-mvc	webforms
are there any obvious productivity gains in developing using webforms or asp.net-mvc

274714
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i banged out a complete prototype commerce site with asp.net-mvc in a few weeks that would ve taken me i m sure at least double that using webforms

274723
fwrite	fread
but not library calls like fopen fread and fwrite

274725
firefox	safari
the prob is this script works in safari and ie but not firefox

274732
javascript	dom
you could solve it this way in javascript using the document.referrer html dom property

274737
constructor	object
i have two constructors for in my case a controller class the default constructor and one that takes the factory and other injected object

274737
constructor	object
the parameterized constructor creates object of default types if the corresponding parameter is null

274738
deep-copy	object
this can be difficult since you may need to do a deep-copy of the domain object

274738
getter	setter
i m not sure why it s a problem that exposing a dto type as a service would cause use of its getter setter to do a round trip

274738
getter	setter
if the service is a remote service the returned dto is serialization anyway and your getter setter will get the copy of the value

274745
hide	show
hide all groupboxes then show groupbox based by index of selected listview

274756
versioning	upgrade
if you re going to do this ensure that when people buy your product that they will get free upgrade to new versionings for a year or some other period of time so that they don t feel like they got ripped off when a new versioning comes out 2 months after they bought a copy

274756
installation	upgrade
also ensure that you support old versions so that those who don t want to upgrade just want bug fixes can do so without risking breaking their current installation with new versions of the software

274758
versioning	upgrade
for example if ms released new versionings of visual-studio every 3 months with a new .net versioning c runtime etc then we would spend a good portion of our time just dealing with the upgrade which would not be good

274761
getter-setter	conventions
i d do the latter approach since it s a conventions that helps me to see at a glance whether a private member has a public getter-setter or not

274764
hotmail	gmail
so that the chances of my mail messages ending up in the spam junk folder become less i was thinking that this must be one the rules used by spam filtering on popular webmail services like gmail yahoo and hotmail what do you think

274816
hide	show
this way all hide show mechanics will be handled by it

274828
entity-relationship-model	datamodel
when you build a conceptual datamodel i suggest you keep to a model like the entity-relationship-model

274880
firefox	opera
actually we don t even know if you are talking about javascript on the browser validation of upload field you can no longer do it at least in a simple way with firefox3 or on the server side neither firefox nor opera nor safari upload the full path of the uploaded file

274881
perl	c++
you should be able to download the standard eclipse distribution then install the c++ and perl tools

274894
windows-xp	dos
i m running an old dos game in dosbox under windows-xp and i m trying to determine when and where it access it s data file

274903
utility	manual
besides manual copy-paste operation i see two options one is you can have a post-build task to copy all the files and another is to have 20000 files zipped zipfile added as a content item to your project with copy always set and either console application unzip em or a post-build step is calling unzip utility to do that

274915
perl	c++
what is the best way to call c c++ from other languages such as java python perl php etc

274917
versioning	upgrade
it is also worth noting that if a user decides to upgrade to the full versioning if you do not have some mechanism in place to transfer over the existing data you will likely see a negative reaction from your users

274923
directory	folder
in every iis web i would have a virtual directory called custom which points to a different folder for each web

274923
directory	folder
update i d like to point out that this virtual directory custom is not suited to contain an inherited web.config - that web.config would be valid only for the custom folder which doesn t contain aspx ascx files

274930
python	php
i think rather than looking for .net related to x technology you should look up the technology you re using python php whatever on how to call restful services

274934
windows-server	windows
if you are running a server os for your build machines such as windows-server 2008 you will have to enable desktop experience and or install windows media player to install the sdk yeah that s an odd one which is required to install mobile device center activesync

274934
windows-server	windows
we currently have windows-server 2008 build machines building and testing our product which includes a significant windows mobile .net cf codebase

274964
perl	ruby
it used to run on top of perl s catalyst mvc framework but once the entire view layer was converted to an extjs based desktop i started migrating to ruby on rails models and controllers

274964
firefox	safari
javascript performance can be a real pain unless you are using the latest versions of safari or firefox 3.1

274966
msbuild	nant
when preparing a release build you might want to consider using a build scripting and msbuild or nant to do this type of thing for you

274977
derived-class	pure-virtual
it suggests a somewhat sophisticated pattern to fully deal with the issue have a protected copy-constructor a protected pure-virtual doclone and a public clone with an assert which will tell you if a further derived-class failed to implement doclone correctly

274984
webserver	host
i have an apache webserver configured in reverse proxy mode which listens for requests on a public ip address and serves them from the internal iis host

274984
contains	any
is there any setting that can be configured in wcf application s web.config or in iis in order to customize the wsdl generated contains host address and put public address instead

275005
arrays	loops
then i have a single loops that iterates through the arrays of points and draws them as so

275018
python	perl
what is the python equivalent of perl s chomp function which removes the last character of a string if it is a newline

275025
python	perl
python rstrip method strips all kinds of trailing whitespace by default not just one newline as perl does with chomp

275026
json	xml
one way to do this to reuse your code is to have your simple page calling a function or whatever you use for server side logic that can be called by itself returning json or xml

275034
initializer	getter
in quite a bit of my code i use custom getter implementation in order to initializer the properties

275034
accessor	ivar
while the objective-c 2.0 documentation states that the synthesized accessor on the modern runtime will synthesize the ivar on first use

275042
malloc	free
in c this happens when you malloc to a pointers and let that pointers leave scope without doing a free first.

275042
malloc	free
by proper use of malloc and free anyone who looks at your code will be at ease

275050
subtract	time
you can then use timersub to subtract the two to get the difference in time and convert it to whatever precision of time you want

275058
logging	trace
in this case you need some kind of logging to trace errors

275092
firefox	opera
this function works on ie opera and safari but somehow is ignored in firefox

275113
keydown	keyup
in your game view define the keyup and keydown methods

275113
nsresponder	nstextview
note that the keydown and keyup events are actually defined on nsresponder the superclass for nstextview

275128
python	ruby
as in say ruby or python

275144
contains	any
this will highlight any jar contains the classname passed in as a parameter in any subfolder

275152
spline	smooth
even if you success in making the correct rotations according to the spline the edges of the flat tops are going to pop out of the volume of your intended tube and it will not be smooth

275154
order	add
you must add a replace call applied to urlencode result in order to replace 26amp

275165
databound	gridview
what i ve done in the past is use databound gridview templatecolumns

275165
textbox	button
then on postback say a save button click you can loop through the rows in the gridview and pluck the values out of the textbox

275181
google-search	adsense
an easy way to have a customized google-search is to use adsense for search it allows you to

275183
ostream	std
in your example cout uses your to convert your x1 object using a user defined implicit conversion to a pointers which is then output by ostream s cout is of class std ostream which takes a void

275201
fwrite	fread
i personally still use the c style fopen fread fwrite etc but that is more of preference than actually correct

275226
pointers	stack
if you allocate an object or memory on the heap and return a pointers then it doesn t die because it s on the heap not stack

275231
linux	bsd
for linux and bsd you want to use a href rel nofollow noreferrer clock_gettime a

275239
environment	building
this worked brilliantly in isolating the building and dev environment from the actual third party web-services

275239
typemock	moq
i m going to be looking into moq and typemock etc soon

275247
contains	any
it lists all known packages that contains any given class

275252
contains	any
if you paste a url into your browser address bar it does not expect it to be html and does not try to interpret any html encoding that it may contains

275261
required	checked
checked for required resources memory disk spaces peripherals as early as possible

275273
scheme	lisp
so first - is drscheme and plt scheme really the tools i need to learn lisp and or scheme

275288
linux	unix
libnids and tcpflow are also available on other unix flavours and do not restrict you to just linux contrarily to iptables

275293
standard-library	boost
take into consideration the fact that quite a few things from boost are already in tr1 and will most likely be in the next revision of the c++ standard-library

275298
contains	set
robert s last xsl variables is good for getting a result tree fragment contains the matching text values but unless as he suggests you use exslt or ms extensions to xslt 1.0 to convert the rtf to a node set you can t get a count of the matching text nodes

275300
pointers	stack
you may have trouble if you lose stack pointers alignment and mix external objects generated with other tools

275308
execute	declare
is this a typo in your post or have you declare it with a different signature than required and thus it is not being execute

275327
listbox	textbox
a bunch of libraries of controls and other resources the typical windows frame combobox listbox image container textbox textarea a wysiwyg-y richtextarea etc. these are the province of flex

275372
value	field
example i ve had a table with a state field that only accepted the value a n and r for active new and retired. typically you d approach a conditional where 95 were r 4+ were a and a few were n

275419
python	java
if you re going to spend months and months learning one particular language then there s no real advantage in using python or java just for their to be proven development speed

275428
short	base
the short answers is that you slice the object by assign a derived object to a base object by value the remaining object is only a part of the derived object

275454
restrict	shared
most shared hosts don t use a true medium trust environment because it restrict some things that are just too vital

275465
http	ssl
with https the ssl connection is negotiated before any of the http headers are sent to the server including the host -header that tells the server for which virtual host the request is actually intended

275472
32-bit	64bit
the executable is 64bit x86-64 and the debugger is a 32-bit i686-pc-linux build

275476
operators	keyword
or actually it s only partly working since entering multiple comma-separated groupinging in the advanced search form or using the grouping search operators doesn t quite work as expected and ends up adding all the words in the additional grouping names as search keyword too

275488
arrays	map
in fact you could also have the macro subtract one off of each of the subscripts in order to make it look like a one based arrays actually map to a zero based arrays

275488
arrays	loops
you may have to add additional loops to deal with some of the fortran arrays io

275488
any	set
happily in any case you have the original program to use as a baseline to make a set of unit tests to help in the development effort

275492
simplemodal	jquery
how about simplemodal for jquery

275498
feedback	account
and if you re looking for near real-time payment feedback i always found it easier to just write a program to check my paypal email account periodically and parsing payment details from the body of the email itself

275506
python	java
if you go this route you might consider using babel which was developed to allow components to be shared between c c++ fortran fortran90 python and java all in the same app

275510
environment	building
i d like to automate this process and coming from a linux environment my instinct was to generate a makefile and building from the command-line

275511
parallels	vmware
it allows us to set up assembly-time components for different projects and then build them into vms on the fly for vmware parallels xen and ec2

275516
python	java
you can rapidly customize lamp ror python django java stack spring etc servers for ubuntu-based vm images at - unbuntu 8.04lts now supported

275519
nhibernate	ado.net
i like nhibernate over a hand rolled dal because while my dal does abstract away most of the ado.net code you still have to write the code that takes a data reader to an object or an object and creates the parameters

275521
hide	show
for your selected list of rooms add an onchange event handler that will show hide the text boses

275527
javascript	dom
using straight dom and javascript you would want to modify the innterhtml property of a dom object which will contain the text boxes...most likely a div

275554
.when	ready
.when the transmitter is ready to send a character it sends a start 0 bit marked with followed by the character code and ending with a stop 1 bit marked with

275555
artifactory	nexus
this is with reference to setting up repositories like artifactory nexus etc

275560
stream	send
say you send 00000000 stream a 11111111 00000000 stream b 11111111

275562
any	set
edit the user will be able to clock into multiple projects simultaneously though by first narrowing down the result set to a single project this shouldn t make any difference to the logic here

275565
clisp	sbcl
supports clisp and sbcl

275572
postgresql	firebird
how easy is it to transition from one db sqlite to another mysql or firebird or postgresql under sqlobject

275573
postdata	request
using this class you can postdata to a remote http address just set the mime type to multi-part form encoded and post the binary data from the image with the request

275576
paragraph	caption
this is also the rationale behind defining sub-styles referenced using the property in text tags for paragraph table cells header text caption etc. and using tags

275578
virtualbox	vmware
i ve found vmware fusion works the best but there are free open source alternatives such as virtualbox if you just want to get your feet wet

275578
hosts-file	hosts
for extra added fun you can edit your mac s etc hosts to make yourdomainname.com resolve to your guest linux boxes internal ip-address and have a simple way to work on test multiple web projects online or offline without too much hassle

275586
account	api
you have to have a flickr account as well as an api key and shared secret

275593
contains	set
i ve made sure all my controllerss and objects have - id key and - void setkey id key methods so that they re bindings-compliant i ve created a controllersalias object in my nib connected it to my controllers created an nsarrayscontrollers that binds to one of the nsmutablearrayss from the class that controllersalias connects to made sure to set the type of objects that are contains within the arrays and then i ve bound a table column to the nsarrayscontrollers

275638
digits	zero
to match a string consisting of digits 0 to 9 and starting and ending with at least one zero the pattern

275638
digits	zero
would work match one or more zero then one or more digits 0-9 ending in a zero

275641
any	set
title meta tags for keywords content-type if not explicitly set by the webserver and any css to be applied to the page

275646
octal	hex
there s no such thing as a variables that stores a hex value or a decimal or octal value

275646
octal	hex
hex octal and decimal are just different ways of representing numbers to the compiler

275703
directory	folder
from there find the point of divergence and work your way back to the assembly folder prepending a .. everytime you pass a directory

275716
integer	zero
so if digits is equal to 5 the format string becomes 05d which specifies an integer with a width of 5 printing leading zero

275724
selected	button
one of it s columns was selected button

275724
selected	button
when i was clicking selected button of any row i had received this error message

275724
callback	methods
clientscriptmanager.registerforeventvalidation methods in order to register the postback or callback data for validation.

275750
checkbox	textbox
the problem is that since html.checkbox is rendering a checkbox as well as a hidden input field if i change the state of the textbox the postback value is doubled ie

275752
order	add
there is a related question here that may help add some light regarding the order of the tags

275752
quirks-mode	doctype
doctype is important to enforce strict rendering no quirks-mode by the browser

275761
textbox	button
i have a textbox and a link button

275761
textbox	button
when i write some text then select some of them and then click the link button selected text from textbox must be show with a messagebox

275761
textbox	button
when i click the submit button for textbox below message box must show lorem ipsum

275761
textbox	button
if i select any text from the page and click the submit button it is working but if i write a text to textbox and make it it s not

275761
selected	textbox
now problem is that when i select a text from textbox and click any other control or space text which is selected is must be still selected

275763
32-bit	64bit
on solaris a 64bit build of gdb is supposed to be able to debugging both 32-bit and 64bit executable though i ve had some issues with recent versions of gdb

275763
32-bit	64bit
i m not sure of the converse - that a 32-bit gdb can necessarily debugging 64bit executable

275797
firefox	opera
for opera firefox and safari you can use the following function

275811
temporary	copy
as chris mentioned returning an object by value involves the copy of a temporary object and its subsequent destruction

275811
constructor	object
by means of that it s possible to implement the move constructor useful to return an object partially avoiding the cost of copy constructor and the destructor of the temporary

275811
constructor	object
last but not least move constructor allow the return-by-rvalue-reference of non-copyable object

275828
protected	public
the custom methods can be written in the code behind file but has to be declared public or protected

275830
application-pool	iis-manager
when using asp.net this account will match the identity of the application-pool which you configure using iis-manager

275843
authentication	login
page.user returns the name that asp.net verifies through authentication and this user in most cases is independent of the windows login that is running the current thread

275850
driver	kernel
there are some other things which already open files from kernel spaces you could look at them the loop driver springs to mind

275851
postgresql	firebird
of course it would probably be much easier to just use a good concurrent db like the ones you mention firebird postgresql etc

275852
silverlight	wpf
i am writing an applicaton that will be a standalone wpf application and also a cut down version that will work as silverlight and so be hosted in browsers

275852
entity-framework	data-access
i know there is a sync framework sql-server data service ado.net entity-framework and sql-server compact edition that help with data-access but i am not sure if they can be made to work together to do the presented scenario

275853
contains	any
this usually works but might silently break if the loop contains any code like if i-1 0 ... etc

275868
build-system	cmake
how would i go about having a cmake build-system which scans for source files now using aux_source_directory scan for header-files too in the same directory preferably using a similar command

275887
reflection	runtime
from your sentence i just want to set a friendly name using reflection i think you want to set the myfriendlynameforthisclass name to the attributes at runtime

275894
stderr	stdout
os.popen3 - stdin stdout stderr

275912
javascript	dom
make sure the dom is ready before your javascript is executed by using jquery s callback function

275931
fadeout	fadein
i see fadein fadeout and animate but i don t see anything like flash

275939
contact	submit
a web site with a simple way to submit feedback - email link or contact form - is the easiest to set up cheapest and quickest to updates

275961
dictionary	hashmap
you can create a dictionary hashmap of groups and for each group store a bool saying if a item of that group was printed or not

275962
scala	java
note that this aggravates specially in java where the syntax is not as terse as it could be compared to scala for example

275974
linux	unix
since congress doesn t set the rules for the whole world there has been a mechanism for flexibly specifying the rules on unix linux for a long time

275982
reflection	runtime
autoeventwireup means asp.net will use reflection at runtime to look for methods on your web form class in the form of page_eventname like page_load page_init etc and automatically wire the methods to the corresponding page lifecycle events

275998
static-typing	let
what static-typing does is let the compiler have enough information to detect type mismatches at compile time instead of run time

276015
platform	gpl
winpdb is a platform independent gpl

276021
python	c++
i have a different perspective having had lots of luck with integrating c++ and python for some real time live video image processing

276021
wxpython	pygtk
user-interface python people are slow and python is great for user-interfaces using wxpython or pyobjc on mac or pygtk

276021
python	c++
i used the image libraries in wxwidgets in my c++ which are already exposed to python through wxpython so it was extremely powerful and quick

276022
display	width
sometimes i find people who program on wide-screen monitors and like to use its full width for display source code

276026
arrays	loops
this is why the loops terminates -- the length of the arrays not being split at all is 1

276030
decimal-point	numeric
as we all know global data like the locale settings affecting the numeric decimal-point printf and strtod are using is evil

276063
tunnel	vpn
even though the mtu at the switching is 1500 you can have situations like tunnel through a vpn that wrap a few extra headers around the packet- you may do better to reduce them slightly and go at 1450 or so

276065
execute	prepare
note that this way with prepare statements will automatically escape all that needs to be and is one of the safest ways to execute mysql queries as long as you use binbparam or bindvalue

276068
duplicates	elements
if there are duplicates elements you can use n

276069
constructor	object
i can for example access methods of root in the constructor of an object where the root is passed in without the app locking up

276087
google-chrome	firefox
this is happening in both firefox and ie 7 although not in google-chrome

276089
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade your app to use .net 4.0 then your long term users aka previous versionings will end up having to install a whole new versioning of the framework

276095
silverlight	wpf
asp.net-mvc application block for wpf silverlight

276095
compact-framework	.net
mvc framework for .net compact-framework

276096
udp	tcp
if you have not done so yet it could be a good idea to look at some recent alternatives to tcp udp like sctp or dccp

276096
udp	tcp
they were designed for niches where neither tcp nor udp was a good match precisely to allow people to use an already debugged protocol instead of reinventing the wheel for every new application

276110
exception-handling	try-catch
without a try-catch block i don t think you can catch exception-handling so structure your program so the exception thowing code is under the control of a try-catch

276135
attributes	properties
try to create a child class redefine all of the properties that you need to change the attributes mark them with new

276135
attributes	properties
later edit this part of the solution is not workable if you have a large number of properties that you might need to rewrite the attributes

276137
udp	mtu
that being said if you want to achieve low latency and can tolerate loss using udp with an overall packet size set to the path mtu be sure to set the payload size to account for headers is likely the optimal solution esp

276140
windows-server	windows
see windows sdk for windows-server 2008 and .net 3.5

276151
ip-address	hostname
this is due to the fact that http begins encryption before the host parameter is sent in http and thus it cannot determine which cipher to use from the hostname - all it has is the ip-address

276151
http	ssl
this would be silly easy to fix if http had a tls command so it could start ssl after asking for the hostname but no one asked me

276167
innodb	myisam
with mysql you can specify different engines like innodb myisam etc

276180
hardware	monitor
what software does everyone use to monitor hardware

276180
nagios	cacti
i know about nagios and cacti but does anyone use any other software

276184
ironpython	cpython
is there any example code of a cpython not ironpython client which can call windows communication foundation wcf service

276190
nagios	cacti
a bit like cacti or nagios but more pleasing to the eye

276192
javascript	dom
note that jquery adds a lot of overhead to dom manipulations that considerably slows down the performance of your javascript code

276193
selected	textbox
i think it will also still support selected and copying text from the textbox which is not possible with a disabled textbox

276206
hide	show
to simplify things i m just checking to see if those fields whose name ends in surname are empty and then show hide appropriately

276209
javascript	dom
devices with os 4.6 and higher bold pearl flip storm etc.. come with a new rendering engine which has much better support for javascript dom and css

276217
versioning	upgrade
perhaps it s because of feature-creep in the later versioning or because of some compatibility which the newer one doesn t support or just because there isn t enough of a difference to upgrade for etc

276217
versioning	upgrade
what makes the older versioning preferable what would need changing for you to upgrade

276225
optimistic-concurrency	data-access
many data-access frameworks use this exact strategy to implement optimistic-concurrency

276241
contains	elements
according to the documentation empty finds empty elements as in contains no child elements not form elements without values an empty textbox

276242
benchmarking	profiling
if you implement it in that way and then later need to speed it up then you can use benchmarking profiling to locate the bottleneck and either link to a compiled language for that or optimise the algorithm

276248
versioning	downgrade
search as you type doesn t work on the new versioning and i don t want to downgrade gtk

276252
attributes	properties
therefore when you request its attributes you are getting the ones defined at car even if you requested not to go up in the inheritance chain as the properties you are querying is the one defined in car

276255
attributes	properties
the properties has the myattributes attributes

276272
sqldatasource	gridview
when you can slap an advanced gridview onto a page along with a sqldatasource and bind it directly to a stored procedure you throw your test automation out the windows

276280
linux	unix
on unix linux this help would constitute creating a core file which you could load into the debugger and see the original location of the unexcepted exception

276285
fogbugz	redmine
we evaluated trac bugzilla mantis lighthouse and redmine fogbugz wasn t an option due to the incredibly high price and decided that we like redmine the best

276308
versioning	upgrade
they force you to upgrade every 3 years by disabling online support for versioning older than three years

276329
32-bit	64bit
it points out itself to 32-bit version of jre jdk instead of 64bit

276336
filtering	sorting
i want the user to be able to apply dynamic sorting or filtering on the result returned so as to obtain a more refined result they wish to see

276348
nagios	cacti
is fairly good too - comparable to nagios and cacti at least

276361
linked-list	arrays
you want to say how expensive the operation is for the unsorted arrays sorted arrays unsorted linked-list sorted linked-list

276386
defined	declare
function foo1 inside foo.c calls bar1 which is declare in bar.h and defined in bar.c

276389
.net	wcf
i ve created a .net wcf service that is intended to always be over https

276399
compression	streaming
note gzip is streaming compression not an archive of multiple files

276400
png	gif
i will limit the file extensions to the most common images like jpg jpeg png and gif

276410
arrays	loops
then on the server side you loops through the _files arrays looking how many files have been uploaded and handling them

276414
arrays	loops
then in _files upload you will have an arrays of files you can loops over like

276437
positioning	slider
depending on the specific application providing a slider that the user can selected a positioning from might be a better choice on the iphone

276454
entity-framework	ado.net
quite a few experienced developers have given ado.net entity-framework vote of no confidence as is discussed further here

276484
ruby	php
there is a nxhtml-mode which you can use to edit javascript php html ruby jsp css whatever on the same file

276491
display	width
i set the ide display windows so the ruler just fits the horizontal width and then i make sure i don t go outside of it

276509
implements	final
in an ideal world the second case should be implements as a final class most of the time

276519
for-loop	loops
two extra details of the for-loops which were not in the simplified conversion to a while loops above

276519
expression	evaluation
before the first evaluation of the controlling expression

276519
expression	evaluation
evaluated as a void expression before the first evaluation of the controlling expression

276519
expression	evaluation
the controlling expression expression-2 specifies an evaluation made before each iteration

276532
versioning	upgrade
you need to have the full versioning of visual-studio 2008 install in order to upgrade to service pack 1

276553
administration	account
make sure that any processes running in iis run from least privileged account don t run the worker processes under ids that are in local administration

276555
any	set
...where a variables is set based on the variables name without the variables names hard-coded and without using any other data-structures

276561
value	field
in particular the changing value of field section describes how to do what you d like to do

276561
perl	php
the above is fairly easily done in perl python php ruby and so on

276575
.net	wcf
i am trying to migrate my .net remoting code to wcf but i m finding it difficult

276575
library-project	libs
copying to remaining classes and interfaces into a common class libs-project then add a reference to system.runtime.remoting libs

276582
attributes	properties
it s something that i have contemplated setting the entire properties object as a context attributes

276585
enumerator	any
in vs2008 is it possible to write an extension methods which would apply to any enumerator

276588
defined	declare
function foo1 inside foo.c calls bar1 which is declare in bar.h and defined in bar.c

276597
value	field
if the query tries to insert a pre-existing value to a field you php will be notified about this constraint breach

276603
grouping	sorting
if you had an arrays of 10 million objects in only a few grouping then sorting is not a reasonable option

276603
any	set
if the grouping are more complicated you can store the grouping that have been seen in any set data structure hash tree etc

276635
uitextview	uilabel
ok i ve answered my own question a uilabel placed on top of the uitextview will also hide the insertion point but can still become the first responder and get input

276645
malloc	free
most libc malloc implementations work by storing a header before each returned memory block which has fields to be used by the free call which has information about the size of the block as well as a magic value

276652
low-level	hardware
however the standard hardware and protocols for connection to data-transmission equipment rs232c and later operate at a low-level and it is generally neither possible nor desirable to alter that arrangement especially via software

276652
modem	uart
even though high-speed modems now transmit complex analog signalss that aren t described in terms of two simple signals levels the rs232c and later-mode digital communication between a computer uart and the data coupling on the modem is pretty much as described

276657
getter	setter
should i only include the difficult algorithm that i implements or any code i wrote for a pojo that had 300 properties and whose getter setter were generated using ides

276660
jqmodal	jquery
using jquery and jqmodal i have tried this kind of thing using a custom confirm dialog

276671
binaries	install
although i don t know why it would do such a thing in this location instead of a user-specific one the driver needed write access to the directory where ibm had install the client binaries and libs which had been done by an administrator and was in the root of the c drive

276682
worksheet	excel
you could import files a and b into excel in one worksheet then if necessary do a filter on that resulting list of addresses to remove any duplicates

276682
macros	vba
now having said all that you could still do a vba macros to do much the same thing but perhaps clean the lists up a bit depending on what you need

276684
put	get
then put the stupidity behind you and get on with your life as quickly as possible

276687
python	perl
for text processing of the sort you describe either perl or python are ideal

276714
environment	building
i even still maintain an old vb6 app and i have replicated my old vb6 building environment to a vpc image

276715
bitwise-operators	operators
bitwise-operators are operators that work on a bit at a time

276761
python	c++
i m currently working on a project were i had to wrap the c++ classes with python to be able to script the program

276767
nunit	moq
there are examples using nunit as well as mocking frameworks such as rhino.mocks and moq

276769
g++	gcc
i m able to get access to a list but i get a bunch of warnings when compiling with -wall with g++ gcc 4.2.4 the generated c++ code that say

276776
contains	set
files can be considered to contains a set of records each either of a fixed length or ending with a delimiter

276777
contains	set
the key point about the public header is that it should contains everything that the user of the library set of functions needs and nothing that they do not need

276793
order	add
displays the range range here it s empty but i m fairly sure you can add elements yourself in reverse order

276806
malloc	free
it s quite likely that free will not return pages to the operating system under the assumption that your program will malloc more memory later

276806
malloc	free
but if you free first malloc might re-use the free memory instead

276810
postback	ajax
from what i ve read about asp.net-mvc it appears it requires posting to work is there any working example with source available of a asp.net-mvc website that has no postback with the help of ajax

276829
opencover	partcover
opencover - successor to partcover

276829
ndepend	ncover
ndepend can import coverage data from ncover dotcover visual-studio 2017

276836
space	input
you must make sure that the input string has enough space to hold all the padding characters

276842
code-coverage	ncover
an alternative to ncover can be partcover is an open source code-coverage tool for .net very similar to ncover it include a console application a gui coverage browser and xsl transforms for use in cc.net

276842
opencover	partcover
update opencover has replaced partcover

276843
command-line	cmd
is there a way short of writing a seperate batch file or adding a system call to pause or getch or a breakpoint right before the end of the main function to keep a cmd windows open after a cmd-line application has finished running

276844
testdriven.net	ncover
i use the version of ncover that comes with testdriven.net

276868
panels	grid
the purpose of the grid is not for real databinding it is just a panels

276874
input-field	checkbox
it seems to me like the html.inputhelper method is not using the attemptedvalue from the modelstate for input-field of type checkbox

276882
contains	set
for example if you have a query that represents items 1-24 in a set filtering by conditions x and y then use a cache key that contains all this information and then when asked for that same search again just return the entire result set from the cache

276886
xsd	xml
the camprocessor available on sourceforge.net will do xml test case generation for any xsd

276898
put	get
you might as well put any value lower or greater than 128 to get different intensities shades of gray

276902
integer	numeric
if file size is a problem you can timestamp with an integer rather than formatted text and you can use a numeric event id to abbreviate each log leave only the instance-specific data as text

276903
silverlight	wpf
as a side note learning wpf would give you the basis to learning about ria with silverlight

276908
content-management	publishing
i m currently planning the migration of a microsoft content-management server mcms website to a sharepoint 2007 publishing site

276908
contains	set
it will contains two areas which need to be protected with forms-based authentication - each of which will have a distinct set of users

276908
protected	public
1 for the public facing site and the others for the two protected areas

276913
constructor	object
so the object needs a constructor

276917
filtering	grouping
the axis will be getting evaluated independantly so the filtering statement on grouping will be looking at only the members in the where-clause

276927
row	col
but instead i just want 1 row 1 col

276934
put	get
here s something i put together a while ago it s windows only but may help you get part of what you need done

276934
methods	extend
i m not using it here because the current methods covers my needs but if someday it s needed to extend or improve this then may want to investigate the wmi tools a vailable

276947
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object from somewhere inside silverlight where i can t get a useful stack-trace breakpoints

276956
silverlight	wpf
it allows you to build your business objects that easily support multiple interfaces asp.net wpf silverlight etc

276976
vrml	x3d
unfortunately vrml x3d has not become anywhere near ubiquitous in the past decade

276980
virtual-machine	vmware
the only way i know of doing development in linux for the iphone would be to install vmware and work on getting os x running in a virtual-machine

276993
put	get
we manage 5 000 desktops in a large enterprise and what we did to get the app on all of the machines was create a simple msi file that put an icon on the desktop you could put it in the startmenu or whatever i guess

277000
keyboard	mouse
if you don t get rid of it the only way to give it focus again is to use the same keyboard shortcut or the mouse which is what we re trying to avoid....

277001
textbox	button
i d like to raise a custom bubbling event from an onfocus handler for a button and a textbox

277004
double	int
like you could selected all of the int in the block and then search and replace to double for example

277007
jprogressbar	progress
while doing all these i want to show a progress bar using jprogressbar

277014
mac-address	packets
two hosts using same mac-address on a single network segment would probably make switches go nuts and you could probably detect it by having an extremely unreliable network connection as the switches would send some portion of packetss that belong to your host to the second one depending on which one of you sent the last packets in their direction

277016
internet-explorer	google-chrome
this renders fine on internet-explorer firefox google-chrome opera netscape and konqueror

277023
constructor	object
using readonly you can set the value of the field either in the declaration or in the constructor of the object that the field is a member of

277025
.when	ready
causing an object s state to change .when accessing properties makes debugging very difficult - a developer usually expects a function to cause something to happen and .when using the debugger won t let a function run unless they are ready for the results

277028
contains	any
the server should host any wcf service contains in dll assemblies loaded in runtime that implements a minimal plugins api startservice stopservice getstatus

277038
web-inspector	webkit
use the built-in web-inspector in a recent nightly build of webkit to track down your issues

277043
execution	exit
i wish to trap this event display the error and exit after closing all files and other attributes i have open during the execution of the scripting

277058
syntax-highlighting	code-folding
it has features like syntax-highlighting code-folding project workspace management class browsing macros scripting integrated version-control ftp editing etc

277105
mac-address	packets
the passive methods would be simply to listen to traffic and look for any packets that you didn t transmit but have your mac-address

277105
mac-address	packets
if another device is spoofing you it must by definition respond to packets with your mac-address as the destination

277105
mac-address	ethernet
so the answer it seems would be to transmit either a broadcast ethernet packets or a packets with your mac-address as its destination that requires a response

277113
contains	any
if the members however are allowed to contains all possible values fitting their own invariants respectively you could of course just make those members public you wouldn t add any protection to them anyway

277117
value	field
it s simply a check to ensure that once the object is fully constructed that field cannot be pointed to a new value

277159
vbscript	basic
i believe it s trying to compile it as a visual basic class instead of seeing it as a vbscript class

277160
button	popup
if it s appropriate you might have a bright red show errors button somewhere which would display that nasty popup with a list of all of the errors

277168
silverlight	wpf
i m looking for some good resources to ramp up on the animation storyboard concepts used in wpf silverlight

277186
push	pull
git does use origin by default when you do things like git push or git pull

277186
push	pull
then you can simply do git push or git pull to update instead of git push unfuddle master

277197
google-chrome	firefox
when sending 1 menu item it renders html that is absolutely correct in firefox and ie but really messed up code in safari and google-chrome

277197
google-chrome	firefox
my question is how do i get asp.net to send the same html and javascript to google-chrome and safari as it does to firefox and ie

277233
g++	gcc
when executing gcc from the command line g++ is the c++ compiler while gcc is the general c compiler

277237
type-safety	generics
you don t have either the speed benefits or compile-time type-safety benefits of generics here - i don t really think you re doing yourself any favours by using it

277239
double	int
because the types are being promoted char - int float - double if there is no declaration of the function at the time you call it the arguments could not be passed at the right places in memory anymore

277248
.when	ready
usually you just commit .when your feature s ready

277253
mstest	nunit
then just right-click on the class on the methods on the project on the solution and use the test options that testdriven.net provides including if you have mstest test with - team coverage which runs your nunit tests with the mstest coverage tools including giving the colorization back into the ide to show which lines executed

277259
subtract	add
you can add or subtract date-periods with english-language style phrases via the strtotime function

277290
google-chrome	firefox
so to address this issue the best way i see is to do like visual-studio firefox google-chrome roolup your own tab control with your theme.

277306
boost	stl
i ve used both for the same project boost is better integrated with the stl and especially c++ exceptions

277306
python	c++
also its memory management mechanism which tries to bridge c++ memory management and python gc is way more flexible than swig s

277306
perl	ruby
however swig has much better documentation no external dependencies and if you get the library wrapped in swig for python you re more than half-way there to getting a java perl ruby wrapper as well

277316
gridview	listview
when the number of items added to the gridview exceeded the listview height the vertical scroll bar did not appear as i specified in the xaml

277327
hide	next
i want to show or hide additional next and previous button if my primary next and previous button are off screen

277334
ruby	php
it shouldn t make much difference if a site is made in asp.net or ruby on rails or php or etc etc etc

277336
g++	gcc
for gcc g++ i found this perl script useful

277368
factors	primes
-i am now looking at determining the primes factors of a number and then use them to find all other factors

277368
factors	primes
i am currently at the stage where i can get an arrays of primes factors for any number i input - i.e 300 has the primes factors 2 2 3 5 5

277368
factors	primes
using this arrays of primes factors i need to be able to calculate the remaining factors - this is the part i am stuck on

277370
subtract	modulo
if the number to be subtract is known to be in in the range 1..n then you can use the fact that subtracting y modulo n is the same as adding n - y modulo n

277376
methods	extend
the only time i can think you should be using constant strings in lieu of enums is if you need to allow room for the user to extend your methods to enable custom functionality.

277393
perl	c++
i don t know if this works in perl but in c c++ you can use b for a backspace

277402
ndepend	ncover
we used ndepend and ncover to provide the raw information to calculate the metrics

277414
javafx	swing
on the other side javafx also supports swing components as well as data binding which makes it appear more like flex

277436
margins	padding
see that the margins and padding are correct

277437
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3 and google-chrome show only the default source

277444
innodb	myisam
the major difference is that innodb supports transactions whereas myisam doesn t

277445
innodb	myisam
the main difference is that innodb supports transactions while myisam does not

277445
innodb	myisam
myisam has typically been considered faster at searching but recent innodb improvements are removing this difference and improving high concurrency workload performance

277445
innodb	myisam
innodb support transactions whilst myisam does not

277445
innodb	myisam
myisam does table level locking while innodb can do row level locking

277446
having	select
if you are wanting to select the values that are not in either list then you can use grouping by and count to count the occurrence of each number and then having to select those rows with a count of 1

277450
value	field
the timestamp field will therefore be much more compressible as most value are equal

277452
innodb	myisam
myisam and innodb also store their data on disk differently

277461
udp	tcp
if you need any level of reliability from udp or require two-way connections you will end up needing just about everything from tcp so you might as well go with that to start with and let the network stack take care of it

277474
haskell	scheme
if it was up to me i d teach scheme haskell or f# but since he d rather learn something that can be useful in his job as a fiscal consultant programming excel

277478
superclass	subclass
the superclass has got some initializers say initanimal the subclass has some initializers say initdog

277478
instance-variables	subclass
i do not like this because the subclass can have some extra instance-variables that i want to make sure are initialized

277481
interpreter	runtime
instead of generating code keep the model alive at runtime and let your application be a runtime interpreter of these models

277483
factors	primes
if you factors a number into its primes

277483
multiplying	exponent
all the exponent and multiplying

277483
factors	primes
so if you know the primes factors you just need to count the repeated ones and use the above calculation to work out the number of factors

277487
constructor	object
initializing by moving heterogenous typed object directly into a container by having a variadic-templates d constructor

277499
designated-initializer	initializer
generally in objective-c you create a designated-initializer for each class and then subclassing use the same initializer

277499
designated-initializer	initializer
there are a number of ways to ensure that subclassing don t call initializer other than their designated-initializer and the way you ultimately choose will be largely based on your whole design

277499
designated-initializer	initializer
first if you create a subclassing that has a different designated-initializer than its parent class you can overload the parent s initializer and throw an exception-handling

277499
superclass	subclass
however it should be stated that you should have a very good reason for doing this and that it should be very well documented that the subclass may not use the same initializer as the superclass

277499
subclassing	superclass
that way each animal and true subclassing of animal can handle their designated initializer themselves and won t have to rely on superclass behaving in such a specific non-standard manner

277500
macros	vba
there s basically two big options he can write vba code macros s or .net code

277508
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
one possibility is to use xsl filtering with openoffice.org so that you can save to resource files directly in a spreadsheet application

277509
base-class	inherited
splisteventreceiver spitemeventreciever and spwebeventreceiver inherited from the abstract base-class speventreceiverbase

277511
innodb	myisam
the most important difference between myisam and innodb is that innodb supports transactions and foreign keys

277511
innodb	myisam
innodb is slower than myisam for most uses but can perform faster in certain conditional due to a better locking mechanism

277527
macros	vba
i think that if you a programmer taught your boyfriend vba he would develop some understanding of programming and also have to hand an extremely useful tool for work far in advance of anything that can be achieved by recording macros

277527
vbscript	vba
in addition it is a very short step from vba to vbscript

277533
postgresql	rdbms
for exact details see the given rdbms s documentation for example in postgresql it is called indexes on expressions

277539
value	field
how do i bind the value of radio-button generated with the html.radiobutton html helper to a field that has a struct as type

277540
build-server	msbuild
on our build-server we ve installed the .net 2.0 sdk in order to kick off msbuild and run our builds

277543
put	get
these are interesting as we all get a sense of the investigation and thought that was put into your answer

277546
linux	unix
i realise i can do this with the linux unix find command but i was hoping to avoid scanning all subdirectories looking for instances of the filename

277563
windows-server	windows
windows sdk for windows-server 2008 and .net 3.5

277580
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
in the past i have just created openoffice.org xsl filtering that read write to from my resource files rather than rely on an external resource file editor because i found that most translators are familiar with spreadsheet but not with resource files

277589
radio-button	selected
how to perform validation for a radio-button grouping one radio-button should be selected using jquery validation plugin

277596
jms	jta
if the answer is no because i need jms or jta then i resort to an application server

277596
websphere	ibm
any time i negotiated with ibm it was always ended up costing twice as much as a weblogic equivalent but corporate policy dictated websphere had to be used

277598
innodb	myisam
myisam supports non-standard-sql fulltext indexing which innodb still does not

277602
vba	vb6
vba is vb6 in terms of runtime at least

277607
value	field
when you use the html.radiobutton html helper with an enum as value field you can only choose your option once

277607
selected	button
after reposting the page the helpers will ignore the value set in the call and set all radio button to the same value being the value you selected the previous postback

277609
function-call	inline
an alternative idea if you happen to be needing to return multiple matches in a body of code is look for your languages callback based regex which permits passing any matched found grouping to a function-call which can do inline substitution

277610
basic	vba
vba is a great starting point for someone new to development and wants to get a handle on the basic

277622
vbscript	vb.net
here is a way to do it using vbscript and here s one to do it using vb.net

277638
division	modulo
while calculating the hashtable bucket index from the hash code of a key why do we avoid use of remainder after division modulo when the size of the arrays of buckets is a power of 2

277646
listbox	textbox
the page panel has textbox dropdown list listbox

277664
contains	any
then test if any of the data entry controls contains values other than default value

277693
windows-xp	windows
this has worked for me on my windows 2000 + ie 6 computer at home as well as my windows-xp + multiple ie computer at work

277703
procedure	records
the cost of your time to a think about it b get second and third opinions and then c write a procedure to archive log records

277707
innodb	myisam
you can have more information about myisam innodb in mysql documentation

277713
python	java
there are interfaces for vb use cdbl and cdate c# datetime.fromoadate tooadate java oledate - looks deprecated though delphi python etc

277742
environment	execution
you can then set that environment variables before calling msbuild and check whether the variables exists in the post-build event before execution whatever code is there

277769
contains	set
then in the paint methods of the jcomponent i set the stroke of the graphics context passed as parameter to paint to the one contains in the object

277772
decimal-point	digits
what i want is to be able to print a double or float with a maximum given number of digits after the decimal-point

277775
internet-explorer	firefox
the problem is that if you press enter in firefox is not working however it is working fine in internet-explorer

277777
cocoa	uikit
even then there will undoubtly be enough works in cocoa but fails in uikit scenarios to make rbiphonetest dubious to use

277786
decrement	increment
now every time you see a a left bracket increment all these variables by 2 and every time you see a right bracket decrement all the variables by 2

277789
administration	account
you have to decide whether your target audience can be assumed to run on power user or administration account or whether you will have to deal with above-mentioned problems

277795
innodb	myisam
here is a description of difference between innodb and myisam

277795
innodb	myisam
difference between innodb and myisam

277810
decimal-point	zero
assuming your number is in the variables num the following function will remove all but the first n decimal then stripes off the trailing zero and decimal-point if they were all zero

277812
haskell	scheme
ocaml haskell erlang and all free lisp and scheme implementations that i know of do not have concurrent gcs

277816
unmanaged	c++-cli
if you are using c++-cli then you can interact directly with both the managed world and unmanaged code so interop is trivial

277818
while-loop	loops
note that since the while-loops will only update fig_handles when it is run you will always have at least 0.2 seconds delay until the loops catches the modification of fig_handles.continue_loops

277823
python	ruby
in ruby most use rails so thats what you hear and django for python is mentioned more then not

277833
administration	account
for many times i try to revoke with this command but when i connect to database by administration account db2 will automatic grant permission to administration again

277839
placeholder	required
i then go to the content pages and add new placeholder for the plaintext equivalents and add text as required

277844
vb.net	vb6
several points about vb.net versus vb6

277849
authentication	logout
authentication rolling your own login logout session management code is a pain especially when there s already pre-written and tested code available

277851
document	editing
what i need is a link on a web page that will open the document for editing in word

277851
document	editing
is there a way to open a document for dav editing directly from a hyperlink

277887
required	checked
i use the synapse routines gethttp to return a specific resource and if found then checked against the local systemd to see if an updates is required

277887
downgrade	upgrade
we chose to prompt the user as sometimes an accidental bug might make it into the system and the user has to downgrade upgrade only specific machines to help troubleshoot

277891
put	get
i tried being intuative in using a master page with content place holders but i couldn t get the placeholders to grow to say nothing of not being able to put a textbox where i wanted one

277893
reflection	runtime
then at runtime use reflection to load the assembly and instantiate the wrapper you want

277895
notepad++	scite
notepad++ is another scintilla -based as scite source code editor

277907
onkeydown	onkeyup
you can then override onkeydown onkeypress and or onkeyup to handle the key press before any of your controls

277914
return-value	arguments
i ve got a phpunit mock object that returns return-value no matter what its arguments

277920
contains	elements
pdf files often contains binary elements such as images so you may be best to convert it to ascii via an encoding such as base64

277925
32-bit	64bit
my huge 32-bit web-services llblgen-based data-access application is running alone on a dedicated 64bit machine

277941
build-process	ant
our build-process uses ant and the third party libs are committed in svn

277944
delphi	c++
in any other language i would create struct s c c++ or record s pascal delphi which are byte-by-byte representations of the header and the record

277959
windows-xp	windows
just curious here is it possible to invoke a windows blue screen of death using .net managed code under windows-xp vista

277973
driver	kernel
you d have to p invoke and interact with a driver or other code that lives in kernel spaces

277985
driver	kernel
vista still has bsod s but they re less frequent because the new driver model has less drivers in kernel mode

277998
basic	vba
as a long time business excel user and programmer i recommend starting with a good vba book that focuses on the key features of the basic language and how to communicate with the excel objects workbooks sheets etc

278010
selected	button
selected the childdefs property and click the ... button

278013
any	set
of course there is no need to set objects to null the point is does it help memory-management in any way

278024
extends	sealed
you should be able to extends whatever control you want assuming it is not sealed

278060
value	field
in almost every case you probably want the clustered index to be on a column or a combination of columns that is unique an alternate key because if it isn t sql will add a unique value to the end of whatever field you selected anyway

278060
product	invoice
if your table has a column or columns in it that will be frequently used by queries to selected or filtering multiple records for example if your table contains sales transactions and your application will frequently request sales transactions by product id or even better a invoice details table where in almost every case you will be retrieving all the detail records for a specifc invoice or an invoice table where you often retrieve all the invoices for a particular customer.

278060
binary-tree	tree
they are kinda like a binary-tree except that each node in the tree can have an arbitrary number of entries and child nodes instead of just two

278082
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql

278090
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
what is a good way to create and read an openoffice.org spreadsheet in perl

278104
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
openoffice.org supports a number of formats if you are looking for something that can read write excel-compatible spreadsheets check out spreadsheet parseexcel for reading and spreadsheet writeexcel for writing

278114
code-generation	mygeneration
mygeneration has some nhibernate tempates for code-generation

278121
localization	translation
its my understanding that the recommended approach to localization in wpf is to use the locbaml tool to extract the localizable items into a csv file translation the items into the desired language and regenerate a new sattelite assembly from this csv file

278124
parentheses	keyword
i will says this anywhere in that code you see the type keyword you probably want to use structure instead the syntax used for properties in .net is a little different function calls require parentheses and vb.net doesn t have an any type maybe system.intptr instead

278127
driver	kernel
i succeded in lots of blue screens when running a callback procedure from live videocaptureing source particulary if your callback takes a long time can halt the entire kernel driver

278134
vb.net	vb6
if you have an automated vb6 to vb.net tool and vb6 itself please save the code as a vb6 project and do convert the code

278148
internationalization	globalization
internationalization or globalization is the design and development of a product application or document content that enables easy localization for target audiences that vary in culture region or language

278149
switching	screens
our application pops up when an internet connection is made and after prompting the user to accept the downloads we d like to switching back to the home screens while we do our stuff

278160
exception-handling	try-catch
i have wrapped them all in proper i hope try-catch blocks which log the exception-handling that happen

278164
entity-framework	ado.net
i ve been playing with linq stored procedures with multiple results sets gave us headaches however and i am wondering about the ado.net entity-framework .

278167
vb.net	vb6
your vb6 code has to call windows api functions to do the work and vb.net code has to do the same

278174
textile	bbcode
for my site we went with textile but i ve found that bbcode tends to be the language that most people already know

278181
perl	c++
works on any system that supports perl and searching through all c++ related files in a directory recursively for a given string is as simple as

278194
globalization	localization
globalization is about producing a map from strings or identifiers to translations in other languages while localization is about using that map to find the correct translation

278194
globalization	localization
globalization happens during development localization happens at runtime

278212
addition	modulo
say that n and m are known and you re looking for x under addition modulo k

278220
search-engine	web-crawler
a person writing a search-engine or a web-crawler wouldn t need a screenshot at all

278225
contains	set
in winforms if you contains the image inside a picturebox control the picturebox control can be set to zoom to a particular height width and the image should conform

278232
user-stories	methodology
you can use the user-stories used on the scrum methodology to express your needs a user

278234
actionscript	mxml
javafx script from what i ve seen is quite similar to actionscript and not at all like mxml

278249
constructor	private
note that microsoft made a needed constructor private so i use reflection to access it

278266
put	get
and i don t care if you outsource to india china or the guys down the street - if you re not specific you re likely to get something that will meet the bare minimum of what you put on paper but not what you wanted

278269
ccombobox	clistctrl
you need to use a ccombobox which is basically a combined cedit and clistctrl

278288
ubuntu	debian
you have the debian derived systems like debian ubuntu which use .deb and the apt dpkg family of management tools

278288
aptitude	dpkg
ideally learn the command-line options to do this for yum and rpm and then dpkg and aptitude and you ll have most base covered

278288
debian	rpm
i think the most important thing to remember is that it s generally a mistake to mix packages from different distributions or releases in the same system even if they use the same package format do not install debian .deb files on your ubuntu system or suse rpm files on your fedora system unless you really understand what you re doing

278289
any	set
on the other hand it really shouldn t take any competent notes programmer more than an hour or two to set it up

278297
push	pull
sql-server reporting services supports both on-demand pull and event-based push delivery of reports

278311
driver	kernel
however it would be the kernel driver that directly causes the bsod for example uffe s directshow bsods terence lewis s socket bsods or bsods seen when using bittorrent with certain network adapters

278311
driver	kernel
if you just want a dump file mendelt s suggestion of using windbg is a much better idea than exploiting a bug in a kernel driver

278317
arrayiterator	arrayobject
arrayiterator arrayobject and

278329
contains	any
there s a feature that when you have a debugging build if you instantiate any object that contains the definition for an event even if you don t raise the event it will hold only a small piece of memory indefinitely

278331
value	field
in short i ve followed the tutorial all the way up to where you need to pass the pin value from the text field into the bowling object

278374
unix	bsd
it is part of bsd unix not sure if it is standard

278396
nsmutablearray	nsarray
are you forced to use nsarray and nsmutablearray for data-structures

278404
matplotlib	wxpython
pycrust is part of the wxpython installation and matplotlib should be insalled separately

278419
standard-library	boost
in c++ if i can t use the standard-library or boost i still have a class like this

278422
octal	hex
be warned that the vt102 documentation generally uses octal so keep an ascii table handy if you re using hex

278423
printf	strcat
functions such as strcat strcpy and printf can easily overwrite the end of their target buffers leading to spurious runtime errors and security vulnerabilities

278439
linux	bsd
i see that i can use gettemppath and gettempfilename to create a temporary file but is there any equivalent to the linux bsd mkdtemp function for creating a temporary directory

278440
integer	modulus
then you do a modulus on the integer

278440
integer	digits
so i guess you could say that the real source of the integer to perform the modulus on is a string of digits

278476
getter	setter
why force the getter alongside the setter

278487
methods	extend
check out the class equalshashcodetestcase you can extend this and implement createinstance and createnotequalinstance this will check the equals and hashcode methods are correct

278517
arguments	default
if you mean that you want to start eclipse with some command-line arguments there is no file where you can add those to be used as default

278522
project-management	scrum
as for the project-management recently the scrum methodology helped me to sort out all kind of communication failures

278523
boolean	int
i ve replaced to boolean value with an int shakecount

278527
superclass	subclass
i d rather not manage the extra objects floating around to assure that all superclass features are part of a subclass object

278527
superclass	subclass
i d rather have inheritance to be sure that each subclass is an instance of it s own class plus is an instance of all superclass too

278542
selected	textbox
if type a is selected i want a textbox to be populated with a value from the database and be read only

278572
superclass	subclass
inheritance is a good thing when the subclass really is the same kind of object as the superclass

278572
callback	methods
consequently it is highly likely that your activerecord classes will share a common interface and implementation of methods like what is the primary key whether the current instance is persisted saving the current instance validating the current instance executing callback upon validation and or saving deleting the current instance running a sql query returning the name of the table that the class maps to etc

278572
superclass	inherited
that said as you note there are too many real-life class hierarchies where the subclasses inherited from the superclass out of convenience rather than bearing a true is-a relationship

278572
subclassing	superclass
so it s unsurprising that a change in the superclass will have side-effects on the subclassing

278592
dictionary	arrays
another option which is ugly is to write out all possible values for the second list box into a data structure like an arrays or dictionary

278597
nswindow	nscell
view nsview and subclasses of course nscell and subclasses nswindow and subclasses

278654
websphere	ibm
the upper management is dead set on a websphere ibm portal

278672
order	join
many applications need to build sql queries through code because as you point out some expressions table join order by criteria and so on depend on the user s choices

278676
button	popup
you can see in the dialog above has a browse server button which popup the following dialog

278719
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie7

278739
glassfish	weblogic
most of my experience is on weblogic but i have used jboss and glassfish

278820
multiplication	modulo
for example this methods is a neat way of doing this test without using multiplication modulo or division operators

278835
user-controls	itemtemplate
i know how to create a custom user-controls in wpf but how can i make it so that someone can provide an itemtemplate

278835
user-controls	wpf-controls
i have a user-controls that is a mixture of several other wpf-controls one of them being a listbox

278846
value	field
in your case you d also apply the grammatical convention of removing leading articles to the value in this field

278850
methods	extend
with say a 2d point class and the desire to extend it to higher dimensions you would presumably have to add at least z getter setter modify getdistance and maybe add a getvolume methods

278850
constructor	object
same amount of complexity in the implementation of domain characteristics less complexity in terms of initializing the object constructor takes care of it vs

278867
derived-class	base-class
so i ve got a case where i d like to be able to apply attributes to a virtual methods in a derived-class but i d like to be able to give a default implementation that uses those attributes in my base-class

278887
internationalization	localization
i m guessing that you mean localization or internationalization or i18n

278888
contains	set
it s probably not the best for c++0x experimentation but for people who are msvc oriented there s a community tech preview ctp of vs2010 which contains a preview of vc10 that has some parts of c++0x implemented note that vc10 will not have the full set of c++0x changes implemented even when vc10 is released

278893
value	field
there are other spots where this can come up like html-esque value in form field but i think the error messages for those were more specific

278896
export	csv
what we have done is export the data from our native format to a csv file which can be opened in excel

278910
put	get
when i put in a grouping i get something like this on all records

278925
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch blocks are generally for exception-handling while using blocks are used to ensure that the object is disposed

278927
document	element
i m inserting an img tag into my document with the new element constructor like this this works just fine

278929
export	csv
we export our data either using excel objects com based code on client side or csv file usually on server side but can be used on client side too

278929
export	csv
for one customer we even had to export data from sql stored procedure into csv-like tab-separated format but named file like xxxxx.xls - this way excel opened that file in more correct way than csv file

278938
put	get
you can put this assembly in your own source tree and reference from there and your codeigniter build should get that assembly and everything it needs when it builds

278955
radio-button	selected
for initial visibility selected the hidden radio-button

278983
solaris	linux
have to be portable across solaris and linux hints that cygwin should

278984
firefox	safari
unfortunately only firefox and safari does support it

278989
glassfish	weblogic
i have used weblogic websphere jboss glassfish resin jetty tomcat and a few others over the last 10+ years

278989
glassfish	resin
however resin is immature and i would avoid it relative to glassfish or jboss--i found it problematic to deploy and support

278993
contains	set
there is now 10 nov 2008 a community tech preview ctp of vs2010 which contains a preview of vc10 that has some parts of c++0x implemented note that vc10 will not have the full set of c++0x changes implemented even when vc10 is released

278996
attributes	properties
the data source for gridview with id gridview1 did not have properties or attributes to generate columns

279003
controllers	routes
there was some interesting code relating to routes - mapping urls to the right controllers

279006
python	ruby
there are many similar apis both for python and for other languages notably in ruby on rails

279006
.when	ready
.when you finally are ready to use the query django creates an sql statment that reflects all the ways you adjusted the query object

279006
postgresql	mysql
many databases are supported postgresql mysql sql lite etc

279034
contains	elements
a more important reason is that this design allows your schema to specify that an imageset elements must contains exactly one of each type of image

279059
python	ruby
the reason i use a framework for example django for python or rails for ruby or webforms and mvc for asp.net is because they make it easier and faster to write applications for them

279059
python	ruby
in the case of ruby and python not using a framework for me would make me go crazy

279067
xbox-one	xbox
supported platform include android apple tv blackberry 10 ios linux nintendo 3ds line os x playstation 4 playstation vita unity web player including facebook wii wii u windows phone 8 windows xbox 360 and xbox-one

279084
python	java
by the way i work in java c# and python as my primary languages with lots of others thrown in here and there and using is one of my most favorite language features all around because it is a practical everyday workhorse

.doc	xls
for html content maybe some javascript or flash could triggers the print dialog not sure but if it s a file that has to be opened in a third party application pdf .doc xls etc. you re out of luck

279090
.doc	xls
if it is a printer attached to the server you can use the standard .net facilities for printing although you again may have to work around situations where you are trying to print pdf .doc xls etc. because then you need to use automation either com or something like sendkeys which will cause you headaches on a server

279099
dialog	pop-up
which will pop-up the print dialog when the page loads see this post for more

279109
handler	service
make sure you are registering the service handler in your app using

279137
attributes	properties
the properties getter and setter of an explicitly implemented interface properties has an unusual attributes

279165
reportlab	platypus
it is also worth mentioning that you can bypass the platypus layout system that comes with reportlab if all you want to do is put bit a of text and imagery on a page

279178
textbox	button
i would suggest using a textbox with a search button to find someone from the list rather than using a combo box in this case

279178
listbox	textbox
it s a textbox combined with a listbox

279220
arguments	default
now aside from the param type being a complex type which i m pretty sure my simple attempt will not automagically work with i m breakpointing in my web service and seeing the methods i ve marked as webmethods without renaming it its literally dosomething and seeing the arguments are all default value the int is 0 the string is null etc.

279229
protected	public
the public start will call the protected that will be ovveride in the abstract-class

279242
value	field
i use the uitextfieldtextdidchange notification to observe changes in the text field and i used a nsnumberformatter to turn the resulting number into a formatted currency value to update the label

279242
decimal-point	digits
my solution might be different from what you need because the decimal-point is always fixed -- i use the system s currency setting to determine how many there digits ought to be after the decimal-point

279242
decimal-point	numeric
however the numeric keypad doesn t have a decimal-point on it

279248
getter	setter
bunch of properties and locking at the property getter and setter level looks wrong

279254
ethernet	packets
is the viewmodel sending packets on the same interface it s receiving or is there a second virtual ethernet adapter

279262
log4net	nlog
if you can use a better logging platform such as log4net or nlog which will record the timestamp at which the methods is actually called

279270
double-quotes	single-quotes
up until now i ve always used single-quotes unless the string contains certain escape sequences or interpolation in which case i obviously have to use double-quotes

279279
any	set
note that mysql will implicitly use utf8mb4 encoding if a collation is specified without any explicit character set

279279
specifications	w3c
for html before html5 only note that the w3c html specifications says that clients should default to sending forms back to the server in whatever charset the server served but this is apparently only a recommendation hence the need for being explicit on every single tag

279288
double-quotes	single-quotes
when you have a ton of stuff on the screens lots of single-quotes give you less visual clutter than lots of double-quotes

279306
openfiledialog	streamreader
i m reading a text file streamreader that the user selects with a button event using openfiledialog

279324
postback	ajax
my first approach where simply using an updatepanel and popuplating it with loadcontrol on ajax postback but this would rerender other loaded usercontrols in the same updatepanel

279342
superclass	subclass
you can then treat an instance of ferrari as either an instance of the ferrari subclass with getengine returning the turboengine or as an instance of the car superclass when getengine will return an engine

279366
spaces	output
it is fantastic to be able to see the output breakpoints error list object browser and resharper windowss at the same time without having to make them tiny and dock them in the main windows which leaves less spaces for code

279380
base-class	inherited
something else in my job experience i have found inherited leads to simpler clearer designs when it s brought in late in the project after it s noticed a lot of the classes have much commonality and you create a base-class

279383
oracle	mysql
covers oracle db2 sql server and mysql

279392
profiling	trace
this gives me the correct object graph but a sql profiling trace shows that child pages are being loaded by a separate query for every non-leaf node in the tree

279401
logout	login
when i profiling my application using sql-server profilingr i am seeing lots of audit login and audit logout messages for connections to the same database

279401
logout	login
login and logout events will not be

dictionary	arrays
iterate your arrays add a key the dictionary for each unique elem increment the value each time that element is repeated

279414
installation	upgrade
been trying to upgrade my subversion installation but due to what i believe are limited rights i m using hosted linux account i m not able to properly . configure and compile the source code see posts post1 and post2 if very interested

279415
administration	account
the users privileges depend on which department they work in so for example administration has access to all parts of the application while account only has access to the account-related parts and sales only has access to sales-related parts etc

279421
radio-button	checkbox
however when it prints out i need it to print with the square checkbox style rather than the round radio-button style

279421
radio-button	checkbox
if i can t get this working i m gonna have to create a checkbox to shadow each radio-button use javascript to keep the checkbox and radio-buttons in sync and css to show the one i care about in the proper medium

279431
postgresql	mysql
preferably this would be a sql statement that would work under mysql postgresql oracle etc

279455
hide	show
for instance i hide the show parent link of the row in question has no parent row.

279463
radio-button	selected
your best bet it to make a print button goes to a new page with a graphic in place of the selected radio-button then do a window.print from there

279478
callback	methods
i would like to turn the validation off for derivedmodel and prevent the callback methods from firing preferably without modifying or otherwise breaking basemodel

279493
constructor	object
what is the way to avoid phpunit having to call the constructor for a mock object

279493
constructor	object
otherwise i would need a mock object as constructor argument another one for that etc

279493
constructor	object
i only have one object in the constructor and it is a dependency injection

279501
web-services	api
you could use the sharepoint api if you are on the same server or use web-services

279522
constructor	object
immutable means that once the constructor for an object has completed execution that instance can t be altered

279546
display	width
how could you calculate the minimum width needed to display a string in x lines given that text should break on whitespace

279551
logout	login
as far as metrics monitoring the login and logout events on sql-server is a good start

279557
gridsplitter	grid
wpf gridsplitter makes my grid wider than my windows

279557
gridsplitter	grid
i ve got a wpf grid with a gridsplitter

279557
gridsplitter	grid
how do i keep the gridsplitter from changing the size of my grid

279561
python	c++
what is the idiomatic python equivalent of this c c++ code

279569
triggers	insert
you can use triggers to send email on update delete insert

279584
callback	methods
it turns out that the before_validation_on_create before_save etc methods if not invoked with any arguments will return the arrays which holds all the current callbacks assigned to that callback site

279600
selected	button
it will allow you to customize the button to specify different sizes via a drop down and even selected a quantity when the item is added to the cart

279610
triggers	insert
so can anyone help me with a triggers on an update of the user table to insert the changes into the history table

are there any limitations on what you can set be draggable or clickable

279639
silverlight	wpf
i have written a wpf application that i want to port to silverlight 2

279652
hide	show
if you want to show or hide them place them inside of a div and show or hide that

279696
macros	basic
i understand how most basic macros work but how to implement this one escapes me

279705
any	set
any ideas how to set the path on the remote machine

279728
32-bit	64bit
maybe 32-bit vs 64bit

279747
rewrite	rule
owen also if we had the luxury of using iis 7 as rewrite rules similar to the mod_rewrite rule of apache is now possible from within iis

279749
display	width
another approach might be to get the dimensions of the display in inches and then divide by the width in pixels but i m not sure how to do that either

279753
display	width
if i change the display to inline then the div stays on the same line as the text but it ignores the width and height i have set and collapses

279754
put	get
however you are not going to get something you can put on the modern desktop

279757
webmail	gmail
the one cpan library mail webmail gmail that i tried didn t work and i don t see much activity with it

279761
for-loop	loops
after the loops of forks do another for-loops with waitpid then stop the clock and do the rest

279792
constructor	object
if it is not inlined then the functions must be called even if they don t really do anything and that includes the constructor of an object since the compiler doesn t know whether the constructor modified global variables or did something else weird

279802
webmail	gmail
i had the same problem with mail webmail gmail i ended up using .net imap simple ssl to get my mail from gmail

279805
tstringlist	tlist
tstringlist has the basic tlist type methods and other methods custom to working with strings such as .savetofile and .loadfromfile

279838
entity-relationship	diagram
i made an entity-relationship diagram but i m having trouble insentity-relationshipting it as an image

279841
msbuild	nant
use nant or msbuild to do different environment builds dev test prod etc

279845
value	field
normally a copyback is performed but in the case of a read-only field there is no way to perform the copy back and hence you are still left with an uninitialized value

279848
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you will then better understand the pros and cons of both webforms and asp.net-mvc

279865
put	get
you ll get a menu prompting you if you want to put it in a new horizontal or vertical pane

279867
silverlight	wpf
also this decoupling allows your server to support any client technology that supports http and angle-brackets and or json like wpf silverlight

279904
lookup	any
if the initial population of the lookup table is static make an enum for that and don t reference any other value in the code

279912
pyopengl	pyglet
i am looking to do some tinkering with opengl and python and haven t been able to find good reasons for using pyopengl versus pyglet

279921
redgate	ssms
the best example of this i have seen for ssms is sql prompt by redgate

279934
http	ssl
i believe the best security you could enable would be ssl over http and a standard authentication scheme via a username and password

279942
pyopengl	pyglet
if you re starting out i d try pyglet first and then switch to pyopengl if you feel like you want to get closer to the metal

279952
base-class	inherited
a use multiple table inheritedance and create a eater base-class that cat cow and human inherited from

279967
contains	elements
the number of elements contains in each arrays isn t as important as the size of the tables involved

279991
double-quotes	single-quotes
please tell me how can save a string with special characters to db.special characters may contatin single-quotes double-quotes etc

280017
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
the view also implements touchesbegan touchesmoved to allow dragging

280041
mousemove	mouseover
mousemove seems to be the closest to a mouseover event

280057
pixels	line
b draw a single pixels line in the buttonhighlightcolor along the top and left edges

280057
pixels	line
and c draw a single pixels line in the buttonshadowcolor along the bottom and right edges

280101
htmlspecialchars	addslashes
is there some equivalent to php s htmlspecialchars or addslashes et cetera

280106
jeditorpane	jscrollpane
when the user resizes the comment box i am setting the desired size for jscrollpane and the jeditorpane

280112
compact-framework	.net
the compact-framework is a subset of the full .net so usually code written specifically for cf will run in regular windows but code written for windows may or may not run in cf depending upon what functionality has been utilized

280113
double-quotes	single-quotes
then i found that i was wasting a lot of time when i d go back and have to change some single-quotes to double-quotes

280124
button	slide
i want to show a â œclick to view buttonâ if they click on the button i want to have a box slide down using jquery to display the other details for the record

280130
linux	unix
sadly this answer probably won t help you but if in fact you were using unix linux for example you could do something like

280130
contains	sorted
sort fileb | uniq newfile # newfile now contains a merger of file a and file b with sorted and unique email addresses

280130
linux	unix
i used to have an extra box running linux for the sole purpose of doing stuff like the above which is a hassle under windoze but a breeze under unix type operating systems

280139
getter	setter
are you talking only about getter and setter that have no extra logic and thus effectively directly expose the member or any get-set pairs

280155
passenger	thin
i ve used straight mongrel i ve used mongrel clusters behind apache i ve looked at thin and i m becoming very intrigued by passenger

280155
rubinius	jruby
i ve looked at mri ruby-enterprise-edition rubinius and jruby

280155
ruby-enterprise-edition	passenger
i m leaning toward apache with the worker mpm and passenger + ruby-enterprise-edition simply because it offers immediate stability and simplicity of setup and maintenance

280157
unique	words
this will keep the branch names unique and you can prefix them with a short and descriptive words or two to keep them human readable like resizewindow-43523

280164
environment	execution
the reason i think this is because the endian nes is a property if your execution environment

280167
exception-handling	try-catch
firstly it sounds like you may be using try-catch too often - particularly if you re catching exception-handling

280170
postgresql	mysql
are there technical political reasons you need to use either mysql or postgresql

280189
macros	vba
i want to pass the shape object to the vba macros so that i could do something in the macros depending on the id of the shape object

280189
macros	vba
is it possible to pass the parameter to vba macros

280194
keyboard	mouse
react to any keyboard mouse mouse

280208
macros	vba
i m not sure if a macros can be run on double click but my vba experience does not come from visio

280216
actionscript	mxml
my question is this should i just keep going with the flex tutorials and work my way through mxml and actionscript

280216
actionscript	mxml
is it the same with mxml and actionscript

280218
inlining	inline
even if you mark a function inline it is actually still up to the compiler wither it will actually do the inlining it is just a hint

280247
keyboard	mouse
this underlined letter is called the accelerator key and is standard in windows-applications so that you can use the alt-key and that letter to quickly selected the menu item and then submenu item with the keyboard rather than with your mouse

280260
gettext	poedit
gettext frequently used poedit for all platforms available but complicated

280272
perl	php
the web and html was around even before we started writing stuff in perl php

280289
windows-xp	windows
i have debugged this using delphi 2009 on windows-xp 64 and the root cause for the missing accelerators seems to be that windows sends wm_drawitem messages with the ods_noaccel flag set which it shouldn t if the system is set to show accelerators at all times

280294
hide	show
to have 2000 and xp menus show accelerator keys right-click an empty spot on the desktop choose properties click the appearance tab and under effects uncheck hide underlined letters for keyboard navigation until i press the alt key

280302
environment	building
i still need to keep tracking on what building is in what environment to be able to revert a release if something went wrong

280302
configuration	environment
i also like the way you get version controlled configuration files on the server since production environment always have different configuration from the development environment

280324
instances	self
if i remember correctly self is reference to a particular instances of the class so when is it not necessary

280327
32-bit	64bit
while working on a .net application let s say an asp.net one are there any difference in the way you would do things while working on the 64bit platform as compared to working on a 32-bit platform

280332
instances	self
in those instances if you do not use self then you will create only a local-variables of that name

280332
constructor	object
the act of passing self to the wx.panel constructor associated it with the current object in some fashion so it doesn t just disappear when the function returns

280336
instances	self
self is always required when referring to the instances itself except when calling the base-class constructor wx.frame.__init__

280342
backwards-compatibility	compatibility
i d probably say if you want backwards-compatibility use tstringlist and if you want forwarding compatibility perhaps the option to change that list of strings to say list of int64s in the future then go for tlist

280344
32-bit	64bit
you can use the long type with fewer concerns about performance in the 64bit version a long fits into a register whereas in the 32-bit version the jit code will need multiple machine instructions for a single long operation

280348
worksheet	excel
there is a bug memory leak occurs when you query an open excel worksheet by using activex data objects which iirc is actually in the ole db provider for jet which you are using although this isn t confirmed in the above article

280348
worksheet	excel
to create a new excel workbook execute create table ddl using a non-existent xls file in the connection string and the provider will create the workbook for you with a worksheet to represent the table

280372
32-bit	64bit
however if you re using 3rd party dlls and your 64bit app tries to link to a 32-bit dll you ll get a runtime exception-handling

280372
32-bit	64bit
a 64bit app can call an out-of-process com object that s 32-bit and vice-versa as you re moving across a process boundary and com will take care of the marshalling for you

280372
32-bit	64bit
you never really have to worry about pointer sizes and the clr types have explicit sizes int is always 32-bit long always 64bit

280399
sqldatareader	sqlclient
i m using .net sqlclient sql sqldatareader and i am get an exception-handling in code when calling the executescalar function - an an error occurs during my delete operation in the sp

280403
export	csv
2. export a few thousand rows into a series of csv files

280407
json	xml
i m all for json in many situations especially where weight or client-side work is a concern but moving away from xml loses readability so important in those config files and the power of tomorrow s problem solutions like xslt and xpath

280407
json	xml
aside my habit is to use xml internally and transform that to json where that s the desired output

280412
show	next
some exception-handling in the web parts snuck into production but instead of causing the entire page to halt a friendly message was show buying us a great deal of time in fixing the problem next release instead of hotfix

280424
any	set
but i m getting the impression you are defining it as an internal application where the rdbms would be set in stone and the system wouldn t have to be interoperable with any other systems whether internal or external

280424
sql-server	mysql
what happens when you get a new cto who is an open source evangelist and wants to change the rdbms from sql-server to mysql

280443
unicode	wstring
no conversion required if you use unicode strings such as cstring or wstring

280453
ostream	std
a similar example of using this is when you derive from std ostream but don t want random people to write into your stream

280483
decrement	increment
another possibility would be to set the bonus value to 0 at the beginning and decrement it by 5 if the player loses and increment it by 5 if the player wins

280494
aggregate-functions	sum
i have a grouping by clause in a sql statement and need to use an aggregate-functions to minus all the values in each grouping instead of adding like the sum function

280524
markup	xhtml
some browsers that have xml-parsing can treat xhtml markup served as application xhtml+xml as xml

280524
markup	xhtml
so when you use xhtml markup you re giving something alien to browsers and seeing if it comes out as you intend

280524
markup	xhtml
what xhtml compliance is good for is syntax checking by validating to see if the markup is well formed

280540
order	join
at one time long ago until about 1995 oracle used to have only a rule based optimiser and with this it was certainly the case that the order of predicates in the where-clause and the order of tables in the from clause there was no join syntax then affected the query plan this was documented to be the case

280542
order	add
i would like to enhance the xsl transformation with a mechanism that allows me to add meta data in order to provide more details for the transformation

280542
attributes	properties
i thought of something like the java properties notation to assign attributes to an xpath

280555
value	field
avoid using concatenation of field value in sql code

280555
value	field
this is fine unless a textual field value is used as part of its construction

280555
value	field
a second-level injection vunerability exists if the field s value is then used in some sql string concatenation inside a stored procedure

280571
stderr	stdout
i am confused about how popen redirects stdin stdout and stderr of the child process in unix

280580
simpletest	phpunit
my main reason for using phpunit over simpletest is that it has great phing integration

280587
file-descriptor	stdin
now if you have your stdout closed in your parent then if the child calls open it will get 1 since that s if stdin is already opened the next free file-descriptor

280605
difference	count
difference between count and count 1 in oracle

280628
stderr	stdout
if you want to capture the stderr too that s possible but then you ll need three pipe and a selected loop to arbitrate reads between the stdout and stderr streams

280650
startup	launch
the only really unavoidable factors in performance between c# and c++ is that c# apps have to do more at startup load the .net and perhaps jit some code so all things being equals they will launch a bit slower

280690
httplistener	http
i m developing an application that is so far using httplistener to provide a small standalone http server

280730
msbuild	nant
we use nant to do our builds using the msbuild task to do the compile and cruise control .net to do our codeigniter

280730
ndepend	fxcop
i have written ndepend cql query to enforce a few rules that are hard to implements in fxcop

280735
isapi-rewrite	isapi
if you decide to go with an isapi filtering we ve had good experiences with ionic s isapi-rewrite

280738
job-queue	queue
if you mean that jobs can be grouping you probably need a job-queue and put subitems in another table that is not a queue just a regular table with a foreign key pointing to the job item

280750
content-length	content-type
you have the content-length in the header and additionally there is the content-type in the header of the file part each file has its own header which is the purpose of multipart encoding

280750
content-length	content-type
server-side check the header content-length content-type .

280754
constructor	object
then you can control when such an object is created by constructor of the wrapper class or one of the methods of the class

280838
key-value	key
i need an algorithm to store a key-value pair where the key is an int64

280840
debian	linux
i switched from mongrel cluster to passenger two weeks ago debian linux server

280861
google-chrome	opera
all browsers respect definition order with the exception of google-chrome and opera which do for every non-numerical property name

280863
groovy	java
here s a small groovy script showing the concept i hope - note this is java under the scripting language

280863
methods	extend
in the case where it is not possible to extend the base class like string a static methods s class as kgiannakakis described is fine

280870
revision	updates
you can create a post-commit hook on the repository-machine which tells the dev-machine to updates its revision

280872
macros	vba
i m trying to write a vba macros for a group tha

280874
diagram	erd
is there a way to exchange erd diagram from one tool to other as xmi exists for exchanging uml document

280890
windows-vista	windows
if you re on windows-vista or later the certificates mmc snap-in allows you to control permissions on that private-key but for earlier versions of windows it s a bit harder

280894
export	csv
i need to automate it so that each night this query can run and export to a tab delimited csv file

280894
export	csv
it is not possible to export a query to a csv file from within access

280894
export	csv
my question is are there any tools that can selected certain tables or perform an sql query on an mdb file and export to a csv file

280899
communication	messages
this link has a good overview of the communication flow for messages based security and has sample code

280900
export	csv
however i do not see why you say it is not possible to export a query to a csv file from within access.

280902
nvidia	ati
consider if you can use gpu processing - nvidia and ati provide the cuda and ctm frameworks and there is an ongoing standarization effort from the khronos grouping opengl

280909
affinity	cpu
is there a progamatic methods to set cpu affinity for a process in c++ for the linux operating system

280912
hash	md5
i always compare an md5 hash of the modulus using these commands

280914
rolap	ssas
i m trying to configure storage mode rolap for a partition in an existing ssas cube

280915
enterprise-architect	visio
for example once i made a python scripting that would interpreter the sql output from visio enterprise-architect to generate mif files for a data dictionary document

280965
export	csv
actually you can export a query to a csv file from within access

280968
filtering	sorting
the class implements some of the required interfaces that enable sorting and filtering in a datagridview

280976
.when	ready
i did try out a linq-to-nhibernate beta and .when that s ready it s definately the way to go for me .when i have to do something with a database again

280978
filtering	grouping
finding the maximum value within a collection or filtering or grouping etc

280996
affinity	cpu
look in cpu affinity for more details

281008
triggers	insert
once i know that the code works properly for all the cases i global replace #insert with insert and add the create triggers code around it and voila a tested triggers

281028
bug-tracking	fogbugz
basecamp is pretty difficult to use for bug-tracking once you get a fair number in there assign to various people - the ability to sort is lacking beyond just turning people on and off - you ll be much happier with a full bug-tracking solution such as fogbugz

281046
ref	out
an msdn article for both ref and out parameters

281049
ref	out
well i have an article on what ref out do - but it doesn t discuss whether or not you should use them

281049
ref	out
in other words avoid out ref where you can do so easily but don t go massively out of your way to avoid them

281081
keyboard	mouse
i m looking for a way to connect a windows-mobile device to a pc via bluetooth and have it show up on the pc as a hid device keyboard or mouse

281106
unsafe	out
in order to do this you will have to compile the app with the unsafe compiler switching as you re bouncing out of the safety .net of managed-code as soon as you start dealing with memory addresses directly

281107
aes	des
looking though the code with reflector it looks like the algorithm is des if the key is 8 bytes long and aes rijndael otherwise

281132
any	set
is there any difference between a volatile object reference and atomicreference in case i would just use get and set -methods from atomicreference

281133
click	mouse
what would be the easiest way to move the mouse around and possibly click using python on os x

281142
getattr	setattr
in c++ instead of a getattr setattr pair it is common to provide two overloads of an attr function

281155
sendmessage	message
use postmessage or sendmessage instead which place the message in the target process s windows message pump -- which is exactly what you want

281213
sql-server	mysql
the 2 reasons i m leaning towards mysql is in that 1 if it ever becomes too big for a shared hosting provider that would be a much cheaper option and 2 i will need to be able to create multiple databases and from what i have seen of the shared hosting providers sql-server is limited to 1 or 2 databases while they allow quite a few mysql databases

281225
gnome	kde
for example emacs runs pretty much contrary to every interface guideline on os x or windows and probably even gnome kde and it s not going away any time soon

281230
value	field
value for the field

281241
versioning	upgrade
we haven t been able to use linq yet because we re still on 2.0 and haven t been allowed to upgrade to a newer versioning

281246
internet-explorer	firefox
i have to add either an embed tag for firefox or an object tag for internet-explorer with javascript to address the appropriate activex plugin depending on the browser

281247
mapping	unique
i understand nhibernate wants a mapping per class and so my initial thought was to have a base serial class and then inherit from it for each different database and create a unique mapping file the inherited class would have zero content

281247
base-class	inherited
what i would then like to do is save these inherited classes not sure what the proper term is to the base-class table using the base-class mapping

281247
base-class	inherited
casting the inherited class to the base-class does nothing when using session.save it complains of no mapping

281247
base-class	inherited
or is there just some oop principal i am missing to more specifically cast an inherited class to base-class

281257
assign	add
in the child form in this example it s a form with a textbox on it you just need to add the showdialog overload and assign user-interface value to the out parameter

281259
buffering	streaming
if you turn off buffering and pump the bytes into the output streaming yourself then you should set the content-length header yourself because effectively buffer off means you are taking responsibility for exactly what gets sent to the client

281280
windows-media-player	embed
that should work it does just fine for me - i use it to embed windows-media-player in a page

281306
arrays	loops
you may find it easier to loops over your arrays and build a new arrays out of the items you want to keep from the arrays than by trying to loops and splice as has been suggested since modifying the length of the arrays while it is being loopsed over can introduce problems

281310
export	report
alternatively you can export report and use them

281331
json	xml
note i use xml for configs system building code generation and similar tasks but json for rpc sql for queries and persistency and finally yaml here and there for logging and quick tasks in other words choose the appriopiate format for the need

281342
javafx	swing
i have been a happy swing user but sun seems like pushing swing to deprecation while pushing javafx which is not yet ready for prime time

281342
javafx	swing
from the forum comments on seems like majority of sun resources that previously worked on core swing are now developing javafx full time

281344
rollback	commit
then you can choose to commit or rollback same

281354
put	get
using cvs keyword expansion you could put in the file and it will get replaced with the date of the last checkin

281356
command-prompt	command-line
this command-prompt has all the necessary .net environment variables set for the the command-line session

281363
assign	add
however despite deleting the old files from the repo every time i add the file with the same name it automatically assign unicode encoding to the file

281369
mp3	wma
i have found a few libraries to edit mp3 tags ultraid3lib is great but none that will edit tags for wma files

281370
rollback	commit
the obvious downside of this is that you might forget to add a commit or rollback at the end or worse still your colleagues will add commit at the end of every scripting by default

281377
associations	model
if you post your model associations i m sure we could really square you away

281382
populate	row
can t you set a default constraint on the column that would automatically populate the timestamp column when a row is inserted to the table

281387
rollback	commit
the caveat is that now you have to tell them to commit or rollback because for sure they re going to lock up your db at least once

281391
any	set
since you re not setting any width in your li s i suggest skipping the float and set display inline on your li s instead if you want them on a row

281391
margins	padding
adjust with padding margins to get appropriate spacing between them and line-height to get correct behaviour for any eventual 2nd line

281400
directory	folder
if they are other resources such as graphics perhaps you have a customer-specific set of folder under one directory

281402
communication	messages
i know that privileged admin applications and user applications cannot send messages to each other or communication in any way

281419
jquery	.post
verify that the jquery code is executing after the browser is done loading on .post back

281421
javafx	swing
swing didn t evolve in the last say 10 years bugs aren t fixed the development has stopped in favor of javafx so you won t ever see any new features too

281421
javafx	swing
javafx will probably look great but is still vaporware and it s made by the people who let swing starve to death so i m not putting any money on it

281430
checkbox	textbox
if textbox following that checkbox is empty you aren t generating the xml documentation file

281443
google-chrome	safari
webkit safari google-chrome browsers insert an extra text node at the end of the body tag

281446
text-editor	editor
frankly i ve never seen an editor which comes even close to what i can do manually in a text-editor

281451
constructor	object
all resources that have a manual create and release should be wrapped in an object so these actions are done in the constructor destructor

281453
floating	clearfix
you re floating your elements so their parent needs to clear reset the flow via the clearfix hack

281469
attributes	properties
what you might be able to do is provide both a getter and a setter but throw a notimplementedexception in the abstract setter decorate it with the appropriate attributes and document so that no one uses it unless the setter has been properties overridden

281479
gtk	swt
as for other platforms swt is phenomenal on windows-vista and xp and almost as good on gtk linux

281479
look-and-feel	swt
however if a simpler api is more important to you or if your users demand the ultimate in platform look-and-feel fidelity swt is the best choice

281480
sql-agent	msde
while a number of these difference are in the favor of sql express we found that the critical items for us were the ability to run as a publisher which only msde supports as well as the lack of a sql-agent in express

281485
authentication	login
my software authorizes the user prior to booting mac os x tiger and leopard. i want to use sfauthenticationpluginview to create a plugin to attempt to use our pre-boot authentication cached securely for user login to mac os x for single-sign-on capability

281488
unsigned	integer
the queue is implemented as a circular buffer unsigned queue maxlength and it stores integer indices into a table of states

281488
queue	fifo
i could also expand the states in a different order so in this case it s not really important if i break the fifo properties of the queue

281509
hsqldb	mysql
you ll probably also want a database like mysql or hsqldb

281509
restart	reload
you could replace tomcat with jetty which is often easier to get class changes to reload without restart the server

281512
tiff	png
i am having issues converting a png to tiff

281521
versioning	upgrade
recently my company underwent an upgrade re operating systems and visual-studio versioning so i m stuck with windows-vista and visual-studio 2008

281532
click	mouse
if you really want to use a jlabel you could add a mouse listener to it to capture click and react to them

281534
vb.net	vb6
recently i changed the first function from vb6 to vb.net still using an access database

281536
constructor	object
of course this assumes that foo is copyable and that its copy constructor is not too expensive but it avoids memory leaks and you don t have to remember to delete the foo object

281554
dump	temp
sp_who2 is useful - especially if you dump the results to a temp table and then pull out only the blocking information

281557
button	popup
in the property sheets click the ... button beside the addition include directories line and expand the macros button in the dialog that popup

281568
jar	war
this guy seems to have worked around the problem by extracting the tld from the jar modifying it placing it in the war s web-inf directory and adding an entry to his web.xml like this

281587
firefox	safari
firefox and safari were ok with that ie wasn t so it s possible that whoever wrote the code didn t even know it was a problem

281595
64bit	x86
as far as hardware int64 will be more efficient on an x64 and ia64 than x86 because the 64bit processors have 64bit registers to perform the operations on them

281603
arguments	undefined
note that the code sample you posted has undefined behavior - the commas that separate function parameters are not sequence points those commas are not the comma operator so modifying i and or j multiple times in the function call arguments list results in undefined behavior

281606
udp	tcp
why does udp have a length field in the header and tcp does not

281606
udp	tcp
i am guessing that the length of the segment in tcp is inferred from the ip header but one should be able to do the same for a udp datagram

281642
freebsd	linux
the stability is huge factor for me and freebsd makes up where linux and windows leave you wanting

281647
any	set
when you create a control make sure you add them to the page first and set any properties on them afterwards

281651
memcached	apc
there s all kinds of downsides to using temporary files mainly it s slower and if you really need a way to store the buffering before outputing it go look for memcached or apc cache

281666
sql-server	oracle
both microsoft sql-server and oracle have support for database encryption

281667
cassini	iis
more answers for cassini v iis here

281688
cassini	iis
the xp version of iis has limitation that are not present in the server version that cassini side-steps

281688
cassini	iis
the only argument i know against is that there are a couple very rare edge cases where the cassini built-in server doesn t exactly mimic iis because you re using odd port numbers

281688
cassini	iis
i doubt you ll ever run into them and using cassini as the primary dev environment does not preclude developers from also having access to iis on the machine

281688
cassini	iis
in fact my preferred setup is cassini first for most small work then deploy to my local iis for more in-depth testing before moving code back to the shared source repository

281728
sendmessage	message
you can then use a single sendmessage methods which is responsible for dispatching the message to all controls that can handle that message

281734
derived-class	base-class
you ve hidden the base-class s erase member function by defining a function in the derived-class with the same name but different arguments

281738
derived-class	base-class
it only looks in the base-class if no overloads were found in the derived-class

281738
derived-class	base-class
a simple solution to that is to introduce the functions you need from the base-class into the derived-class namespace

281738
derived-class	base-class
alternatively of course you could simply write a small helper function in the derived-class redirecting to the base-class function

281748
quicksort	big-o
big-o like the system quicksort but possibly with a worse multiplier

281749
show	next
for the benefit of the next person who needs an example below is my code which moves a process icon which has been placed on a visio grid and show the continuous motion animation looking at the preview it seems that my indentation has been eliminated

281786
processor	cpu
if your database is using 3-20 cpu and the final performance is still unacceptable it means that you don t lack processor power since it is most of the time idle

281805
rollback	commit
if it is being run manually you don t run the rollback or commit until you see the number of records affected

281805
rollback	commit
running in a transaction may mean you have other problems when people forget to commit or rollback and lock up the system

281812
function-call	inline
however this isn t always true -- if your inline function was only used once there s little change and if the inline function is very small you could get a .net reduction in code size by removing the function-call overhead

281812
inlining	inline
inlining won t affect heap usage as the same allocations and deallocations would occur for the inline code as would occur for the non-inline versioning

281816
serialization	marshalling
what you need is object serialization or object marshalling

281839
value	field
just check if the field starts with a given value which you can achive whith something like this

281841
convention	standards
use a standards naming convention for these tests in the project test directory

281846
subclassing	superclass
you can interpreter a subclassing as an instances of a superclass but not vice sersa

281882
testng	junit
they are built using junit or testng and interact with the system under test using something like selenium that hits the web pages as if they were users

281890
annotations	mapping
ddl to mapping files and so on but i can t find any command-line tools for simple ddl generation from jpa annotations classes

281943
xhtml	tidy
thinking of gurin s answer one possible xslt-based pathway for html is to use tidy to convert it to xhtml apply xslt to the xhtml but use to get html back out

281944
aquamacs	emacs
under emacs btw you mentioned aquamacs go with emacs.app instead i then specify via the preferences to have option command and command option

281945
worksheet	excel
i have multiple parts of a largish program relying on using a query as an input point to construct an excel worksheet using ben s poi so it s somewhat important i can continue to use it as a query to avoid a relatively large rewrite

281951
administration	account
the service is running under a domain account that is a local administration on mycomputer

281957
priority-queue	queue
if the prioritization is important implement a priority-queue class that handles that automatically by placing the devicemessage objects in priority order as they re inserted into the queue

281959
command-prompt	cmd
on a cmd-prompt to get help setting that up with the cmd

281996
put	get
when you put them all together you basically get something where you can write plain text in one end and get encrypted binary data out having stored it in memory temporarily of the other end

281999
png	ico
i have an ico file that contains a 48x48 and a 256x256 vista png version as well as the 32x32 and 16x16 versions

282002
arrays	loops
my first thought is to use .indexof in a loops and build an arrays of term distances subtract the index of the found term from the previously found term then .

282019
getter	setter
preferrably without loads of getter setter

282045
ndepend	fxcop
tigraine has mentioned fxcop - there s also ndepend which is somewhat different - a code analysis package which can identify design issues

282046
hide	show
show and hide do just that

282048
getter	setter
if you need to save memory i would make getter and setter that manipulate bits of internal integers or similar

282056
constructor	object
since you have to define variables in the h file and initialize them in the constructor setup of an object it s easy to forget

282056
arrays	loops
off-by-one errors on for loops arrays access

282062
attributes	properties
i can set the stretch amount properties in xaml using the attributes syntax

282067
constructor	object
i m using the oracleparameter constructor that takes the name and the value as an object i assume the data type is then implied from the datatype of the object but since sometimes the value of my parameter is null it s being set as a string therefore throwing this error

282067
constructor	object
i don t want to use the constructor that takes the datatype explicitly because i use reflection heavily to build the oraclecommand object and its parameters

282080
csv	xml
you re not parsing the data into a dom so you re not really able to make use of the benefits that xml gives you over say csv -- ensuring well-formedness schema validation transformation querying etc

282103
asp.net-mvc	webforms
now to the asp.net-mvc or webforms question

282103
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc gives you total control over the html css and javascript that is emitted but requires more work whereas webforms gives you ease of development but without 100 control over the markup that is emitted

282103
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you can do lots with webforms and the introduction of asp.net-mvc doesn t threaten the future of webforms

282107
chdir	mkdir
can t you just do this by creating the dir with mkdir then chmod it 777 the change directory with chdir and then create the file touch

282117
contains	any
any control on the form must be contains by the form hence it gets chopped off

282118
checkbox	button
i know that you can use a checkbox control and set it s appearance property to button but it doesn t look right

282119
silverlight	wpf
i wouldn t worry about winforms wpf or silverlight for now

282123
delphi	c++
rudy s delphi corner is the best resource i know of regarding delphi and c c++ interoperability

282123
delphi	c++
his pitfalls of conversion is pretty much a must read when using c c++ apis in delphi

282133
implements	final
just because someone can implements something with a high degree of confidence does not mean it goes into your release without passing through the same final cycles and the code freeze is an important part of that

282134
sql-server	mysql
first you ll need a way to store the information - this will be a combination of c# and some persistence strategy like mysql or sql-server or xml

282134
silverlight	wpf
in this step use every presentation technology that you re interested in - wpf winforms asp.net asp.net with asp.net-mvc silverlight - whatever you re interested in

282146
sql-server	mysql
my background in programming has been vb c# .net php c++ and mostly mysql although i have used sql-server on a much smaller scale

282157
base-class	inherited
assuming one has an abstract base-class foo with __get defined and a child class bar which inherited from foo with a private variables will the parent __get be called when trying to access the private from outside the class

282162
simpletest	phpunit
simpletest and phpunit which i prefer

282164
mta	sta
i have messages coming in on mta threads that need to be serviced on sta threads

282164
implements	extends
you d have to implements a custom collection or perhaps extends bc to implements queue item priorities

282170
macros	vba
if you want it in vba i got this from a recorded macros

282186
installation	building
our main building consist of over 61 discrete steps covering compiles for java c++ c# and installation building for 5 different os platforms

282201
message	alert
is there any way to force outlook to display html in the desktop alert instead of text for a multi-part message

282205
exception-handling	error-handling
there is no inheritance and no real exception-handling so expect to write a lot of boilerplate code for error-handling and basic form functions repeated over and over

282205
basic	vb6
appleman s developing com activex components in visual basic 6 has quite a good treatment of the ins and outs of com s interaction with vb6

282216
constructor	object
the fact that this function has a name helps the casual reader know what it does but to really understand what it is doing one has to have an understanding of why this function might be necessary how javascript object properties can be referenced what data types javascript supports how constructor functions work how anonymous functions work etc

282221
version-control	cvs
at my workplace we are using cvs as the version-control system

282221
bazaar	git
is there anything like those front-ends for one of the distributed vcs bazaar hg git

282222
having	select
i know how to use the select and if..then statements in sql plus but i m having a difficulties having a unix script to point to variables if abc to select...

282228
administration	account
what we are seeing is that when our application runs as local administration account everything works well

282241
keyboard	mouse
ideally it would be a tool that records mouse clicks and keyboard presses and takes screenshots at that point of time

282245
click	mouse
onclick - mouse click an object

282262
perl	php
if i need to use a php solution then so be it but first are there any simple forums that are written in perl that you d suggest

282263
defined	declare
i don t mean just the standard names please prefix all symbols declare defined in public headers with a specific string and avoid any name that anybody else might have ever though about using

282271
keyboard	mouse
could then give keyboard and mouse

282279
directory	folder
i then tried running it outside of the release folder in the bin directory and what do you know it worked

282317
subclassing	base-class
the base-class might become just a placeholder for utility functions for the subclassing

282332
sitemesh	stripes
we want to keep moving forwarding with our new stuff using tomcat stripes and sitemesh

282342
gethashcode	equals
gethashcode and equals shouldn t be in system.object - not everything s suitable for hashing

282350
identity-column	sql-server
if you are stuck with sql-server 2000 the typical technique was to create a new temporary table to contain the result of your query plus add an identity-column and generate incremental values

282365
type-erasure	reification
generics type-erasure no reification generics

282366
arguments	default
default arguments handling specifically the fact that you can change the default arguments for future callers

282366
private-members	private
lack of proper private-members and functions convention just says that most things that start with underscore are private except for all the stuff like __getattr__ that isn t

282377
base-class	inherited
in visual-studio how do i show all classes inherited from a base-class

282377
base-class	inherited
for example in asp.net-mvc there are several actionresult types -- and they all inherited from implement the base-class actionresult

282392
unsigned	short
lots of nasty little bits of c poking through in particular all the conversions between short int unsigned etc..

282402
parentheses	keyword
off the top of my head the only place where there isn t whitespace between identifiers and keyword and whatnot is after a function name and before the following parentheses

282413
decimal	hex
just for the record you don t need it to be an html entity in theory you could use any unicode character encoded as a character entity like decimal or hex

282421
aquamacs	emacs
not sure if you re totally married to using emacs from the terminal but another option is to use carbon emacs my favorite and aquamacs very mac-like

282436
python	php
i ll do php as i like it at times and python will be done way too much

282436
wamp	php
php is right there and it s so ubiquitous it takes only 5 minutes to install a full lamp or wamp stack

282445
perl	php
it has a much smaller library compared to php perl java etc

282445
explode	implode
for all it s otherwise excellentt list handling i miss php s built-in explode and implode

282448
pointers	stack
elements have minoccurs 0 yet when i submit requests without them i get errors returned back indicating they re required sometimes even stack traces of null pointers exception-handling

282448
boolean	int
nearly all of the web service functions specify a response that includes an int to indicate success really a boolean and an error message string

282460
versioning	upgrade
how can i determine current versioning of my repository to see if i need to upgrade it svnadmin upgrade

282471
contains	set
you then set datanavigateurlformatstring to something contains 0 1 etc

282491
buffering	streaming
your optimization can easily be compared to what you usually do with streaming you use a buffering

282492
identity-column	sql-server
you want sql-server to concentrate on running the new requests as they come in and not on maintaining a gap-less identity-column

282516
deep-copy	object
comments along the lines of deep-copy or recursive call to copy object properties and so forth can quickly elucidate for the programmer who isn t green behind the ears but doesn t know all the particulars of javascript s peculiarities

282519
singleton	facade
one solution is to use a singleton and have one or both of the application and facade register with that singleton

282545
compact-framework	.net
i m writing my first windows ce app using the .net compact-framework v3.5

282545
system.web	.net
it appears that the .net cf does not have system.web

282560
interop	tlbimp
then i changed the namespace of the interop in the testing code - it varied from the one in the main code because of different argument use when using tlbimp

282561
string.format	stringbuilder
when you use string.format it internally uses a stringbuilder to create the string

282569
sequences	unique
sequences are required to be unique but they are not required to be sequential

282580
bmp	png
when that vector based file is rendered to a bitmap based format - bmp png tiff jpg etc.

282618
button	popup
it s generally untrusted - associated with scummery such as blocking the back button popup that never die etc

282635
g++	gcc
you can check what gcc g++ do by using the -s option

282635
g++	gcc
gcc and g++ more or less behave the same in this case

282641
derived-class	base-class
read from one database in your derived-class write to another database in your base-class

282643
codeigniter	cakephp
on the other hand i ve never played around with codeigniter so i can t recommend cakephp over codeigniter

282659
glassfish	weblogic
i downloaded a free glassfish server from sun then as i am an oracle developer downloaded the latest jdeveloper which comes with a weblogic server from bea oracle

282659
glassfish	weblogic
i want to write a soap interface to my oracle 10g can i get away with the glassfish server why should i used a weblogic server and how does this differ from the oracle application server for j2ee apps

282677
sql-server	oracle
a really good data access layer should allow you to swap out oracle sql-server access a flat text file xml or whatever you want and doing so would be transparent to the other application layers

282681
annotations	mapping
annotations play well with xml configuration files so you might have to add a hibernate configuration file to your project with the mapping that you need

282696
perl	php
unfortunately the website provider for my friend s site only allows perl or php cgi-bin scripts

282696
perl	c++
is there an easy way to simply have a very small perl or php wrapper that just calls the c++ compiled binary

282696
perl	c++
would the c++ program still be able to read from stdin for post commands or would it have to be read by the perl or php and then forwarded

282698
http	ssl
your best bet in this scenario is to use an iframe which contains an http ssl page that just contains thelogin control

282708
perl	php
it can be a security risk and if they specifically only allow php and perl then they would probably specifically disable as many methods of running non-php perl as they could

282722
key-value	key
this contrasts with hashtable which allow you to store key-value pairs later retrieving the value based on the key

282723
arrays	loops
if you store them all in an arrays then you have to loops through the entire arrays comparing each entry s student id with the one you are looking for

282725
perl	c++
also perl has a lot of inline classes that allow you to write code in other languages to be called in perl including one for c++

282730
georss	kml
the easiest way to do this is to selected to xml and then transform the data into georss or kml

282764
value	field
the value of the first field of each line make model may contains 0 or more actual spaces

282764
value	field
the value of the other field in each line contains no spacess so a spaces delimiter works fine for them

282774
triggers	insert
i ve been in a situation like you jpa hibernate sequence for non id field and i ended up creating a triggers in my db schema that add a unique sequence number on insert

282776
arrays	loops
now that you ahve read in each arrays you should walk across it with another loops and check the value in each one

282788
virtualization	virtualbox
using virtualization is working like a charm though and you can go the easy way with software like virtualbox

282794
any	set
my approach was to construct a command-line that has the right environment variables set from the cgi query params and then do substitution on the resulting output so that any links back to the cgi would go to my wrapper scripting instead

282798
http	ssl
i d recommend getting an ssl certificate and requiring http any time users submit a password to your website

282802
revision	svn
i know that i can svn diff -r a b repo to view the changes between the two specified revision

282809
value	field
then you can just bind the visible property of the hyperlink field to that value - no rowdatabound required

282811
cassini	iis
i don t think it simulates either tbh it just a webserver for local development where iis is not an option based off cassini

282815
order	join
you have to use the join keyword and define the relationship between the entities in order to make a proper inner join

282818
typedef	struct
in c++ you cannot name a function the same name as a class struct typedef

282821
registration	login
i believe that the time would be better spent in ensuring that the user registration and login pages are easy to access and understand allowing the user ample time and space to see whether they ll stay logged in

282823
registration	login
member data registration information login

282825
put	get
dont get me wrong i believe ruby-on-rails has brought very good ideas to the mainstream like convention over configuration but has this oversimplification just put this line of code and .

282831
firefox	safari
i am trying to see what are the gotchas in using xmlhttpwebrequest such that it works for safari firefox and ie

282835
hash	md5
a simple hash function md5 sha1 whatever accumulates the bytes of the object to create a 4-byte number

282836
arrays	map
now the hash map uses this hash value to place the value into an arrays

282836
arrays	map
it is possible for two different keys to hash to the same value or two different hashes to map to the same arrays index

282836
linked-list	tree
the simplest is to use a linked-list or binary tree for each arrays index

282838
click	mouse
catching the mouse click etc..

282851
solaris	linux
note in response to robert gamble s totally reasonable solution our code is cross-platform and we have people and builds on linux solaris and windows so the new-line.

282857
any	set
if you want the line to be just a simple horizontal or vertical line put another panels disabled so it doesn t pick up any mouse events on the main panels set its height or width to 3 or 4 pixels or whatever you want and bring it to front

282858
.when	ready
.when we are ready to push the new view to production is there an easier way to do it other than manually repeat the steps to set it up on the production install

282863
selected	listbox
the problem is easily reproducable by creating a new windows form project adding a property grid and a listbox to the form and setting the listbox as the property grid s selected object

282873
json	xml
i ve used asp.net ajax for a while but without ever worrying about json or xml communication

282876
sysadmin	root
dev database on my localmachine with root login as sysadmin

282904
account	api
i ve checked the account s api rate limit and it s well within the boundaries

282904
account	api
quick update on this turns out the problem was on twitter s end--the account in question had tighter than normal api limits imposed for some reason

282905
notepad++	emacs
another thing - notepad++ supports lisp syntax coloring but it doesn t have an integrated lisp console like emacs does

282905
command-line	cmd
would it be fine to just have a notepad++ windows and a cmd line windows open side-by-side and use the cmd-line whenever i want to run my program

282916
arrays	loops
i am extremely new at php and i was wondering if someone could help me use either a for or while loops to create an arrays 10 elements in length

282938
selected	button
i have a dialog with a selected color push button which pops a qcolordialog

282940
javascript	dom
a different approach would be to have in your javascript an array that represents the data that would go into the dom nodes sort that data and then regenerate the div that holds the dom nodes

282945
delegation	dealloc
one thing to look for especially is that if you have passed a reference of a class to something else as a delegation that you free it in your dealloc methods

282947
macros	let
the vim macros language is a powerful one which can let you run external programs including the one in the current edit buffer

282947
emacs	vim
but if you re used to notepad++ you ll probably find it as hard to move to vim as you would to emacs so maybe your proposed solution is the best one

282948
any	set
getbundle loads a set of candidate bundle files generated using the specified locale if any and the default locale

282950
scheme	lisp
also if you are doing scheme you don t say which lisp you are referring to i second the recommendation of drscheme

282951
for-loop	arrays
he she also points out that a temporary arrays is created and thus is slightly more expensive than a normal for-loop

282956
revision	svn
that will get you a list of revision where the file changed which you can then use to script repeated calls to svn diff

282958
sql-server	oracle
i started on sql-server and to me the oracle sequence scheme looked like a hack

282988
jedit	vim
i just use vim or jedit

282992
daemons	systemd
of course the immediate answer for most situations is yes and i am a firm believer that a process should correctly cleanup any resources it has allocated but what i have in my situation is a long-running systemd daemons that opens a fixed number of file descriptors at the startup and closes them all before exiting

282993
sql-server	mysql
the engines in question are mysql 5 or later and sql-server 2005 or later

283011
safari	opera
i m trying to process a credit card transaction in .net and it works perfectly in safari opera and ie

283024
alloca	free
is it possible to free memory allocated by c s alloca explicitly before the current function exits

283039
alloca	free
but all the blocks are free when you exit the function that alloca was called from just as if they were automatic variables declared in that function

283041
malloc	free
just use malloc free if you need to explicitly free it - those functions are usually heavily optimized

283042
c++	lua
i am looking at embedding lua in a c++ application i am developing

283042
c++	lua
receive a new work item in c++ program pass details to lua backend lua calls back into c++ to carry out necessary work returns finished results

283042
c++	lua
a pushing popping all the individual data-members onto the stack when crossing to from c++ and lua sounds messy

283045
latitude-longitude	location
where all location are latitude-longitude

283087
value	field
in the end i need field name and new value and with the record id s

283087
value	field
i ll do the rest of the checking beautifying including the column name to human readable and if a field value hasn t actually changed

283088
dialog	pop-up
if you need to edit the text i would then either pop-up a editor dialog or send the data that is stored in content to an textbox on your form for editing

283090
dialog	pop-up
i d like to pop-up a simple dialog with an editor box to let user enter some value then just return

283097
deployment	install
i d look into making it completely dynamic so that you don t have to do anything special at compile time or when building your install deployment package

283097
enterprise	licensing
have a licensing scheme mechanism flag that tells you whether the current user is licensed for pro or enterprise

283097
required	checked
when the plugins loader comes across a new plugins checked that plugins s attributes to see what level license is required

283139
cartesian-coordinates	points
to build a great circle you ll want to convert the points to 3d cartesian-coordinates i ll leave this step out but it s trivial for a spherical earth found iteratively for an oblate earth model a la wgs-84

283148
factory-pattern	singleton
it appears you might be trying to use a singleton pattern as a factory-pattern

283151
coalesce	isnull
you also could read an article which compares coalesce and isnull

283167
probability	cdf
where g is the inverse cdf aka quantile of the student-t distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 taking a probability and the degrees of freedom one less than the number of data points

283177
versioning	upgrade
you don t really want to upgrade the system versioning of sqlite on mac os x

283190
linqdatasource	formview
i am connecting to it with a linqdatasource and binding with a formview

283201
ftp	scp
if you don t have a shared file system you can also use ftp scp or http to move trigger files around

283206
websphere	ibm
my application communicates with another system via ibm websphere mq

283233
version-control	git
with distributed version-control systems like git every check out essentially is a branch

283234
findcontrol	asp.net
the other difficulty with this approach is that you wouldn t really have access to controls created on the asp.net page directly without using findcontrol

283244
python	ruby
i ve recently had the chance to do some ruby programming and if your coming in new to either language i think ruby or python are pretty easy to step into

283244
python	ruby
i haven t looked into rails and ruby enough to be familiar with the documentation available but i ve been pretty impressed with the django and python documentation available

283248
strncpy	strcpy
edit good suggestion from healthcarel - use strncpy rather than strcpy

283250
ruby-on-rails	django
since django and ruby-on-rails are a bit similar in their approach i would base on decision which language do you like more

283250
python	ruby
does ruby has bigger appeal to you than python

283250
python	ruby
python has support in visual studio platforms see ironpython but ruby is heavily developped for jvm see jruby

283255
hash	md5
while i might be totally misunderstanding you maybe it s a good idea to treat a vector as a byte stream and do some know hash on it sha1 or md5

283263
updating	updates
i m putting a crontab job for updating with apt-get once a day running debian lenny there are updates almost daily

283278
strncmp	strcmp
using non-limited string functions such as strcpy or strcmp instead of safe versions like strncpy and strncmp

283282
configuration	upgrade
what happens when a software upgrade breaks because you forgot to update a configuration file

283283
groovy	java
you could maybe try groovy if you re happy to run on the java vm.

283302
xsd	xml
define the schema using relax ng compact syntax convert it to xml schema xsd file and generate java code using jaxb xjc

283308
malloc	free
iif this is a c program which uses the function make sure you allocate with malloc and free with free

283316
safari	opera
this only occurs on ie6 and ie7 but not ff2 ff3 opera latest nov 12 2008 or safari again latest

283317
pointers	stack
the first variant doesn t work because you re returning a pointers into a stack object which will get destroyed

283331
stream	send
i have a byte arrays that contains an audio file i would like to send that file to a server using a chunked stream

283351
linguistics	nlp
the stanford list of nlp corpus linguistics resources may also help

283359
enumerator	any
secondly you d need to do something with the updated value after the delegate invoke an enumerator doesn t offer any ability to update contents

283370
linux	unix
on linux unix use unlink as soon as you created the file

283374
put	get
it also allows iteration over the keyset without locking it takes a copy at the start of iteration and get operations can generally be interleaved with calls to put without blocking it uses fine grained lock striping iirc

283386
difference	zero
so no there is exactly zero difference

283400
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
in terms of general concurrency utilities - .net has always provided a bit more than the basic which java used to provide in terms of mutex manualresetevent autoresetevent and readerwriterlock

283411
radians	atan2
atan2 y x returns the principal value of the arc tangent of y x expressed in radians

283414
compact-framework	.net
the company jamo solutions www.jamosolutions.com meets the requirements for automation testing on mobile devices including .net compact-framework applications

283425
internet-explorer	firefox
now most of my users are fine as they are using firefox and or internet-explorer

283427
user-controls	ascx
we made extensively use of user-controls ascx

283434
mta	sta
nunitforms and failed dragdrop registration - problem of mta vs sta

283441
put	get
commonly you might want to do a related get and put in close succession and if another thread is looking at the same values you have an immediate thread race

283450
boost	stl
the advantages of the second method is that you can take use your compilers pre-compiled header support plus you can wrap stl #includes in pragmas that disable some warnings for example some boost headers will cause warnings when compiling at level 4

283451
glassfish	weblogic
i don t know glassfish or jboss particularly but both the oracle and weblogic application servers will provide a fully integrated suite of functionality including soa security grid clustering systems management and development tools over and above just the standard j2ee container

283477
maven-assembly-plugin	maven
is this possible with some of the official maven plugins maven-assembly-plugin

283478
ubuntu-server	ubuntu
we use the ubuntu-server lts releases for production servers ubuntu 6.06 lts and some servers upgraded to ubuntu 8.04 lts

283484
javascript	dom
somehow use an externalinterface.call and do the dom trickery in javascript wich is probably what i will do because i m very familiar with js and a complete newbie with flash actionscript unless you have a better solution

283520
ironpython	cpython
note there was a mission by some of the crew at resolver systems to allow you to use cpython bindings with ironpython called ironclad but this is in its early stages and i think they will concentrate on getting things like numpy working first gui toolkits will always be the last and hardest

283535
appdata	temp
appdata local temp qas_8hjs.dll -- the directory name is

283535
any	set
is there something we have neglected to set up for example any environment

283543
csv	xml
i tried to use -tf text and -tf csv parameters but they don t work in the way i think they should i have a xml on output all the time

283555
rollback	commit
commit or rollback semantics also known as strong exception-handling safety or no-change guarantee operations can fail but failed operations are guaranteed to have no side effects so all data retain original value

283562
.when	ready
start planning how it can be improved if you design it from scratch new architecture etc and present it to the management .when it is ready and comprehensive

283566
boost	stl
stl boost are neatly arranged in namespaces so they don t ever cause any mix-ups or overlaps either

283575
export	report
i m using the reportviewer control to display a report within a webforms i ve also implemented the export to excel feature by calling the render methods of the server report

283582
precompiled-headers	stdafx.h
also be aware that enabling precompiled-headers in msvc at least in some versioning actually does change processing declarations before the #include stdafx.h are ignored so this needs to be your first non-comment statement

283602
difference	zero
first preprocess your list of values by taking the difference between each value and the previous one for the first value assume the previous one was zero

283603
contains	any
typically hibernate applications needed to refresh objects which contains any properties for which the database was generating values

283613
selection	highlight
or if you just want to highlight the lines and use replace all in selection with the same replace

283630
linked-list	nodes
a nodes that contains a cargo object and a reference to a linked-list

283642
message	alert
i ve run into this issue myself when i needed to build an alert message or something from an asp.net back end and stick it in a javascript alert on the front end

283657
short	zero
the short description is to maintain your production code in two sets of libraries where one set hopefully the larger set has 100 line coverage or better if you can measure it and the other set hopefully a tiny amount of code has 0 coverage yes zero percent coverage

283661
windows-xp	windows
i have plenty of free space the server is installed for months the version is 5.1.22-rc-community-log on windows-xp sp3 and i have used only one windows account to create and execute mysql service

283674
couchdb	mnesia
i would recommend couchdb instead of mnesia

283674
couchdb	mnesia
mnesia doesn t have map-reduce couchdb does correction - see comments

283674
couchdb	mnesia
mnesia is statically typed couchdb is a document database and pages are documents a better fit to the information model in my opinion

283675
sql-server	ms-access
this leaves me with only 3 choices however ms-access database fiel sql-server compact 3.5 which says it s a db file as well in the description and microsoft sql-server database file

283686
internet-explorer	firefox
it has an abstraction for ajax which works in all browsers and not just internet-explorer and maybe firefox

283686
put	get
it also helps if you understand the basic of http - for example the request methods put post get delete head and so on

283709
sharing	share
if you re already separating your components into merge modules you re guaranteed that the components will share their guids and you will get this behaviour and the sharing of components won t cause you any problems

283722
g++	gcc
if you mix code compiled with gcc and with g++ see graeme s answer

283727
if-statement	loops
lets just say it has 2 if-statement 2 else statements and 2 foreach loops

283737
dialog	pop-up
this code is called by a pop-up windows that displays this file or gives a open save dialog in internet-explorer

283744
command-line	cmd
does your telnet app need to run in a cmd windows or do you only need to start it from the cmd-line

283744
command-line	cmd
you can launch it from the cmd-line with the start cmd and let it execute a script in the background

283754
telnet	ftp
telnet ftp passwd fsck rlogin

283757
firefox	opera
i usually test when designing using opera and firefox and my collegue who used a mac tested it in safari too

283757
firefox	opera
if you design using the standards and test using relatively standard compliant browsers like opera firefox and safari and then add the dreadful hacks for ie preferably using conditional comments allthough it is nonstandard and proprietary it s fortunately and correctly regarded as commendt by real browsers so you won t break the working code you have less problems

283767
value	field
you can also use the valuecommit event which is dispatched when the user commits the changes usually by moving the focus away from the text field but remember that this event is also dispatched when the field value is changed programmatically

283776
specifications	w3c
from the w3c html 4.01 specifications quote

283776
attributes	properties
http servers may use the properties name specified by the http-equiv attributes to create an rfc822 -style header in the http response

283779
directory	folder
what is left visible is everything in the target directory besides these two folder the generated jar file for example

283781
compatibility	deprecated
php irreversibly modifies field names contains these characters in an attempt to maintain compatibility with the deprecated register_globals feature

283813
value	field
you can also follow up field default value etc

283854
line-endings	newline
try opening the file in universal newline mode which will cause python to guess what the right line-endings are ie

283859
cassini	iis
i m working on vista and i d prefer not to install iis i d rather just us cassini for local testing

283859
credentials	security
security is also a problem with this method since it sends the credentials as clear text

283866
sftp	ftp
just publish it with visual-studio to a local directory and then copy the contents of the local directory via ftp sftp scp to the server

283866
sftp	ftp
it can do ftp and sftp as well and also it has a server and a client component

283903
internet-explorer	opera
for javascript you ll be better off using opera opposed to pocket internet-explorer

283907
updatepanel	gridview
gridview within updatepanel with ajax crud and pagination are lightning fast

283914
order	add
however to get you working u need to selected one of the nodes first in order to add to it like this

283916
contains	any
my html doc also contains css and when opening in word it completely ignores the css so i no longer have any of the formatting

283925
base-class	inherited
ok so i have an abstract base-class called product a kititem class that inherited product and a packagekititem class that inherited kititem

283929
32-bit	16-bit
remember that integer is 16-bit and long is 32-bit

283959
contains	set
note also that the padding set on the contains divs should be no less than the width corner radius of your images though it can certainly be greater should you wish

283961
display	width
update the problem i have is i don t know how many products i ll display i can have 1 2 or 3 products i can center them if it was a fixed number as i d know the width of the parent div i just don t know how to do it when the content is dynamic

283962
filtering	sorting
it gives us ajax sorting filtering paging all server side

283969
arrays	loops
with i being outside the arrays then if would be available after the completion of the loops

283980
data-structures	tree
some data-structures are not well suited for random access but can be iterated over very fast tree linked lists etc

283985
display	width
by default div elements are display as block elements so they have 100 width making centering them meaningless

283994
font-size	width
the width of the characters depends on font-family and font-size

283994
fontfamily	font-size
i rewrote it for you and added classname so you can use a style to set the fontfamily and font-size

283994
google-chrome	firefox
that is not necessary since modern browsers do that for you tested with firefox ie opera and google-chrome

284004
contains	set
in the end the set result will contains the s1-s2

284045
getter	setter
these scripting allow you to automate the generation of getter and setter methods for any highlight instance-variables

284047
convention	standards
we use the java standards package naming convention

284051
virtualization	vmware
first i thought that virtualization would help but i ve tried vmware with an ubunto image and i can t find anywhere how to do this

284056
hsqldb	mysql
mysql and hsqldb are popular ones for java at least for small to medium applications

284064
display	width
an element with â display blockâ as div is by default has a width determined by the width of its container

284074
virtual-machine	virtualization
modern virtual pc software relies on virtualization support features in the host cpu and that the virtual-machine has the same instruction set as the host

284083
arrays	loops
loops an arrays and two lists

284090
dictionary	arrays
to reflect changes in the underlying dictionary and as i understand it copying the collection to an arrays will not do this as well as seeming inefficient - i don t actually want a new collection just to expose the underlying collection of keys...

284092
export	report
i am export a report from ms-access 2003 to excel 97-2003 output

284092
export	report
if i export the output of the report s underlying query export a datasheet this conversion does not happen

284092
export	report
export a report to a text format is a disaster because the columns are not delimited

284103
carbon	cocoa
on mac os x i have the option of cocoa and objective-c or carbon and c c++

284104
void	main
static void main string arguments

284105
arrays	loops
loops over the string arrays and convert each string successively into the corresponging integer using std istringstream

284126
for-loop	loops
for the other for-loops you need to check inside the brackets to have an idea for what this loops is used

284126
emacs	vim
so i think it s the vim vs emacs things coming back in your question with the for vs foreach loop people who like the for will say this foreach is useless might cause performance issues and is just big

284128
webforms	asp.net
if you are using asp.net webforms then for handling user authentication verification i d recommend asp.net membership services because it does some of the heavy lifting for you and also helps you from making any elementary security mistakes

284134
convention	standards
generally yes i d go for convention and readability over standards in this scenario

284137
required	checked
this required some additional overhead by the runtime to do since it must checked if the object exists before every property methods reference

284137
instances	destroy
generally it is better to explicitly create and destroy the object instances yourself using the set new syntax

284138
naming-conventions	conventions
i certainly would continue to use the same naming conventions as it ll keep the code consistent even if it is consistently ugly and more readable than mixing variables naming-conventionss

284149
.net	wcf
as you can see in the error below which occurs with the standard web services api wcf or wse3 when i send the request with text encoding the response comes back correctly with all the data in a multipart related response but the .net framework chokes

284171
put	get
you might need to put some time into tweaking them to get the windows application look and feel just right but that should be more than compensated for by the lack of a need to write a whole new presentation layer

284184
hide	show
you may want a button to hide show the category lists as this can take a lot of spaces even when using scrollbar

284189
python	lua
i am thinking lua or python

284189
python	java
would it be a good idea to use python in java which is ran with flash

284194
json	xml
yes php can output xml and json for ajax but not all php frameworks support json xml equally well

284265
put	get
your best bet is to put the code that uses side_bar_html in your onreadystatechange function so that it doesn t get used before it s set

284266
subtyping	generics
note it only makes sense to use a generics class in this manner if you need to support multiple kinds of items represented by subtyping of item

284287
png	gif
i am by no means an iis expert that s why i just gave up and went with converting to gif files but from the research i did before giving up i can tell you that not all versions of iis support the png mime type by default

284293
binary	hex
watchdog timer reset pins 8-bit counters overflows delay loops hex binary bit-masking interrupts interrupt service requests io ports etc. it s all very educational - and a great feeling to get so close to the machine - but being able to code something in c will hide some of this complexity so you can focus on results

284303
derived-class	base-class
i had it inside a firepropertychanged methods on a base-class and moving it to the derived-class made the difference

284305
.net	wcf
if you are only connecting to .net services then look into wcf clients and services

284313
boolean	int
note dosomething is just there because of the where extension methods being ok with a methods that takes in a user and int and returns boolean

284321
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have an application with 5 uiviewcontroller s each inside a corresponding uinavigationcontroller all tucked inside a uitabbarcontroller that displays 5 tabs at the bottom of the screen

284321
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
i want to display another uiviewcontroller inside a uinavigationcontroller when a dialog button is pressed

284321
hide	show
then i can show it and hide it using the tabbar s selectedindex property

284323
document	element
same way you re append it to the document element now

284325
child-process	spawn
suppose i have a process which spawn exactly one child-process

284331
csv	xml
so if you are writing a 100 mb xml file from csv you might consider xmlwriter

284331
getter	setter
another issue with xmlserializationr is that it doesn t like to serialization immutable types everything must have a public getter and setter unless you do it all yourself by implements ixmlserializable in which case you haven t gained much by using xmlserializationr

284358
duplicates	elements
now while this works great it has drawbacks -- i now have duplicates properties for anything i want to be a cdata elements and i have to write extra code for these properties

284358
attributes	properties
in an ideal scenario i d be able to add an attributes to these properties so they are automatically treated as cdata elements

284360
environment	building
easy to integrate into a continuous building environment

284368
attributes	properties
would work fine for a list-type properties but for a set throws an error when upon submit it tries to bind input-field content to object attributes

284370
children	nodes
however whenever i do it lists the top level navigation nodes but i cannot get the children to be displayed

284380
any	set
a table like this should not allow any direct access all access should be from stored procs and the permissions set on them instead

284384
export	report
xml is supported as export format of the rendered report only

284388
code-coverage	ncover
i m setting up codeigniter at present using thoughtworks studios cruise gallio to run xunit.net fact tests and ncover 2 to do code-coverage

284393
value	field
the error messages are added to the collection as strings formatted from program constant templates globalization is not a concern obviously 0 cannot be empty please enter a value for the 0 where 0 is the field name

284408
click	mouse
so i ve set up a mouse listener nsidomeventlistener and then when a click occurs the handleevent callback gives me access to the nsidomevent

284428
attributes	properties
clearly in model objects attributes and relationships are good fodder for properties

284428
attributes	properties
even synthesized computed attributes seem like a good use case for properties

284428
attributes	properties
do you use properties for your private object attributes

284437
constructor	object
a few lines that are generic for any object is more efficient than having to manually create a clone that involves possibly private constructor field assignments etc

284450
stdin	eof
in order to loop like that i think you d need to be sending an eof ctrl-d from stdin after every integer entry

284450
if-statement	loops
finally that if-statement looks like you re trying to determine why the loops exited

284481
default-arguments	arguments
if it bothers you you could use default-arguments to use given arguments first then search for get post values if none are provided though that might be a security risk

284489
directory	folder
so i took alien.lua core.dll and struct.dll from the unzipped folder and put them under a directory named alien in a common library repository

284533
constructor	object
and if you plan to mostly distribute your class as a component in other applications then simply put config arrays object as a parameter in your class constructor and leave the details to the user

284533
methods	extend
remember that one can always extend your class and overload your outputting methods with his own

284533
protected	public
comment each public methods or even better also protected and private ones with explanations what do they do and what parameters are needed

284537
background-image	width
you ll also need to add a class to the final cell in each row if you want to add that drop shadow on the right and just change it s background-image and width property accordingly

284542
calloc	malloc
well the simplest answer would be to use calloc instead of malloc

284552
child-process	sigint
install a trap handler to catch sigint which kills off your child-process if it s still alive though other posters are correct that it won t catch sigkill

284566
constructor	private
if i create a private constructor what is the best way to initialize that reference to appease the compiler

284576
perl	awk
perl might be able to do a lot of things awk can do but offered the choice in this day and age i would choose python here

284581
dialog	pop-up
but i don t want that message to pop-up when the the application has a modal dialog in the foreground because the user couldn t do anything about it

284588
multiplication	addition
i run a little speed check on them which just uses addition and multiplication

284605
constructor	private
you can simply take the address of the passed reference in you regular constructor and initialize it to null in the private constructor

284635
export	report
ms-access is too dumb to export it properly from a report

284635
export	report
my way around it was to carefully craft a query and then export the results of the query rather than the report

284640
reserved-words	keyword
the square brackets are used in vb.net to surround a variables name that is named after a reserved-words or keyword

284641
python	java
additionally there is pdftextstream which is a commercial java library that can also be used from python

284644
user-interface	drawing
i suppose it s microsoft s answer to cocoa on mac os x insofar as it aims to unify a number of application services user-interface 2d and 3d drawing fixed and adaptive documents advanced typography vector graphics raster graphics animation data binding audio and video. that sounds like cocoa to me -

284653
oracle	mysql
i m just playing around with the express version because i have to migrate some code from mysql to oracle

284659
buffering	streaming
obviously there must be a way since the higher level languages offer some sort of buffering mechanisms with their readline streaming methods

284661
tstringlist	tlist
i just don t like much tlist as tstringlist satisfied my needs without needing of treating pointerss as tlist is a list of pointers value

284673
session-cookies	cookies
james - that doesn t differentiate between setting a session cookies and a general purpose cookies though ie lets you differentiate between first party session-cookiess and third party but i see with firefox they only differentiate between first party and third party

284677
actionscript	mxml
you can use that sort of technique to create the components in actionscript you will still need to set all the properties that are usually set in mxml but they all have the same names

284678
object-reference	instances
message object-reference not set to an instances of an object

284679
perl	awk
i usually end up doing a lot of vi regex munging but i bet there are easier ways to do these things with awk perl etc

284700
contains	any
this means that the javascript classes are pure and don t contains any references to css ids or classnames

284711
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
a uinavigationcontroller is a distinct object that is very different from a uitabbarcontroller

284716
document	element
that wrapper csimplexmlparser loads an xml document and sets its top record to the document element of the xml document

284716
contains	elements
crecord being an abstract class with cxmlrecord one of its subclasses and which gives access to child records singularly or by grouping and also allowing access to the value of the record values for child elements or attributes in the case of cxmlrecord. a cxmlrecord contains an msxml msxmldomnodeptr and a pointer to an instance of a csimplexmlparser. the wrapper also contains utility functions for returning children which the cxmlrecord uses to return its child records

284721
contains	set
for those toolstrips that contains more button then can be displayed in that space the toolstrip doesn t expand vertically to show the whole set of button but instead shows the drop-down arrow on the right-side that allows the user to see the remaining button

284726
postgresql	mysql
it s about postgresql and mysql so the performance analysis is different but the logic for explicitness still holds why force yourself to always worry about something that s relevant a small percentage of the time

284734
value	field
so while you are using an xpath like report subreport record field value you actually need to first set the namespace of your document

284734
value	field
and then selectnodes using r report r subreport r record r field r value

284739
buffering	capture
the bracketed expressions known as capture buffering in the first half of the regexp are referenced as

284741
python	java
i know that resorting to java on the server side would be a solution but i just can t imagine that this can t be solved with apache + python

284749
double-quotes	single-quotes
try changing the double-quotes in the user attributes to single-quotes

284765
value	field
however if i fill in the required field and save the document then those field get populate with my value when you create a new document

284765
value	field
this isn t good because i want the field to be blank when a new document is created - i want the users to be forced to fill in those value

284765
updating	updates
i can updates the templace by updating the colums and making them optional editing the word templates saving the templates then changing the columns back to required

284787
windows-vista	windows
for others the command is using visual-studio 2008 command prompt windows tool in admin mode if using windowss-vista

284801
json	xml
html xml json yaml etc. can all be parsed incrementally

284811
xsd	xml
you can supply an xsd if you are using xml in your rest service

284817
.when	ready
.when you are ready to catch up with everybody else s changes you would use git-pull to both fetch and merge

284838
web-applications	client-server
if you need a really advanced routing system developed a company called routesmart makes dll based route solver solutions for client-server apps and now web-applications using arcgis 9.x

284851
testng	junit
in either case segmenting out the tests as both testng and junit do is helpful with integration tests too

284853
sql-server	mysql
you will need to charge a premium though because of the extra cost of maintenance and the extra database specialists you will need on hand to performance tune for each type of database a mysql specialist probably won t know how to best tune a sql-server database and vice versa

284853
contains	any
you will need a whole pile of servers and network and dba people to do this though as you will need to maintain basically 24 hour uptime for each client and they may require you to store their data on servers that do not contains any data from competitors

284863
web-applications	web-services
you may use selenium for web-applications soapui for web-services or other appropriate tools

284889
entity-framework	nhibernate
i d like to go with something automated like linq2sql entity-framework nhibernate subsonic

284889
entity-framework	nhibernate
to retrieve a single row in linq2sql entity-framework nhibernate subsonic would these solutions have to bring the entire list down to the client and find the row that i need

284892
keyvaluepair	key
use the keyvaluepair class for you key and value then just serialization a list to disk with an xmlserializationr

284903
parsing	comma
parsing is simple read the file split at newline or comma then take the elements in pairs

284915
post-increment	pre-increment
in c++ you should get in the habit of using pre-increment ++i rather than post-increment i++ to increment loop variables

284919
python	java
hey guys i already know java objective c c# and some python

284920
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
if i remove clientaccesspolicy.xml and instead add the flash style crossdomain.xml policy file then it works

284920
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i do see through inspector the network how clientaccesspolicy.xml is requested first unsuccessfully and then silverlight fallback to crossdomain.xml

284922
solaris	aix
the subversion webpage has links to unofficial binaries for many nix systems including hp-ux solaris aix the bsds and linux distros

284929
abstract-class	subclassing
what i would suggest is to write your tests on the desired functionality of a non-abstract subclassing of the abstract-class in question then write both the abstract-class and the implementing subclassing and finally run the test

284929
abstract-class	subclassing
your tests should obviously test the defined methods of the abstract-class but always via the subclassing

284933
dialog	pop-up
avoid pop-up dialog like the plague

284948
configuration	installation
my reasoning is more along the lines of removing a lot of software installation and configuration hassles especially when working between different languages platforms frameworks projects

284950
tortoisesvn	smartsvn
we are using various svn clients tortoisesvn smartsvn subclipse etc.

284961
put	get
rest really only uses the http verbs get put post delete on a resource

284969
fflush	stdout
immediately before sleeping call fflush stdout

284985
worksheet	excel
more detailed problem in vba you can assign a formula to a range in an excel worksheet

284986
abstract-class	subclassing
if you do not want to subclassing the abstract class just to perform a unit test on the methods which are implemented in the abstract class already you could try to see whether your framework allows you to mock abstract-class

284995
perl	php
you could maybe use an off-the-shelf asp-style preprocessor mode for ruby python perl php whatever prior to the c preprocessor

285005
grouping	sorting
as i really only want to find the start and end values of grouping with small gaps the sorting only needs to create buckets and can discard the data

285023
radix-sort	quicksort
i was just going to say radix-sort however that could be a bit above what you were looking to implement introsort is generally the accepted sorting solution for data it s a variation of quicksort that switches to heapsort when it reaches smaller sets as it s faster on smaller sets than quicksort

285030
entity-framework	nhibernate
i can t speak on linq-to-sql entity-framework nor nhibernate but i am in love with subsonic

285034
any	set
the improved support for asp.net-mvc is linked to this as you can set ii7 to route requests without extensions to .net so you can have urls which are cleaner such as without having any extension visible which reveals what type of server technology you re using and is very untrendy these days

285065
panels	grid
there are a few community add-ons which make it easy but start by looking at the actual grid store instead of the grid panels

285074
radio-button	selected
if this is a bug one workaround would be to automatically selected the enabled radio-button when the item is moved so any advice on how to achieve this would also be most appreciated

285074
internet-explorer	firefox
update i ve tested this in firefox 3 internet-explorer 7 opera 9.5 and safari 3.1.2 all on windows-xp x64 and this issue occurs in all of them

285086
getattr	setattr
however you can to an extent do this with the setattr and getattr built-in functions

285087
object-reference	instances
the exception-handling is object-reference not set to an instances of an object. - the stack-trace is

285125
radio-button	checkbox
the problem comes when i try to use a checkbox radio-button progress bar

285125
radio-button	checkbox
the checkbox and radio-button appear exactly like normal buttons and the progress bar crashes

285174
pygtk	gtk
i would recommend using gtk which binds to python via pygtk and has the glade gui designer

285176
javafx	swing
i think a combination of javafx swing java2d and java s browser-based jre comprise the solutions that wpf provides

285176
javafx	swing
swing provides ui capabilities and can be used in both java and javafx

285194
buffering	streaming
i haven t tried it from a webrequest but both the windows media player activex and the mediaelement from wpf components are capable of playing and buffering mp3 streaming

285204
emacs	vim
but there is one advantage with ides over emacs vim related environments i want to focus on you spend less time installing configuring the features you want

285204
emacs	vim
no idea how many hours i would need to get the features i use up and running with emacs vim

285210
deployment	install
every hour it kicks off a larger build that constructs the online help and install that we use on our various deployment platforms

285225
emacs	vim
you ask should i use an ide instead of... but i don t understand what the alternative is - vim and emacs fulfil many functions any ide will give you

285225
emacs	vim
then your question boils down to simply what ide should i use with arguments to be made for the simpler realm of vim and emacs

285239
put	get
remember that if you re still at the tutorial stage any tutorial is going to have a lot of just put this line of code in because they are trying to get concepts across not dig down into the inner workings of everything

285240
concatenation	comma
there are ways of concatenation every grouping member into one comma separated string i d suggest you read about it here

285240
value	field
table user then gets a int or bigint field grouping and each grouping id is assigned one bit value ie 1 2 4 8 16 and so on the value of the user table s grouping field is then the sum of the groupingid it s assigned to

285248
web-services	api
you can interact with it via a web-services api in ruby or any other language

285254
solaris	aix
edirectory is cross platform and runs on windows netware linux sles and red hat at least solaris aix and hpux

285272
attributes	properties
use the attributes properties and set the cssclass

285292
methods	extend
in order to extend the basic functionality exposed by this interface extention methods are used

285313
value	field
i have a field in a database that is nearly unique 98 of the time the value will be unique but it may have a few duplicates

285320
selected	button
the scenario will be this the user will selected some entry and then click a convert to link button

285343
triggers	insert
edit turns out there s some funny business via triggers and custom datatypes that occur on insert we ve got a bit of a messed up db. given normal settings i ve marked the answer appropriately

285384
lookup	any
this will give you the object as extract does and then delete it from the list without any lookup

285407
arrays	loops
use repmat to initialize an arrays of requesth objects and then use a loops to create the desired objects

285421
show	next
the best i can come up with at the moment is to have a hidden span next to each input that is styled to show instead of the input when printing and use javascript to keep it in sync

285433
httpd.conf	.htaccess
the leading will not match within .htaccess only within httpd.conf src - bottom of page if you wish for processing of further rules to stop then add the l flag

285440
constructor	object
it was a good enough solution but i don t like the fact that the time needed to convert the stream into an image object with the bitmap constructor is far far far larger than the time needed to download the stream

285442
contains	any
one of my problems is that there seems to have been no discipline when writing the html so that although they have used css extensively there are half a dozen css files and a cursory analysis reveals that there is a significant number of styles in the css files that are not referenced by any of the html - rather they contains trail of false redesign starts and old now redundant styles mixed in with the current items

285446
any	set
this is literally all the code i added to the form i had not added any event handler i have tried it with the selectionmode set to one and multiextended

285447
arrays	loops
now you need to populate the matrix loops through each input arrays and get each character and the one after it

285447
linked-list	arrays
now you would simply insert the chars into an arrays one at a time linked-list would be the easiest you will see why in a second

285451
integer	zero
if it is an integer zero

285458
hide	show
in rowdatabound which initially show hide the links i add a linkvisibility instance to the collection for each row

285487
mime	rfc
specs such as pem rfc 1421 and mime rfc 2045 specify that base64 strings can be broken up by whitespaces

285502
internet-explorer	google-chrome
this code works in firefox internet-explorer not in safari google-chrome

285502
google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome the divnew can only be moved vertically

285507
authentication	impersonation
you can set your web application to impersonate run as the user that iis authentication them as see impersonation in the asp.net doco

285518
children	nodes
it s arguably proportional to the square of the number of strings if each nodes has many children implying that each string appears many many times in your list of lists each with a different string immediately following it

285532
baud-rate	parity
are you sure you ve configure the serial-port correctly particularly the baud-rate data bits stop bits parity and flow control settings

285543
if-statement	arrays
you should wrap the whole thing in an if-statement just in case you re dealing with a zero-length arrays

285593
perl	c++
i would like to design very high availability never take server down roll out features without restart etc application with both client probably c# gui and server components java c++ perl

285601
hide	show
theoretically you should be able to write some code like this and then use the return-value to show hide what you want

285607
ruby	php
php ruby on rails asp.net or java

285627
revision	svn
when you tag it with svn cp you re just making a copy of that particular revision with a longer name

285687
contains	elements
however my xhtml files contains elements from another schema

285707
rounding	currency
i ve heard of some folks creating their own cash or money classes which encapsulate a cash value with the currency but under the skin it s still a bigdecimal probably with bigdecimal.round_half_even rounding

285711
methods	extend
either way i d probably extend the class to have a .tostring that uses the correct format and as a place to put other methods that might come up for a long multiplying and dividing will go awry if the decimal isn t adjusted

285712
arrays	loops
also when reading the file will the arrays automatically contain all the lines of the file or will i have to make a loops which which copies every line to corresponding subscript i

285715
worksheet	excel
the proof-of-concept prototype a simple asp.net page that queries a single item from the database and opens excel to add data to a worksheet is working well when run locally on the development machines happily creating and displaying an excel spreadsheet as requested

285741
application-pool	iis-manager
you can change the user the application-pool runs as through the iis-manager

285753
boost	stl
for example there are stl standard templates library and boost tr1 extensions to stl that are considered industry standards well stl is at least

285753
environment	building
static-libraries depend on your building environment

285754
double	int
so let s say i want to write a class that operates on different kinds of numbers but i don t a priori know what kind of numbers int double etc. i will be operating on

285760
child-process	spawn
i need to spawn a child-process that is a console application and capture its output

285768
silverlight	wpf
you should check out patterns practices composite wpf and silverlight

285768
silverlight	wpf
also a project linker that updates the source of your wpf app when you change silverlight code or vice versa using linking

285782
push	pull
should he have the right to push in my repository or should i pull from his repository

285792
push	pull
either way you d pull the changes into the private repo on your computer fix any mistakes that result from the merge and then push his changes to your public repo the one on github

285803
format-patch	repo
he can make his own fork of your github repoitory and when he feels he is ready to integrate he can send you pull requests where you have his repo public url as a remote or he can send you git format-patch sets

285818
ubuntu	linux
with java version 1.5.0_06 on both windows and ubuntu linux

285819
constructor	object
every resource acquisition whether it s a synchronization lock a database connection or a chunk of memory or anything else that must be acquired and released should be wrapped in an object so that the constructor performs the acquisition and the destructor releases the resource

285827
protected	public
per josh the automatically-generated uid is generated based on a class name implements interfaces and all public and protected members

285828
entity-relationship	diagram
my fallback option is to recreate an entity-relationship diagram by hand

285829
datagridview	listview
sort of like listview in details mode but i want to keep the datagridview flexibility

285829
datagridview	listview
so does anyone know of some ideally easy way to make the datagridview row selection look like the listview one

285835
logging	trace
my first attempt was to store the exception type message and stack trace as fields in the bug tracking system.the logging component would then do a query against the bug store to see if there is an open bug with the same information

285835
bug-tracking	fogbugz
i had heard that fogbugz for example had such a feature for automated bug-tracking and was curious how it was implements

285850
webforms	asp.net
mvc uses routing but routing is also used by dynamic data and we plan to integrate routing with asp.net webforms

285853
msbuild	nant
i was using nant msbuild to deploy my release package and the global.asax file was not included

285868
scheme	lisp
when you program in lisp or scheme you spend a lot of time thinking about functions and what actions you want to take on your data

285877
32-bit	64bit
i never wrote production code in objective-c and its hard to keep up but as far as i am aware nsinteger and friends are in 10.4 it s just that cocoa isn t 64 bit in 10.4 whereas in 10.5 most of it is so no more need for seperate 64bit worker process under a 32-bit user-interface

285877
versioning	upgrade
i don t know what your product is or who your customers are but from my experience mac users are early adopters relatively speaking i ve never used an os x versioning longer than two weeks before the next upgrade was out and in my circle i am a late adopter

285877
32-bit	64bit
if you re just doing 64bit because you can there s no reason that i can imagine not to keep supporting 32-bit but if you want stuff like coreanimation you don t have much choice

285878
32-bit	64bit
if you need 64bit you can create 64bit cli executable that does heavy lifting and provide 32-bit font-end for it using nstask and nspipe

285899
sql-server	oracle
for a little context we support both oracle and sql-server as our back-end

285902
mta	sta
i believe that excel is an sta component and therefore cannot be created inside the mta

285908
perl	lua
ruby is slower than perl python and lua

285913
reserved-words	keyword
the keyword here is reserved-words

285923
contains	any
this assumes however that the lookupstring doesn t contains any characters special to regexs they d need to be escaped

285934
order	add
you must add the .cpp file to your project in order to compile it

285942
sql-server	oracle
i ve seen this a fair number of times in oracle databases since it s a pretty big default value that you don t need to think about when you re creating a table similar to using int or bigint by default in sql-server

285973
y-combinator	combinators
while he doesn t to my knowledge look at the y-combinator itself he does look at other combinators for instances

285983
selected	cell
to show a button or another control over the selected cell

python	ruby
i ve used this for a couple years in my .net sites but i ve had to settle for more painful libraries for my python ruby and other projects

285995
gzip	zip
however if you are exchanging really big xml files you might want to consider compressing them before transmission using zip gzip etc

285998
tableofcontents	latex
have not done this in years but i would look at the latex source code for tableofcontents and listoffigures

285999
downgrade	upgrade
i ve taken the plunge and upgrade or maybe downgrade

286005
httpd.conf	.htaccess
mod_rewrite rules may be placed within the httpd.conf file or within the .htaccess file

286005
httpd.conf	.htaccess
if you have access to httpd.conf placing rules here will offer a performance benefit as the rules are processed once as opposed to each time the .htaccess file is called

286005
any	set
the flag stops processing any further rewrite rules for that pass through the rule set

286007
configuration	installation
i need to configure tomcat memory settings as part of a larger installation so manually configuring tomcat with the configuration app after the fact is out of the question

286015
xsd	xml
you can use xsd.exe to generate a class from an xsd xml schema definition

286018
any	set
if the query is set to filtering on any

286018
any	set
i should note that the domain administrators never knowingly set any such permissions

286018
difference	factors
the original cause of the difference still isn t clear although the fact that most of the bad records were created after a switch to windows 2003 for the domain controller that could be a factors

286022
filtering	sorting
i m looking for good patterns for implementing a paged table of results in asp.net-mvc with sorting filtering and paging provided via ajax

286024
expression-blend	design-time
we are experiencing a similar issue we are looking forward for a solution that will provide design-time support under expression-blend 2.0 strong type

286058
hashtable	set
if i have a key set of 1000 what is a suitable size for my hashtable and how is that determined

286085
credentials	account
maybe it s a configuration issue or maybe tortoisesvn is sending invalid credentials causing a locked account

286090
pointers	stack
i think the second version should work but i believe i m not setting the arg list of the new stack frame correctly i did it by writing to 0 since its the first part of the function pointers and writing and but its probably not right since those are the parameters of victim_func

286102
.when	ready
.when your original process is ready for another message the gatekeeper can compute which message to forwarding by any rule you choose

286114
directory	folder
what i first noticed is you are making a directory higher in the tree then attempting to make the php file in the current folder

286148
any	set
does it recognize any character set encodings used in the table

286148
lazy-evaluation	maybe
hehe sorry for being too lazy-evaluation to google but i ran through this problem before in another table and thought i found a solution but i was thinking that maybe i just ticked my broswer s options to use by default a utf-8 encoding

286163
value	field
if you have not assigned anything else to that location then it will have the value zero just like an object s uninitialized field would have

286175
rounding	currency
then using currency class to define rounding convention

286180
static-code-analysis	stylecop
i like stylecop s static-code-analysis and rules enforcement

286221
pointers	stack
after you have that written you need to write a pointers to it on to stack in the location that the shell_code function expects to find its arguments

286227
webforms	asp.net
1 a separate view engine for asp.net mvc instead of current webforms view engine

286229
factors	digits
also even if all components of a phone number are digits there is no guarantee that phone numbers in all parts of the world are actually small enough to fit inside a 64 bit value once you factors in area codes country codes internal extensions etc

286231
freebsd	netbsd
for freebsd netbsd openbsd macos x kqueue

286252
primitive	int
primitive arrayss int float char etc are never empty by which i assume you mean null because primitive arrays elements can never be null

286261
order	add
this way your clients can use windows live writer and have support for the full range of features available from wlw like hierarchical categories the ability to add categories hierarchical pages and the ability to create pages and assign a parent page and a page order to your new page support for slugs and support for summaries and extended entries just to name a few

286281
callback	methods
to get the property efficiently as far as reading goes you can do something like this in your callback methods

286281
callback	methods
to get the phone number from the record you could do again inside your callback methods

286288
protected	public
my first attempt was using the base-class having a non-virtual public interface and then having another protected virtual methods checkcreatedtype that would allow anything in the chain to inspect the type before the base-class create was called

286288
subclassing	base-class
the alternatives are you hardcode all the checks for all subclassing inside the base-class bad or otherwise externalize the checking

286288
base-class	subclass
the check is done by the subclass registering a delegate to invoke in base-class but without the base-class knowing all the rules upfront

286300
cos	sin
you can calculate the sin from the cos using sin 2 + cos 2 1

286300
sqrt	sin
that is sin sqrt 1-cos cos

286303
swing	swt
now swt is os specific and you may not have the same flexibility than swing so you need to have good reason for looking for an alternative to swing especially when you consider there are good lafs look and feel for java

286307
contains	set
what you could do is set a cookie when the user visits your website that contains some obscure data

286315
internet-explorer	firefox
script that works with firefox safari khtml internet-explorer and css3 capable browsers

286323
mootools	extjs
i prefer jquery so that is my first recommendation but i worked with yui mootools prototype and extjs javascript before making my decision

286325
.net	wcf
.net 3.0 adds things like wcf wpf wf which are nicer ways to do things that were generally already there in the framework

286354
.net	wcf
i am making a business specific messaging application it is going to connect between 5000 and 10 000 machines back to our datacenter via wcf no vpns all over the .net

286354
message	alert
it is mainly for alert and i need to be able to send message direclty to specific clients and wcf allows me to do all of this with a duplex contract but with this many clients it got me thinking about maxing out the tcp port spaces of 65535 ports

286372
macports	fink
the easiest way to start afresh with macports or fink is to simply remove the folder sw for fink or opt for macports

286374
lisp	let
slime will let you connect to a lisp repl running the swank back-end

286377
sql-server	oracle
i don t have sql-server to check but in oracle it will eliminate the top-level scan for type 1 condition

286384
inlining	inline
in general an inline methods that does nothing but pass the call onto another function is a great candidate for inlining

286394
32-bit	64bit
you can mix 32-bit and 64bit in the same farm it s fully supported

286394
32-bit	64bit
however it s highly recommenced to keep each tiers in the same bit width for example all wfe 64bit application server 32-bit sql servers 64bit

286394
32-bit	64bit
you can deploy an office sharepoint server 2007 farm on a mix of 32-bit and 64bit servers provided that you maintain architecture homogeneity at each topology layer

286394
32-bit	64bit
for example you should not mix 32-bit and 64bit web front-end wfe servers but you may use 64bit database servers in a farm with 32-bit wfe servers and application servers

286417
sniffing	packets
you could make a trace of the http traffic using fiddler or a network packets sniffing tool like ethereal whireshark on the machine where it is working and on one of the other machines and compare the results

286418
ubuntu	linux
the web application hosted on linux ubuntu

286454
communication	messages
if communication must use another channel you can use xmpp to exchange ip-address and then proceed with the standard socket route but if you encrypt your messages there should be no problem even going through a 3rd party server - to be true all packets go through untrusted 3rd party router so you should encrypt anyway if you have sensitive data..

286466
host	dns
could host your own dns server and code your end point to register on this dns

286466
messenger	skype
the simplist answer might be to jump on the back on an existing service such as messenger skype bit torrent etc

286476
optional-parameters	named
i also look forwarding to some of the features in c# 4.0 such as optional-parameters named parameters no pia and much more

286478
administration	account
imho developing in an administration account is not only unnecessary but also highly dangerous

286478
virtualization	vmware
in times of microsoft virtual pc and vmware server both free there isn t even an excuse due to high prices for virtualization software

286491
python	c++
i ve tried several libraries wxwidgets pythonwin wrapper around mfc tkinter when doing so i often felt that i was writing code in a language other than python despite the fact that it was python because the libraries aren t exactly pythonic they are a port from another language be it c c++ tk

286495
py2exe	exe
i don t know your py2exe tool but we usually use this way to convert py to exe

286499
py2exe	exe
also i ve used py2exe for my own application and haven t tested it with other exe conversion apps

286504
cpu-architecture	32-bit
the rules about how much memory is consumed depend on the jvm implementation and the cpu-architecture 32-bit versus 64 bit for example

286520
.when	ready
unless you already know that locking is a bottleneck for you i would stick with what you ve got and just be ready to upgrade .when you can

286523
low-level	hardware
in my experience it isn t that commonly needed in actual applications apart from the already-mentioned sort algorithms and occasionally in low-level hardware poking so in my view it s a bit too special-purpose to have in a general-purpose language

286533
while-loop	loops
i ve been able to do it with a while-loops but i want to try it with a foreach loops

286549
contains	lookup
it is also ok if it contains object_id of that procedure so i can lookup name in all_objects

286558
selected	checkbox
i have a list of objects each with it s own checkbox where the user can selected multiple of these

286558
selected	checkbox
how can i mark in the view which checkbox are already selected

286563
lan	wan
i ve searched a bit and for me it looks like we must use application integration framework aif enterprise-portal ep - this due to as i understand that the bc is not made for multi-users like on the web but must be implements with a session-wrapper like ep - and also it must be run on an lan and is not capable to connect via wan

286570
solaris	linux
my understanding is that start-stop-daemon is a command that is specific to linux or bsd distros and is not available on solaris

286570
solaris	linux
what is the best way to translate my init.d scripts from linux to solaris

286573
svnkit	svn
now i don t see svnkit 1.2.1 in the connector list in preferences team svn svn connector

286583
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux ubuntu 8.04 but would be also be interested in solutions for other operating systems

286607
ip-address	hostname
your application would need to know in advance which hostname the other host will be using but this service would at least get around the fact that you don t know exactly which ip-address the other computer is on

286611
keydown	keyup
whilst nominally possible using rwssession sendeventtowindowgroup or tapatask sendkey there are complexities involved the events arrive in right order keydown key event keyup and behaviour of different feps front end processor for user-input

286614
python	c++
i m developing an application with a team in .net c++ and provide a com interface to interact with python and other languages

286617
inlining	inline
however inlining opens the door to more optimizations if you have v a + b + c your wrapper class forces the generation of stack variables whereas for inline calls the majority of the data can be kept in the fpu stack

286634
hotmail	gmail
it s the way that big ones gmail g docs hotmail .. do it - lot of javascript code that manipulates with user-interface

286635
keyboard	mouse
as g mastros says the _click event is the one to use since it fires when the selection is changed via either keyboard or mouse

286680
json	xml
xml json and a either a web service or directly through a socket

286690
textbox	button
i have a few textbox and button on my form

286690

if a user type in a textbox the program will know what button to fire when the user press the enter key

286693
contains	elements
variables contains the elements name which should be used

286693
arrays	loops
this loops for the inserts can get costly if you have bigger structures but c doenst allow arrays indexing with strings

286698
ubuntu	debian
to use in debian ubuntu sudo aptitude install html2ps and then pipe the output to lpr to print

286734
webforms	asp.net
i use the new asp.net mvc framework more and more i really don t like the html and viewstate soup webforms tend to create.

286757
sql-server	mysql
in sql-server i would expect an exception in that case but if mysql substitutes some kind of invalid date -value that could maybe explain the difference

286759
base-class	inherited
however this problem could arise with some other base-class from which it s perfectly sensible to inherited

286774
silverlight	wpf
and i don t know about wpf either but i can tell you they are going to provide silverlight for mobile devices giving you access to a subset of wpf

286806
export	report
when i export a report from sql reports 2005 the image logos are distorted a bit and the sheets are locked so further editing and sorting is not possible

286821
contains	set
the list argument contains all the numbers that you want to permute and taken is a set that contains numbers already used

286846
persistence	hibernate
in our case we are using java persistence api jpa and we currently use hibernate as our persistence provider and use its entitymanager

286846
rollback	commit
what basically happens under the hood is we initiate a transaction when entering the slsb methods and commit it or rollback it immediately before exiting the methods

286853
selected	listbox
it is not too difficult to create a textbox and listbox combination where the listbox is requeried in the change event of the textbox progressively narrowing the items selected

286864
digits	zero
in the case where the string ends with i can obviously pad it with two zero as well then stripes out all separators leaving just the digits and parsing the resulting string with spirit

286873
required	checked
anyone who checked out my project ends up missing my required library

286874
linked-list	queue
i believe the queue collection extends the linked-list anyway

286885
contains	set
example bellow is a button that has his text set on paint depending on value contains in his tag property let suppose that you will use tag property to set the key that will be used to read matching resource

286887
webserver	nginx
both nginx and lighttpd webserver have x-send-file headers you can return from php

286893
service-layer	crud
the service-layer has the most bussines model knowledge and the dao s do relatively simple crud work

286921
python	perl
other languages have facilities to do just that python supplies str.translate in perl there is tr â â xpath has a function translate coldfusion has replacelist

286933
reliability	robustness
pardon my saying so but a smooth progress-bar is gilding the lily - nice to have and look at but not critical to the application s function reliability or robustness

286934
order	add
if every item in the order has it s own version of a price future price changes won t effect it you can add discounts etc

286944
environment	building
does anyone know any source of examples and templates for software requirements building environment description and other kind of documentations that are common for software development

286956
vbscript	vb6
or you could rewrite the vb6 app as a vbscript program

286959
value	field
i ve tried the drew noakes library and the sanselan library but neither give me a value of rgb for any field

286978
perl	c++
json is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the c-family of languages including c c++ c# java javascript perl python and many others

287014
action-filter	controller
what i really wished i could do was have an action-filter that would return a view or partial view during the onactionexecuting event that displays this animated .gif then once the controller completed processsing and returned the viewdata the view or partial view with the actual view data could be displayed

287020
stderr	fflush
you can use fflush or print to stderr which is not buffering

287054
export	report
i need to export a report to excel file using php on the fly

287054
pecl	pear
is there any way i can embed insert images into this excel file without using any library only php code or library which doesn t require pear pecl extensions

287077
macros	basic
looping through the vbprojects collection works but only if user has specifically trusted access to the visual basic project in the macros security settings - which is rarely

287079
multiplication	division
if you re only using multiplication and division rather than operations like square roots that can result in irrational numbers you will never lose precision

287133
unique	words
using lucene one can retrieve the terms containsed within in an index the unique stemmed words excluding stop-words that documents in the index contains

287135
dictionary	map
with such variable properties a dictionary approach basically a map of key-value pairs type specific or not is a great way to retain flexibility in the design

287159
any	set
maybe i do not understand your question well but you can set the specific exception-handling with the fault property of throwactivity in any place before the activity execution

287172
linked-list	queue
it is effectively a hashset but it also maintains a linked-list to allow a predictable iteration order - and therefore can also be used as a fifo queue with the nice added benefit that it can t contain duplicate entries

287186
order	add
in order to ignore matches that occur right next to a or you could add to the start of the regex so you get

287188
selected	checkbox
i can selected all many checkbox and click submit and what is does is a jquery ajax call for each row

287192
gridview	listview
a common web ui design is to display a sortable grid gridview listview datagrid with paging

287199
any	set
after databinding with gridview i wanted to add the result set query1 into dataset or datatable.can anyone give me any idea how to do it

287214
arrays	loops
this will create an arrays copy of your list and it will loops through this instead of the original list

287222
build-process	msbuild
you will also need to master some msbuild ninja moves to keep a 1 step build-process and keep yourself sane using msbuild you can get vs to compile both versions at the same time without resorting to the command line

287227
session-cookies	cookies
i don t know specifically how asp.net implements its sessions but part of the cookies rfc is that session-cookiess ones without a specific expires date are purged whenever the browser is closed

287231
for-loop	loops
use a for-loops instead of a foreach loops

287238
persistence	hibernate
according to java persistence with hibernate

287238
annotations	mapping
mapping collections of value types with annotations ...

287239
filtering	sorting
decouple the filtering sorting from the actual source so that you can mock the datasource

287239
integration-testing	webtest
next you could also use a automatic webtest to test the complete stuff integration-testing

287259
g++	gcc
i tried autoconf but its assuming .h is gcc instead of g++

287267
output	cat
tac lists a file in reverse line order the output of cat backwards

287273
g++	gcc
from reading the this eclipse cdt faq entry it sounds like eclipse can automatically generate a list of include directories if you start your build from within eclipse and if your build outputs the gcc g++ commands before actually starting gcc g++

287275
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is out of beta now and compatibility with wpf has improved

287293
superclass	subclass
should you realize that you need to change the superclass you can fix things without having to sweat the details in each subclass

287305
profiling	trace
normally we only use the sql profiling to run trace for very short periods of time for performance troubleshooting but in this case that really wouldn t give me a good overall picture of the kinds of queries that are run against the database over the course of a day or week or month

287305
profiling	trace
execute the trace server-side sp_ create_trace instead of using the sql profiling user-interface

287307
put	get
and put the techo info in a hidden area ie click here to get the propeller head version

287312
python	tcl
both the tutorial and book have plenty of code examples in tcl and none in python

287312
python	tcl
do they just learn to read the tcl docs and convert them in their head to what the code should probably look like in python

287315
execute	prepare
if you run the query once the statement is parsing prepare bound and execute

287317
instrumentation	profiling
i would rather spend a little time analyzing the problem up front and putting a few strategic print statements than figure out how to instrumentation your app for profiling then pour over gargantuan reports where every executable line of code is timed

287375
associations	model
take a look at the arts associations for retail technology standards data model

287382
django-haystack	searchable
another possible way can be to create two interfaces for searchable object django-haystack and tobesearched object needle

287386
postgresql	mysql
also this was done in postgresql so i m not sure if this exact syntax would work in mysql

287394
evolutionary-algorithm	markov-chains
you probably want to look into markov-chains - they re probably of more use to you than an evolutionary-algorithm to start with as judging the quality of the output in order to breed the best is going to be a nightmare subjective and time-consuming and they re ideal for combining with evolutionary programming

287404
notepad++	vim
the issue is when i try to use that expression in vim and notepad++ it can t seem to find anything

287410
background-color	transparency
to be honest if you re filling up the whole body with these divs then you re better off giving one of them a transparency background and setting the background-color of the body to the desired color masking the problem

287448
global-assembly-cache	gac
yes in general unless you need to install a component into the global-assembly-cache gac all you need to do is copy the files to a folder on the computer you want to run it on

287467
cursor	row
in addition to other comments cursor when used improperly which is often cause unnecessary page row locks

287469
onmouseover	mouseout

what s the difference between having and where in an sql select statement

287475
aggregate	grouping
having is used when you are using an aggregate such as grouping by

287486
having	select
select in blahblahblah grouping by something having count something 0

287492
python	java
java c# python etc. have first-class list structures to contain result sets

287498
mstest	nunit
this allows us to use bizunit s library of steps directly in c# nunit mstest code

287500
anonymous-class	abstract-class
as jon suggested you could create an anonymous-class that implements it inline but there s a class called keyadapter that is an abstract-class implementing keylistener with empty methodss for each interface methods

287507
any	set
in an aggregate query any query where an aggregate-functions is used predicates in a where-clause are evaluated before the aggregated intermediate result set is generated

287507
having	select
that s why predicate conditions on aggregate values must be placed in having clause not in the where-clause and why you can use aliases defined in the select clause in a having clause but not in a where-clause

287534
selected	button
one more thought since each of your five view controllers is a uinavigationcontroller you could always pushviewcontroller animated onto the selected view controller then hide the back button

287535
dependency-injection	inject
that refers to a common pattern also referred to as dependency-injection where dependant objects inside of a class are inject into an instance of the class from client code to control which version of a dependant object the instance will use.

287535
implements	abstract
the key is often the abstract type or interface that all instances of this registration must implements

287535
configuration	environment
in this way simply by changing configuration data you can control the actual types used by the application changing them in one environment or deployment location from those used in another

287538
hash	md5
i would imagine you will have to add a column to the database for the encrypted password then run a batch job over all records which gets the current password encrypts it as others have mentiond a hash like md5 is pretty standard edit but should not be used on its own - see other answers for good discussions stores it in the new column and checks it all happened smoothly

287569
versioning	migrate
for example when a user logs in migrate his or her password automatically to the hash column and remove the unhash versioning

287595
selected	checkbox
when a user selected checking all checkbox i toggle the states of the children - obviously i don t want to fire the check events of all the children until i am done setting all of the checkbox

securitymanager	classloader
class.getmethods bypass es securitymanager checks depending on the immediate caller s classloader see section 6 of the java secure coding guidelines

287668
jquery	.post
there s a great jquery blog .post that you might find useful

287677
conditional	operators
you can also use the bitwise | operators to get or conditional

287689
centering	fixed
and keep the centering point fixed the thing you re looking at

287725
log4net	nlog
also better employ some logging infrastructure nlog log4net so you can output some timing about which operation delays how much as an alternative to attaching a remote debugger

287732
methods	extend
you can extend those controls and then call the onlostfocus and onleave protected methods of the base class.

287741
oracle	mysql
what is the best way to set this up since i see a lot of options to connect the web app to sql server or oracle databases but i m nervous that it won t work correctly with mysql

287757
mapping	unique
i figured that keys did not need to be unique within a section otherwise the parsing would just return a mapping

287760
.net	wcf
my geonames .net wcf client

287777
authentication	login
i m just wondering if not having the allowed to authentication permission may inadvertently block login

pascal	delphi
what code will produce the absolute fastest execution in delphi pascal

287793
contains	set
here is a full example note that whatever is include in the constructor can be set in the properties panels of the designer workflow3 is the target workflow that contains only a codeactivity and the behind code is the following

287793
contains	set
the replicatoractivity contains only a invokeworkflowactivity which has the targetworkflow set to workflow3

287794
value	field
trying something like putting comma separated value in the field which appears a bit clumsy

287794
value	field
create another table for the field and let the multiple value go to the field

287803
contains	any
for more on this topic you could see synedit s source code which contains lexers called highlighters in the project s context for about any language on the market

287831
contains	elements
this problem occurs because a child container html elements contains scripting code that tries to modify the parent container elements of the child container

287834
compatibility	legacy
i ve got some legacy software that i d like to involve in an automated unit test for testing network protocols compatibility and because this software is old and runs in an outdated environment i d like to encapsulate it in a virtual-machine

287858
recurring-billing	google-checkout
google-checkout doesn t currently support recurring-billing but it is on their feature suggestions page

287859
background-color	width
it won t stretch the full width between the label and the right side but you can have the label hide the bottom-border using background-color or something and have the div expand all the way to the right aswell without the margin

287875
javascript	dom
i m trying to come up with a reusable javascript or jquery function that would allow me to test if one object is a dom descendant of another

287883
pbkdf2	scrypt
edit 2016 use argon2 scrypt bcrypt or pbkdf2 in that order of preference

287883
hash	md5
when you hash the passwords use do not use plain md5

287883
pbkdf2	salt
use pbkdf2 which basically means using a random salt to prevent rainbow table attacks and iterating re-hashing enough times to slow the hashing down - not so much that your application takes too long but enough that an attacker brute-forcing a large number of different password will notice

287885
msbuild	nant
you may want to check out some of the nant and msbuild task repositories for vm-related tasks to make this easier

287928
square-bracket	operators
but for the life of me i can t find the documentation on the index square-bracket operators

287932
json	xml
good choices are url encoded parameters xml and json

287937
compact-framework	.net
if you re using the .net compact-framework and developing for windows mobile the easiest approach is to use web services

287940
directory-structure	filesystems
you can create any filesystems and directory-structure on this device

287956
profiling	trace
whereas if profiling is processing the trace it will skip events if the server gets too busy. from sql 70-431 exam book best practices.

287978
if-statement	loops
for example comparing loops in an if-statement

288044
imageview	textview
i know that i can create an xml layout r.layout.mainmenu_item that has an imageview and textview in it but i am unsure how to set the imageview s icon

288054
hide	show
goal efficiently show hide rows based on the data in the row

288057
sqldatasource	gridview
i m working with a gridview that uses a sqldatasource element that looks like this

288074
groovy	java
thanks everyone for all the answers most of them make the same point groovy integrates slightly better with java then jython or jruby

288074
groovy	java
using netbeans 6.5 as my ide i have found that groovy to integrates better with java projects then jruby

288084
folder	dir
exec master.sys.xp_cmdshell dir b c some folder with sql backups in it

288121
directory	folder
however within the directory that i want to recursively search through there are many folder files which have been added locally these i do not want to commit

288127
code-coverage	build-process
i would like to include some code-coverage into our nightly build-process

288127
packaging	building
buckminster drives checkout from multiple repositories and the pde building and packaging of the product

288127
cobertura	eclemma
i have been looking at cobertura emma eclemma dbunit though am very interested to hear of any experiences with these or any other tools

288151
perl	tcl
also for a taste of how these widgets look in ruby perl and tcl see

288175
logging	daemon
i am setting up a logging infrastructure using syslog daemon on my linux server

288179
assign	add
i have a macros that i wrote to just help me with my unit-testing it was derived from other macross that just add underscore.js to the name of the methods as you write it and when i go to tool options environment and then keyboard to assign a shortcut to it it not anywhere to be found none of the mymacross default section is there

288210
arrays	loops
which would give me an arrays of layerid s and then i d loops and do this for each one

288226
macros	vba
wordbasic was used to write macros s for in word before vba was used

288236
xsd	xml
are there any code generators that would take a well-formed xml document and write out an xsd schema based on how the xml document is structured

288263
for-loop	loops
however since we move the multiplication into the for-loops this is done every single loops

288267
pointers	stack
manage both the smart pointers to the controllers and the supervisor on stack which will allow you to determine the order of destruction

288271
xsd	xml
the xsd.exe utility which is installed with visual-studio is capable of creating an xsd file from an xml file

288274
rowdatabound	databound
rowdatabound fires after a row has been databound

288274
rowdatabound	databound
if i want to manipulate the text in a header column does it matter if i use the databound or rowdatabound because i can always just check the e.row.rowtype

288304
.net	wcf
i wonder if there is a means to pass around interfaces and having wcf generate the proxies on the fly on the client as does the original .net remoting

288305
oracle	mysql
i ve seen select getdate oracle and select now mysql and like forms

288309
factors	primes
since you re searching for them in ascending order you could keep a list of the primess you ve already found and only check for divisibility against them since all non-primes numbers can be reduced to a list of lesser primes factors

288310
groovy	java
if you are a java developer groovy feels more similar to your current language then jruby or jython

288310
groovy	java
groovy combines the best of java the language java the platform and ruby the language

288318
visual-studio	release-mode
when executed inside visual-studio in release-mode or from the.exe in any mode

288322
quirks-mode	doctype
i was having problems with both ie and firefox as it was rendering the iframe document in quirks-mode until i added the doctype

288322
google-chrome	firefox
firefox ie google-chrome support the .scrollheight doesnt work with google-chrome so i have come up with a javascript example using jquery to set all iframe heights on a page based on the iframes content

288351
rowdatabound	databound
databound happens after all rowdatabound events are done firing and therefore only fires once for the control

288412
dictionary	arrays
now i would like to deserialize a semi-complex json string which represents an arrays of dictionary

288418
hash	md5
however i always get different md5 results when i hash the file after it is downloaded

288419
stringbuilder	stringwriter
feed stringbuilder to the stringwriter

288420
deployment	install
i don t just run the app in house - others download it and run it on their sites or run it at hosting companies so doing things without requiring that a service be install makes the deployment easier

288425
.net	wcf
the code complexity involved with wcf is quite a bit higher than with the plain old .net remoting solution

288440
salt	md5
get md5 javascript implementation and compare salt

288465
document	element
my problem is this i execute an xpath query from an element in my document which i know will return another element

288468
contains	elements
write a javascript function that will hide the swf or its contains elements and call that function via the close button in the swf itself

288473
insert-into	prepare
the question is whether you should use a simple string for the statment insert-into table1 value x y 12 vs a prepare statement insert-into table1 value

288476
hash	md5
if im not totally wrong here the md5 hash is only working on the actual data not the timestamps and other metadata

288486
push	pull
that lets anyone push pull their changes including branches to the bare repository and then others can fetch pull merge as they see fit

288496
configuration	logging
here is my logging configuration in my asp.net app

288499
callback	methods
make sure than in your callback you use the proper endxxx methods etc

288500
restart	daemon
restart the ssh daemon doesn t correct the problem

288501
expander	grid
i ran into a similar problem using an expander inside a grid with a gridsplitter

288507
versioning	upgrade
i wouldn t advise running this many versioning or instances on a production box but 2 instances until you upgrade your other applications to 2005 should be no problem

288536
stderr	stdout
stdout and stderr neednâ t be built-in

288544
where-clause	sql
it appears that the filters provide the where-clause to the generated sql query

288562
g++	gcc
gnu gcc g++ provides non portable attributes for types which are very useful

288570
spring	grails
seeing as how the guys who make grails just got bought out by spring source yesterday i would say grails

288570
groovy	java
also since groovy is a superset of java you can dive right in just using the java you know without having to learn ruby

288570
groovy	java
now you ll learn a lot of dynamic stuff too and eventually write groovy code instead of java code but it lowers the barrier to entry

288615
hash	md5
accidental collision of md5 is impossible in all practical scenarios to get a 50 chance of collision you d have to hash 6 billion urls per second every second for 100 years

288615
hash	md5
even though there is a known collision attack against md5 intentional malicious collisions are currently impossible against hash urls

288620
entity-relationship	diagram
i am trying to generate an entity-relationship diagram from an existing ms sql-server 2005 database

288622
perl	c++
there are libraries for it in c c++ c# java and python there are alpha versons for ruby and perl

288650
pyro	rpyc
if you re even considering pyro checkout rpyc first and re-consider xml-rpc

288665
grouping	sorting
either way it s seems like wrong way to pulling your data you can probably do taht with one query adequate sorting order by directly in the sql-server grouping by and sum for getting the sum of your terms

288665
hashtable	sorted
then just copy it to your hashtable and it should already be sorted aswell as limited to 10 entries

288674
frame-rate	fps
though for gameplay ai physics spikes are much more of a concern as that will usually what makes your game look choppy which is often worse than a low frame-rate assuming we re not dipping below 20 fps

288698
.when	ready
we ve found the scripting to be incredibly helpful in developing snappy applications where images are always ready .when we need them

288716
joomla	drupal
drupal joomla mambo ... etc

288732
hash	md5
at the moment i calculate an md5 hash for the known file and then scan all files recursively looking for a match

288741
virtual-machine	vmware
we run jira on a virtual-machine - vmware running windows-server 2003 se and storing data on our sql-server 2000 server

288744
iso	utc
it does of course rely on the utc string being a properly formatted iso 8601 string

288749
hash	md5
it seems pretty pointless to read the entire file compute a md5 hash and then compare the hash

288752
safari	opera
the problem is not seen with ie6 ie7 opera latest stable nov 2008 or safari latest stable nov 2008

288755
.when	ready
.when data is ready to report a value is placed in a table in the db

288759
perl	ruby
i ve done similar-enough tasks in perl ruby and vbscript

288761
dojo	gwt
none of the ajax things gwt dojo are on the list yet

288771
richfaces	icefaces
icefaces or richfaces jsf

288789
hash	md5
you should either use a hash function which has not been broken yet like sha-1 or as soapbox mentioned use md5 only as a fast way to find candidates for a deeper comparison

288790
binary-tree	tree
i believe std maps are implemented as binary-trees meaning searching for a key will only require comparing your key down to the depth of the tree which will be 8 for a 100 element binary-tree

288807
constructor	object
you could pass a file object in the constructor of the logger class

288808
ienumerator	ienumerable
is yield return a shortcut for implementing ienumerable and ienumerator

288833
environment	building
custom building environment

288867
button	popup
i just need some text and a simple close button link but i would like the page darkened below the popup as it does with the ajax modal control

288877
callback	methods
is there a way i can set up callback on or automataically log methods parameters entries and exits without making explicit calls within each methods

288885
any	set
this is currently how mainstream browsers do this - it s necessary to ensure that example.co.uk can t set a cookie for .co.uk which would then be sent to any other website under .co.uk

288898
element	dynamic
i want some of the element values to be dynamic or expandable

288904
environment	building
this gives you a stable environment for your building include 3rd party libraries environment variables etc.

288908
contains	set
the simplest way is to set or add to pythonpath and put or symlink your modules and packages into a path contains in pythonpath

288918
insertion-sort	quicksort
for example insertion-sort has worse algorithmic complexity than quicksort at least in the average case but in almost all implementations insertion-sort is faster than quicksort for small n and so quicksorts break out to insertion-sort towards the end

288918
floor	ceil
so the worst case depth is floor 2 log2 n call it 15 for a total of 120 and the best is ceil 1 2 log2 n which is 4

288921
cursor	row
over a small table the speed of summing up the rows over the order by columns favors the set-based operation but as the table increases in row size the cursor will become faster because it can simply carry the running total value to the next pass of the loop

288931
pascal	delphi
delphi aka object pascal i ll talk about the native version not .net

288942
multiplication	division
but division and multiplication could be costly.

288946
division	modulo
but the modulo operators might be as costly as a division

288954
aspect-ratio	scale
now my content scale and keeps aspect-ratio

288955
binary	hex
however what if i want to specify and send a hex or binary number

288965
decimal	hex
decimal and hex character references are all accepted

288968
python	perl
is it possible to perform a named-group match in perl s regex syntax as with python

288999
simplemodal	jquery
i ve used the simplemodal jquery plugin and i ve been quite happy with it

289005
hash	md5
the md5 hash is calculated on the file contents and is not affected by document metadata

289005
hash	md5
how are you creating the md5 hash for the file

289010
contains	elements
we have a class that contains a number of sorting functions and we have no issues sorting by one elements

289034
division	modulo
but here s a fun fact gcc doesn t use division modulo for this

289047
hide	show
if you wanted to show an image somewhere else on the page you could accomplish that using javascript to hide show the image on the link s mouseover event

289062
authentication	login
login authentication

289064
.net	wcf
this may not be exactly what you are looking for but wcf should always be considered when doing application communication in a .net system

289072
value	field
a char 1 is smaller and in this situation probably more readable but a specialized table gives you a little more visibility and maybe even ease of management if you want to add and remove possible value of this field later

289091
arrays	map
more specifically it is map of lists vectors arrays

289093
http-method	post
if i change the http-method in the ajaxoptions to post all is well

289095
account	userid
you should use a unique userid password pair for each account you have

289113
environment	building
but anyway your mangled name is going to depend on your calling-convention so before you find your mangle name you need to know what your building environment is using as the calling-convention

289128
jquery	.post
if you are making http .post requests throug jquery you could dynamically insert the __mvcasync.post value into your request and then you could take advantage of the ismvcajaxrequest extension method

289149
python	perl
as of perl 5.10 perl regexes support some python features making them python compatible regexes i guess

289149
python	perl
the python versions have the p in them but all of these work in perl 5.10

289149
buffering	capture
define a named capture buffering

289149
buffering	capture
backreference to a named capture buffering

289149
buffering	capture
subroutine call to a named capture buffering

289156
directory	folder
you are probably receiving errors on your build- it sounds like the dll s are actually output from other projects in your solution so you should check if they are building properly or if they are being output to a different directory instead of your bin folder

289158
directory	folder
you need to specify copy local on your references this will copy them out of the library folder into your bin directory

289159
textarea	pre
i tried setting white-space pre on the textarea s css but it s still not enough

289163
cassini	iis
the other thing that s a pretty big gotcha is debugging web-services is much easier using iis and vdirs rather than separate cassini instances

289182
subclassing	base-class
since it is the base-class it allows you to return any of the actionresult subclassing such as viewresult or jsonresult

289193
dictionary	arrays
your outermost object should be a dictionary and not an arrays

289195
sorted	lookup
if the items in the map aren t going to change much after the map is constructed or you don t need to interleave insertions with lookup you might try just keeping the key-value pairs in a sorted vector

289202
fogbugz	trac
you can also find hosted solutions for fogbugz jira and trac

289220
updating	updates
else updating just updates the item table

289241
perl	php
forgive me for a potentially silly question here but in other programming languages scripting ones like php or perl it is often easy to dump everything contained within a variable

289258
irrlicht	ogre
now if you want something like this for a free project and you know c++ you may try any of the many open source engines out there such as ogre or irrlicht

289268
value	field
what this accomplishes is to make sure that any value already assigned to the field the combo box is bound to will still display

289268
value	field
if you have a blank rowsource that won t work so the reference to the form s current value for that field and union it with the filtering list

289269
groovy	java
the fact that groovy is also essentially a superset of java means that the huge population of java programmers out there will have a quicker uptake time in picking groovy up over ruby jruby

289269
groovy	java
they can start programming it like it s java and slowly start inserting idomatic groovy as they pick it up

289269
groovy	java
more to the point of what you re asking i think that another advantage of groovy is that the language that you go to when you want to optimize something is almost the exact same syntax it s java

289269
python	java
if you re working in the ruby or python worlds you re going to have to go to either c which is a big shift or java which is also quite different than those languages

289269
groovy	java
programming in groovy tends to help keep your java skills somewhat sharp as well

289269
python	ruby
if you have particular access to a ruby or python infrastructure or a team that has familiarity with those kind of environments then i could see choosing one of those other languages

289273
code-coverage	eclemma
eclemma would be a good start a code-coverage tool would allow a coverage session to record the information you are looking for

289281
python	php
in cocoa there is no dump like php s print_r or python repr since there is no textual format that represents an object as in those languages

289301
selected	button
click the + button in the lower-left corner of the screen to add a library scroll down to the bottom of the library list and selected libz.dylib

289315
background-color	display
in ie6 the paragraph following the empty paragraph is display with the background-color of the empty paragraph which i m guessing is wrong

289316
any	set
that means you need to set it up so that you can readily restart the server but also you need to offline any data that you generate and wish to keep either to one of amazons other services like s3 or to some other external service

289317
webforms	asp.net
and not the account the user signed up with using some stock standard asp.net webforms page

289325
basic	vb6
my vb6 is a little rusty but basic dialog to choose a file is provided already

289329
void-pointers	dereference
i got dereference void-pointers error while compiling the below code-snippets

289340
instrumentation	debugging
if i understand the question correctly you want more than the standard stacktrace data but you don t want to manually instrumentation your code with say log4j debugging statements

289348
.when	ready
work on several features at once release each individually .when it s ready

289356
project-management	scrum
there s agile project-management with scrum by ken schwaber and crystal clear a human-powered methodology for small teams by alistair cockburn

289362
value	field
i m using the mysql query browser part of the mysql gui tools and need to change a field to null but i can t figure out how to do it - if i delete the value it tries to update it to

289368
curly-braces	braces
edit as mentioned by romaintaz below you can also get eclipse to auto-select all of the code between two curly-bracess simply by double-clicking to the immediate right of a opening braces

289377
selected	cell
in mysql query browser right click on the cell and selected clear field content while the focus is in another cell

289377
selected	cell
in mysql workbench right click on the cell and selected set field to null

289378
postgresql	mysql
not a relational database like mysql or postgresql

289395
.when	ready
as for the release process you could introduce the features .when they are ready and inform the users via a company blog that is updates .whenever a new feature is done

289404
while-loop	loops
put the while-loops in the third exe to sleep each time through the loops and see what happens

289404
while-loop	loops
even if it doesn t fix this particular probem it isn t ever good practice to poll with a while-loops and even using sleep inside a loops is a poor substitute for a proper timer

289405
if-statement	loops
for instance i try my best to avoid having an if-statement in the most inner loops especially one with a result which is not somewhat uniform say evaluates to true or false randomly

289421
.when	ready
like someone else said - make sure .when a request hits your server you ll be ready to reply

289434
shutdown	exit
thread.join doesn t look like a solution - the db thread only exit at app shutdown

289438
udp	tcp
tcp 1433 and udp 1434 are open on our firewall

289452
host	dns
i keep getting the no such host is known exception-handling even though i could access google with my browser the dns server is almost certainly working

289468
contains	elements
i am working on an algorithm that will try to pick out given an html file what it thinks is the parent elements that most likely contains the majority of the page s content text

289468
children	tree
i have come up with a few ideas such as traversing the html document tree to its leaves adding up the length of the text and only seeing what other text the parent has if the parent gives us more content than the children do

289476
traversal	parent
start form parent nodes and traversal the tree for each node that is just formatting it would continue the count within that sub block

289476
traversal	parent
once you find the most content block traversal back up the tree to its parent to get your answer

289482
worksheet	excel
it is possible that vba is still holding a reference to the worksheet so excel hasn t tidied it up properly

289491
order	add
use the test view and the add extra columns and order

289493
authentication	login
i get an error because the application is trying to connect to the sql-server with nt authority anonymous login instead of my domain user and anonymous isn t authentication

289498
command-line	cmd
my actuall requirement is i want to start the tracd server using the command-line cmd whenever windows boots up

289506
parentheses	operators
study c s operators precedences and insert parentheses where necessary

289525
python	java
type safe languages like c# java vb lisp ruby python and many others would throw an exception if you tried to cast an array of characters to a foo instance

289525
python	ruby
late binding in vb or code in ruby or python enables strong dynamic duck typing

289533
worksheet	excel
i have also managed to reduce # of rows in my excel worksheet by copying it to another worksheet then deleting the original sheet

289533
worksheet	excel
you could also try copying only the data in your worksheet and paste it into a new excel workbook file

289569
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to new versioning

289572
keyboard	mouse
what i m searching for is the pen equivalent to the hid mouse driver hid keyboard driver and mass storage driver

289572
keyboard	mouse
the mentioned example drivers makes it possible for windows linux and mac os to recognize mouse keyboard and memory sticks without installing new drivers

289572
keyboard	mouse
so far i m able to make usb hid descriptors that qualify as mouse and keyboard from os point of view and automatically uses the standard driver supplied by the os

289580
versioning	upgrade
but just to add xsl s answer using the lts versioning on servers allows you to have some confidence you can deploy servers which are going to be regularly patched but will not need upgrade of the entire os

289583
desktop-application	multi-user
my project will be a desktop-application with a simply db that will be using sql-lite as there is no need for multiple connections nor multi-user access

289587
click	mouse
there is only one way to do this edit this is referring to the sip in non-smartphone windows-mobile so i m not sure it s relevant to your question and it does involve simulating a mouse click on the 123 button

289590
png	ico
it creates an ico file from 1 or more png s and handles multiple sizes etc like

289592
python	java
i asked someone to sketch some java code on a whiteboard when interviewing and was surprised to see the candidate put some python up instead

289615
upgrade	migrate
it was long obsolete by then having been succeeded by both windows 2000 and xp 2003 but because companies did either not want to migrate yet or had custom software that is not compatible microsoft provided support and security upgrade until then

289633
convenience-methods	initializer
so maybe the image that s made with the initializer can release it s image data when it receives a memory warning since it can go back to the systemd cache while the one that s created by the convenience-methods can t

289681
highlight	selected
however when i try to do this in gvim under windowss it selected all highlight or visually selected all text in the current windows

specifications	w3c
the http 1.1 specifications or from w3c provides a pseudocode example of how to decode chunked transfer-coding

289699
any	set
the best way to check would be to instead set the visibility to visibility.colapsed and see if there s any drawing performance difference

289712
pascal	delphi
as a long time pascal and delphi developer i always line up my begin and ends thus

289717
perl	awk

return-type	arguments
in java 5 a methods can override another if the arguments match exactly but the return-type of the overriding methods if it is a subtyping of the return-type of the other methods

289755
value	field
the main problem seems to be not initializing value - treating field as variables

289760
sftp	scp
i m looking for something simple and secure like scp rsync sftp

289761
c++	lua
i ll make a c++ client library as well in the near future and of course c# java and lua wrappers

289780
sftp	scp
there are scores of sftp scp clients for windows

289780
winscp	putty
you ll find winscp putty filezilla and list free country list of sftp clients

289793
bazaar	git
that being said if you have some requirements to do this that you cannot get around you can use one of the more modern version control systems like git bazaar and darcs there are others but i ve used these three

289796
deployment	install
i know that you can install your windows service via the vs deployment system which i ve done

289800
installation	building
now i want to use that as a standalone building tool but i am unable to find the installation directory

289837
background-image	transparency
make a new single background-image that s 592px wide transparency background and has the gradients at the left and right of it - a 1px high image with left gradient - transparency section 504px wide - right gradient

289838
perl	ruby
the documentation and discussion forums imply that it s possible but the methods in wxhttp are very low-level compared to what you find in .net and scripting languages like perl and ruby

289841
superclass	inherited
in oop languages like c# or vb.net if i make the properties or methods in a superclass protected i can t access them in my form - they can only be accessed in my class that inherited from that superclass

289847
32-bit	64bit
is it a 64bit vs 32-bit problem

289849
aggregate	grouping
assuming that the column headings john lucy etc are fixed you can grouping by the address field and use if functions combined with aggregate operators to get your results

289865
internet-explorer	firefox
this needs to work with internet-explorer 6 and 7 and preferably with firefox 3 as well

289877
contains	set
create a new appdomain to load the assembly and set the appdomain s base directory to the directory contains all the assemblies

289879
python	lua
i looked at lua io python ruby and a host of others but the challenge essentially is that i don t think non-programmers will be able to understand the code all that much

289883
contains	any
you could create a hook to block check-ins of any code that contains tabs at the start of a line or contains tabs at all

289914
sql-server	oracle
i know what i m looking for is probably a security hole but since i managed to do it in oracle and sql-server i ll give it a shot

289914
command-line	cmd
notice i m not looking for the system cmd which the mysql cmd-line tool offers

289915
filtering	sorting
sorting and filtering rows on conditions

289916
triggers	insert
in case of triggers it obviously is because it could return something that s totally not the last id that your insert created

289923
struct	unions
compilers are allowed to add padding to struct and unions and while i admit that it s a little surprising that yours does round up the union to a two byte size when you are able to get a one byte struct it is perfectly allowed

289931
json	xml
janrain now has a service that will allow you accept openids and facebook with minimal engineering effort make https calls to the service and parse an xml json response

289938
binaries	install
to have a standalone build tool i suggest that you just download directly the maven2 binaries files and install it on your computer if it is not already done

289941
updatepanel	datalist
i have datalist that is inside an updatepanel and it is in panel in modalpopupextender

289961
any	set
however if you have any bytes with the bit set ascii transfer mode will lose them - hence binary mode which truncates nothing

289963
csv	xml
specifically for log file analysis i would recommend microsoft s log parser free which will allow you to run queries with basic aggregation against all types of text based files and across sets of files xml csv event log the registry file system active directory etc

289969
rollback	commit
at the end of the procedure after rollback commit it sets the transaction isolation level to read commited

290018
radio-button	selected
to allow selected only one radio-button in time i have used a trick form this article

290073
windows-server	windows
i m not sure if you can yet to use powershell v1.0 you needed to download windows sdk for windows-server 2008 and .net 3.5 to get the dll file that you referenced

290079
apache	squid
using ab to pull the same image 10 000 times with a concurrency of 100 both apache on its own and squid apache burned through the requests very quickly

290079
apache	squid
but squid made only a single request to apache for the image then served them all from ram whereas apache alone had to fork a large number of workers in order to serve the images

290079
apache	squid
it looks like squid will work well in freeing up the apache workers to handle dynamic pages

290085
youtube	flickr
my advice if you have never written a web application before is to start by using off the shelf tools - try using wordpress or the like for content management and hosting videos with a third party youtube photobucket flickr or the like

290091
savepoints	rollback
in postgresql you can even nest them by using savepoints which you can do a rollback to

290095
void-pointers	dereference
from this it follows you cannot dereference void-pointers and neither you can take the sizeof of it

290095
void-pointers	dereference
the moment you assign something to a void-pointers any type information of the original pointed to type is lost so you can only dereference if you first cast it back to the original pointers type

290103
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you could also look into the routing library that was built for asp.net-mvc in one of the previews they split those classes off into the system.web.routing namespace and from what i ve heard it can be used with webforms now

290104
value	field
on submit you ll write a value in that field and make sure you check on every submit attempt if this field is empty

290133
if-statement	while-loop
i could always copy the code within the while-loop and place it within an if-statement preceding the while-loop which will also include my print statement

290177
precompiled-headers	stdafx.h
when you normally use precompiled-headers stdafx.h serves 2 purposes

290186
export	report
if you need different layouts depending on what format the report export to then you need to make separate reports for each of those layouts

290212
compact-framework	.net
i don t know what these are called in the c++ world but in .net compact-framework your application form s resize event would be called when you minimize maximize a window and then in the event code you would check the windowstate property of the form to see if its minimized or mazimized

290218
windows-mobile	windows-ce
the pocket pc os is built on windows-ce 3.0 and lower while windows-mobile is now built on windows-ce 5.0 even windows-mobile 6 but was also built on windows-ce 4

290232
moss	wss
we checked out kofax ocr for anydoc and a couple of others on the ocr side and sharepoint wss sharepoint moss hyland onbase sap collaboration manager and documentum on the repository collaboration side

290241
groovy	java
groovy is aimed squarely at being the choice for java developers .

290241
jruby	mri
the jruby team are now reporting better performance than the native mri

290253
value	field
a tinyint is an 8-bit integer value a bit field can store between 1 bit bit 1 and 64bit bit 64

290259
radio-button	selected
since you are using javascript already to handle the radio-button click event on the client you could update a hidden field with the selected value at the same time

290262
innodb	myisam
5.0.3 for myisam and extended in 5.0.5 to memory innodb bdb and ndbcluster

290267
pointers	stack
when you pass a reference-type to another methods byval you are creating a copy of the address stored in the calling methodss stack and passing the copy of that value the pointers address to the called methods where it is stored in a new memory slot in the called methodss stack

290267
pointers	stack
if i pass a reference-type byref otoh i am passing a pointers to the declared variables in the calling methods stack which contains a pointers to the object on the heap it is therefore a pointers to a pointers to the object

290298
png	gif
gif or png

290305
attributes	properties
it seems to me nibernate should have enough mapping metadata to do the right thing or does the unique attributes on the properties not ensure this

290320
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t occur with firefox safari or google-chrome

290323
value	field
- when the object is found in the list of objects i want all the field to have a value and be sent to the client

290323
value	field
- when the object in not found in the list of objects i only want the objectname and objectstatus field to have value and be sent to the client

290328
value	field
this is best if you want to use standardised sql and don t mind that the field could contains an out of range value basically anything that isn t 0 will be true

290335
firefox	safari
the following works fine in ie and safari but firefox is positioning the div absolutely on the page not within the cell code based on the solution solution here

290335
quirks-mode	firefox
i have tested both with and without the dtd which put firefox in quirks-mode and standards mode and neither worked properly

290351
callback	methods
dowski s methods is best you should modify the various bound callbacks to bind to an ordered sequence of custom events with the first callback bound to the real event

290362
any	set
any values you do not set in the response object will have their default values set int 0 string but this way you can signal to the client not to pay attention to those fields

290403
postgresql	hsqldb
postgresql or hsqldb and possible even h2 database

290407
overlapping	padding
you can have a header section which has background aligned to the bottom as an image and bottom padding that prevents text content from overlapping that part

290409
dbix-class	dbi
it combines the various templating engines such as templates toolkit or mason with the various orm interfaces like dbix-class and class dbi

290415
hash	md5
the secret key is used to create a signature via md5 hash

290430
selectedindexchanged	selectedindex
selectedindexchanged is not going to be raised if you set the selectedindex or selectedvalue via code

290433
value	field
while technically nulls are ok as a field value they are quite frequently frowned upon

290433
value	field
depending on how data is written to your database it is possible and common to end up with an empty string value in the field as opposed to a null

290438
background-image	height
otherwise create a div with the correct height set its background-image to a very thin 1 or 2 pixel image with the correct height color gradient properties and tile it across the x axis

290440
exception-handling	try-catch
though that would throw an exception-handling if nothing matches so you d probably want to wrap it in a try-catch

290440
expression	brackets
the brackets make this a generator expression rather than a list comprehension

290448
notepad++	emacs
in this particular case using a gpl-licensed editor like notepad++ or emacs puts no obligation on the product you re building with your code providing you don t distribute notepad++ or its libraries with your product

290456
python	java
the conclusion seemed to be that i should go for something like python and then convert any critical bits into something faster like java or c c++

290456
python	php
my overall question is is writing web applications in python a good idea and is it as easy as it is with php

290460
hash	md5
why do a md5 hash and not something like aes

290463
contains	set
if you set a password to be a newly created guid then it is a rather safe password more than 8 charcters contains numbers letters ans special characters etc

290469
sniffing	packets
since everything is so opaque and the client is for obvious reasons unwilling to pay us to sit in their facility for 8 hours or so to physically see it happen perhaps with network monitoring packets sniffing tools we re kind of at a loss

290470
ip-address	hostname
replance windowshostname with your hostname or ip-address

290471
export	csv
when you need to read from a log export your csv file to a table on your sql-server then you can query with standard sql statements

290473
hash	md5
the hash is strictly a signature so a one-way hash like md5 is good enough for their usage

290474
message	alert
the following will popup your alert message and set the variables appropriately although i haven t tested it for errors

290499
any	set
alternatively if you have a msdn developer license you can run tfs workgroup edition and set up a build-server on any old xp box

290513
negative-number	zero
i do not want to accept decimals negative-number and numbers with leading zero

290516
ostream	std
note the use of constant ... since otherwise boost lambda wouldn t notice that this is supposed to be a lambda expression the compiler would try to output the string using std cout and assign the result an std ostream reference to menu help

290516
boost-function	boost-lambda
you can still use boost-function since it will accept everything returning void and taking no arguments - including function objects which is what boost-lambda creates

290520
duplicates	elements
i am writing out the contents of my underlying list tag to the trace.axd and that shows the elements to be in the correct order without duplicates

290547
pylons	django
if you are looking for something that comes prepackaged with web db templating integration i d suggest looking at django turbogears or pylons

290547
cherrypy	web.py
if you want to have more control over the individual components look at cherrypy colubrid or web.py

290563
linkbutton	onclick
one thing to keep in mind with linkbutton s if you re planning to use ajax alot of ajax solutions will insert javascript on the linkbutton s onclick event which is not a valid event for a link

290563
internet-explorer	firefox
some browsers will handle the code such as internet-explorer while others will ignore it such as firefox

290577
python	php
i would suggest django but given that you ask for something as easy as it is with php then you must take a look at psp python server pages

290585
highlight	selected
the selected options of the main menu as well as the submenu are also highlight by adding a class main_on and class sub_on by onclick event

290590
textbox	button
for both .net winforms and windows presentation foundation if i have a textbox that the user has just entered text into and a button if the user clicks the button the lostfocus event fires before the button click event fires

290594
environment	building
if they really want an accurate answer they re going to have to let you building at least some test applications that can simulate the actual environment

290609
python	php
it is easier to write web-apps in python than it s in php

290615
subtract	add
quick test are you going to add subtract multiply divide phone numbers

290630
attributes	properties
we ve vaguely got somewhere - using upper and lower instead of encryption functions - by combining paired properties one mapped with a custom user type and the other with a formula attributes

290632
compatibility	platform
cross platform compatibility is not an issue

290641
updating	updates
updating the table means you should join that selected to your updates

290645
hash	md5
so one approach could be to sort them concatenate the bytes and take an md5 hash of all the bytes.

290650
cherrypy	django
however raw cgi is a huge pain when compared with the greatly simplified world of an all-python framework turbogears cherrypy django whatever.

290650
python	php
this leads to some confusion see syntax error whenever i put python code inside a django template when you want to use the free-and-unconstrained php style on the django framework

290650
contains	any
those view functions can contains any python code at all

290656
order	add
if you ve actually got a sequence of guids and the order matters then i d suggest using the same approach i wrote about in another answer - repeatedly add multiply

290664
ostream	std
this will automatically work for any type which has defined with an std ostream

290664
ostream	std
it will also automatically work with stream manipulator objects - those are really just functions which take an std ostream parameter and just calls the function on the ostream

290677
authentication	login
the downside is you don t have the ability to format the login screen - it will be a standard http authentication dialog box

290679
groovy	scala
anyone have any references examples of this problem solved nicely with preferably groovy or scala

290686
ncover	nant
for a build runner we use nant to send email to various people copy the packaged builds where they re supposed to go run nunit and ncover and deploy the software to our web farm

290694
directory	folder
i was asked to find a way to monitor changes modification renaming deletion moving of files in specific folder on the company s shared file server simple windows shared directory

290704
rollback	commit
for transaction control you use begin commit and rollback

290704
rollback	commit
then you end the transaction by issuing either a commit or rollback

290705
hash	md5
md5 and sha1 have shown a bit of weakness two words can result in the same hash so using sha256-sha512 iterative hash is recommended to hash the password

290711
any	set
just guessing here because i don t have time to set up a test and confirm right now but are you doing any validating

290712
32-bit	64bit
it could be equal to a dword 32-bit or it could be 64 bits on a 64bit platform

290749
stdout	stdio
if that s a concern you should arrange to call system.out.flush before calling your jni function and in your c function if it s using stdio rather than the low-level write call you should call fflush stdout before returning

290751
postback	ajax
the ajax tab control will do all tab switching client side which means there is no postback callback when switching tabs

290761
web-services	api
i m writing some blog software and wondered if there was a standard restful api if not i ll go buy the restful web-services book and design my own

290778
textbox	button
i m looking at service.controller and have been successful in stopping and starting various services with button events but now i m trying to figure out a way to return the service status to a textbox and query for service status every 10 seconds or so and i feel like i m hitting a brick wall

290779
constructor	mutators
but in order to mock any helper classes we usually create some way to externally set them via constructor or mutators

290784
capacity-planning	metrics
see capacity-planning for web performance metrics models and methods

290830
callback	methods
generically a delegate is an object used to access a methods external to the object owning the methods while a callback is a variables that holds a delegate

290832
javascript	dom
the web 2.0 apps that i ve worked with usually use client-side javascript to request json data from the server then use that data to update the page in-place via dom

290835
callback	methods
in particular you could then have one callback with one methods to call on error and one on success

290882
callback	methods
in this way you can control a large chunk of the internal behavior of a methods from outside the methods by passing pointers to different callback each time you call it.

290882
callback	methods
on one call to the sort methods you might pass a callback that compares by object name and another time pass a function that compares by object weight or whatever.

290899
command-line	cmd
how exactly using vb6 can i can call any windows-shell cmd as you would from the cmd-line

290909
grouping	sorting
for example i would prefer to keep items in same order each time with like items grouping together instead of sorting them

290923
updating	updates
i ve tried rm ing the file and updating i ve tried cvs updates -a and neither changes the flag

290940
checkbox	button
does anyone know if it s possible to determine using javascript whether the user s browser allows checkbox and radio button to be focused

290940
browser-detection	safari
i can t just use browser-detection to do this because in at least one case safari the user can turn the ability on and off

290951
authentication	login
writing the code for the user authentication portion of a web site including account registration login and password resets is pretty simple but what do you need to make a really good user authentication setup

290962
value	field
form constructor has initial param that allows to provide default value for field

290995
any	set
is a wildcard denoting the set of all types or any

291020
administration	account
it s this last step that can be circumvented by administration by returning true to basically all account verification requests but in most cases if the user has intentionally entered a bad address it s already been caught

291043
ms-access	oracle
ms-access to oracle

291067
32-bit	64bit
one section is used by 64bit processes and one part by 32-bit processes

291070
sql-server	oracle
i worked at a company for a number of years whose product supported either oracle or sql-server

291070
sql-server	oracle
the packages were used to make the oracle triggers work similearly to sql-server ones with a logical inserted and deleted tables we kept two sets of stored procedure scripts

291073
environment	execution
splitting your application code between two different sets of development tools and execution environment can get complicated and it can make it harder to find skilled employees

291079
selected	cell
i also found a workaround that works on release or debugging build get any cell in the range using get_item then call selected on that item then selected again to de-selected it

291079
selected	cell
apparently select cannot be called on the range if there is a cell already selected or perhaps if the selection state is undefined

291082
linux	unix
it effectively ends the os wars if you run web apps - the apple fans can keep using apples the msoft fans and unix linux fans likewise

291082
versioning	upgrade
upgrading desktop apps can be a nightmare especially if you develop a new versioning using new tools and suddently have to upgrade all the other stuff dlls binaries whatever on all the desktops

291083
selected	cell
i also found a workaround that works on release or debugging build get any cell in the range using get_item then call selected on that item then selected again to de-selected it

291083
selected	cell
apparently select cannot be called on the range if there is a cell already selected or perhaps if the selection state is undefined

291089
stream	send
at the very least load the tiff selected the first frame page do a drawimage into a new bitmap save the bitmap as jpg to a memory stream and send that to response

291093
abstract-class	subclassing
extract getfile into its own class hierarchy with an abstract-class say tabstractfileutils that defines the contract and concrete subclassing that implement it including your default tdefaultfileutils

291093
subclassing	inherited
this won t prevent others from subclassing tdefaultfileutils and calling the inherited getfile but that is just not how inherited works anyway

291098
user-interface	look-and-feel
i let them loose withing some carefully chosen parameters to redesign the main user-interface menu look-and-feel logo placement and if it does not negatively affect the usability then i make the changes

291102
required	checked
right now my controllerss all inherited from a base controllers so my first thought was to override the onactionexecuted methods to checked for the existence of the required form field and from there if it finds it verify it against the cookie and either allow the post to continue or kick it to some error page

291123
python	java
yes you can write perfect web2.0 web applications without using any framework on the server side in any language perl python java etc and without using any javascript libraries framework on the client side

291123
javascript	dom
know how to safely evaluate parse the json object using javascript and know to manipulate the dom

291157
fogbugz	svn
most any of the popular defect issue tracking systems will handle the incident and document management - think wiki with trac or fogbugz along with svn for doc mgmt

291157
msbuild	nant
as for tools to consider - i think searching stack overflow for nant msbuild cruisecontrol etc will give you more content than you can shake a stick at.

291162
value	field
before submitting the form i d like to grab the value of the checkbox and stick them into a text field then submit that

291183
firefox	opera
it appears to work perfectly in firefox 3.0.4 but both opera 9.62 and ie fails to execute any other javascript from the same .javascript file including what normally works

291183
jquery	.post
i have a similar .post jquery function in the file which works fine when the above code is not there

291189
firefox	safari
works great in firefox but shows up at the top of the page in safari

291189
firefox	safari
on the image breaks it in firefox and does nothing in safari

291246
scheme	lisp
scheme started out as an experiment to add smalltalk-like oop to lisp

291252
push	pull
so some way to be able to push and pull the built objects to a server is critical for this

291252
svn	rcs
integration with rcs we use svn

291255
duplicates	elements
another way is to sort the arrays then walk the elements until you find a pair of adjacent duplicates

291267
scheme	lisp
if you re shaky on recursion at all i highly recommend learning scheme or lisp

291270
ruby	php
note that i d rather not work without an ide - upon trying one for php i instantly became completely dependent sigh on them - and since i ve never really used ruby or rails before having code completion would be a major help

291288
firefox	safari
the following works for me in firefox ie safari

291304
google-chrome	firefox
the code works on firefox ie7 google-chrome but not safari

291311
64bit	x86
the only difference is that i am now running 64bit as opposed to x86

291318
external	embed
it turned out i had changed an external referenced .swc file s embed mode set to external as opposed to using it as an rsl

291326
contains	any
one problem i see is that the paths mentioned there seem to need to be the short versions of the filenames such that they don t contains any spaces

291329
continuum	bamboo
apache s continuum and atlassian s bamboo will meet #2-6

291330
installation	upgrade
see for example the more fields plugins - it adds to the new edit post form without breaking your ability to upgrade the core installation

291366
stderr	stdout
you give it a bunch of command lines to run stored in a database it captures the exit value and stdout and stderr and if the exit value is non-zero it marks the build as broken

291372
postgresql	mysql
for development i use mysql and postgresql on windows xp

291381
selected	checkbox
add a class name in my example colorcheckbox to all checkbox with colors in your form if checkbox exists - this help avoid problems when you want to use different additional checkbox in your form for other purposes than selected colors

291391
selected	textbox
i am dynamically generating some data which includes a selected drop-down with a textbox next to it

291391
selected	textbox
however in changing the code to reference a class since there will be multiple data grouping that include a selected with a textbox next to it and i could not get it to work

291391
selected	textbox
the relevance of the textbox next to the select is the second part of the code...to update the textbox when an option is selected in the select

291391
selected	textbox
.one is so the select is updated only once then the .bind allows any options selected to be placed in the adjacent textbox

291395
value	field
the standards document for the schema defines one of the field as a rational-numbers and its data is represented as two integers typically with the second value being a 1

291403
boolean	int
you could also package these boolean into bitmasked int

291405
webforms	asp.net
when building a multi-lingual website with asp.net webforms i ll use an http module to rewrite the urls to end up with something friendly for humans search engines like

291436
rational-numbers	base
the guy proposing to base all other numbers on a rational-numbers primitive has never heard of transcendental numbers like pi for example which cannot be represented in this manner

291444
where-clause	sql
i m trying to inject a dynamic where-clause in my linq to sql query and i get an overload exception

291445
prolog	lisp
problem 2 this just feels wrong based on my prior experience with prolog lisp

291464
children	nodes
you can access the root of the tree using the xmldocument.documentelement property and access the children of each nodes by using the childnodess property

291468
visio	dia
personally i use dia an open source visio kind of clone it works under windows linux and macosx

291521
configuration	installation
another part of the installation process is running the configuration wizard which is auto-launched at the end of the mysql installation only if there is user-interaction provided

291527
height	frame
i ve been working on this awhile and tried a lot of things changing the height of the rows changing the scroll settings adding a tag changing the height of the contents of the frame as well as checking to make sure widths are set to 100 throughout

291527
height	frame
the frame that are troublesome are the first frame named title with src of pagetitle.html and the last frame named contextpanel with src of submitbar.html both have their widths set to 100 and heights are either 100 not set or a value less than or equal to their row height

291529
boolean	int
calls int boolean

291549
event-listener	listener
if by default the listener is not configured then you will have to set the event-listener

291566
json	xml
have you application generate correct content-type headers application json text xml etc and handle those in your success callback

291621
installation	building
now regarding eclipse itself the releng project is the one in charge of the actual building that link gives you some further indications on how to proceed beginning with the installation of the releng plugins

291622
streamreader	streamwriter
since your question relates to a stream object i think you can use serialport.basestream and cast it into a streamwriter streamreader

291623
lookup	any
i am trying to design a location lookup in which the user can specify a location to any desired level of accuracy

291629
rollback	commit
i can t test this on oracle 8 but on newer versioning you can explicitly start a new transaction by issuing a commit and then altering the rollback segment

291631
profiling	debugging
with delphi 4 i had been using gpprofile by primoz gabrijelcic as a profiling and memory sleuth by turbo power for memory analysis and leak debugging

291637
silverlight	wpf
when you design a wpf silverlight try to design ui and viewmodel totally separate so that at any point of time we can change the layout and ui controls based on theme and styles

291644
any	set
e.g. if your database server is set to cst but the user is on est you ll need to add 1 hour to any timestamps which are the input to a query

291665
iframe	popup
the javascript plugin injects an iframe pointing to a login page of domain second.com into the first.com page and displays it as a popup so that the user can login

291669
scrollbar	widget
what you re seeing is how safari draws scrollbar when there is not enough space to draw the entire scrollbar widget set

291669
any	set
you should set overflow hidden in the css for the body of any frame page you don t want to scroll

291690
javassist	cglib
javassist and cglib are two good bytecode engineering libraries

291696
export-to-pdf	export
when i preview it using the viewer or export-to-pdf it works -- but not when i export to excel

291704
firefox	opera
the check needs to work for ie firefox and opera browsers

291724
32-bit	64bit
an asp.net webpage running on iis on a 64bit machine will be hosted by a 64bit version of the w3wp.exe process and if your webpage uses 32-bit dlls your site will fail

291724
32-bit	64bit
so it s still not able to run 32-bit dll inside 64bit process but rather it is running w3wp.exe as a 32-bit process instead

291747
firefox	opera
i am not sure if opera and firefox use this same key but they likely have similar configuration options but this should at least get you on the right track

291760
google-chrome	firefox
it works with firefox opera and google-chrome but unfortunately not with ie

291760
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox opera and google-chrome you can test it easily like this

291811
change-password	login
user is required to change-password at next login

291829
arrays	loops
i have a file with several thousand rows and several columns separated with tabs what i d like to do is loops through each individually drop the columns into an arrays so that i can place them in another application individually then move onto the next line

291836
double	int
and the type of myarrays is not arrays a b it is arrays int double

291836
parentheses	operators
this has two errors the one the compiler complained about is a precedence problem as the compiler-added parentheses readly show and which can easily be fixed by correct application of either parentheses or the operators

291836
double	int
now both bounds are tuples and its type is arrays int int double

291848
processor	affinity
is it possible to programmatically either via the win32api python or via a command-line option set the processor affinity for a process

291849
directory	folder
what is the simplest way in vb6 to loop through all the files in a specified folder directory and get their names

291858
processor	affinity
given a process handle you can call the setprocessaffinitymask win32 api function to set the processor affinity for another process

291860
javassist	cglib
there are technologies like assembly and cglib but i recomend javassist because it is a very good library for that and you can find examples in tapestry5 framework

291861
global-variables	call
sometimes to get more detailed error information a call to another function such as getlasterror or a global-variables needs to be consulted such as errno

291864
contains	lookup
no i have read-only digest objects which only contains important information for things like lookup and massive collections and convert these to fully hydrated objects on demand

291886
nhibernate	ado.net
data layer raw ado.net returning arrays full cream orm like nhibernate

291891
terminate	timeout
i could use a timeout to terminate the send if it is taking a long time that is the server does not respond quickly but that is not what i want

291897
arrays	loops
one solution is that in each process i could accumulate the text of the queries i wish to invoke in an arrays then loops down it once i m ready to write but i m wondering if it s possible the sqlite transaction can be made to do this for me automatically

291903
postgresql	oracle
while i do not have oracle i did a quick test with postgresql and your first example is_disabled being null and disability_income_type_id being 1

291903
expression	evaluation
... expression evaluation to true or unknown succeed

291903
postgresql	oracle
so if oracle behaves the same as postgresql the check constraint would pass

291908
webforms	asp.net
i ve found a bit of help on this page when doing this with the asp.net mvc framework but still looking for a good solution for webforms

291909
stax	sax
if you can t love sax then lax your no-third-party-libs requirement and use stax with woodstox instead

291913
authentication	logout
formauthentication is used to set the session identity and the authentication cookie that allows users to stay logged in until they logout or the session expires

291913
authentication	login
note since your web site only needs to authentication when editing you ll need to set the permissions that allow everyone to read all pages and implement your own logic to redirect them to the login page when they want to edit

291920
groovy	java
i have to include groovy classes into existing java apps and include groovy into ant s build.xml file

291920
groovy	java
update are there more specifics in combining java and groovy compilations

291922
hide	show
i have a nested function to show hide paragraphs news-ticker-style

291943
ip-address	hostname
i ve even attempted to connect via the servers ip-address on the lan rather than it s windows hostname

291945
selected	button
when creating a form for adding a client i would like to remove the company choices as that has already been selected via an add client button on the company page and limit the rate choices to that company as well

291970
any	set
any time we set a parameter on a query we use a base class or utility methods so we can pass the user s timezone into the custom type parameter

291972
.when	ready
perhaps you can accumulate your data in a separate database and .when you are ready to merge the accumulate rows attach the separate database copy the rows in a single statement and detach

291979
explode	implode
the reverse of explode implode

291981
children	nodes
when a nodes starts as a myc and gets children you have to remove the original myc instance and replace it with a myb version that has a new nodes as a child

291993
value	field
unless there is some reason to have different threads have different value - and i cannot discern one from your example - i would recommend making the user field a a string not a threadlocal and b non-static

292039
oracle	mysql
our application must also be deployable onto several database products including but not limited to oracle ms sql server and mysql

292048
scala	java
however you don t necessarily have to be purely functional -- for example scala is not pure and should work with any java framework you d still be able to use functional programming for the business layer etc

292062
observers	listeners
your order processor and other processors can have listeners observers on the processorder methods

292077
reflection	runtime
being able to examine classes at runtime is a powerful feature and is the basis of the reflection features in .net and java

292097
groovy	java
i was planning to user java regex but thought someone might know a cool way in groovy

292109
malloc	free
with linux gcc c++ i d like to record something to stderr whenever malloc free new delete are called

292117
click	mouse
it takes coordinates as command-line arguments moves the mouse to that positioning then click and releases the mouse button

292118
contains	elements
the top menu is a tag with each child elements contains a nested tag

292122
firefox	opera
additionally tested in firefox 2 3 opera 8 9.5 and safari 4 successfully

292129
malloc	free
as far as overriding malloc and free since you re working on linux and with gcc the easiest methods is to use malloc_hook and free_hook

292135
authentication	login
i am using an authorize filtering inside the controller so if i redirect to the url the rendered html is the login page one i use a custom authentication

292143
malloc	free
you can trace calls to malloc free with ltrace

292158
linux	unix
i m an officer in the boston linux and unix group and we have half a rack with three servers and tape backup unit

292168
void	main
svm static void main methods

292169
convention	standards
i m already familiar with the standards java package naming convention of using a domain name to create a unique package name package com.stackoverflow.widgets

292178
selected	button
create a container view that held your x stars and when one was selected the container could set the selected state on any button to the left of the touched button

292187
authentication	impersonation
if you have impersonation enabled and if you are using the right windows user account and if sql-server authentication using windows auth and if you are still unable to access sql-server you may be running into the classic double hop issue

292189
google-chrome	safari
the microsoft.com menu doesn t work on google-chrome or safari either but i doubt that microsoft cares

292197
machine-code	disassembly
if you re good with assembly it might be possible to disassembly the machine-code for the function and reverse engineer it

292222
http-redirect	request
check the user-agent http header on the inbound request and either use it to triggers a http-redirect or if you re using apache use mod_rewrite and a rewritecond to vary the result based on the user-agent without requiring the extra http roundtrip that a redirect uses

292225
python	ruby
likewise python and ruby

292225
cvs	git
all the other points seem as valid under git or svn or cvs or .

292235
endpoint	uri
the issue is this when i manually created the wcf-nettcp receive location it has its endpoint uri net.tcp biztalkserver postreceivelocation_tcp postreceiveservice.svc

292250
scheme	lisp
beyond personal experience the closest thing you ll get to an objective guess is the tiobe index which currently ranks lisp scheme 21st with 0.470 market share

292251
webforms	asp.net
ironically this wasn t as huge of a problem back before asp.net webforms .

292259
duplicates	elements
did you insert an elements with the same id duplicates id

292262
void	main
i place all applications that is anything that has a void main string arguments in the class in the futura.app

292262
convention	standards
i also try to mimic the standards java library package names for my own code although in a couple of cases i broke convention because of my own tastes futura.inet for internet not merely socket code and futura.collections for non-util stuff. to paraphrase david mamet always be genericizing

292267
ironpython	ironruby
the dynamic keyword looks like it can bridge the gap between dynamic languages like ironruby or ironpython quite nicely which will probably help its adoption in the microsoft monoculture.

292271
void	main
that s very counter-pedagogical of java that the first thing you should learn is the public static void main thing

292302
dynamic-dispatch	implementation
it is an implementation of dynamic-dispatch built on top of the dynamic language runtime dlr

292314
show	next
i just need a indicator for every point which show a smaller or bigger circle and next to it the value of requestcount

292320
modifiers	final
so it seems one of the modifiers is wrong here static or final one of them don t matches the semantics you need here otherwise you wouldn t want to test it with different value

292340
any	set
any compiler options you set design time do not get written to the .cfg file

292343
sql-server	oracle
i must admit that i am not familiar with oracle but i am more or less beaten by sql dialect of sql-server

292348
user-input	output
items for which i seek basic syntax and examples include hello world program loops flow control variables declaration variables type conversions objects if possible file user-input output when with block can be used and so on

292364
vba	vb6
the versions of vba post office 2000 are almost identical to vb6

292385
vba	vb6
also as mitch mentioned if you learn the basics of vb6 you can use the same syntax for vba

292411
double-quotes	single-quotes
you do not want extra double-quotes inside single-quotes or extra repeated double-quotes or escaped quotes or any other obscure stuff like that

292418
contains	elements
syntax-highlighting and all the other full host of features you can get in a standard editor just make your developers suicidal when they find themselves editing web pages by hacking at an undersized textarea with awful white on black not to mention the extra fun you get with having to worry about entity encoding etc for instance try editing html with in a textarea where the html content contains a textarea elements

292418
lookup	any
filesystems lookup is close to database index lookup and you don t have any unknowns other than you need to stream it from a disk no table locking stuff to worry about

292421
comparator	sortedmap
treemap a sortedmap navigablemap will sort the results order of which can be determined by a comparator

292438
linux	bsd
under linux bsd the timeout on i o operations on sockets is directly supported by the operating system

292459
onchange	onfocus
try removing any validation this includes any onfocus onblur onchange event handler

292465
profiling	trace
another option is to use sql-server profiling to capture a trace of all activity on the server then search through the captured queries for the field name you want

292485
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i ll preface this by saying that i do mostly web development where much of the architecture is already decided in advance webforms now asp.net-mvc and most of my projects are reasonably small one-person efforts that take less than a year

292491
itemtemplate	databound
i have a databound listbox that uses a custom itemtemplate to display my stuff

292491
contains	elements
the itemtemplate has a 4x2 grid that contains different elements

292492
json	xml
i think that the bit that you re missing is that a method marked with a webmethod tag is going to serialize the data as xml not json

292498
contains	any
python is statically scoped so if you pass â spamâ to another function spam will still have access to globals in the module it came from defined in code1 and any other contains scopes see below

292510
versioning	upgrade
seconding klathzazts manually changing the versioning numbers. this is often the best solution for dealing with vsc++ when something goes wrong in the upgrade process

292561
worksheet	excel
the excel will show it as worksheet as you formated it

292561
worksheet	excel
i think this is most universal way how to create rich excel worksheet in internet enviroment without having excel instaled on server

292567
methods	extend
the classes and or methods are partial so you can extend change the behaviour in the separate file

292573
directory	folder
it may be easier just to see if you can get permission to write to a single directory perhaps inside your web app folder on the server

292580
revision	rcs
a good example might be a wiki where the underlying model data consists of file revision data for instance from rcs

292590
asp.net-mvc	webforms
microsoft have made it clear they will continue supporting and improving both webforms and asp.net-mvc in the future

292590
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i personally would never go back to webforms development after using asp.net-mvc on several big projects

292590
asp.net-mvc	webforms
but you can mix webforms and asp.net-mvc so its easy enough to get the best of both worlds

292607
python	c++
i m a c++ developer with basic python skills

292629
installation	environment
last i checked though it s been several months the installation of the air runtime environment was fast and easy

292653
joomla	drupal
as mentioned above there are things like joomla and if you want to stick to php frameworks you could also use drupal which has a ton of documentation and support and is relatively easy to understand

292653
joomla	drupal
it too is much like drupal and joomla so it s a nice cms framework which you might feel more comfortable with since asp.net is based off of a programming language as opposed to a a scripting language unlike classic asp or php

292657
e-commerce	product
when i m trying to model the stuff i m trying to manipulate i come up with a series of discrete item definitions- an e-commerce site will have a sku a product a customer and so forth

292657
diagram	erd
these domain models can be represented as uml domain models class diagram and sql erd s

292659
python	java
they have support for c++ java and python

292659
python	java
i was usually going between c++ java and python

292674
python	java
it will be a long time probably never honestly before a functional language has as rich a web programming environment as java python or ruby

292675
contains	elements
you can avoid adding event handler to each list item by adding a single event handler to the contains elements the unordered list and leveraging the concept of event-bubbling

292675
arrays	map
it appears that you are wanting to map data in an arrays to list items

292709
octal	hex
customnumbereditor treats number with leading zeros as decimal removed unwanted octal support while preserving hex

292732
contains	any
does this have any implications on the cert and how the browser treats it if it just contains a domain name

292739
innodb	myisam
are you using innodb tables or myisam tables

292766
user-interface	look-and-feel
one great example of this is the napkin look-and-feel a pluggable java look-and-feel that makes it look like your user-interface was scrawled on a napkin

292777
python	java
it s also good to have them at all as it means that java c++ python c# et al projects can communicate with each other efficiently

292779
selected	cells
i also tried selection.clear but that just cleared the last cells that were selected and still added an extra series to the plot

292789
checkbox	textbox
this is an issue that requires attention if you are creating multiple textbox checkbox or radiobuttions with labels dynamically

292793
appdata	temp
go to users appdata local microsoft and look for visual-studio temp files

292803
sql-server	ms-access
should i change this database to sql-server express or something else to make it easier or should this work from with ms-access

292806
selected	button
not just the ones that are selected i will be making these radio button but that s another question

292810
constructor	object
you simply need to create a binding object and address object and pass them either to the constructor of the client proxy or to a generic channelfactory instance

292820
required	checked
additional question from the fact that fire is null when there are no events registered i conclude that everywhere an event is fired a checked against null is required

292829
swing	awt
for awt swing you would use eventqueue.invokelater swingutilities.invokelater is only necessary due to java 1.1 not having the eventqueue method - 1.2 is about to celebrate its tenth birthday

292836
selection	cell
this procedure will remove the active cell from the selection

292836
selection	cell
this procedure will remove the area contains the active cell from the selection

292844
having	select
string teststring select apples n from dblp r where we ate n grouping by all of them r having no shame n

292851
value	field
i am trying to insert a new row into my table which holds the same data as the one i am trying to selected from the same table but with a different user_id and without a fixed value for auto_id since that is an auto_increment field and setting ti to now

292861
value	field
i have a form that has default value describing what should go into the field replacing a label

292872
debugging	trace
assign it the full path including the file name of the file in which you want to record the debugging trace for example c temp iedebugging.log

292906
instance-variables	local-variables
if the collection is used as temporary storage and isn t accessible outside of the methods it should be declared as a local-variables not an instance-variables and most likely should be initialized where it s declared in the methods

292906
contains	elements
if we initialize it inside the thread at least we can say that eventually state will contains one elements but we can t say whether it s 0 or 1

292920
google-chrome	firefox
for heavy-weight applications those can be easily understood or at least profiled such as firefox or google-chrome

292948
contains	set
first project contains form1 that displays one label with text set to a string from properties.resources like this

292951
firefox	safari
download a debugger for your browser firefox firebug ie visual-studio express web developer safari drosera and following the execution path until the exception is thrown or you get to the portion of your code where the dom manipulation should happen

292956
constructor	object
if it s something that really is an instance variables and represents state of the object it is then completely initialized by the time the constructor exits

292970
16-bit	8bit
from the se j2me developer doc all images are stored in phone memory in a 16-bit per pixel rgb format possibly with a 1-bit or 8bit per pixel alpha channel

292975
domdocument	domxpath
for this kind of task reading the document into a domdocument and using domxpath is probably more suitable

292975
domdocument	domxpath
to answer your question both libraries as well as domdocument + domxpath are standard outfit with php5 so they would be equally fine choices

292991
vb.net	vb6
i would think there is an api to allow this but my favorite vb6 site mvps vb.net does not have a way

292992
groovy	java
i ve never used it but open office has a java api which of course you could use from groovy as well

292999
sniffing	traffic
if this is a private site you may not care so long as you are getting link-level encryption and are you that fearful of someone sniffing your traffic

293006
jar	war
the process has already started on moving each jar war into it s own project but it s obvious that this will only scratch the surface a few classes in each app jar and a mammoth legacy project with everything else

293012
boost-asio	boost
it doesn t appear to be built into boost-asio as of current boost svn but if you re willing to write your own classes to simulate the boost asio detail socket_option ones you can always follow the examples in boost asio socket_base.hpp and do the following

293013
any	set
most traditional dals that i have seen will have a larger set of methodss where the methods will take any number of parameters

293030
temporary	copy
there is an other solution is to copy the delegate into a temporary variables

293035
duplicates	contains
then i create separate files contains a duplicates nested-class structure also marked partial

293036
facade	dao
while repository allows you to abstract the whole data-access perhaps being a facade for multiple dao maybe different data sources

293043
widget	button
all i need is to be able to put together something that would look roughly like what the user would see on his screen menus button text fields and all the standard widget

293047
base-class	inherited
solution a virtual base-class is a base which occurs only once even if it is inherited more than once by different classes indirectly in an inheritance tree

293081
data-access	nhibernate
so standard agile philosophy would recommend making your domain classes simple pocos which are persisted using a separate proxy layer via data-access objects like nhibernate does it

293091
selection	cell
it will take you to cell a1 thereby canceling your existing selection

293093
getter	setter
the only intents expressed by your code are getter and setter

293097
contains	any
generally this shouldn t be modified by any user code so expect it to contains the standard functions and nothing else

293115
constructor	object
for example if i know that the constructor is internally scoped and object are only created by a factory class

293136
iteration	elements
it treats dom elements in an object-oriented way and the new iteration has a lot of coverage for non-compliant code

293141
entity-framework	ado.net
linq to sql and the ado.net entity-framework seem to be the most popular data providers for asp.net dynamic data

293151
xhtml	tidy
you could try using something like html tidy to cleanup any broken html and convert the html to xhtml which you can then parsing with a xml parsingr

293159
put	get
requests to do any operation get put in a queue

293170
click	mouse
the label will intercept any mouse click although this won t affect keystrokes

293177
.when	ready
i know it s 1-2 years until this new systemd propagates but you can start your project and have fun .when it s ready maybe

293178
click	mouse
click on the button to restrict the mouse to area 0 0 100 100

293182
python	php
if you re happy with sql you could probably do this with postgresql and one of the snap-in languages such as python or php

293185
asp.net-mvc	webforms
ps i m using asp.net-mvc not webforms

293209
attributes	properties
you can do this by deriving from system.configuration.configurationsection and writing properties which represent attributes and sub-elements

293215
attributes	properties
in the early days of .net i believe there was an attributes you could decorate a class with to specify a default properties

293236
python	ruby
before choosing to go down the python route i looked at ruby

293236
python	ruby
i chose python for among other reasons its cleaner syntax and the fact that it could do everything ruby can

293236
python	php
python is making oo click much better than php ever has and i m reading more and more on oo principles to enhance this better understanding

293256
ironpython	ironruby
but there are a number of other .net languages out there - a# boo oxygene f# ironlisp ironscheme ironpython ironruby nemerle phalanger p# powershell and more

293264
project-management	scrum
i gives a nice briefing about what scrum is all about and how it can be used from project-management

293289
tablerow	layout
eventually when browsers catch up notably with ie8 the css way to get table-like layout without the html semantics will be to use display tablerow

293292
bug-tracking	greenhopper
we user jira for bug-tracking and release management and we have started using greenhopper for project-management inside of jira but one thing that it lacks is the idea of user stories versus tasks in those users stories

293293
quirks-mode	doctype
also your example doesn t have a doctype - a valid doctype is essential for getting browsers to correctly interpret your code without one you ll be stuck in quirks-mode

293304
keyboard	mouse
a hook dll allows you to intercept all mouse and keyboard events

293304
keyboard	mouse
you can also inject mouse and keyboard events

293306
space	input
just going through my lisp solutions for project euler i find a cross total function a digit matching function several functions for searching a space a minimal text parsing a function splitting a number into the list of its decimal digits a function constructing a graph and a function traversing an input file

293318
contains	elements
the stuff does break down when you assign to a certain elements and then a different to a contains elements

293325
locale	french
i go to canada and set my system locale as french

293327
aggregate	grouping
one solution would be to limit the rows in the grouping to the top two before computing the aggregate

293338
contains	elements
there is not anything about sizes being relative to their parent s size that is particularly hard to understand and this property can be useful should you want to change the basic font size on your page or a part of it you can just change it once rather than having to go through fixing up every font-size declaration on contains elements

293342
children	nodes
second the selected nodes has 4 children - two for the option tags and two more for the inner text of the option tags

293343
put	get
the issue is that rest uses get post put and delete

293343
put	get
i ve monkeypatched methods for put like post and delete like get

293349
versionone	rally
but if you must have software there s also rally and versionone

293364
32-bit	64bit
might it make more sense to put 64bit applications into program files x64 and leave 32-bit applications to run in program files

293371
initializer	setter
you might be able to use the object initialization to simulate fluent but this only works at initializer time and would only work for single arguments methods where the property is only a setter

293374
32-bit	x86
x86 is commonly assumed to be 32-bit unless you specify x86-64

293378
json	xml
in which case do what cade recommends and pass the data as xml for example or whatever format you choose json binary etc.. then build your sql right before you actually run the command

293382
32-bit	x86
80386 had the first 32-bit instruction set see x86 wikipedia

293385
pointers	stack
if you want the pointers to x to remain valid after foo returns you must not allocate x on foo s stack period -- even if you know that in principle nothing has any reason to clobber it -- because that just isn t allowed in c no matter how often it happens to do what you expect

293392
benchmarking	profiling
finally if you make any of those changes which could affect your website s performance run some benchmarking and profiling the gain or loss in performance

293394
margins	scale
using relative units for font-size line-height and top bottom margins and padding will also keep the typographic scale intact as users increase decrease text size

293409
value	field
is there a way i can have id in the url be the value of a field in the display record

293421
contains	elements
because operators will contains the same boilerplate code looping over every elements and applying appropriate operation i thought i could generalize it

293450
32-bit	x86
in x64 that program is in program files x86 on vista 32-bit it s in program files

293462
any	set
i don t believe there s any way for variables a to implicitly set itself to none

293482
python	php
i have been looking for an algorithm or python code to do this but haven t found anything except some half-baked implementations in php etc

293514
ruby	php
it would be nice if there were support even if only added via a downloadable addon for interpreted languages like ruby php and classic asp

293517
header-only	boost
you should really have a look at boost operators a header-only library that really simplifies creating orthogonal and consistent arithmetic operator overloads

293563
32-bit	64bit
if both x and y are 32-bit it is too big to fit in a register on a 32-bit architecture and the same applies to 64bit values on a 64bit architecture denton gentry s answer mentions how simpler values are returned so it has to be allocated somewhere

293563
pointers	stack
the compiler instead has the caller tells the called function where to put the result which is probably somewhere on stack of the caller by passing the called function a hidden pointers to the space allocated to it

293576
rhino-mocks	nunit
sometimes you want to build up a series of related objects - examples include the nhibernate criteria api rhino-mocks expectation constraints and nunit 2.4 s new syntax

293579
connection-pooling	pool
.net uses connection-pooling which means that when you close dispose of the connection it doesn t actually close the connection rather resets it and add it back to the pool

293622
any	set
to do so you can set the specific states before any drawing operation

293634
driver	kernel
you can find out when processes start via using a real-time etw consumer - however to be able to take some action that could possibly cancel the process from starting you ll have to do something shady undocumented like hooking createprocess or using a kernel filtering driver to block reads to the exe

293647
postback	ajax
i would recommend using ajax to postback silently every 10 mins or so to keep it alive or increase the timeout of the session as you suggest

293659
delphi	c++
it works in stand-alone mode integrates with visual-studio and also works with borland s ide for those c++ builder and delphi fans out there

293672
ostream	std
so my question then is there a way to handle files greater than 4gb in size using std ifstream std ostream ie standard c++

293674
revision	svn
you could put a revision control git mercurial svn on the file system and then automate commits during the save phase

293699
gridview	formview
i am using a custom datalist control but this problem also occurs with gridview detailsview formview and repeater control and maybe with other databound controls

293720
submitchanges	datacontext
all of the sql is then handled for you and means you don t have to write anything simply call submitchanges on the datacontext

293732
communication	messages
you don t need to actually do anything to create a custom messages for communication within your application just make sure that the code that sends the messages and the code that receives the messages agree on what the messages number actually is and use a messages number that doesn t overlap with any of the numbers windows uses

293732
communication	messages
there is a registerwindowmessages function but that s only needed to get a messages number that s unique across the entire operating system so used for inter-process communication

293732
32-bit	64bit
in win64 for example lparam is long enough to hold a 64bit pointer but wparam only holds a 32-bit integer

293737
arguments	default
however i think you probably got a zero-filled struct as the result because the stack object was default constructed in the caller function possibly with explicit zero arguments or else due to zeros on the stack

293740
hosts-file	hosts
what one has to do is simply add test hosts to the hosts windows system32 drivers etc hosts iirc in addition to adding a site to the local iis

293740
hosts-file	hosts
this plays well with version-control checkout add site to iis and hosts edit edit edit commit

293753
contains	any
if you want to return results that contains any of the keywords then replace all the and with or

293757
linux	unix
the utf-8 and unicode faq for unix linux has a lot of useful information on the subject

293757
linux	unix
although it s meant for unix linux users most of it is not platform-specific

293768
bazaar	git
if you know how please explain how to do this in your vcs of choice such as subversion git mercurial bazaar or etc

293777
hosts-file	hosts
i really appreciate that...but i was probably too drunk to notice the entries in my etc hosts were binding my hostname to the old ip address...so as soon as i removed that...things worked like a charm

293785
windows-xp	windows
can gather vast amounts of information about about a windows server 2003 as well as windows-xp or vista

293790
webforms	asp.net
i am trying to wire up dependency injection with windsor to standard asp.net webforms

293814
value	field
is this possible to use string value of one node which tells what type of field is presented in another node using linq to xml

293819
parentheses	operators
the and operators has a higher precedence than or so if you want to return results that contain all of the keywords you need to add parentheses as follows

293841
value	field
this won t help you solve this very problem but a word of good advice never ever write comma seperated value into a database field

293863
updating	updates
very good in my case because i want them to continue working while i m updating the application was very bad that every time i updates the app-code folder all the user would loose what they were working and had to login again and i want to extend the shared-hosting 20 minutes to 45

293872
arguments	default
also mem_fun only has a default constructor that takes 0 arguments

293878
webforms	asp.net
our shop is in the process of converting our internal project management application from asp.net webforms to asp.net mvc

293878
authentication	login
but i would like to do so with some type of authentication login and a password

293878
asp.net-mvc	wcf
is this possible using asp.net-mvc or should this be done through some other service like wcf

293902
web-testing	selenium
if you need to test your view then you re probably already using selenium or some other web-testing framework

293904
queue	fifo
asides from that you really need to get to know queue especially fifo and event queue will help you avoid going into the realm of multithreading world

293919
children	nodes
compare this to the situation where you have each nodes know about its children - then you only need the root nodes

293920
set	bag
your bag attributes for example could be such a set

293933
put	get
every link request ex mypage.aspx put a get called synctoken with another token diferent from the one you have stored in the session it goes like mypage.aspx

293945
required	checked
then after login you can checked to see if the current user s ip-address has a row in the database and perform the required action

293956
document	element
i ve been working with jquery for a pair of weeks and i ve noticed it works fine with objects that are in the original html document but when i generate a new element using jquery the library doesn t get any of its events

293967
constructor	object
should operations that could take some time be performed in a constructor or should the object be constructed and then initialised later

293967
constructor	object
for example when constructing an object that represents a directory structure should the population of the object and its children be done in the constructor

293974
constructor	object
someone using your object may not really care what is in sub-directories so start out by just having your constructor list the first level and then if someone wants to descend into a specific directory then build that portion of the tree when they request it

293978
constructor	private
you could put the code itself into a private function and call that out of your constructor just to keep the code in the constructor clear

293986
constructor	object
if you are constructing object at startup for a long-running program then there is no problem with doing a lot of work in constructor

293993
order	join
i used left join instead of inner join in order not to exclude companies without users

294002
constructor	object
at a minimum your constructor needs to get the object configured to the point that its invariants are true

294022
background-color	border-color
you should extend the above style a little for instance change background-color or border-color to give an alternative change indicating focus

294031
constructor	object
the most important jobs of a constructor is to give the object an initial valid state

294046
constructor	object
the constructor must put the object into a usable state hence at a minimum your class variables ought to be initted

294076
directory	folder
it s a rather specific instance where one would have to use this but if you are in the same predicament i was in simply put in your ftp server address username password the name of the folders you want deleted and the path of the folder to start in and this will iterate through the directory deleting all folders that match the name

294092
updating	updates
in that case i end up having events generated called from a thread that is incapable of directly updating the user-interface in wpf i would have to issue every updates originated form the 360 controllers class through the ugly use of dispatcher.invoke

294097
redmine	trac
i m also using trac for several projects but i m in the process of switching to redmine

294097
redmine	trac
redmine handles multiple projects and sub-projects right out of the box and overall seems nicer than trac

294097
python	ruby
both have integration with subversion so it s a matter of determine the features you really need and the backend language you might already have available trac runs on python redmine on ruby on rails

294100
subclassing	superclass
in order to see that the setlabel function can be applied to a wx.statictext instances you have to travel up the namespace hierarchy in the wxpython docs to the wxwindow superclass from which wx.statictext is subclassing

294101
binary	hex
typically you d base64 or hex encode binary content so that it can be transported as text

294103
bazaar	git
i worked on a project for one place that were forced to use a locking system and opted to use no control at all so i set up a secret svn branch even though i much prefer bazaar or git

294113
application-pool	was
i know application_end will be triggered but is there a way to know that it was triggered by a recycle of the application-pool

294119
constructor	object
the how often in a given period object with the long constructor are constructed

294144
webforms	asp.net
make sure you read the basics of the two types of asp.net webforms and mvc and pick which makes more sense to you

294147
logout	login
how can i override this for login logout

294154
denied	root
now i am trying to import the data i get this error #1044 - access denied for user root localhost to database information_schema

294166
ubuntu	linux
i ve used it on both a macbook running os x as well as ubuntu linux on a desktop both with success

294177
click	mouse
i m wondering is it possible to somehow map a key-press event to act like a middle-key click of a mouse in xwindows

294178
createprocess	detours
if you only need to tracking process creation coming from a specific program or a few programs the easyhook detours methods mentioned here will work pretty well but you effectively need to install a hook on createprocess into each program so it s not a great solution if you want to tracking all process creation in the system

294220
mousemove	mouseup
currently i have an image placed in the center of the windows and i m thinking of using the three mouseevents mousedown mousemove and mouseup to calculate the new positioning when dragging the image

294234
linked-list	nodes
i m working on an assignment that is telling me to assume that i have a singly linked-list with a header and tail nodes

294236
controllers	routes
you should make routes to controllers and their actions

294240
double-quotes	single-quotes
also variables aren t substituted in single-quotes so you need to use double-quotes

294261
arguments	default
i have class with a member function that takes a default arguments

294261
arguments	default
that said if i want to invoke the callable member on the object with the default arguments what s the correct syntax

294270
constructor	object
how would you call the constructor of the following class in these three situations global object arrays of object and object contained in another class struct

294279
groovy	java
i added the smack library jar to the lib folder of my grails project but i still cannot import any of its packages into my java or groovy classes

294283
arguments	default
when you pass mem_fn only sees a and can t see the default arguments

294283
arguments	default
using tr1 bind you can bind the default arguments explictly or you can use it as you would mem_fn but you can t do both in one object

294285
dialog	pop-up
the general pattern is the user will press some key combination my program will detect it and potentially pop-up a dialog to get user input and then run a corresponding command typically by running an executable

294292
any	set
i can set the wave volume but if the master volume is too low this won t have any effect

294299
textbox	button
i created an ajax website in visual-studio added a simple page with a textbox and button when i click the button once everything works when i click it twice i get the error

294339
void	main
i d also double-check that the class is public and the methods is public static void main string arg

294340
click	mouse
my question is how do i detect what mouse button that was pressed without using the click event

294349
hide	show
i am not sure how to acomplish this but my first thought was to use z-index and show hide layers

294373
associations	model
and any model that assumes global static associations inherent coupling between classes is problematic

294388
any	set
i can t really see any reason why that would not be viable as long as most of your developers are english and even if they re not the world is used to the ansi character set

294392
webserver	host
that s not so much because i don t like jet for websites but because i don t like windows for a webserver -- i m an apache supporter and php developer and host all my websites and my clients as well on non-windows hosting services presently all of them are linux but that wasn t always the case

294397
children	nodes
then you will need to retrieve the nodes s children and draw each of them

294405
attributes	properties
the named properties in that attributes is item

294410
subclassing	base-class
this means having unimplementsed methods in the base-class and only implements these methods in classes which themselves have no subclassing

294417
entity-framework	ado.net
primary reason is because i want to use asp.net-mvc and possibly ado.net entity-framework but i do not want to make a contract with yet another hosting provider

294439
spring	grails
g2one s acquisition by spring source makes the roadmap for eclipse integration for grails look much rosier too

294444
value	field
i would like to convert that into separate table for each row or definition list where each field name is followed by field value

294445
linked-list	nodes
if so the link property of each nodes has a reference to the next nodes in the linked-list

294462
debugging	trace
the trace will appear only in debugging version not in release

294477
silverlight	wpf
depending on the type of development you do i would avoid wpf at first and stick to winforms or webforms vs silverlight as you will be more at home there coming from java

294477
silverlight	wpf
move to wpf or silverlight once you start feeling comfortable as there is a lot to learn with these frameworks

294504
upnp	ssdp
updates an interesting kind of related discussion of ssdp and upnp is available on stackoverflow

294517
openssl	zlib
curl libcurl 7.16.1 openssl 0.9.7e zlib 1.2.3

294517
openssl	zlib
curl libcurl 7.16.0 openssl 0.9.8i zlib 1.2.3

294522
keyboard	mouse
the main thing to keep in mind is that oncommand is fired for any action that results in an activation of the button which can include pressing the space bar when the button has the focus using a keyboard shortcut attached to the button or clicking the button with the mouse

294522
onmousedown	onmouseup
the only actions that result in the button property being added to the event object are onclick ondblclick onmousedown and onmouseup

294522
onkeydown	onclick
to get the same functionality as oncommand you d need to handle both onclick and onkeydown events yourself while making sure the button is still enabled

294528
python	c++
it lets you use python code embedded in c++ source files to generate c++ source

294547
turkish	locale
additionally some case insensitive languages change the identifiers to lowercase before using and that causes problems if active system locale is turkish or azerbaijani

294547
turkish	locale
see here for more info about turkish locale problem

294547
turkish	locale
this problem is also present in any software that compares strings using turkish locale not only the language implementations themselves just to point out

294550
subclassing	superclass
separate subclassing of a common superclass can implements the various exception-handling and special cases

294573
constructor	private
probably safer then being held captive by framework changes through using private protected constructor

294579
contains	any
the url cannot end in a trailing slash and can t contains any slashes at all

294582
codeigniter	symfony
besides i d be curious to know if any one of the popular php frameworks codeigniter cake symfony etc. actually use reflection

294602
variables	boolean
you could a boolean variables if you think it will make your intention clearer or if the test is a complex expression

294603
value	field
you can use field column string1 string2 ... to find rows with any particular subset of possible enum value

294608
selected	listbox
if you only want to add this functionality to a selected number of listbox s you can call addcustomscrollingsupport instead passing in a specific listbox control

294608
scrollbar	z-order
in an older version of this code i wasn t calling the z-order methods on the second listbox the one that provides the scrollbar to make sure it would appear on top of the first listbox

294608
keyboard	mouse
apparently when the first listbox is disabled any mouse and keyboard events that would have gone to that listbox bleed through to the second listbox so scrolling support still does work

294616
unsigned	short
long long unsigned countnums short start_x short start_y short arrays 15 short size bool goright bool goright2

294624
textchanged	textbox
you could use the textchanged event for the textbox

294628
authentication	login
when the login prompt starts up u have two options for authentication - windows authentication or sql-server authentication

294630
exception-handling	error-handling
obviously that is pretty crappy error-handling but it shows that the exception-handling object contains the error string

294635
python	ruby
i m sure you d be able to do this with most dynamic languages javascript python ruby by carefully monkey-patching some of the base-classes

294679
moss	wss
wss v3 or moss

294688
contact	submit
when my phone nokia n82 calls i want to submit the callers phonenumber to a search applet application that will query microsoft-dynamics crm and see if a contact person or a company has that phonenumber and if so show the corresponding person or companys info on my screens

294735
linked-list	nodes
i don t know anything about the roguewave collections but if their linked-list allocates an external nodes then you should be able to halve the number of allocations by using an intrusive list - write your own container if necessary

294748
click	mouse
the user click the mouse button

294748
keyboard	mouse
i m trying to simulate a data-aware version of a tlistbox here and i need something to replace the list box s onclick handler which despite the name actually goes off anytime the selection is changed whether through the mouse or the keyboard

294752
m2eclipse	maven
unfortunately i m currently using rad rational application developer - ibm s commercial version of eclipse and it is not fully compatible with m2eclipse and i can t use q4e as i m using maven 2.0.7 with no way to upgrade to 2.1

294758
triggers	insert
how can we create a triggers to send an email on any insert or delete action on a table.it should send an email and also it should have the location of the server and the database

294760
compact-framework	.net
how can i get the .net compact-framework to animate it

294766
gentoo	ubuntu
i can do this easily on my own machine gentoo but a binary distribution like ubuntu probably doesn t have a compiler available by default

294768
compact-framework	.net
this would be very easy to do in .net compact-framework on a windows mobile device

294771
zen-cart	cart
i am using zen-cart to host my shopping cart

294773
barcode	code128
i m working on a new app that is using itextsharp for pdf-generation and i figured that instead of using two libraries i would use itextsharp s barcode generation library since it supports code128 barcode

294773
itextsharp	itext
is anyone out there familiar enough with itextsharp s or itext itself barcode components or with code 128a barcodes to tell me how to make the itextsharp one look exactly like the barcode.4net one

294774
endpoint	uri
for me i use below code to extract binding information from mex endpoint uri

294795
button	popup
wwhen i click the button on the popup to insert data to database it does nothing whyyyyy

294796
triggers	insert
basic triggers info is easy to find in bol we pull the insert with

294814
json	xml
i want to see and the web server replies with some html json xml binary data for images etc.

294814
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the difference with asp.net-mvc and webforms is how the webserver handles the request and how it generates the response

294814
asp.net-mvc	webforms
for example asp.net-mvc uses controllers to determine what to show the user while webforms have a pages which determine what data for that page to show

294815
ip-address	proxy
your original plan is the best one as long as you remember to proxy to the ip-address since you cannot know what the domain name is pointing to until the ttl has elapsed

294827
.when	ready
the ef msdn forum is full of examples as to why ef is not ready for prime-time but i there is one particular example that is a clear winner - what would normally be a simple five table query 10-15 lines of sql becomes 1500 lines of sql .when using ef and the entitydatasource control

294845
perl	ruby
perl python ruby bash powershell...take your pick

294852
bison	yacc
parsing will probably be handled with a yacc bison grammar it is now

294852
language-implementation	interpreter
language-implementation patterns create your own domain-specific and general programming languages recommended in the comment thread for books on creating interpreter languages

294852
environment	execution
the current prototype is an interpreter and it makes sense to me as we re accepting a path to an arbitrary code file and execution it in our application environment

294872
ruby	php
back-end tends to be more java or .net most common for web at least by the job ads i ve seen with a bit of python ruby php and other

294885
margins	padding
i d like to put some spacing between each tbody element but padding and margins have no effect

294890
user-input	output
at the action level i have an object that holds all view data -- user-input and generated output -- that i ll call view object is there a general term for this

294890
required	checked
finally there are some validation methods that would required a database connection checked if a user input-field has a corresponding database record for example and the view object has no concept of a database only the service

hotmail	gmail
in my website under development the members can send messages to each other which are sent directly to their email now i m worried that some members can send spam to other members i have a spam filtering but it doesn t give 100 protection as you know i m worried that my domain might get blacklisted on yahoo gmail hotmail or aol which will cause any messages sent from my domain to end up in the spam folder this is why i want to add the domain of my website to their whitelists if they exist

windows-vista	windows
on windowss-vista the windows does not show up on the taskbar though and the windows is in the background

294914
methods	extend
you can extend the zend_db_table_abstract class and add some useful methods to it

294914
constructor	object
in your constructor you could populate your data into properties of your object

294921
document	element
hook into an appropriate event such as when the active document is changed within the document model and in that event invalidate the appropriate ribbon button you ll need the id of the element from the original ribbon xml you load

294926
attributes	properties
to find out which it is try making the properties read write even if the write doesn t do anything useful and ensure the value has a data-members attributes etc

294932
derived-class	base-class
if the base-class destructor is virtual then when you call operator delete on the base-class pointers it uses dynamic dispatch to figure out how to delete the object by looking up the derived-class destructor in the virtual function table

294942
32-bit	64bit
a bool is actually only 1 byte but alignment may cause 4 bytes to be used on a 32-bit platform or even 8 bytes on a 64bit platform

294960
default	reset
i wrote a quick func called reboot which closes libcurl opens it again and calls reset to put it in the default state

294961
versioning	upgrade
which needs to be able to read what versioning of each component is install on their client machine in order to perform an upgrade only on that one component

294961
prerequisites	uninstaller
i have researched - and apparently prerequisites are not meant to be uninstaller

294961
prerequisites	uninstaller
perermtate i don t think there is a way to uninstaller a prerequisites that was prior install which makes sense as the prerequisites may be required as a platform for other applications after all prerequisitess were meant to be 3rd party components to the application

294965
mediawiki	bugzilla
i ve considered bugzilla but they don t seem to have .sql files in the trunk as in mediawiki

294965
mediawiki	bugzilla
perl scripts have to be executed which builds the database schema tables - so instead of getting only one file as in mediawiki tables.sql i now essentially have to download entire bugzilla folder for different revisions to understand schema changes

294965
postgresql	mysql
for both the questions mysql or postgresql is preferred as the database

294975
barcode	code39
the itextsharp library while ostensibly for creating creating pdfs also has a barcode generation library that include code39

294978
constructor	object
they essentially construct the parameter object using whatever constructor has the same signature as the convenience method you called and then call sqlparametercollection.add sqlparameter like this

294978
constructor	private
they shorten the code with marginal impact on performance the constructor may bypass setter methods and operate directly on private members

294978
any	set
however if you allow the size to be inferred like this and you recycle the parameter object in a loop you did say you were concerned with performance then the size will be set by the first value and any subsequent values that are longer will be clipped

294978
double	int
if you assign an int to a double there s no loss of precision because double is wider

294978
double	int
this is why you can assign an int to a double but going the other way you have to do an explicit cast - double to int is a narrowing conversion with potential loss of precision

294983
account	api
tfs uses the domain information of the current logged in windows account it s part of the tfs api

294990
perl	ruby
message senders are in perl ruby and c

294994
base-class	inherited
you can easily use a relational inherited model with a table content representing an abstract base-class and various tables animalcontent carcontent etc

294999
primitive	boolean
because you need to use boolean instead of the primitive type

295021
compact-framework	.net
by default the .net compact-framework does not support displaying gif based animations on a windows form

295023
ostringstream	std
use c++ std string and ostringstream - but you ll lose the printf format you ll have to use the operator

295047
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i think you re basically on the right track - if you have not already i would suggest taking a look at rhino igloo an webforms asp.net-mvc framework here s a good blog post on this and the source is here - ayende the author of rhino igloo tackles the issue of using windsor with webforms quite well in this project library

295061
strict	let
that being said not all shops allow strict tdd and you have a design at hand so let s use it and do tdd - albeit it would be better to say test-first-programming but that s not the point as that s also how i started tdd

295063
hide	show
or should i have one control and multiple panels which i show hide

295094
filtering	sorting
is there any known pattern algorithm on how to perform sorting or filtering a list of records from database in the correct way

295094
filtering	sorting
my current attempt involves usage of a form that provides some filtering and sorting options and then append these criteria and sorting algorithm to my existing sql

295123
python	php
also it should be php or python server javascript client can t use flex or silverlight for very specific non-programming related issues

295125
enumerator	any
apart from writing my own enumerator or single selected extension methods any ideas

295127
arrays	loops
i m not sure wich is fastest using arrays indexes or xpath i would guess that arrays indexes were faster but you should try both in a loops a few thousand times getting the time before and after the loops to check

295127
data-structures	tree
if you will need more complicated queries and speed isn t an issue then use whatever is easiest to implement and gives the power you need xpath is good for complex tree navigation arrays indexing is good for quick random access in list-type data-structures

295135
strict	let
i d rather be strict than otherwise so let s say i want to retain only letters digits and a small set of other characters like _-.

295170
sql-server	oracle
as far as we can tell tde-enabled dbs say sql-server 2008 or oracle 10.2 make the problem go away but not all our customers are willing to splash out on upgrades

295174
required	checked
it uses structural type checked as opposed to nominal at compile time to check for the required methods in the type

295182
base-class	inherited
should each event type be enqueued on an own queue or should the events inherited a base-class that can be enqueued

295187
priority-queue	queue
if one of the requests has higher probability then either you need some fancy priority-queue or you can use different queue

295209
command-line	cmd
when i execute the caspol cmd from the cmd-line it succeeds

295209
command-line	cmd
copy paste of the generated cmd works fine on the cmd-line

295210
selected	button
when uploading some image audio video files in the same batch i want the file selected in the one field should not get accepted in the other button

295216
google-chrome	firefox
my facebook application contains javascript that works in firefox and ie but aborts in google-chrome

295220
value	field
properties encapsulate field thus enabling you to perform additional processing on the value to be set or retrieved

295220
value	field
it is typically overkill to use properties if you will not be doing any pre- or postprocessing on the field value

295229
return-type	arguments
however you will encounter problems if a function return-type has a commas in its name as this will be interpreted by the preprocesor as passing 2 arguments to the deprecated macros

295233
filesystems	symlink
i don t know if what you want is directly possible but a workaround if you are using a linux filesystems would be to create a symlink to your coloned directory and add this symlink to your pythonpath like this

295248
reference-type	generics
in c# and .net generics are maintained at execution time too and work for value types as well as reference-type keeping the appropriate efficiency a as a backing it rather than an arrays of boxed bytes.

295248
ref	out
java has no equivalent of c# s ref and out for passing parameters by reference

295252
managementeventwatcher	wmi
try looking into monitoring wmi events you should be able to create a wql event query that monitors the day of week change managementeventwatcher etc and then setup an event handler that fires when the event arrives

295252
void	main
public static void main

295254
contains	set
in system.componentmodel there s a class called canceleventargs which contains a cancel member that can be set in event listeners

295259
windows-xp	windows
i would like to create a delphi application for windows-xp which allows dropping of files dragged from windows explorer the desktop or folder windows or other applications which support this operation such as total commander

295279
decimal	hex
if we have the letter a which is 77 in decimal and 4d in hex

295291
any	set
i believe this will get the entire table from the database and to the filtering in dotnet ie not optimal is there any way i can get the tableadapter to filer the result set on the database instead ie what i want to is send selected from tbl_cpc where cpcid 1 to the database

295300
value	field
so you can say you only want to set a value to an integer field if the value is greater than x otherwise throw an exception-handling

295305
value	field
normally you will always use a property if you expose a field to the outside and you will often use it internally if you need to do validation of the value

295314
wait	hang
after that it often hang wait forever

295325
authentication	login
users are authentication by login and password there is no email attribute attached

295325
lookup	any
my naive approach was to leave them unimplemented since i assume if there is no need to restore a password there is also no need to lookup users by email -- does this have any side effects

295341
compact-framework	.net
.net compact-framework has been ported to symbian os

295348
windows-server	windows
i m looking for a way to monitor certain windows services on windows-server 2003 and restart if necessar y

295350
decimal	hex
do use hex rather than decimal whenever you put constants in a bit-wise operator

295363
nagios	cacti
for example solarwinds ipmonitor comes to mind or nagios or cacti

295367
realloc	malloc
modern operating systems will allow for running processes to request more memory - for instance in c you can use alloc malloc realloc or similar to request chunks of memory

295380
getter	setter
properties support asymmetric access you can have either a getter and a setter or just one of the two

295380
value	field
field are always symmetric you can always both get and set the value

295380
value	field
field always return the same value

295380
ref	out
fields may be used for out ref parameters properties may not

295393
parsing	comma
i would really reccomend that you parsing split on comma the email list and put each in a row in a separate table i assume you re talkin about a database-table

295417
integer	digits
i need to have a string based on an integer which should always have 5 digits

295421
selected	button
i just want to be able to selected a bit of text click a button link and have some simple html tags that i define put either side of the highlighted text

295445
curly-braces	braces
strangely though when writing in curly-bracess languages i also prefer the trailing braces layout

295446
integer	digits
on the other hand if you need it for internal processing you re always expecting five digits in a loop or whatever but you re not expecting to do arithmetic on the value then convert the integer to a string first and then do any processing

295446
integer	short
in short convert the integer variables to a string and store in a new variables then use that

295457
svn	rcs
i think your confusion is rcs in comparison to cvs subversion rcs blocks a file for all others while editing svn doesn t block anything normally

295479
common-lisp	lisp
there are versions for common-lisp and emacs lisp and it demonstrates use of quasiquote and macros

295487
groovy	java
i would say if you need to mix java with jruby groovy go with groovy

295487
groovy	java
as everybody said groovy has tighter java integration

295489
arguments	default
the default model binding takes form parameters by name and matches them up with the properties of the type specified in the arguments list

295511
any	set
is there any other way to set a guid-parameter than always change the complete sql-statement

295518
margins	padding
while em s are still very useful for most text sizing precisely because it does respect nesting the rem is great for things like margins and padding which you may not want to change size with nesting this is a common cause for misaligned left margins but which you do want to change size along with the root html font-size typically using media-queries

295523
any	set
if i set this param to say 10m what price if any am i paying compared to setting it to 1m or 4m

295524
put	get
a wiki for internal use to get popular it will need the ability to put in screenshots easily without bothering with save screenshot to file - upload file - put complicated markup on page to display image

295534
hash	md5
if you re more paranoid than that concatenate two hash for a longer one such as md5 and sha-256

295557
webrequest	webclient
edit after a long time using webrequest i found out about customizing webclient

295564
stderr	stdout
at this point the process has stdin stdout stderr from its parent plus a file that will be a s stdout and b s stdin

295565
decimal	hex
you could always prepend append a sequential id in decimal or hex to your existing hash

295576
linqdatasource	sqldatasource
the sqldatasource class has a selected method so that it can be triggered programmatically in page_load but the linqdatasource does not have this method

295578
hide	show
is there a control like system.windows.controls.groupbox that can hide its contents and show only the name and an expander button

295590
multiplying	division
this should be faster because it reduces the number of division operations done in naive square rooting down to a simple divide by 2 actually a multiplying operation and replace it with a few fixed number of multiplication operations instead

295591
host	dns
make sure dns resolves both host names to the ip-address of your isa server

295603
oracle	mysql
i m writing an applicationt hat was prototyped on mysql and is now connecting to an oracle database

295603
database-agnostic	sql-server
i ve read some tutorials which tell you to use the sql-server jdbc adaptor but i d rather configure the application so that it s database-agnostic and just have the connection string specify the protocol etc

295609
getter	setter
c# has automatic properties which are incredibly convenient and they also help to keep your code cleaner at least when you don t have custom logic in your getter and setter

295611
contains	set
the first main div tag contains the 3 other tags had nothing set for it except a size which was 400px by 400px

295625
hide	show
you can rendering out those rows you want to insert and the + show them and hide them

295629
oracle	mysql
i m writing an application which has to be configurable to connect to oracle sql server and mysql depending on client whim

295640
command-prompt	command-line
if there is output in the command-prompt that you need to record you can put a output.txt at the end of the command-line shortcut

295646
properties-file	jar
then all you need to do is load up the connection details from your properties-file and include the correct jar file on your classpath and you re done

295647
anonymous-function	eval
note the use of eval since this sits in a loop and the anonymous-function is different each time round

295657
order	join
sorting is often faster on the db as well because the db can often do the join in such a way that records are already sorted in the order you want them

295670
python	perl
can you use the same concept in python perl

295676
python	perl
i ve no idea whether python perl have the same capabilities i m afraid

295677
selected	button
attach the to click event of the button and set your grid to edit selected mode

295678
digits	base
for example look at the last digits of your number in hex by doing a bit-wise and. perfect squares can only end in 0 1 4 or 9 in base 16 so for 75 of your inputs assuming they are uniformly distributed you can avoid a call to the square root in exchange for some very fast bit twiddling

295681
contains	elements
you could make the contains elements positioning relative then give both the image and link positioning absolute to affect their stacking order

295705
perl	php
php requires php runtime to be installed as a cgi extension in iis rails requires ruby cgi style options c perl python require not only the compiler runtimes but also some poking under the hood in regards to how iis handles those files jsp requires.

295705
ruby	php
personally if forced to make this choice i would choose either php or ruby on rails but there s no valid reason for that outside of a random and subjective choice

295706
enterprise	licensing
you have to install reporting services using the enterprise edition media and to avoid doing all kinds of nasty stuff to the licensing the fail-over cluster also have to be enterprise edition

295710
triggers	insert
we can do this in t-sql by writing triggers for every table insert and update and using context_info to store the user id

295710
entity-framework	ado.net
so here i am stuck to create a bridge between entity-framework and ado.net

295718
background-image	width
i now have a full-height a single em-defined width and a full-height background-image down each side

295731
stream	send
i have a website built in c#.net that tends to produce a fairly steady stream of sql timeouts from various user-controls and i want to easily pop some code in to catch all unhandled exception-handling and send them to something that can log them and display a friendly message to the user

295735
instances	private
it makes sense to use them if you have a big class which is hard to handle and read for a typical developer to separate that class definition in separate files and to put in each file a logically separated section of code for instances all public methods and proprieties in one file private in other db handling code in third and so on..

295737
rar	zip
try opening it in any archive extractors you have zip 7z rar gz tar etc. to see if it s just a renamed file format .pk3 is something like that

295748
spawn	exit
if you re spawn the process using java.lang.process it should just work - i don t believe the spawned process will die when the jvm exit

295758
updating	updates
these updates anomalies generally fall into inserting new data updating existing data and deleting rows

295758
business-objects	olap
once you have built a star schema and if you have chosen your dimensions well named your columns wisely and especially chosen your granularity well using this star schema with olap tools like cognos or business-objects turns out to be almost as easy as playing a video game

295795
terminate	timeout
i ve seen in the past that the psi project-server interface within microsoft project didn t override the timeout and so the default of 100 seconds was applied and would terminate anything talking to it for longer than that time

295795
any	set
do you have access to all of the code and are you sure you have set timeouts where applicable so that any defaults are not being applied unbeknownst to you

295800
traffic	packets
if you have problems determining this try installing a packets filtering and monitor the traffic to see who sent the last data

295800
breakpoints	hang
once you figure out whether it s the client or server causing the lag attempt to debugging into the application and get a breakpoints where the hang occurs

295807
linux	unix
i m also assuming from your comments that the environment is unix or linux - i don t think the following is possible in windows

295828
postgresql	mysql
you might find wamp to be a good fit for your situation but i think you should save yourself the windows tax and use a lamp or use postgresql instead of mysql

295866
gzip	zip
gzip zip the file

295871
rar	zip
zip itself and rar aswell are a combination of the two processes

295873
gzip	zip
gzip is a simple file compression program that doesn t do the file bundling that tar or zip does

295874
wamp	php
you might consider based on your introduction a wamp option windows apache mysql python perl php

295881
gzip	zip
the most popular zip utilities in unix gzip and bzip2 only do file compression

295886
gzip	zip
the other thing is to look at some of the common compression techniques notably zip and gzip and learn their signatures

295899
shell	bash
i d also learn bash because it tends to be the default shell

295913
gzip	zip
amongst other things it means that people could use the cpio program for packaging the files instead of tar and then use the compressor of choice once upon a time the preferred compressor was pack later it was compress which was much more effective than pack and then gzip which ran rings around both its predecessors and is entirely competitive with zip which has been ported to unix but is not native there and now bzip2 which in my experience usually has a 10-20 advantage over gzip

295937
gzip	zip
actually the deflate algorithm is used by both zip and gzip and with appropriate binary adjusting you could take the payload of a gzip stream and put it in a zip file with appropriate header and dictionary entries

295937
compression	streaming
for large collections of small files tar followed by a streaming compressor will normally result in higher compression ratio than zip because the streaming compressor will have more data to build its dictionary frequencies from and thus be able to squeeze out more redundant information

295945
credentials	account
i understand that windows authentication is more secure because you don t have to store credentials in web.config and send them over the wire when authentication to sql-server but is that a secure configuration for production environments where the network service account is a db_owner

295956
while-loop	loops
i have tried adding a while-loops to wait until buffer.isloaded is true but that just goes into an infinite loops

295962
constructor	object
in the past i ve created a variables that counts the number of object of a given class that have been allocated by incrementing the value in the constructor and decrementing it in the destructor

295963
user-controls	ascx
i use it on a normal user-controls ascx where it works

295963
constructor	object
i know this could cause problems since i would have to set a reference to the page somehow - i tried looking at clientscriptmanager but it s constructor is internal indicating it s used somewhere like internally from scriptmanager - but it also hints that there might be an entrance comming from a class library with no compiletime reference to the page object

295969
business-objects	crystal-reports
also you can add business-objects crystal-reports any of those reporting tools because really bi reporting

295977
export	report
the export to excel will go to extraordinary lengths to try and maintain how your report looks

295977
export	report
the export does this to try and match alignment in excel with the original report

295986
arrays	loops
with collect applied to an arrays or enum you can loops through each item of that arrays and then do what you need with each student in the example to call a function for insert the students

295994
fwrite	fread
we had a discussion here at work regarding why fread and fwrite take a size per member and count and return the number of members read written rather than just taking a buffering and size

295994
fwrite	fread
fread and fwrite return the number of items successfully read or written

295994
short	zero
eof is reached the return-value is a short item count or zero

295998
any	set
ok turns out the parsing methods overrides any previously set entity resolvers with the handler passed in to the parsing methods

296011
rar	zip
it is also why zip files are extremely prevalent on windows because support is built in regardless of the superior routines in rar or 7z

296011
opensolaris	linux
these are what i have committed to memory from my many years on linux and recently on nexenta opensolaris

296015
textbox	button
in the example above if i enter the name joe into the textbox and click the save button the textblock is updated upon lostfocus and the data is saved properly

296017
triggers	insert
and a table to store historical archived date insert by a triggers perhaps

296057
gnome	kde
first you should decide if you are going to be managing the system using gui tools gnome or kde or if you will be accessing mainly from ssh using a command-line

296057
ubuntu	debian
from a gui perspective i typically have the terminal cli running anyway from a debian ubuntu perspective

296057
gedit	kate
text editors gedit gui - gnome kate gui - kde vim cli or nano cli

296057
ubuntu	linux
i would recommend going with a linux distro that has a friendly community ubuntu centos debranded free rhel or rhel you pay them to help you

296060
lookup	any
note do not use eval in any case where you are getting the name to lookup from user entered input

296060
getattr	setattr
to handle fully qualified names like post.id you could use something like the below functions in-place of getattr setattr

296069
python	java
php doesn t have as big a path issue as java and python but they all use a path setting to find components and libraries

296069
linux	unix
every programming book in unix linux book covers this

296084
business-process	integration
so i didn t know it but i think this is the model i m writing to business-process object that handles data integration and business entities that are logical models rather than database models

296089
scp	ssh
i also evaluated scp sftp which are based on ssh

296089
sftp	ftp
being pretty advanced ftp server it apparently offers no scp sftp server functionality

296089
ftp	ssh
it allows ftp over ssh but for that you need to buy certificate again

296116
web-services	security
restful web-services are in general read-only from the view of the client although you could write code which could use post or get to make changes on the server passing an encrypted token for security

296120
enumerator	any
if the documentation does not say anything about the order of enumerator i would strongly suggest you stay away from any assumptions

296144
any	set
that set of tests would include the calling code for any methods extracted

296166
quirks-mode	doctype
by quirks-mode i mean does your page has a doctype declaration similar to the one below although you should off course use the corrext doctype

296170
.net	wcf
in terms of .net tools like wsdl.exe will give you a full client-side proxy library to represent a soap service or svcutil.exe for a wcf service

296171
value	field
are you really trying to update a numeric field c4 number 10 with neu character value

296174
json	xml
rest over http puts more of that burden upon you the developer negotiating formats xml json http post parsing results dom maps dto marshalling etc.

296181
sftp	scp
sftp and scp only give access to the entire system if that user has access to the entire system

296183
revision	svn
i don t have the svn with me but we merge using the advice from the svn cookbook you merge the branch from the revision it was branched to the head revision

296192
required	checked
we can achieve what we want by creating a note field in tfs and making it required on checked in

296192
value	field
the scc interface will make the tfs check-in dialog appear force the developer to enter a value in the field

296208
filtering	grouping
for example you can filtering on the content type id of sharepoint grouping which is 0x010b

296215
configuration	environment
consider adding platforms in the configuration for different environment if you want to

296215
environment	building
this may not be the answer you are looking for but something to consider when you want to fork building based on project environment

296217
debugging	trace
different log levels - so you can tweak the logging configuration to only log errors in production to log all sorts of debugging and trace info in a development environment etc

296219
version-control	git
if you have a look at git instead of svn you will find a version-control system which is more powerfull at merging in general

296229
javascript	dom
the javascript we use manipulates the dom to show hide divs and perform incremental searching for a combobox selecting from a table

296237
margins	padding
adjust the layout by giving your containers div some padding and or the image a margins and you should be able to get exactly the look you re after

296238
sftp	ftp
on windows i tend to use winscp to upload files via sftp it can also do normal ftp and scp

296254
contains	elements
i need the custom elements contains in curly-brackets

296283
derived-class	base-class
if maps are repeated in the derived-class should they contains the contents of the base-class map or just the additional items

296304
bison	yacc
alternately you could write your own using lex and yacc or their kin- flex and bison using a public lex specification and a yacc grammar

296305
fwrite	fread
as for a rationale for the parameters to fread fwrite i ve lost my copy of k r long ago so i can only guess

296305
fwrite	fread
even though the c standard specifies that fread and fwrite be implemented in terms of fgetc and fputc remember that the standard came into existence long after c was defined by k r and that things specified in the standard might not have been in the original designers ideas

296325
getter	setter
basically what i d like to do is to use entities if they were in my context cat getter setter etc so like normal pojos

296333
csv	xml
i have an importer process which is running as a windows service debug mode as an application and it processes various xml documents and csv s and imports into an sql database

296349
data-structures	map
thrift has richer data-structures map set

296357
convention	standards
if you re using a webapp then the common convention is use a contextloaderlistener to ensure a webapplicationcontext is inserted into a standards place in the servletcontext

296366
perl	awk
oh yeah it s on a linux server of course so i have perl sed awk grep etc

296368
shell	bash
learn the bash shell especially history

296368
iptables	netstat
how to work with iptables netstat and traceroute

296374
installation	building
building the app provision deliver with non-technical installation instructions

296380
required	checked
an import statement required checked to see if the module exists which has a non-zero cost

296397
gnome	kde
this library is quite popular and used by abiword gnome and kword kde wvware

296418
display	width
the problem i am having is that when i change the columns being display the column widths are only being determined by the width of the header cells not the data in it

296438
windows	winpe
i have an mfc app running in winpe windows preinstallation environment and i m trying to make a method call with a 64-bit value in a ulonglong as a parameter

296438
pointers	stack
the value is initially allocated on stack immediately before the call and i ve tried passing it by value reference and pointers

296458
any	set
in the .xsd file for a typed dataset in .net there s a section that contains a list of any data connections i ve used to set up the datatables and tableadapters

296484
iprincipal	iidentity
the last line of your question is probably the quickest solution however i don t think you need to create the interface httpcontext.current.user is already an iprincipal and httpcontext.current.user.identity is already an iidentity

296492
versioning	downgrade
interestingly the solution here was that i needed to downgrade my rake versioning

296497
keydown	keyup
when hiding on keydown or keypress the other application that becomes active after my windows hide itself receives the keyup event for that keystroke

296497
keydown	keyup
for example tweetdeck sends the message currently being edited on enter keyup even if it did not receive keydown keypress

296497
keydown	keyup
if i try to create an history of matching keydown keyup i m over-complicating my code modifiers generate their own keyup

296518
keydown	keyup
alternatively can you just eat the keyup off the message-queue after you receive the keydown

296518
keydown	keyup
i would not worry too much about applications handling keyup rather than keydown - like you point out - the only reason this is an issue is because your app changes active windows in the middle of a keydown keyup sequences

296518
keydown	keyup
you can probably just handle the keyup instead of keydown with no adverse side effects

296518
keydown	keyup
this is stateful - you can only go into hiding if you received the keydown and the keyup - at least that is what i would do

296527
firewatir	watir
worth noting that the firewatir project has been rolled into the watir core and the codebases integrated as of the 1.6.2 release last week

296535
mime	rfc
this great codeproject article by peter huber sg entitled pop3 email client with full mime support .net 2.0 will give you an understanding of how mime processing can be implements and the related rfc specification articles

296548
click	mouse
it works fine and handles the mouse properly for instance click and selected are processed ok

296575
alias	pwd
some people alias pwd to echo pwd

296575
alias	pwd
do an alias pwd and which pwd on both that user and any user that works normally

296589
constructor	object
otherwise from my knowledge you can t create an object without calling the constructor

296603
thunderbird	mutt
i d be grateful to hear how to do this in other email clients thunderbird outlook evolution mutt etc

296605
sftp	ftps
it does provide a simple upgrade path to sftp over ssh and ftps over ssl though that is a pay-for commercial product

296611
constructor	private
however for the benefit of the readers here is how to get at a internal protected or private constructor

296615
google-chrome	firefox
both ie6 and ie7 will download the file as file with no extension but firefox opera google-chrome and safari have no problems at all downloading the file as file.exe

296650
python	java
primarily languages will be java c c++ python and php

296669
mybatis	ibatis
it still requires xml configuration but have a look at mybatis formerly ibatis

296686
value	field
you can get value of field like this

296686
document	element
these can be quite fragile assertions i d recommend you anchor these xpath references to an outer containers element not the root of your document as lots of automatic tools do

296714
constructor	object
when objects are abstracted away from their underlying memory it is fundamentally invalid to suggest that an object instance can exist without the constructor being invoked

296719
attributes	properties
what s a good rule of thumb for naming methods that return properties attributes members of an object

296744
fieldset	labels
i have problem with labels inside a fieldset feedback form

296744
firefox	opera
it is correctly shown in firefox opera ie6 but it looks ugly in ie7 see this page here

296769
constructor	object
you have to call a constructor to create an object

296778
packaging	building
we use finalbuilder for building our visual-studio 2005 projects including packaging the final executable and dlls with installshield and putting them up on a shared server

296778
linux	unix
we also telnet out from finalbuilder to a number of other platforms unix linux openvms and start remote builds by running makefiles there

296780
nested	assign
if you tried to declare a new variables at the point where you re currently assign to postparent the problem would be with the nested block because the scope of postparent would include that nested block even though it was before the declaration

296784
getter	setter
in smalltalk the convention is blarg for getter and blarg for setter

296784
getter	setter
you mention cases where you don t have both getter and setter

296792
expression	evaluation
i m guessing it has something to do with lazy evaluation but i thought these expression would get sequenced so there wouldn t be a problem

296793
binaries	install
the main application .exe should be one any supporting binaries would each be separate projects the install would be a separate project etc

296809
constructor	object
constructor are run the object might

296814
attributes	properties
the reason they are named get... is to represent the process of accessing to a characteristic of an object whether it is a simple properties or a calculated attributes

296816
executable	jar
the executable calling createprocess had an unclosed file handle to updates.jar from an attempt to copy the update jar earlier

296849
textarea	textbox
what is the way of seperating line-breaks and space in multiline textbox or html textarea while inserting database asp.net

296857
gridview	listview
however using the progressbarrenderer as one generally has to when trying to draw a progress bar in an owner-drawn listview gridview or other such control just gives the visual style without the pretty animation

296906
profiling	trace
in particular i created a simple trace with both object opened and object closed with no filterings except the standard application name not like sql profiling filtering and ran but no events were reported

296917
webforms	asp.net
i m trying to add dll references to an asp.net 3.5 project webforms not mvc and all of the references i m adding keep showing up as auto updating

296919
windows	ms-dos
other than that for simple things such as simply runnning an application take a look at windows command script ms-dos batch files

296940
perl	php
perl ruby or php may be more your speed

296956
vbscript	jscript
vbscript cscript jscript very powerful when combined with wmi

296956
python	perl
you could install perl python or other engine

296965
c-preprocessor	macros
if it is plain c lex and yacc are your friends but you need to take on account c-preprocessor - source files with unexpanded macros typically are do not comply with c syntax so parsing written with k r grammar in mind most likely will fail

296965
dwarf	elf
there are ways to get debugging information out of binary - for elf executable with dwarf there is libdwarf for windows-land coff

296970
url-encoding	url
i ve written an encoder source that uses all kinds of parsing tricks that i could think of different kinds of html entities url-encoding comments multiline attributes soft hyphens non-obvious structure of mailto url etc

296975
git-repo	repo
when i run git-branch -r i can only see the branches that existed when i ran fetch against the svn repo to initializer my git-repo

296980
plugins	add-on
you might be able to change this with a plugins add-on but not without writing code

296996
compact-framework	.net
i develop applications for the pocketpc platform .net compact-framework 2.0 and higher and one of the problems i constantly run in to is the drop-down width for combobox controls is not wide enough to show very long string values

297010
spaces	output
in order to get it to do partial-keyword searching i added some code in sql to split up the search query by spaces and output a statement like the following

297020
expression	evaluation
in my opinion algebra is essential for any decent programmer since it forms the underpinnings of variables representation and expression evaluation functions commutativity and transitivity of operations etc

297020
combinations	permutation
knowing your way around combinations and permutation is vital in almost any programming context

297021
string.format	stringbuilder
string.format uses a stringbuilder under the hood check with reflector so it won t have any performance benefit unless you are doing a significant amount of concatenation

297027
hide	show
i want to show all twenty then hide only the ones that don t relate to what i m working on

297050
memory-management	shared-memory
apr is a larger library than glib with lots of useful stuff in it hash tables argument parsing file i o stuff memory-management shared-memory routines signal handling etc.

297053
insertion-sort	stable-sort
i think you should sort the list twice first by priority and then by earliest time using any stable-sort algorithm for instance insertion-sort

297061
constructor	private
and the constructor is private

297101
exception-handling	error-handling
for instance i don t see any obvious reason why a fetch request would need error-handling beyond programmer mistakes which incidentally also raise an exception-handling in my experience

297115
order	add
add the item to the running order and add its duration to t

297121
configuration	logging
is it possible to separate the logging configuration into another configuration file

297123
dictionary	hashmap
in terms of java both the class hashmap and the class dictionary are implementations of the map abstract data type

297123
dictionary	arrays
abstract data types are not specific to any one programming language and the map adt can also be known as a hash or a dictionary or an associative arrays others at

297135
driver	kernel
unless you are targetting a specific embedded platform or kernel mode driver there is no real need to limit yourself to c anymore

297137
python	c++
i haven t tried directly calling python functions from c++ but here are some alternative ideas.

297137
python	c++
generally it s easier to call c++ code from a high-level language like python than the other way around

297137
python	c++
if you re interested in this approach then you could create a c++ codebase and access it from python

297137
python	c++
depending on how you want to use the library you could alternatively create python scripts which you call from c++ with the exec functions

297146
selected	button
it was a button that posted back to manufacture a custom excel sheet loaded with user selected data

297152
double-quotes	spaces
note the double-quotes in order to be able to delete directory with spaces in them

297155
python	c++
although calling c++ libs from python is more normal - you can call a python module from c++ by bascially calling the python intepreter and have it execute the python source

297175
python	c++
this library is mainly used to expose c++ to python but can be used the other way around

297202
hide	next
the previous next button would essentially hide show the div in each step of the process

297205
updating	updates
what s the best way of updating this field to non-null via an updates scripting without deleting the contents of the table

297206
textbox	button
i also have a textbox underneath the table and an add button

297210
postback	ajax
as far as i know for this you would be forced to be calling this method via a postback and not an ajax call

297221
value	field
if you want to change it from nullable to not-nullable you must provide some value that can be assigned to rows with null value in that field

297236
postback	ajax
i m guessing the problem occurs because the site is a single page that uses ajax so there are no postback to reset ie s count of commands executed

297248
any	set
you ve got to set a value to any rows with null in the null able column before you change it to not null

297256
business-objects	crystal-reports
i ve used cognos series 7 cognos series 8 crystal-reports business-objects xi r2 webintelligence reporting services 2000 reporting services 2005 and reporting services 2008

297256
any	set
on good hardware at a consulting gig i was able to scale it to a larger set of concurrent users without any issues

297256
sql-server	oracle
i ve read about instances where oracle and db2 quotes include installing a sql-server 2005 analysis services server for olap cubes

297256
database-agnostic	oracle
database-agnostic definitely a good solution if you expect to use oracle db2 or another database back-end

297256
database-agnostic	oracle
database-agnostic like boxi this is definitely a good solution if you expect to use oracle db2 or another database back-end

297259
json	xml
you should use xml or json

297269
highlight	selected
graphical explain tools that show the plan of the actual exiection path come close but they show too much info and do not highlight the missing link in the selected stament

297269
postgresql	mysql
i am using postgresql sqllight and mysql but would be interested in how tools for other databases platforms work

297273
string.format	stringbuilder
i have taken a look at string.format using reflector and it actually creates a stringbuilder then calls appendformat on it

297273
string.format	stringbuilder
i know that stringbuilder attempt to prevent pointless memory copies from taking place but the string.format still ends up with extra overhead compared to the plain concatenation

297273
string.format	stringbuilder
it is those intermediate results that are eliminated by using string.format or a stringbuilder

297284
web-config	app-config
string.format is probably a better choice when the format templates c 0 is stored in a configuration file such as web-config app-config

297291
postback	ajax
you can use this to register all your scripts original load postback ajax postback

297294
environment	building
my building environment is configured to compile run and create coverage file at the command-line using ned batchelder coverage.py tool

297294
environment	building
i m using eclipse with pydev as my editor but for practical reasons it s not possible convenient for me to convert my whole building environment to eclipse and thus generate the coverage data directly from the ide as it s designed to do

297301
touch	drag
i would probably implement this using a uiview with custom touchesxxx messages so that the user could for example touch the first star and drag out a four-star rating

297303
printwriter	ioexception
some days ago i realized that printwriter as well as printstream never throw an ioexception when writing flushing or closing

297307
instance-variables	accessor
this covers not just accessor methods and instance-variables but to-many relationships validation auto-notifying dependent keys and so on

297311
sql-server	oracle
this is for oracle sql-server might be different

297314
progress-bar	progress
one possible view onto the progress is a visual progress-bar with a title that refers to task name and step within task

297325
application-pool	was
i used a similar stuff to do a revert to the application-pool identity for a website that was heavy on impersonation

297328
constructor	object
what i want to do is create a program that can take an object and use reflection to list all its properties methods constructor etc

297328
reflection	runtime
the reflection machine would allow for runtime manipulation and interrogation

297330
codedom	.net
how do i programmatically embed a .net module to the assembly generated by codedom

297335
put	get
i ve got some code that will generically get all controls in a form and put them in a list

297354
json	xml
your message types are what you d expect - messages that conform to a contract between the process es inserting and the process es reading structured with xml or your other choice of representation json would be handy in some cases for instance

297355
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
i wrote a case-insensitive versioning of char_traits for use with std basic_string in order to generate a std string that is not case-sensitive when doing comparisons searches etc using the built-in std basic_string member-functions

297358
exception-handling	error-handling
the error-handling direction that apple has been taking since 1.4 has been nserror for errors that the application should know about like the one you stated above and exception-handling for programming errors that should never get past qa

297368
installation	upgrade
but i ve been told some sql-server dba s are going to upgrade the os of a ss2000 installation to 64bit to get 64k pages in the fs

297378
attributes	properties
i believe the vs designer does it by getting an instance of the control s designer see the designer attributes and if the designer is a componentdesigner getting the associatedcomponents properties

297378
design-time	designer
in effect this class controls certain aspects of the designer and of the design-time behavior of the component

297387
contains	set
i have a problem where i am attempting to update a set of attributes with a fixed value contains within a repeating section of an xml document using the microsoft.biztalk.streaming.valuemutator

297401
directory	folder
a virtual directory in iis points to any folder in the filesystems to look for the appliction

297408
uitableview	uiview
i ve extended it a little so that rather than using opengl for display all the time i have a plain uiview as the title screen a uitableview for a high scores screen and an unmodified eaglview for the game screen

297409
value	field
now here is where it gets tricky you have a value but attributes decorate the field which holds the value

297409
value	field
you actually need to reflect over the enumerator s field and check the value of each against the value you ve been given results should be cached for performance

297412
triggers	insert
i guess i would have to have 3 triggers in club table for insert update and delete and 3 more in coach table

297421
any	set
i don t need to set default encoding for project or so i need it to be default for any files i create

297426
transparency	frame
currently i am making use of large numbers of separate .png files with transparency backgrounds to represent the various sprites and different frame of animation that i need

297427
32-bit	64bit
one issue we ran into last year was that there were no 64bit drivers available so our servers that have applications connecting to the as 400 must be 32-bit

297429
temporary	copy
restore the whole database to another machine or temporary database then copy the table seems like the easiest to me

297438
sql-server	mysql
i m using jpa hibernate s implementation to annotate entity classes to persist to a relational database mysql or sql-server

297460
document	editing
is there any way to force text-mate to use a two-space tab instead of a full tab when editing html ruby-on-rails document

297466
document	editing
you should have an rhtml or erb document or whatever file type you want to change open for editing when doing this

297469
any	set
i never found a satisfactory answer for this - basically you just need to add the varybyparams property and if you don t have any parameters set it to the magic string none

297484
value	field
the results page would then use the default value for the field that don t exist in the url

297493
xsd	xml
hyperjaxb versions 2 and 3 actually generates hibernate mapping files and related entity objects and also does a round trip test for a given xsd and sample xml file

297500
postback	ajax
if anyone has a simple fix for this please let me know or even better an ajax sort which would avoid the postback would be even better

297512
python	perl
the pipe is the slowest s.lott s solution is faster then the above python version and toolkit s perl solution is the fastest

297526
checkbox	textbox
i m trying to come up with the cleanest way to clear all the controls on a form back to their defaults clear textbox uncheck checkbox

297543
header-files	makefile
basically you need to dynamically create the makefile rules to rebuild the object files when the header-files change

297544
xsd	xml
mapping xsd s to database tables is very similar mapping objects to database tables in fact you could use a framework like castor that does both it allows you to take a xml schema and generate classes database tables and data access code

297555
hide	show
below that there is a series of checkbox type_of_request for new account delete account new software etc which show hide those form elements as they are checked unchecked

297555
required	checked
i would like to validate the required sections on the form only if the corressponding type_of_request item has been checked

297555
selected	checkbox
a typical scenario will be both the email and other checkbox in the type_request has been selected

297572
arrays	loops
i can easily retrieve all records from a table select from users where user_id 1 and then loops through an arrays adding what s not in the db and creating another arrays of items to be removed in a subsequent call but i m hoping for a better faster was of doing this

297577
heuristics	greedy
even if you know everything your next move is greedy in matching a heuristics

297581
versioning	upgrade
if i understand correctly you basically want a setup.exe that will detect the current versioning of the prerequisites on the target system install them if they re missing and upgrade them if they re out of date

297594
click	mouse
the cough- hack -cough trick is to draw the line on the panels underneath the controls and also draw it on each of the controls themselves resulting in this which will persist even when you click the button and move the mouse around

297594
click	mouse
it s easy to draw directly on controls in .net but whatever you draw is wiped away when someone click the button or moves the mouse over it unless it s perpetually redrawn in the paint events as here

297594
textbox	button
update this method will not work for scrollbars textbox comboboxes listviews or basically anything with a textbox-type thing as part of it and not because it only offsets for button in the example above - you just can t draw on top of a textbox at all at least not from its paint event at least not if you re me

297601
enumerate	next
even end games -- when there are fewer pieces -- are hard to enumerate to determine a best next move

297611
variables	boolean
the second is where the accessor takes an argument and places the attribute into this variables pointer reference usually and the third is where the attribute foo is a boolean type

297624
python	ruby
there are various samples available for how to host python or ruby running on the dlr inside your own appdomain

297634
append	input
i can see it being an interesting mini-tool though to take a sql query with n predicates as input and return a graph of the count result after append each separate and clause to the trunk of the statement .

297642
pascal	basic
the languages were basic and then pascal but it doesn t really matter what the language is

297649
printwriter	writer
when the reader writer api was added printwriter was created to parallels the existing printstream

297653
required	checked
i wonder if its because ioexception are checked this would required you placing a try catch block around every system.out

297661
return-value	arguments
this tells the compiler the rules that apply for setting up the stack pushing arguments and getting a return-value

297678
callback	methods
as with the socket class if you need to coordinate with your callback methods somecmd_oncompleted in this case you can use the return value of executeasync to know if the operation is pending true or if the operation completed synchronously

297690
string.format	stringbuilder
i did a bit of profiling of various string methods including string.format stringbuilder and string concatenation

297692
extends	sealed
that said the rich libraries themselves can suffer from abstraction inversion however because the internal implementation are often hidden or key classes are sealed developers attempting to extends these libraries are often forced into re-implementing replicating functionality to successfully make use of extension points provided by the base-class library - this is not so much a language issue as a conscious choice made by the developer of the base-class libraries to avoid exposing functionality which may be brittle or change often with new release of the .net jdk

297695
callback	methods
then in your object s setcallbackobject withselector methods you can call your callback methods

297703
value	field
does it already index value converted to their base characters corresponding to that field s collation

297707
numeric	digits
to be compatible with arpanet each label must start with a letter and end with a letter or digits but some tld s now allows an all numeric domain like 0.nu

297720
callback	methods
selectors are generally passed to delegate methodss and to callbacks to specify which methods should be called on a specific object during a callback

297720
callback	methods
for instance when you create a timer the callback methods is specifically defined as

297720
callback	methods
so when you schedule the timer you would use selector to specify which methods on your object will actually be responsible for the callback

297751
any	set
the first thing i do on any project is get output to the screen and make sure my devkit is set up etc

297764
coverage.py	pydev
i don t know anything about pydev s integration of coverage.py or if it even uses coverage.py but the .coverage files are pretty simple

297780
xsd	xml
they even had a tool that let me give a sample of the xml i was writing a xsd for and it would try to infer the definition

297793
google-chrome	firefox
my pages all validate and they look correct on firefox and mostly correct on google-chrome

297810
specifications	w3c
different w3c specifications define different sets of node types

297810
document	element
li code document code -- code element code maximum of

297825
put	get
since you are only dealing with int s it wouldn t hurt to put some type checking in your assignments otherwise you ll get sql errors if a string slips in somehow

297830
contains	elements
an nsinvocation object contains all the elements of an objective-c message a target a selector arguments and the return value

297876
schema	rdbms
if you need to use an rdbms you may have to stick with a de-normalized schema though

297889
selected	button
i m trying to prevent the user from dragging a toolstrip from instance 1 of type a to instance 2 of type a selected some stuff on instance 2 and then clicking a button on the toolbar only to have something weird happen to some other windows

297895
webforms	asp.net
i ve been trying with the idea of taking an existing asp.net webforms application and converting it to a hybrid so that going forward we can do asp.net mvc

297895
webforms	asp.net
in order to do this i created an asp.net mvc application and started copying some of the folders from the asp.net webforms projects that contain webforms

297901
global-asax	web-config
i think you d have a lot easier conversion adding the system.web.mvc assemblies to your current project and updating the web-config file and global-asax

297919
arguments	default
in perl many methods use the default variables and _ if you don t explicitly specify arguments

297923
contains	elements
i am not sure if google makes the adsense code available over ssl as well if not your visitors will be warned by the browser that the page may contains insecure elements

297936
versioning	upgrade
this may be named pipe or tcp-ip mdac versioning upgrade vs install etc

297937
callback	methods
one general pattern for asynchronous operations in .net at least for the backgroundworker and the begininvoke endinvoke methods pairs is to have a result object that separates the callback from the actual return value or any exception-handling that occurred

297946
asp.net-mvc	webforms
basicallly you d use ignoreroute to exclude all of your webforms from being routed to an asp.net-mvc handler

297963
keyboard	mouse
virtualizing the mobile is way different from virtualizing the server or the desktop where in the the hardware components are almost standardized like the keyboard mouse usb lan etc so the hardware could be easily abstracted for any of the os

297970
javascript	dom
there are a number of great javascript libraries frameworks out there jquery prototype mootools etc. but they all seem to focus on dom interaction and ajax functionality

297988
linux	bsd
so computing running mac os or linux or bsd or beos are just pc

297995
lan	vpn
i do this all the time using an access gateway vpn then ssh to servers inside the company lan

297996
.when	ready
i have the filtering function ready but now i need to apply it to a list as show on the second example excluding all elements for which the filtering returns true .when applied with the first arguments

298004
directory	folder
is there a neat archiving library that automatically handles archiving a folder or directory for you out there

298009
any	set
is there any way to direct c# to ignore nullreferenceexception-handling or any specific exception-handling for that matter for a set of statements

298009
exception-handling	try-catch
edit try-catch will skip the succeeding statements on exception-handling

298009
xsd	xml
now prop2 could be a null object because it doesn t exists in xml message - an optional element in xsd

298012
conditional	operators
other than that - perhaps some use of the conditional operators

298042
integer	numeric
for instance for a compiler i might start with integer variables declare assign with a numeric constant and perhaps print - or any other way to ensure it works

298042
assign	add
then i could try to declare two variables and assign one with the other add an incrementation operator implement arithmetics .

298064
inherited	subclass
qt documentation states that it ... assumes that the first inherited class is a subclass of qobject.

298075
frame	width
frames store per-frame information like the x and y offset of the frame in sheet cell width and height and any transformation resize rotation hue etc.

298075
frame	width
a less flexible alternative i used earlier was to specify fixed sizes for cells and sheets and calculate frame offsets and sizes based on these value width is always 32 pixels so third sprite is at 32 2

298081
web-config	app-config
beyond that you can also tweak the proxy settings via configuration app-config web-config machine.config etc via the configuration system.net defaultproxy node

298092
internet-explorer	firefox
it is a firefox internet-explorer plugin that exposes an sqlite database and a few other goodies

298134
perl	php
a small ajax oriented server side script php perl ruby whatever that takes a few parameters and does the mysql query sending the data to the client in an http-and-javascript friendly manner for example as image jpeg or json

298136
textbox	button
you can also change focus in your click handler before reading the value for example forcing the focus to the button or to another textbox

298139
object-reference	instances
this works for a few labels but on a button i receive a object-reference not set to an instances of an object. when i try to change the text property

298173
postback	ajax
if you actually want to create tablerow or tablecell objects you would of course need to postback no need for javascript or make an ajax call javascript to server-side code

298194
rollback	commit
i need to implement a simple transaction methods commit rollback in saving to the db

298203
any	set
it can be set to any descendant of tcustomhint

298204
hash	md5
i would guess that performing an md5 hash on every item every time is pretty costly

298209
webserver	host
with either option the webserver will determine the account based on the host name in the http header

298209
host	dns
which we can do because our dns provider has an api to manage host records

298217
value	field
this has two implications first any field initialization code is duplicates in each constructor and second any code you include in your constructor to initialize fields to specific value will in fact re-assign the fields

298218
markup	xhtml
if not is there any convention for how to markup underlined text in xhtml

298228
any	set
a benefit of keeping the tool in source control is that you can set company-wide settings such as pointing to a internal repository - then run that single instance of maven from the vob on any platform which retains the settings you originally set

298232
markup	xhtml
the goal of xhtml strict is that the xhtml markup should be used to describe the structure of the content

298251
export	csv
the selected form posts will then be used to generate a csv file for export

298265
ubuntu	linux
you could use a pre-built vmware image 1 or create your own pretty simply using a linux distro like ubuntu 2

298267
g++	gcc
it can use either vc++ gcc g++ or it can be configured to use other compilers if required

298314
required	checked
..then be able to go though each result checked if it s no longer required then removing it probably using filter-branch

298329
inherited	subclass
i m not sure i understand what you mean by map a subclass one-to-one but if you want to map inherited where the subclasses have properties that are not nullable you can do like this in fluent-nhibernate

298329
subclassing	inherited
since you want the subclassing properties to be not-null you have to use the table-per-class joined-subclass way of modeling the inherited

298346
internet-explorer	firefox
i am trying to send an email on click of image button which works in mozilla firefox but not in internet-explorer

298352
order	add
you could of course add optional fields like a timestamp which would let you selected comments in the order they were entered

298381
margins	padding
i have set the width to 25 or 24.99 to avoid a rounding error in some browsers so that they re spread out evenly across the page but you might want a different alignment which is easily done using margins padding and or a different width on the containers

298385
javascript	dom
i guess what i want is something like a dom tree or even better something like how getelementbyname works in javascript

298390
pseudo-element	pseudo-class
links2 is a class made by you not a pseudo-class or a pseudo-element

298487
bugzilla	trac
i ve been using trac for a small personal project and at work we used bugzilla for this

298488
loading	gif
ajaxloading div contains a rotating loading gif

298489
value	field
the choices btw should be defined in your model as the range of value for that model field

298506
floating	margins
floating the div right next to another one floated left and with the margins set as you have they should end up at either side of the browser windows with the left hand div expanding to fill the available spaces apart from the 10px gap created by your margins

298521
ubuntu	linux
tomcat 5.5 runs on ubuntu linux

298538
parentheses	let
alternatively to avoid let blindness and parentheses paralysis use some pipelining |

298551
continuous-integration	automated-tests
i had to commit to writing and maintaining good automated-tests and to getting a continuous-integration server and a one-click build-and-deploy capability

298560
value	field
then when fetching a record from the database if this field s value is more than 5 minutes old you can re-cache the data from the restful api you re not using couchdb are you

298566
arrays	loops
if you want to use filter_input on the entire arrays you need to loops through it send each arrays key to filter_input and put the result back in _get

298585
value	field
as you point out you can already skip all values left to default no field no value

298603
pointers	stack
from then it s simply a matter of reading the argument out and incrementing the pointers by an appropriate size to move deeper into stack

298603
32-bit	x86
the x86 stack in 32-bit mode is 4-byte aligned generally and this also means that bytes and words are passed as 32-bit integers

298648
worksheet	excel
do you know how to add define more than one worksheet in excel file written using html

298654
click	mouse
when you have the mouse captured you get one click event outside your windows then capturing is turned off

298677
traversal	parent
my question is can anyone think of an elegant design that will allow me from any object to traversal the entire tree for example to identify the root parent from any subsequently child object

298687
windows-xp	windows
the resource kit can also be installed on other versions of windows like windows-xp

298692
windows-xp	windows
i know that the last thing i should think is it s a windows bug but the fact that simply by using iis on windows server or by changing iis on that windows-xp machine to filezilla and lighthttpd my file transfer speeds go up twice from the original configuration makes me go hmmm

298712
tortoisecvs	winmerge
tortoisecvs with winmerge

298716
tortoisecvs	winmerge
tortoisecvs with winmerge is my choice too for cvs

298724
directory	folder
please 1 uninstall db2 express via control panel - add remove programs 2 uninstall portal and was by using portalserver uninstall uninstall.bat 3 after uninstalling portal i delete all files in install directory of portal ii delete files in documents and settings administrator local settings temp iii delete files in documents and settings administrator that begin with a dot iv delete vpd.properties file in c windows v delete wpdb2ins folder and files included in it

298724
administration	account
also ensure the account installing portal express has administration rights on the installation machine

298727
webserver	host
if i wanted to host two virtual machines - one of which was running a little-used webserver and one of which was running an often-used build platform we use team city and the virtual machine would be one of the build agents what hardware would you recommend for the physical host machine

298730
tortoisecvs	winmerge
on windows definitely using tortoisecvs and winmerge will meet your needs

298735
ole-automation	com
safearrays are the way to go if you want ole-automation compliance and maybe use the com interface from other languages such as vb6

298765
oracle	mysql
a dbms database management system is the software like mysql sql server oracle etc that manages and runs a database

298767
instance-variables	accessor
i would avoid using properties if the accessor methods does something non-obvious to the object like setting an unrelated instance-variables

298771
contains	set
a table is a table a set of rows and columns containing data and is contains in schemas

298772
javascript	dom
is there a way to access the same variable in javascript perhaps using the dom i don t know how django makes the variables accessible

298772
contains	lookup
i want to be able to lookup details using an ajax lookup based on the values contains in the variables passed in

298777
authentication	login
i want to find a way to redirect the whole page to the login form when the authentication has timed out and an ajax link is clicked

298785
.when	ready
can you start the next movie earlier in a different component and pause it on the first frame and somehow swap and un-pause it .when the previous one is finished so that it s already ready to play

298786
font-size	height
it has a height of 150px and a font-size of say 1.3em

298790
dynamic-reports	report
sql-server reporting services for any dynamic-reports generated or report builder for adhoc reports

298816
filtering	sorting
so that end users can modify report layout filtering and sorting options.

298824
m2eclipse	maven
for integration between maven and eclipse see m2eclipse and maven eclipse plugin

298830
command-line	cmd
i have a single string that contains the command-line parameters to be passed to another executable and i need to extract the string containing the individual parameters in the same way that c# would if the cmd had been specified on the command-line

298854
contains	any
i recommend lxml over xmlproc because the pyxml package contains xmlproc is not being developed any more

298859
.when	ready
additionally even with the gc it s a best practice to manually set your pointers to nil .when you re done with them to hint to the gc that they may be ready for collection

298859
author	posts
the author does both .net and cocoa and has several posts discussing the difference

298872
client-server	security
i want to write a client-server system where the server uses remoting instead of iis but i want the client to automatically pass it s credentials to the server just like a browser does when communicating with an iis server that has integrated security enabled.

298875
font-size	height
you don t need to set the height value and the font-size doesn t affect the vertical align

298879
gtk	gdk
if it comes to gui stuff than libapr has nothing whereas glib has gdk gtk and a lot of stuff for gnome if you like

298879
glib	gtk
desktop programming use gtk and glib

298880
directory	folder
then the filereader will attempt to read that file from the base directory - which in tomcat is likely to be the bin folder

298932
selected	button
i can click selected push button etc but it won t accept keyboard input and mouse wheel notifications as a result

298933
unit-testing	assertions
also unit-testing frameworks allow for some of the need for programmatic assertions to be external to the code being tested

298955
look-and-feel	swt
if your final goal is native look-and-feel for each target os you can look at swt

298963
internet-explorer	opera
yes if you have opera and not pocket internet-explorer it get s a bit better

298969
exception-handling	error-handling
you can t replace exception-handling with assertions because if the user runs your application with assertions disabled the default all of your error-handling code disappears

298978
libxml2	lxml
gimel and tim recommend lxml which is a nicely pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries

298988
jndi	jdbc
this problem occurs irregardless of using a datasource jndi or jdbc

298996
superclass	inherited
create a superclass s and make a and b inherited from it

299023
radio-button	selected
make a copy of one of apple s defaults and change it to your liking and make sure to selected the option-as-meta radio-button there

299080
profiling	trace
i want to create a trace on a database server from my c# app like what you do in sql-server profiling

299095
put	get
we have tried to put some guards around the selection but can t seem get all problems covered

299100
implements	extends
if we want to extends any thing in vista we have to implements interfaces using com

299119
multiplication	division
the elaborate on jeffery s message since you generally a better chance of truncated needed decimal than you have of overflowing a 32-bit integer and because multiplication division is commutative you should generally do multiplication before division

299121
multiplication	division
do multiplication first as long as they re not likely to overflow and division second

299124
profiling	trace
more technical history of the profiling this old sqlmag article has some history of the profiling which replaced an app called sql trace when sql 7.0 was introduced

299143
multiplication	division
as said above you should do the multiplication before the division

299158
triggers	insert
can i use this keyword in a triggers and determine if the triggers was called by an insert delete or update

299160
jquery	.post
just started getting into jquery and have an issue with a jquery .post call working perfectly on my local dev box vs 2008 built-in web server but failing when i deploy to a windows 2003 server iis 6 box

299172
document	element
in practical terms id attributes should only be used one per document class attributes can be used on more than one element on a document

299172
specifications	w3c
check the w3c specifications and also the css-discuss page on this issue

299180
web-services	api
traditionally distributed api s such as web-services or rpc layers live on the next layer up

299180
service-layer	crud
exposing a simple api for crud operations can also be achieved by directly connecting to the database server so a web service-layer over the top of this is not going to give you anything that the dbms doesn t already provide

299183
double	int
math.sqrt works with double as input parameters so you won t get accurate results for int bigger than 2 53

299192
instrumentation	profiling
i don t believe he has open-sourced this yet but as he describes it the basic idea is to use aop to instrumentation code that you re interested in profiling and record which thread has touched which field

299200
firefox	safari
subjects webkit safari firefox apis applescript automator javascript ruby ruby on ruby-on-rails os x tiger

299208
document	editing
for example if you re editing a class go to symbol works on the methods names but in a css document you ll be searching on your selectors

299222
json	xml
be it a full blown html template an html snippet json xml etc

299231
populate	row
3 if the user click on the blank new row at the bottom of the datagridview i capture the new empty row of in the rowenter event and populate it with data

299256
firefox	safari
i don t have any insight into safari but it s based on webkit and there should be some resources on customizing it similar to how you d use xul on firefox

299257
textures	fbo
fbo s allow you to draw directly into a textures as if it were another rendering context

299289
triggers	insert
if you need to determine which one of these called the triggers you should check the insert and deleted tables like below

299295
openoffice.org	acrobat
in addition to creating pdfs from scratch you can also use it to fill in pdf forms and or templates created with acrobat or even ms office openoffice.org

299300
url-rewriting	rewrite
you could use an url-rewriting isapi such as iirf to rewrite the url into something the aspnet_isapi can process

299310
parentheses	braces
the braces are of course optional here i just prefer them to parentheses when defining functions after all this isn t lisp

299331
oracle	mysql
excellent support for oracle mysql sql server etc

299338
attributes	properties
try setting the dispid attributes of the properties to be 0 as described here in the msdn documentation

299355
value	field
i beleive that s becuase a system.dbnull value is a null in database-table but a null field in a procedure effectively equates to the null nothing keyword

299379
contains	set
i would like to create a common silverlight library that contains a set of resources used to define the styles used for all the silverlight user-interface libraries

299401
value	field
this is hopefully done by ms already...but if you don t trust or implement something on your own...you could just fill object with some data save it restore it and check if the field value are in place

299451
filtering	sorting
you can present different views of you folders using the data view filtering and sorting controls

299458
json	xml
try xml or yaml or json

299474
put	get
i am not a web developer but somehow it seems that i should be able to use some tool to tell me exactly what put get magic goes from the final request to the server

299490
filtering	grouping
the problem is that i need to add additional filtering to only look for users who are in certain security grouping

299522
hide	show
above i used the payload instead to indicate whether the shell should show or hide

299541
string.format	stringbuilder
on top of this i ve seen comments regarding the memory consumption string.format uses a stringbuilder internally

299547
paintcomponent	draw
for a single image i would think about making a custom subclass of jpanel and overriding its paintcomponent methods to draw the image

299548
value	field
in the helpfile entry for tdbcombobox it says that the text of the selected option becomes the new value for the field

299558
solaris	linux
however i have used win32 oracle clients with cygwin and made it work - the same shell scripts would work on cygwin linux and solaris

299560
order	join
you can sorta fake it with a set of self join but in order to do that you have to know all possible permissions before you write the query...which is what the other suggestions have proposed

299577
text-editor	editor
there are several very good rich text web editor written in javascript eg fckeditor yui text-editor and many many others

299631
json	xml
you can post back to your server with xml or json

299645
onmousedown	mousedown
i need to override onmousedown to implement the dragging functionality but i also want my animation triggers on the mousedown event

299654
gzip	zip
you could configure your webserver to compress the page on the fly and possibly cache the compressed version for any client that indicates it can take a gzip or zip or other encoding which is pretty much all of them

299657
.net	wcf
.net remoting or wcf would be more optimal

299658
project-management	project
if it were just projects then any one of the online project-management tools goplan copper project ms-project would suffice but definately not basecamp i find this ok for very small projects and small teams but anything larger and i think it falls down completely as a pm tool

299670
versioning	upgrade
unless i m changing the service s public interface i often deploy upgrade versioning of my services without even uninstaller reinstalling.

299702
soft-references	weak-references
the sun jre does treat soft-references differently from weak-references

299707
windows-xp	windows
windows server 2003 windows-xp and later os versions do not suffer that pain

299709
shell	bash
i set the windows environment variables for oracle_home and oracle_sid and was then able to run sqlplus in a cygwin bash shell using the net_service_name from tnsnames.ora

299711
javascript	dom
you can use the java libraries httpunit or htmlunit that can test the finished dom after being manipulated by javascript

299711
javascript	dom
both use the full-featured javascript engine mozilla rhino and then add their own dom implementations

299717
perl	php
it can also compress obfuscate javascript css code from your php asp.net perl jsp xslt file

299723
rollback	commit
i need to do transactions begin commit or rollback locks selected for updates

299729
internet-explorer	firefox
this all works fine in firefox safari and opera but i m getting an unspecified error in internet-explorer 6 and 7

299740
selected	button
then in the toolbars list selected menu bar then click the reset button

299743
silverlight	wpf
while this is possible using wpf via dynamic resources see this video and fast forward to 12 00 i don t think this is possible yet in silverlight

299748
multiplication	subtraction
a nice property of 31 is that the multiplication can be replaced by a shift and a subtraction for better performance

299752
difference	zero
in the two examples above there s no difference zero

299769
compact-framework	.net
i have plenty of experience with nunit and mbunit but i m new to .net compact-framework development and i d like to get off on the right foot

299769
compact-framework	.net
is there a prevailing unit testing framework for the .net compact-framework and if so what is it

299770
ms-access	oracle
i am trying to convert a working ms-access query to run on an oracle being accessed via vb script .asp

299771
unpivot	pivot
it looks like there are new operations that were include as part of sql-server 2005 called pivot and unpivot

299774
.net	wcf
in .net wcf appears to offer a way around the performance hit that chris mentions

299786
stretch	styles
by default its orientation is bound to the parent toolbar.orientation but you can override this and set its orientation to vertical with a styles and this will allow items to stretch horizontally

299808
authentication	login
when a request is made to an asp.net page requiring authentication asp.net redirects to the specified login page with supplying a returnurl querystring argument identifying the original requested page by default

299838
highlight	selected
when you selected a word it is highlight wherever else it shows up on the page so it is an implicit search which i find very very useful

299848
filesystems	fat
regarding the usb key generally usb keys use one of the fat family of filesystems

299848
administration	account
in that case if the account in windows at least it must be a domain account or similar just naming two account the same will not do it do not exist on the target computer only a user who can ignore filesystems permissions such as root on nix or administration on windows will be able to access the file

299849
firefox	safari
i see this behaviour on firefox for example not safari for what that s worth

299858
base-class	inherited
remember kids every time you overload a methods inherited from a base-class a little kitten starts crying

299866
minimum	max
you can fine tune your pool by playing with the minimum number of connections the max number of connections to be created and the timeout

299874
any	set
alternatively set a breakpoint on httpresponse.redirect string bool and follow the call stack - i doubt there s any other ways that the runtime uses to redirect a request

299886
push	pull
a bare copy that you can push pull from which your would push your changes when you re done and then you would clone this into you web directory and set up a cronjob to update git pull from your web directory every day or so

299894
filesystems	fat
as technophile said removable drives usually use fat filesystems so no permission info is copied at all

299913
python	java
so i m wondering how easy possible it is for a php script to call a java program or python script or a program or script in another language

299918
dictionary	arrays
another option is to read the contents of each recordset into a disconnected collection dictionary arrays etc so you can close the connection right away

299929
text-align	width
then we text-align center the element and give it a 100 width so that it is the size of .image_block

299931
triggers	insert
lastly i could create a triggers that is called after updates deletes insert

299945
webforms	asp.net
drag and drop is more suited to standard asp.net webforms not mvc

299948
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
subclassing uicontrol and implements the touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended methods

299951
contains	any
html can contains nested tags to any arbitrary depth so it s not a regular language

299951
.when	ready
be ready to scrap the regular expression solution .when the parsing requirements expand

299951
markup	xhtml
xsl and dom are two standard technologies designed to work with xml or xhtml markup

299972
export	report
i have a simple report that i want to export to a csv file

299972
export	csv
the problem is when i export to csv format the total row for a grouping is listed in front of every record

299972
export	csv
if i export to excel and then save as a csv file the total row is where it belongs

299972
export	csv
it would be easy enough to write a macros to clean up the spread sheet and export as a csv file for my end users

299984
transactional	audit-trail
look at this as the equivalent of an audit-trail in an account application - this is the journal - a single table with every transactional recorded

299992
silverlight	wpf
i know that this is possible with wpf using myassembly.visualstudio.design.dll but i haven t been able to find info on doing this with silverlight
