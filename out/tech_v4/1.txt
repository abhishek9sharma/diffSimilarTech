javascript	dom
i understand how javascript is run and i think i understand most of the dom but i ve no idea about animation

10048
javascript	dom
interestingly enough you program silverlight with javascript and that would be the major benefit to simply upgrading to a faster and more dynamic dom that is implemented in silverlight but still writing the same code

10048
scriptaculous	jquery
for simple javascript animations look at jquery or scriptaculous

10061
bluetooth	usb
i d like to be able to do this with the gps hooked up to a laptop by bluetooth or even just a usb cable

10061
push	pull
bonus points if you can show me some examples of using an api to push and pull data to and from the gps

10062
haskell	ocaml
so you might want to learn haskell ocaml or another functional language

10083
put	get
for these last ones i could always put .bat files on my path but that s going to get old fast.

10098
webforms	asp.net
i m getting into more of a tdd workflow and have a mix of mvc and asp.net webforms apps

10106
uniq	grep
unxutils for ls rm grep uniq sort .

10115
unit-testing	assertions
several years ago we made it policy to use assertions at all levels of our software and this - along with unit-testing code reviews etc

10139
lgpl	gpl
it s licensed under the gpl rather than lgpl

10146
entity-relationship	diagram
i currently use toad data modelentity-relationship i ve been using their beta cycles for a while now free and little to no bugs and they have a great html documentation tool that provides eventity-relationshipything including entity-relationship diagram

10149
elisp	lisp
also i m comfortable with lisp but not super familiar with elisp

10155
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i don t think there s any reason that i would choose one framework for webforms and another for asp.net-mvc

10157
progress-bar	progress
you can then keep checking the iasyncresult until the update is complete querying the update object for its progress after every check because you can t have the other thread update the progress-bar user-interface then calling application.doevents

10282
order	add
filtering your rows and use the row_number function to add row numbers in the order you want

10292
required	checked
you can change the maximum number of thread-pooled threads in code at runtime so there s nothing to stop you checked the current vs maximum number and upping the maximum if required

10293
ruby	php
has anyone used jaxer in a production environment i am curious as to how it holds up compared to something like php ruby etc

10324
binary	hex
in c what is the most efficient way to convert a string of hex digits into a binary unsigned int or unsigned long

10366
safari	opera
this works great in ie7 not at all in every other browser i ve tried ff2 ff3 opera 9.5 safari

10366
function-call	inline
using inline javascript instead of a function-call

10412
export	report
i have a project where i would like to generate a report export in ms-word format

10416
textmate	gedit
textmate is a great editor and there is a way to replicate some of the functionality in gedit

10416
textmate	gedit
check the article out here to modify gedit to behave like textmate

10478
firefox	safari
ideally i d like some function that can return the currently selected text in the browser windows that works in ie7 and 6 if possible firefox 2 3 and safari 2

10513
contains	any
it means that your domain model is pure and contains zero references to any type of persistance file i o database etc

10528
macports	fink
it s also available through macports and fink

10532
postgresql	mysql
i ve been using php mysql for ages and am about to start using postgresql instead

10536
common-lisp	lisp
nathan i ve upmodded the common-lisp links because you asked about lisp especially with reference to emacs lisp

10536
common-lisp	scheme
however common-lisp is very different from scheme

10536
common-lisp	scheme
as you mentioned sicp is for learning scheme not lisp or at least not common-lisp and not emacs lisp

10536
common-lisp	lisp
there are some overlap in principles however you can t simply cut and paste code from sicp and expect it to run on any common-lisp or emacs lisp system

10539
titlebar	icons
without the icons the only methods i could imagine for users to access the system menu is via right-click of the titlebar

10558
python	ruby
the easiest to get started with according to most people are python and ruby

10563
32-bit	64bit
on the other hand unlike the scheme version i posted this version only works for 32-bit and 64bit numbers

10586
document	element
obviously i could write a big switch statement with a case for every possible type of element which can occur in an xml document and just write it back out again but it seems like a lot of trouble for something which seems like it should be simple

10587
reflection	runtime
the short answer is that early or static binding refers to compile time binding and late or dynamic binding refers to runtime binding for example when you use reflection

10589
decimal	hex
is 35f a decimal number and an f or is it the hex value 0x35f

10616
sql-server	mysql
what are some of the main differences between mysql and sql-server

10623
sql-server	mysql
one thing you have to watch out for is the fairly severe differences in the way sql-server and mysql implement the sql syntax

10634
cruisecontrol.net	mbunit
i currently use nant ccnet cruisecontrol.net svn mbunit

10634
msbuild	nant
update any compelling features that would cause me to shift from nant to msbuild

10639
msbuild	nant
i feel that msbuild and nant are fairly comparable

10645
msbuild	nant
i use msbuild alongside nant because the current version of nant can t as yet compile .net 3.5 applications same was true when .net 2.0 first came out

10657
build-server	msbuild
the only reason i can see for using msbuild is if you would like to use a automated build-server like cruise control

10684
solaris	sunos
it no longer occurs in solaris sunos 5

10714
processor	cpu
the asp.net worked thread afaik doesn t come from the thread pool and shouldn t get affected by your call to the remoting service unless this is a very slow processor and your remoting function is very cpu intensive - in which case everything on your computer will be affected

10737
build-process	msbuild
if you start using msbuild and you want to do more custom things in your build-process get the msbuild community tasks

10748
cvs	git
i ve used rcs cvs sccs sourcesafe vault perforce subversion and git

10779
sysadmin	root
you cannot completely protect a stored password against a determined sysadmin with root access so there s not really any need to try

10809
gridview	listview
listview much better than the gridview dataview in that they let you write out clean html

10846
elementtree	lxml
i ve also use lxml and pyxml and i find elementtree nice because it s a standard module

10898
authentication	login
it s important that the linked server work whether we are using a windows authentication account to login to sql-server or a sql-server login

10904
silverlight	wpf
wpf is the future of smart clients in .net and the skills you pick up you ll be able to reuse if you want to make browser-hosted silverlight applications

10926
filtering	sorting
filtering and sorting are the main reason

10933
python	java
most of the tools i ve seen are based on php java python etc

10956
extends	sealed
if the class isn t sealed you can create a harness for it by extends it and then exposing all your internals within the child class

10990
webserver	upload
i have been told that this folder needs to be owned by the webserver user for the upload process to work so i created the folder and then set permissions as such

10990
webserver	upload
is there a permission setting that will allow me to still upload files and then modify them later as a user other than the webserver user

10996
populate	row
then create a second class that inherits from the basedetail class that has the additional parent plan object so you can create a basedetail class when you want to just create a detail row and assign the planid to it but if you need to populate a full detail record with the parent plan object you can use the inherited detail class

11014
constructor	object
if the object is on the stack then you might be able to assert within the constructor that the value of this is always close to stack pointer

11034
versioning	upgrade
definitely upgrade to tfs 2008 and visual-studio 2008 as it is the v2 versioning of team system in every way

11053
order	join
for example and i m not the architect on this db so bear with me it can take 7 join in order to get a clean and complete record back which include a person s name address phone number and company affiliation

11060
python	c++
i have developed a code-generator that takes our python interface to our c++ code generated via swig and generates code needed to expose this as webservices

11091
environment	building
obviously this requires that you get perl from one source or another which adds overhead to your building environment setup

11101
negative-number	short
when reading any single value from the arrays copy it into something like a short or an int and manually convert the negative-number into the positive value it should be

11122
administration	account
for azman with asp.net turn on impersonation in web-config and make sure with an ad administration that the impersonation account has reader permissions on the azman store

11141
value	field
if time has not expired and a request for the data is done the stored value in the field are returned

11163
mstest	nunit
nunit mstest ect all do pretty mutch the same thing

11197
javascript	dom
since setting the properties with javascript never seemed to work but setting using firebug s inspect did i started to suspect that the javascript id selector was broken - maybe there were multiple items in the dom with the same id

11201
execute	prepare
what i d probably do is just prepare several queries and execute the right one depending on what i ended up needing

11257
instrumentation	trace
setting up this logging may be a small hassle but for us it paid huge dividends in the long run especially with the device in live use we can get real data instrumentation stack trace from exceptions etc

11278
licensing	platform
we actually roll our own licensing since it is easily portable across platform and we can send people new license keys which extend their trial

11288
filtering	sorting
so wpf doesn t support standard sorting or filtering behavior for views of compositecollections so what would be a best practice for solving this problem

11288
filtering	sorting
i d get all the default view sorting and filtering behavior on my new composite object collection and i d be able to put a data template on it to display my list items properly depending on which type is actually stored in that composite item

11301
reflection	runtime
if you can t predict at this moment how people will sort and filtering your object collection then you should look at system.linq.expressions namespace to build your lambda expressions on demand during runtime first you let user to build expression then compile run and at the end you use reflection namespace to enumerate through results

11305
vba	vb6
i m a newbie when it comes to xml since i m stuck in vb6 and vba because of the field i work in

11312
nsresponder	nstextview
note that this is an inherited nsresponder methods not a nstextview methods

11359
windows-server	windows
edit to clarify i would like to run this software on a windows machine and monitor a remote windows-server for cpu memory etc

11373
configuration	environment
tns_admin is an environment variables that points to the directory where the sql .net configuration files like sql.net.ora and tnsnames.ora are located

11425
typename	typedef
the typename a in the definition of binds to the typedef name defined in the global namespace scope not to the typedef name defined in the base-class

11443
python	c++
it s certainly more work but you probably need to bite the bullet and set up an end-to-end regression test suite fixed c++ files - swig interfaces - python modules - known output

11443
python	c++
you really want to check the known input fixed c++ code against expected output what comes out of the final python program

11471
filtering	sorting
i m not yet very familiar with wpf but i see this as a question about sorting and filtering collections

11516
user-controls	treeview
iâ m creating a user-controls for a rich treeview one that has context menus for renaming nodes adding child nodes etc.

11592
chain-of-responsibility	visitor
yes factory chain-of-responsibility command proxy visitor and observers among others are in use in a codebase i work with daily

11615
entity-relationship	diagram
thentity-relationshipe s a lot of hentity-relationshipe s normalization hentity-relationshipe s entity-relationship diagram have at it but not much in the way of real examples

11639
communication	messages
messages â an abstract typed definition of the data being communication

11664
anjuta	gnome
anjuta for gtk gnome

11664
kdevelop	kde
kdevelop or quanta for kde

11683
moss	wss
there is no way you can have a moss 2007 wss 3.0 development for free but a microsoft action pact is so cheap to get

11714
build-process	msbuild
build tool msbuild - you ll want to customize the build-process and learning msbuild is the best way to do this

11714
ndepend	fxcop
static code analysis ndepend fxcop others

11766
adplus	dump
microsoft also has a newer tool to assist with generating crash dump to replace adplus called debugdiag

11770
webforms	asp.net
it s not really an issue if you re using asp.net stack webforms mvc or rolling your own because all your aspx files get compiled and therefore not touched by webserver

11819
ubuntu-server	linux
i have warehouse installed on a linux machine running the ubuntu-server edition nginx for the http server and mongrel cluster

11820
binary	hex
are the bytes stored in base 10 hex or binary characters

11834
traffic	packets
for example if it s compressed the data block of the packets shouldn t be readable as plain text...however if it s uncompressed you will just see plain old xml text...like you would see with http traffic or even ftp in certain cases

11857
put	get
i would like to gauge what solutions other people put in place to get team system functionality

11873
sql-server	mysql
this shouldn t be too hard if the backing store is sql-server or even mysql as they have built in support for row numbering

11873
any	set
despite this you should be able to avoid doing any session management on the server avoid any explicit caching of the result set and just rely on the backing store s caching to keep your life simple

11902
python	c++
for example we have a server written in pure python which is replacing a server written in c a client written in c++ gsoap and a client written in cocoa objective-c

11917
continuous-integration	teamcity
i use visualsvn server for source control mingle for project management and bug tracking and teamcity for continuous-integration

11920
base-class	inherited
inherited off the abstract base-class

11923
deep-copy	object
moreover a deep-copy is required to serialize an object and have it restored exactly

11964
virtual-machine	vmware
i want to be able to make a new virtual-machine from my own licensed copies of windows for that vmware is kind of expensive

11970
vmware	esx
i ve only had experience with vmware esx and while it s a fairly expensive product it is also very powerful

11973
opensolaris	linux
it s free open source and it runs on windows linux macintosh and opensolaris

11994
getter	setter
all properties do is give you a concise syntax for specifying both the getter and setter in a single line and allow you to synthesize their implementation

11994
getter	setter
that s generally a good pattern with properties only ever touch the underlying instance-variables for a property in initializers in -dealloc and in the getter and setter for the property

12011
configuration	logging
it s pretty customizable and has a pretty good interface for updating your web.config for the configuration of the logging

12047
.net	wcf
if your on windows platform with .net 3 take look at wwf wcf as this can help in webservice to webservice - lots more in the acutal platform now for all these concerns without the overhead of biztalk and others

12051
base-class	inherited
if i inherit from a base-class and want to pass something from the constructor of the inherited class to the constructor of the base-class how do i do that

12064
cross-compiling	scons
scons is a cross-platform cross-compiling build library uses python scruipting for the build systems

12064
build-system	qmake
if you re using qt qmake is a nice build-system too

12066
deployment	install
you might consider using clickonce deployment which makes it very easy to add bootstrapping the .net 2.0 3.0 and or 3.5 redistributable install into your application

12087
safari	opera
there are various workarounds at the moment but they re different between ie and fx i don t know about safari opera etc

12093
ienumerator	ienumerable
every time you use yield you get a whole new class that implements both ienumerable and ienumerator clever optimisation unreadable code

12095
progress-bar	progress
the importprogressevent args carries a string message a max int value for the progress-bar and an current progress int value

12140
any	set
this works better in any case much better than having all those objects need some global settings object --- that of course effectively makes unit-testing impossible disadvantage can be that you sometimes need to set a dozen of properties or that you need to let those properties percolate into sub-objects

12144
json	xml
at the moment every application we distribute is using it s own ad-hoc configuration files whether it s property files ini style xml or json internal use only at the moment

12144
solaris	linux
edit really needs to be a cross platform solution linux windows solaris etc

12167
python	ruby
i m not sure that this is the best way to do it but when i m deploying ruby gui apps not python but has the same problem as far as .exe s are concerned on windows i just write a short launcher in c# that calls on my main script

12176
revision	svn
is there any way to include the svn repository revision number in the version string of a .net assembly

12184
json	xml
there s nothing wrong with xml it s reasonably human readable as much as yaml or json or ini files are but remember its intent is to be read by machines

12225
value	field
how can i have the mee field pre-populate with the database value when the data is shown on the page

12227
updating	updates
well anyways a user came to me needing an updates done to our contact database batch updating a bunch of facilities

12246
variables	boolean
to be clear i wanted to know if it was safe to have concurrent threads read and write to a boolean field without any explicit synchronization code is accessing a boolean or other primitive-typed variables atomic

12248
put	get
and with the now very small amount of application specfic code they get put into company.applications.applicationname this helps me really think about business objects a lot more since i dont want too much within this namespace so i come up with more flexible designs

12258
contains	any
a dto is a simple object that doesn t contains any business logic

12280
rollback	commit
lesson learned use transaction commit and rollback

12287
json	xml
xml json ini

12313
environment	building
nant is far far easier to set up your building to do automatic testing deploy to multiple production environments integrate with cruisecontrol for an entry environment integrate with source control

12313
msbuild	nant
we ve gone through so much pain with tfs msbuild using tfsdeployer custom powershell scripting etc to get it to do what we were able to do with nant out of the box

12317
msbuild	nant
the main reason i still use nant over msbuild for my automated builds is that i have more granular control on my builds

12317
msbuild	nant
however i do use both nant and msbuild in conjunction for some build tasks like building wpf applications

12317
msbuild	nant
it is just a lot easier to compile a wpf application with the msbuild target within nant

12349
directory	folder
i didn t reinstall php i just copied all of the dlls in the extjs folder to my php extjsensions folder as specified in the extjsension_dir variables in php.ini and i copied the versions of libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll from the php download into my system32 directory

12353
atexit	main
it is also responsible of calling any code that should run after main like atexit

12358
key-value	key
typically the key-value table starts off as string to string but helper functions in the object do things such datetime getconfigdate string key etc.

12408
stderr	stdout
as others have said this entry point will not be main but will instead be a part of the runtime library - it will do things like initialising static objects setting up the argc argv parameters setting up stdin stdout stderr etc

12409
versioning	migrate
then for each candidate release you start with the previous versioning migrate using your release procedures which will give those a good testing as a side-effect and run your timings

12412
shell	bash
bash is the better interactive shell in my opinion.

12468
managed-code	native-code
that s true for managed-code or native-code obfuscated or not

12489
directory	folder
how do you scan a directory for folder and files in c

12513
linux	osx
under linux osx use the opendir readdir closedir functions

12537
latex	tex
i m looking for software such ms-word wiki tex latex lyx and for automated tools

12538
tokenize	parsing
string tokenize + ll 1 parsing will give you an expression tree.

12538
subtraction	addition
the polymorphism way might involve an abstract arithmetic class with an evaluate a b function which is overridden for each of the operators involved addition subtraction etc to return the appropriate value and the tree contains integers and arithmetic operators which can be evaluated by a post

12543
javadoc	doxygen
for development documentation specifically api docs tools like javadoc and doxygen are used a lot

12543
latex	tex
i don t see tex or latex used much outside of academic or research communities

12553
cvs	git
but more importantly it s plain text which means it s really easy to manage with our vcs cvs svn git etc. and it can easily live right there with the code -- so there s no excuse for not updating the documentation as you develop

12557
perl	php
lastly lists are not hashable so the type of mapping done with dictionaries hash tables in perl associative arrays in php must be done with tuples

12559
configuration	installation
now we keep local copies of the installation and configuration files

12561
keyboard	mouse
though they re mostly targeted at automating administration tasks or shortcuts for users autohotkey and autoit let you automate nearly anything you want as far as mouse keyboard interaction

12561
click	mouse
some of the mouse stuff can get tricky when the only way to really tell it what you want to click is an x y coordinate but for automating entirely arbitrary tasks on a windows machine it does the trick

12638
sql-server	ms-access
so basically i m building an app for my company and it needs to be built using ms-access and it needs to be built on sql-server

12642
webserver	upload
i am trying to upload a file or stream of data to our webserver and i cant find a decent way of doing this

12642
webrequest	webclient
i have tried both webclient and webrequest both have their problems

12662
multiple-file-upload	multiple-files
i need to use silverlight as i need want to upload multiple-files and html does not allow for a multiple-file-upload

12671
button	popup
when the button is clicked the modal popup opens but the button_click event is never fired so the modal doesn t get its session data

12671
checkbox	button
since the two pages are separate i can t call the modalpopupextender from the aspx.cs code i can t reach the list of checkbox from the ascx.cs code and i don t see a way to populate my session variables and then programmatically activate some other hidden button or control which will then open my modal popup

12700
hide	show
the modalpopupextender uses javascript and dhtml to show and hide the controls in the user-controls client-side

12703
yaml	ini
but for something more complex like server configuration an ini file would be a huge pain to maintain and something more structural like xml or yaml would be better

12712
web-config	app-config
you can change the settings for the reader quotas and such in the web-config app-config or you can set it on a binding instance in code

12715
datalist	listview
if you want something with more flexibility in appearance the datalist and listview controls also have built-in support for editing inserting or deleting fields as well

12716
put	get
some google research indicates i could #import mscorlib.tlb or put it in path but i can t get that to compile either

12728
deployment	install
you ll want to setup launch condition in your deployment project to make sure version 2.0 sp1 is install

12730
administration	account
the only thing i can currently think of is the following make sure you re running under an administration account

12731
authentication	login
pick with windows nt authentication using the network login id

12731
triggers	insert
open the table in access and modify one of the entries the triggers doesn t fire on insert just update

12732
imagemagick	phpthumb
phpthumb uses imagemagick whenever possible for speed falling back to gd if necessary and seems to cache pretty well to reduce the load on the server

12762
contains	set
contains the details of how to set it up

12762
visualsvn-server	collabnet
but as others have said there are now more friendly packages contains the svn stuff - visualsvn-server so badly named it makes me weep and the collabnet distribution - the later is apache only and is hand rolled on the thighs of virgins which means that it always seems to appear about three weeks later than everyone else

12788
webforms	asp.net
the asp.net mvc framework is an alternative to the normal webforms way of doing asp.net development

12789
webforms	asp.net
we used asp.net webforms on the microsoft pdc site and have kept the html pretty clean - the viewstate could probably be disabled on most pages although in reality it s only a few dozen bytes

12820
updating	updates
linq in .net also greatly simplifies updates by keeping a datacontext of any changes you have made and only updating the fields which you change

12821
any	set
i would be creating each and every instance of an event in a table and this table would be regenerated every month so any event that was set to reoccurr forever would be regenerated one month in advance using a windows service or maybe at the sql-server level

12826
solaris	aix
if the gnu version of date works for you why don t you grab the source and compile it on aix and solaris

12845
ports	dmz
if you re going to do this spend a bit of money and at the least buy a dedicated router firewall with a separate dmz ports

12854
value	field
if i recall correctly you cannot insert a null value to a field only dbnull

12893
children	nodes
the binary nodes add minus mul div these have two children a left and right side

12893
children	nodes
a nodes to hold a value val no children nodess just a numeric value

12896
pecl	pear
and before i get pointed at pear pecl i need actual code

12910
mouseover	mouseout
for instance if you change enter and leave to mouseover and mouseout your events fire with no problem

12928
pascal	delphi
in pascal delphi

12937
haskell	lisp
imperative languages like java and c# solve a certain set of problems pretty well but it also helps to think in a functional manner sometimes such as with haskell and lisp

12941
contains	lookup
you could build grouping objects that each contains a set of schedule strings one for each season but if all the grouping object does is provide lookup functionality then you ve reinvented the lookup table in a much less intuitive fashion

12956
checkbox	button
it also extracts the text and control type information button checkbox etc. as well as other meta information

12961
jvisualvm	visualvm
it s also worth noting that starting with jdk 1.6 update 7 there is now a bundled profiling called visualvm which can be launched with jvisualvm

12965
contains	any
hstring always starts at the beginning of a line and doesn t contains any white space or colons

13002
json	xml
the only other time i consume webservices outside of .net was in javascript but now i only use json responses instead of xml webservice responses

13050
revision	svn
for simplicity tortoise svn gives a basic revision graph

13056
primitive	int
for example in java you may need to convert an int value into an integer boxing if you want to store it in a collection because primitive can t be stored in a collection only objects

13100
ref	out
using out or ref passes a reference to the variables specified in the call to the function

13100
ref	out
any changes to the value of an out or ref parameter will be passed back to the caller

13100
ref	out
both out and ref behave identically except for one slight difference ref parameters are required to be initializer before calling while out parameters can be uninitializer

13100
ref	out
by extension ref parameters are guaranteed to be initializer at the start of the methods while out parameters are treated as uninitializer

13100
ref	out
edit as dp points out the difference between out and ref is only enforced by the c# compiler not by the clr

13100
ref	out
as far as i know vb has no equivalent for out and implements ref as byref only matching the support of the clr

13105
ref	out
the clr does not distinguish between between out and ref

13105
ref	out
this means that you cannot have two methods whose signatures differ only by an out or ref

13109
arrays	map
in php i often need to map a variable using an arrays .

13123
mbunit	nunit
i think you can do this with the row test attributes available in mbunit and later versions of nunit where you could specify several sets to populate one unit test

13130
keydown	keyup
even if you capture the keydown keyup event those are the only events that the tab key fires you still need some way to prevent the default action moving to the next item in the tab order from occurring

13140
linux	unix
check out or lookup the man pages on any linux box or through google e.g unix man ar

13200
bug-tracking	fogbugz
i use cruisecontrol.rb for codeigniter and fogbugz for bug-tracking but the more general the answers the better

13204
command-line	cmd
yet if i run the cron cmd directly from the cmd-line it works perfectly

13216
lookup	any
it won t take any longer at least not significant to lookup a product by unique name than numeric id as long as the column is indexed

13258
contains	set
the msbuild that we run for continuous-integration automatically changes the build number for us so the resulting build zip file contains a properly versioned set of dlls and executable

13275
value	field
the general difference is that a reference-type lives on the heap and a value type lives inline that is wherever it is your variables or field is defined

13275
pointers	stack
variables value type lives on the stack reference-type lives on the stack as a pointers to somewhere in heap memory where the actual memory lives though note eric lipperts article series the stack is an implementation detail .

13277
testng	junit
testing - junit testng

13277
bamboo	hudson
there are also bamboo plugins for findbugs pmd and checkstyle but as noted the free hudson codeigniter server has those too

13352
versioning	migrate
you get easy versioning - if one client wants to stay on software version 1.0 and another wants 2.0 where 1.0 and 2.0 use different database schema there s no problem - you can migrate one without having to pull them out of one database

13352
contains	any
there is never any complexity from the but the database also contains other clients issue

13355
dialog	pop-up
it s annoying when i drag a windows to another monitor and then if the application generates a pop-up dialog or spawns another windows if that pop-up dialog gets displayed back on the primary monitor

13358
value	field
we made the enter key function like the tab key where the enter key would save the value in a text field and advance the cursor to the next field

13359
localization	translation
there is no way you should be doing this and i see this as a fault in your translation process i am an ex-localization engineer and ex-developer of localization tools

13376
eventargs	winforms
all of the winforms focus events gotfocus lostfocus enter leave are called with empty eventargs parameters which will not give you any additional information

13403
contains	elements
lastly if you want to return a new arrays contains the results of the processing of those elements greater than 3

13430
any	set
a quick google did not turn up any instructions for getting it running on iis 7.0 so i was wondering if anyone had experience getting this set up

13435
for-loop	arrays
the increment in the original foreach loop will not affect the contents of the arrays the only way to do this remains a for-loop

13454
python	php
i wrote a piece of code to convert php s striplashes into valid python backslash escapes

13460
any	set
no trunk branch or any of that. if there is a recommended way to set up source control systems what are they

13463
.when	ready
you can commit create branches and work pretty much as though you were all alone and then .when you re ready to push up your changes you can promote them from your machine to the master copy

13473
contains	elements
the outcome is an arrays contains elements indexes

13488
punctuation	comma
the final character class makes sure that if an url is part of some text punctuation such as a comma or full stop after the url is not interpreter as part of the url

13490
environment	building
under source control and then my building deploy system renames them automatically as it deploys to various environment

13495
masstransit	nservicebus
of course wcf can do async messaging using msmq bindings but a tool like nservicebus or masstransit will give you a very simple send receive or pub sub api that will make your requirement a very straightforward job

13541
factors	numeric
it s like having the cake and eating it too the speed factors is there since when using the enter key no unnecessary tabing must be done to get to the correct field and using the enter key next to the numeric keyboard makes it really smooth

13550
python	ruby
i think its good to use these kind of solutions to speed up things but i wonder why aren t these programs as popular as vs.net j2ee ruby python etc

13562
carbon	cocoa
if the path came from the stock mac os x frameworks for example an open panel whether carbon or cocoa you won t need to do any conversion on it and will be able to use it as-is

13577
zend-framework	codeigniter
have a look at the zend-framework too it has the benefit of being php 5 whereas codeigniter is still php 4 as i understand it

13580
user-controls	ascx
i m using asp.net-mvc components which replaced ascx user-controls in preview 4

13582
cakephp	drupal
one was written in cakephp and the other was written using drupal

13590
scriptaculous	jquery
if all you need is a sortable list then a simple scriptaculous list or jquery list with a quick webmethod callback should fit the bill quite nicely and you can obviously stick this into your own user control

13594
internet-explorer	firefox
firefox and opera ignore the o and set the max length to 2 while internet-explorer ignores the field altogether

13605
python	java
for example the first thing python does when it sees source code is compile it into a bytecode representation essentially the same as what java does when compiling class files

13605
python	java
there s no reason why somebody couldn t write a just-in-time jit compiler for python along the lines of what java and .net already do to further increase the performance

13627
ironpython	ironruby
so from jython and jruby you can easily access java code and from ironpython and ironruby you can easily access .net code

13643
smalltalk	lisp
the last twenty years of evolution in interpreter can be seen as going the other way - polymorphism eg naive smalltalk metacircular interpreter to function pointers naive lisp implementations threaded code c++ to switch naive byte code interpreter and then onwards to jits and so on - which either require very big classes or in singly polymorphism languages double-dispatch which reduces the polymorphism to a type-case and you re back at stage one

13703
labview	matlab
it specifically looks at labview versus matlab as opposed to c

13704
webforms	asp.net
i m about to do a large migration of several websites from classic asp asp.net webforms to asp.net mvc and was wondering what kind of advice those of you with experience in both technologies have

13725
32-bit	64bit
are nsinteger and int the same width on 32-bit 64bit platforms

13730
32-bit	64bit
the two are simply defined as longs in 64bit and as ints in 32-bit

13779
any	set
you have to remove any event handler you ve set on the node before you remove it to avoid memory-leaks in ie

13809
versioning	upgrade
i m all for pushing users to upgrade to the newest available versioning of ie since problems improve with every release however i m also against telling people to upgrade or change their browsers

13809
versioning	upgrade
unless of course you re developing an internal application then i d say everyone should upgrade to the newest available versioning

13817
benchmarking	profiling
also it provides a profiling that will benchmarking your code and provide pie-charts execution time etc

13851
firefox	opera
in opera and firefox the header and the menu are neatly attached to eachother

13851
margins	padding
i have tried explicitly defining padding and margins on the img however it does not work

13858
boolean	int
i particularly like bool bool ebool boolean bool int conversions

13860
margins	padding
rather than hunting down the specific behavior try sanity checking by explicity setting padding and margins properties for img div etc selectors to 0 set border-style none border-width 0px border 0 etc

13868
margins	padding
they reset padding margins and other display properties on a lot of html elements to minimize the display difference

13918
onkeydown	onkeyup
you can do this by adding onkeyup onkeydown etc

13944
configuration	environment
i don t have an environment setup to test right now but i m guessing something went wrong with the configuration

13981
interpreter	runtime
i understand that the ruby 1.8 ast is traversed at runtime using a big switch statement and many things like calling a methods in a class or parent module involve the interpreter looking up and down the tree as it goes

14033
any	set
the problem with unit-testing any kind of data-related programming is that you have to have a reliable set of test data to start with

14118
messenger	bots
i m writing my first perl app -- an aol instant messenger bots that talks to an arduino microcontroller which in turn controls a servo that will push the power button on our sysadmin s server which freezes randomly every 28 hours or so

14135
sftp	ftp
i want to want the checked in files to be uploaded into the server via ftp and as they get use to subversion via sftp

14192
markup	xhtml
when serving as text html whether you use xhtml markup or html markup it s treated by browsers as html

14192
markup	xhtml
of course if you want to use xhtml 1.0 markup and conform to xhtml 1.0 then you shouldn t use

14194
firefox	safari
i would launch with it working in firefox ie7 and safari and look at who goes to your site

14247
actionscript	mxml
i ve gathered that you can t have it both ways -- that is to say have the class functionality in a separate actionscript class file but have the contained elements declared in mxml

14259
required	checked
here you checked customer mandated properties that are required by your systemd

14261
actionscript	mxml
if you write your own reusable components then writing them in actionscript may sometimes give you a little more control but for non-reusable views mxml is much better

14261
actionscript	mxml
this is what makes manual bindings in actionscript a little less convenient than those in mxml

14261
getter-setter	setter
the currentemployee could be made into a getter-setter pair and implements like this only showing the setter

14270
click	mouse
i had a system that would record mouse click and locations and used this to manually generate a scripting which could be replayed to produce the same results

14308
sharing	share
for our first year we ve been using a server for sharing project files a plain windows machine with a network share

14313
execution	exit
you ll see that powershell.exe has a -noexit parameter which tells it not to exit after execution a startup command

14314
zipfile	archive
to access the contents of a zip file you have to unzip it although the zipfile package makes this fairly easy as you can unzip each file within an archive individually

14346
glut	glu
this links your program with the glut glu and opengl libraries

14375
repository	entity
i m using repository pattern with linq have irepository.deleteonsubmit t entity

14379
freeglut	glut
but later implementations of glut like freeglut do

14410
emacs	vim
pretty much every other editor that isn t a vi descendant vim cream vi-emu seems to use the emacs shortcuts ctrl + w to delete back a word and so on

14424
put	get
i ve used it a couple of times to get some decent looking class diagrams to put in presentations blogposts etc

14448
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
obfuscation tries to make the reverse-engineering to be harder cost more money than development and for some types of algorithems it succeeds

14462
32-bit	64bit
the 64bit jit is different from the one for 32-bit so i would expect some difference in the output - but i wouldn t switch to 64bit just for that and i wouldn t expect to gain much speed if any in cpu time by switching to 64bit

14462
32-bit	64bit
int64 already works on both 32-bit and 64bit systems but it ll be faster running on 64bit

14467
enterprise-architect	visual-paradigm
about the tools at work i use enterprise-architect but personally i find visual-paradigm for uml a better choice

14479
nsthread	cocoa
nsthread is part of the cocoa api and as such documented over at apple including the particular method + detachnewthreadselector totarget withobject i d link there but apparently stackoverflow has bugs with parsing it

14515
order	add
we use nunitlite although i think we did have had to add some code to it in order for it to work

14582
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
i understand that subversion has it origins in the case-sensitive world of nix but is there any way to control this behavior in either subversion or tortoisesvn to be file name case-insensitive when used with windows

14597
latex	tex
i edit a lot of documents in latex so i use svn to store the tex files and images and so on

14603
version-control	cvs
i m thinking svn and cvs aren t friendly enough to non-technical users but i m curious now as to the possibly uses for version-control for non-engineering projects.

14611
administration	account
when the account is created the administration can add some information like name and address

14617
sftp	ftps
i m trying to retrieve a file from a server using sftp as opposed to ftps using java

14630
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
this is due to the fact that files from subversion can be checked out on both case-sensitive filesystems nix and case-insensitive filesystems windows mac

14640
selectedindex	selecteditem
to set a default-value just add the item to the combobox s collection and set the selectedindex or selecteditem to that item

14640
checkbox	listbox
depending on how many options you are looking at you can use a listbox with the selectionmode property set to multisimple if it will be multiple choice or you could use the checkbox control

14674
environment	building
on a frequent basis people would mistakenly add a reference to an assembly in the wrong location which would mean it would work okay on their local environment but might break on someone else s or on the building machine

14717
profiling	trace
perhaps i could use the profiling and run a trace but this cluster is very heavily used and i m afraid i d be looking for a needle in a haystack

14718
manual	rcs
i personally use rcs for this type of thing - whilst it s got a manual aspect it s unlikely i want to push something to even the test server from my dev machine without testing it first

14756
administration	account
the local system account can see and print to them from a vb6 dll and administration can print just fine from the c# dll as you might expect

14781
windows-server	windows
i m experienced with the .net environment the clr and the associated windows stack including sql and windows-server

14819
gridview	listview
use the listview - it gives you the features of the gridview combined with the styling flexibility of a repeater

14862
environment	building
i ve used subversion for everything from source control building environment install scripting and all that developmenty goodness

14873
wordpress	blogs
i ve noticed that a few wordpress blogs have query statistics present in their footer that simply state the number of queries and the total time required to process them for the particular page reading something like

14893
put	get
get any necessary additional resources - mostly things like documents images and reports that are associated with the project and put into directory from step 5

14909
javascript	dom
anyone who writes client-side javascript is familiar with the dom - the tree structure that your browser references in memory generated from the html it got from the server

14909
javascript	dom
javascript can add remove and modify nodes on the dom tree to make changes to the page

14910
any	set
i have a real problem with coupling my build to the ide it ends up making it a real pain to set up build servers down the road since you have to go do a full vs install on any box that you want to build from in the future

14919
bazaar	git
i ll second eridius suggestion of git but i d expand it to the other drcs distributed revision control system such as mercurial and bazaar

14943
dialog	pop-up
i am using a form as a pop-up dialog to display a progress bar and i do not want the user to be able to close it

14968
getter	setter
i ve found using setter getter made my code easier to read

14980
protected	public
private fields with public or protected properties

15007
javascript	dom
there are lots of widgets provided by sites that are effectively bits of javascript that generate html through dom manipulation or document.write

15011
msbuild	nant
first get your code compiling with one step using an automated build program nant msbuild

15024
bug-tracking	fogbugz
for a one or two man team it s already been discussed on so that you can use fogbugz on demand but what other bug-tracking solutions exist for small teams

15026
web-deployment	web
web-deployment projects by microsoft for precompiling web site projects

15028
bugzilla	trac
4 bugzilla trac

15033
penetration-testing	security
i used to listen to pauldotcom security weekly but they talk an awful lot about penetration-testing and not so much about other aspects of computer security

15035
msbuild	nant
build automation nant msbuild rake maven

15035
continuous-integration	jenkins
continuous-integration cruisecontrol.net or continuum or jenkins

15035
bugzilla	trac
issue tracking trac bugzilla gemini if it must be .net and free-ish

15041
javascript	dom
but if the javascript code is actually calling dom methods and so on you re going to need a full-blown browser

15048
macros	let
let users add functionality to your .net applications with macros and plug-ins

15050
msbuild	nant
msbuild beats nant for .net 2 or 3.5

15072
redmine	trac
it s got trac redmine and subversion as well as several other unrelated ones

15091
smalltalk	lisp
technically ruby is more sophisticated than java or c# being closer to smalltalk in terms of oo purity and closer to lisp in terms of meta-programming facilities

15091
ruby	php
technically ruby on rails can scale just as well as java .net or php etc

15093
cursor	row
if you have a sql statement like the one above that may change data in more than one row you might want to include a cursor to update all records affected by the triggers

15095
macros	vba
i d say check the vba in the macros to see how it is doing it

15132
silverlight	wpf
if you re doing web development asp.net asp.net-mvc and silverlight nã e wpf e come to mind as relatively recent trends

15161
ncover	fxcop
checkout these articles on continuous-integration using msbuild cruisecontrol.net fxcop nunit ncover and subversion.

15177
directory	folder
if you re talking about scripting created by a user that will be run from that users crontab i typically put those in either a bin or scripting folder in the home-directory or if they re intended to be shared between users a usr local scripting directory

15187
ocaml	lisp
this could either take the form of bindings to the emacs extension api in some other language making ocaml a first-class emacs extension language or an emacs interaction mode where for example the extension has a pipe into which it can write emacs lisp expressions and read out result values

15195
software-quality	metrics
there s a lot of metrics and tools regarding software-quality code-coverage cyclomatic complexity coding guidelines and tools enforcing them etc.

15217
emacs	vim
if you were to build a new editor that fits this paradigm how would you improve on vi vim emacs

15217
emacs	vim
getting it right is hard enough competing agains the likes of vi vim emacs would be extremely tough -- most people who use these editors are die hard fans and you d have to give them a compelling reason to move to another editor

15234
firefox	safari
performance even though great progress has been made with firefox and safari

15243
dialog	pop-up
i am using a form as a pop-up dialog to display a progress bar and i do not want the user to be able to close it

15261
ubuntu	debian
on debian and ubuntu the defaults are 28800 mysql kills connections after 8 hours but maybe the default for your platform is different or whoever administrates the server has configured things differently

15274
font-size	width
i ve seen several sites set cookies based on user click to change font-size or page width and then have different css files applied based on the value of those cookies

15277
put	get
you can then put the re-usable sql code inside one of these or if you want to get really high tech you can use a library which does it for you

15296
python	ruby
they are working on a ruby implementation as well but the python version is way ahead and is actually ready for primetime

15310
export	report
in the case of ssrs report the console app generates the ssrs report and export them as pdfs via the ssrs web service api

15310
export	report
the odd thing is that this report will run render export if the report is run directly on the reporting server using the report manager

15310
export	report
export to pdf through the browser viewer in the report manager takes an additional 55 minutes

15316
children	tree
basically you ll do a tree search to find the spot x minutes ago then count the number of children on the nodes with newer times

15316
children	nodes
if you keep the number of children under the nodes up to date this sum can be done quickly

15323
data-access	nhibernate
it is not a competitor to nhibernate in fact using clsa business objects nhibernate as data-access fit really well together

15323
business-objects	data-access
lack of separation of concern generally your business-objects have data-access code inside them

15323
environment	building
i feel there are other technologies better suited to building applications in that environment

15349
selected	button
upon selected one of these button the program will notify the script where further events may occur

15362
fogbugz	trac
any of bugzilla trac or fogbugz will help you with your bug tracking and each offer an export feature so you can always change your mind later on

15401
perl	php
the last 4 chapters also gives a dedicated chapter to each of php .net perl and java

15412
principles	srp
an answer to a stack overflow question stated that a particular framework violated a plain and simple oop rule single responsibility principles srp

15412
principles	srp
now don t get me wrong - i believe srp to be the key to most good oo designs but i feel there are cases where this principles can and should be broken just like database-normalization rules

15412
principles	srp
i aggressively push the benefits of srp and the great majority of my code follows this principles

15432
principles	srp
srp is a software engineering principles that can apply to the role of a class or a function or a module

15448
perl	c++
i use eclipse for java visual studio for c++ c# and vb.net jellyfish pro for powerbasic i still use visual studio 6 for classic vb and i use textpad for perl python powershell vbscript sql html and batch files

15513
instrumentation	trace
if i had the source code for all the controls on the page i would just instrumentation them to trace out their render time

15514
value	field
so for example if the user starts to enter asdf into the date the field turns yellow and a popup error message appears saying the value entered is not valid

15578
32-bit	64bit
the main reason for me though is that i m always maxing out my memory and having a 64bit os allows me to go past the 4gb limit of 32-bit

15578
32-bit	64bit
but even if you don t get 64bit just buy 2 2gb ram cards anyways....you will be able to use most of it my system shows 3.5gb on 32-bit and then you ve got it for if you upgrade later and if your system has 4 slots you ll have room to expand to 8gb later on..

15583
lan	wan
all of my visio experience is with lan wan documentation

15627
object-oriented-database	db4o
one useful example is the guys who run db4o object-oriented-database

15633
revision	svn
when you want to mark a particular revision a release version then simply svn copy the project into the tags directory

15633
.when	ready
later you can svn-merge your branch back into the trunk .when it is ready for action

15635
solaris	linux
our company has about 20 developers all running windows xp vista and developing primarily for linux solaris

15672
protected	public
public protected private and static properties of classes all work roughly as expected

15674
revision	svn
when using subversion svn for source control with multiple projects i ve noticed that the revision number increases across all of my projects directories

15674
revision	updates
when i perform a commit to the trunk of the ninja program let s say i get that it has been updates to revision 7

15683
ubuntu	debian
this is my install scrpt i use it on debian servers but it will work in ubuntu ubuntu is built on debian

15712
perl	c++
there were some excellent suggestions already but i just wanted to mention that perl can also be called can call to c++

15732
xsd	xml
i m generating some xml files that needs to conform to an xsd file that was given to me

15737
python	ruby
you can write cocoa apps with python or ruby right in the ide

15741
xsd	xml
but then again validating xml against xsd files is a rather heavy weight problem

15746
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.0.1 gecko 2008070208 firefox 3.0.1 .net clr 3.5.30729

15783
entity-relationship	diagram
now you should think of designing the database entity-relationship diagram class-design dfds deployment etc

15793
sql-server	oracle
i actually wrote a handy tool that will convert oracle ddl to sql-server it worked 99.9 of the time

15803
attributes	properties
you need to decorate the listview properties with the designerserializationvisibility attributes like so

15808
messenger	skype
all sorts of background agents - skype messenger winamp etc

15810
directory	folder
you can set the build action copy to output directory property on individual files selected the file and hit f4 to open the properties windows to control what happens to them during build but not for folder

15838
any	set
the practice of programming be improved using any of c s native utilities if i set the i variables to be a register variables

15876
arrays	loops
if there is a known value at the end of the arrays null you can eliminate loops counter

15897
silverlight	wpf
those from liquidicity are specially useful for wpf or silverlight you can make an interface that even zoomed looks great

15902
png	ico
i like the free silk icons at famfamfam but they re png s and when i convert them to ico format they look pretty crappy

15928
onmouseover	onclick
either a library like jquery that has been mentioned or by modifying the suckerfish code to use onclick instead of onmouseover out

15940
integrated-security	active-directory
one problem with database triggers is that it leaves you no choice but to use integrated-security coupled with active-directory as access to your sql-server

15947
coldfusion	railo
there s a swiss company called railo who are currently in the process of releasing an open source coldfusion engine that is affiliated with jboss

15965
export	report
however we do offer export functionality for single report in the following formats

15965
configuration	installation
these partners deliver a number of professional services such as installation support training and advanced filtering and e-commerce configuration

15989
vertex-shader	shader
write a basic pass through vertex-shader shade however you desire in the pixels shader

16067
boost-python	python-sip
and how much of these potential problems are dealt with by libraries such as ctypes bgen swig boost-python cython or python-sip

16105
cvs	git
i would recommend you migrate from cvs to a proper distributed version control system such as git which will provide this sort of functionality very naturally

16110
selected	textbox
i have a user that want to be able to select a textbox and have the current text selected so that he doesn t have to highlight it all in order to change the contents

16155
methods	extend
normally in php when you extend something you can overwrite any methods contained therein right

16155
implements	extends
when i implements the ishipper interface i don t have to make the shipper object extends the vendor object that implementss the ivendor interface

16155
arrays	loops
each one has completely different methods for actually getting the shipping estimate but all the system needs to know is that they are a shipper and that the methods listed in the interface are callable on them so it can treat them all exactly the same and loops through them in a shippers arrays calling gettransitx to find the best shipper for a shipment

16186
wxpython	pyqt
one of the fastest ways is to use python with a gui binding like pyqt pyfltk tkinter wxpython or even via pygame which uses sdl

16215
switching	screens
i occasionally switching back to a monospace to disambiguate something but mostly find that a good clean sans-serif font is easiest to read and doesn t waste screens estate

16245
implements	extends
this allows you to both extends interfaces and also have a class that implements multiple interfaces both allowed and very useful in many cases without worrying about having to satisfy a particular constructor

16245
methods	extend
all shippers ups fedex etc now implement ishipper which extends ivendor and extend the abstract class shipper which has all common non-abstract methods for shippers defined in it getname getzip etc

16255
firefox	safari
safari and to a lesser extent firefox 3 have support for font-face in css which lets you use custom fonts

16272
event-log	logfile
personally i would log it to either a logfile or the event-log depending on the issue

16276
revision	svn
then set svn keywords id revision property on the file

16278
revision	updates
that said i personally don t see the problem with the revision numbers incrementing on every updates

16381
gethashcode	equals
gethashcode should be a lot quicker than equals but doesn t need to be unique

16400
webserver	security
i prefer this anyway because debugging with the integrated webserver can give you a very false impression of how your application will interact with the iis security model

16408
hash	md5
the md5 hash you re using has 128 bits with billions and billions of possible hash

16412
spaces	output
by the way it s a good thing that html browsers ignore white spaces in general it allows us to have clearly formatted source code without affecting the output

16449
string.format	stringbuilder
string.format uses a stringbuilder under the covers i believe so multiple concatenations are avoided

16480
contains	any
if it contains numbers or any other non-string things dates i d use string.format because it gives me more control over the formatting

16483
firefox	gecko
user-agent mozilla 5.0 ... gecko 2008070206 firefox 3.0.1

16483
firefox	gecko
user-agent mozilla 5.0 ... gecko 2008070206 firefox 3.0.1

16515
click	mouse
by breaking down each part into subvis we are able to reconfigure the tests with the click and drag of the mouse

16528
groovy	scala
and it supports lots of interesting and useful languages jython jruby scala groovy

16529
selected	checkbox
the builder maintains an internal data structure that represents the fields label options for selected checkbox radio mandatory status and the general sorting order of the fields

16534
firefox	gecko
update firefox behavior was changed for gecko 2.0 firefox 4 -- http content is now cached

16550
msbuild	nant
nant or msbuild which one to choose and when

16551
value	field
create your hidden field using javascript and set the value as needed

16551
json	xml
this would probably be the best solution if didn t want to deal with json xml at all

16558
msbuild	nant
generally speaking i get the impression that nant offers more flexibility compared to msbuild whereas with my relatively simple needs i ve been fine with the latter so far

16559
build-server	msbuild
we use msbuild because we started with visual-studio 2005 now visual-studio 2008 and msbuild was already built in to the sdk - there is less maintenance on the build-server

16564
msbuild	nant
we actually use a combination of nant and msbuild with cruisecontrol

16564
msbuild	nant
nant is used for scripting flow control and calls msbuild to compile projects

16568
database-agnostic	database-table
i m interested in learning some ideally database-agnostic ways of selecting the n th row from a database-table

16573
contains	elements
overriding the equals methods is necessary if you want to test equivalence in standard-library classes for example ensuring a java.util.set contains unique elements or using objects as keys in java.util.map objects

16581
msbuild	nant
i have used both msbuild and nant and i much prefer msbuild mainly because it requires a lot less configuration by default

16601
gethashcode	equals
you should never override equals gethashcode for mutable objects - this goes for .net and java both

16611
xsd	xml
i thought it would be a good idea to provide some form of schema document for the xml that i generate so i pasted the xml into visual-studio and got it to generate an xsd

16611
xsd	xml
the annoying thing is that my xml doesn t validate to the xsd that was generated

16630
radio-button	selected
selected the radio-button a redirection to a url enter the url for the new site and check the checkboxes for the exact url entered above a permanent redirection for this resource this second checkbox causes a 301 redirect instead of a 302 redirect

16643
expression	brackets
brackets expression

16648
buffering	streaming
i was going to say that i didn t think that silverlight 2 s httpwebrequest supported streaming because the request data gets buffering into memory entirely

16674
ruby-on-rails	django
the problems come if you want to use some other web language framework like ruby-on-rails or python django pylons

16714
value	field
if you need to assert for example that the value of the small element is less than the value of the big element or even more complex business rules involving multiple field you probably want schematron or a hybrid approach

16727
rewrite	rule
i thied it but i think i cannot access such parameter easely in a rewrite rule

16737
directory	folder
if you are referring to the folder the ide has as the current folder then you can just change the shortcut that launches delphi to set the current directory where ever you want it to be

16744
continuous-integration	teamcity
for build automation and continuous-integration take a look at teamcity from jetbrains

16757
hide	show
won t work if you have the form on the content page itself like you do now but you could show hide the link to the special submission page based on noscript

16777
postgresql	mysql
basically postgresql and mysql supports the non-standard

16793
internet-explorer	firefox
when you get to it in internet-explorer it will ask you if you want to debug and prompt you to choose a debugger from a list hopefully you will see visual-studio in that list both a new instance as well as your currently-running instance - if you are using firefox with firebug it will automatically stop execution on that line and you will be within the firebug debugger not visual-studio

16836
tortoisesvn	smartsvn
svn with smartsvn or tortoisesvn

16845
business-objects	crystal-reports
crystal-reports by business-objects seems to be a popular choice

16850
bazaar	git
i like mercurial other folks swear by git and bazaar

16853
gzip	zip
try the sharpziplib a c# based library for compressing and uncompressing files using gzip zip

16856
webrequest	webclient
as for downloading it you can use the standard webrequest or webclient classes in .net

16876
revision	svn
on one project we simply rolled the svn revision number into the product version number for all our releases and we never even tagged

16879
jquery	.post
in his coding horror .post secrets of the javascript ninjas jeff wrote about using jquery while writing stack overflow

16897
versioning	upgrade
actually we tried do upgrade do the new 2007 versioning

16897
midl	idl
additionaly the midl tool provided by microsoft didn t parsing correctly the idl files that we exported from delphi

16927
jquery	.post
zack yeap i have read that .post also and based off that .post so uses jquery as their javascript library

16948
revision	svn
if you want to be able to pull a specific revision out from the past usually an older tag i like being able to have everything i need come from the svn checkout

16953
command-line	cmd
does this happen when you run the javac cmd from the cmd-line

16963
gridview	formview
to me controls such as datagrid gridview formview etc

16971
increment	reset
how do i reset an increment identity s starting value in sql-server

16973
document	editing
when you start editing instance xml document and even editing xml schema you need on the fly validation against a schema and if possible autocomplete of attributes and elements

16978
value	field
i even created a custom datafieldcontrol that sets the field s header text and sort expression based on data field creates an insert row in the bottom and automatically collects the value in the row and forwards them to the data source s insert methods and generates a list box if an additional list data source is specified

16989
arrays	map
you ll need to remove the dups manually or just toss in some simple dup checking logic with a map or arrays or something

16991
solaris	linux
it should also be available on linux and optionally solaris

17024
webforms	asp.net
you don t want to use a webforms button in asp.net mvc

17024
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc is a completely different way of working and you no longer have the webforms abstraction

17056
contains	any
currently the query is using containstable but i have switched that with freetexttable contains and freetext without any noticeable difference in the results

17120
msbuild	nant
before leveraging cruisecontrol to it s fullest extent you need to create an automated build scripting that can be run by msbuild or nant

17132
arrays	map
so i would just create an arrays of glatlng s of every city from the geocoder and then draw them on the map

17171
expression	evaluation
iterators can also be used to implement other kinds of lazy evaluation where expression are evaluated only when you need it

17210
wmv	mp3
as it is silverlight only plays wmv and mp3 neither of which is simple legal

17233
grouping	sorting
yeah it s bloatware but you get a lot of functionality that wouldn t be much fun to re-invent sorting paging grouping column reordering inline editing templating server-side and client-side

17249
gnome	kde
kdevelop is a kde project but run on gnome

17249
anjuta	gnome
anjuta is an equivalent project on gnome but i find it unusable for real work

17260
perl	ruby
good code is good and bad code is bad - whether it is written as a bash script a windows cmd file in python ruby perl basic forth ada pascal common lisp cobol or compiled c

17269
click	mouse
to click on the link i have to move the mouse to the right till the cursor turns into a hand

17276
content-management	blogs
also once you want to get more advanced most cheap hosting services have tools that can be install with one click and provide things like blogs photo galleries bulletin boards phpbb and even content-management tools like joomla

17277
populate	row
the rows will be populate with data from the view if any sales available if not the row will have 0 values

17292
ruby	php
most php and ruby cms s are free and web hosting is free extremely cheap if you re not demanding

17295
icollection	ienumerable
so when writing a function or methods that takes a collection write it not to take a list but an ilist t an icollection t or ienumerable t

17312
arrays	loops
edit note the subtle optimisation where you count back from the arrays length and only increment up until i in the inner loops

17316
msbuild	nant
then there are the targets which most people familiar with make nant or msbuild should be able to follow

17331
stderr	stdout
it looks to me like mk and daniel fone interpreter it as wanting to see manipulate the stdout of the command neither of their solutions capture stderr fwiw

17342
joomla	drupal
if you re familiar with html javascript basic i d look into a cms - wordpress drupal joomla nuke etc

17350
gridview	listview
mainly i like the form view and listview the gridview still needs some work

17351
zend-auth	zend-acl
in the interest of not reinventing the wheel why not take a look at acl authentication systems like zend-acl and zend-auth

17357
command-line	cmd
for example i know most of the subversion cmd for the command-line but if i can lump all those cmd into one script i can fire at will i save time and mental energy

17357
packaging	building
that doesn t mean i m going to building a website that runs bash on the backend but i will surely use bash ksh python whatever to help me generate the skeleton project and manage my packaging and deployment

17371
glew	.lib
add the glew .lib path to your compiler s .library directory list

17371
variables	boolean
you do this by checking a boolean variables named glew _your_extension_name which is exposed by glew

17377
vb.net	vb6
.net rocks for when you want to hear the billionth interview about databinding controls in the trenches during the transition from vb6 to vb.net

17396
basic	vb6
instead of running visual c and visual basic side-by-side run vb6 under vc

17451
protected	public
you control the access rights for members and functions using private protected public right

17458
value	field
with such value in the field it is possible to search using the query

17475
valgrind	gprof
we used gdb extensively with the occasional use of valgrind and gprof

17475
perl	ruby
i went from perl to python to the current ruby

17532
user-controls	ascx
user-controlss - which inherit from user-controls and are contained within an ascx file

17570
syntax-highlighting	textmate
it covers most of the topics above including syntax-highlighting multi-selected edit column selected textmate bundles for autocomplete

17591
abstract-class	base-class
for protected members that are called by a base-class abstract-class are the way to go for specifying a contract between base-classes and classes that inherit from them

17603
pixels	line
for current text size font display size windows size margins etc determine how many characters can fit on a line if fixed-type or how many pixels can fit on a line if not fixed-type

17603
pixels	line
go through line character by character calculating how many characters or pixels have been recorded since the beginning of the line

17603
pixels	line
when you go over the max chars pixels for the line move back to the last spaces punctuation mark move all text to next line

17624
value	field
how can i easily update the filename column of these inserted field assuming i can selected the recent rows based on known id value to include the .jpg extension

17645
chown	chmod
you ll need to use chown chmod to make sure the correct users have access to them

17645
linux	unix
note that these may be on your linux unix system as fromdos or tofrodos or perhaps even as the general purpose toolbox recode

17675
linux	unix
note that these may be on your linux unix system as fromdos or tofrodos or perhaps even as the general purpose toolbox recode

17678
chown	chmod
you ll need to use chown chmod to make sure the correct users have access to them

17703
javascript	dom
javascript has survived and become popular purely because developers have very little choice in the matter - it s the only language that can interact with a dom

17704
windows-vista	windows
one of the bullet point features for windows-vista enterprize and ultimate is the unix subsystem for windows which allows you to write posix.

17709
linux	unix
if you re truly interested in programming stuff for unix download one of the many linux distributions ie

17717
postgresql	mysql
we are currently using mysql for a product we are building and are keen to move to postgresql as soon as possible primarily for licensing reasons

17735
revision	svn
when i first started using revision control systems like cvs and svn i didn t really understand the concepts of the trunk branching merging and tagging

17757
http	ssl
charles can act as a man-in-the-middle for http ssl communication enabling you to debug the content of your https sessions

17795
ip-address	hostname
but hostname is the same as the ip-address

17796
telnet	ssh
the putty telnet ssh client download putty.exe for free from

17796
radio-button	selected
selected the ssh protocol radio-button

17799
ip-address	hostname
a lot of users have the same shared ip-address so you will not be able to find their hostname

17817
required	checked
needs to support checked for required fields and preferably regexp validation of fields

17865
queue	fifo
my challenge is that the queue is not a fifo meaning that new items are prioritized and can be inserted somewhere in the middle of the queue

17906
selected	listbox
i have a rather classic user-interface situation - two listbox named selecteditems and availableitems - the idea being that the items you have already selected live in selecteditems while the items that are available for adding to selecteditems every item that isn t already in there live in availableitems

17906
selected	listbox
is it possible in wpf to set up a style trigger to enable or disable the move button depending on anything being selected in either listbox

17906
selected	button
selecteditems is on the left side so the button will move the selected availableitems to that list

17906
selected	button
however if no items are selected i want this button to be disabled - and the other way around for the other list button

17948
.when	ready
.when we are ready to deploy our code up the stack from development to test or test to production we need to run the wsdl.exe command to point to the appropriate versioning of the web-services

17951
pointers	stack
from the looks of the stack trace are you using unsafe code pointers and the like

17959
dialog	pop-up
after wrestling with windows installer setup i figured out the best way to include the wse30 redist and pop-up a dialog if it is not installed

17978
directx	gdi
happens a lot with directx gdi and others

17989
double	int
decimal places etc and the informs c++ what the variables you ve given it is character int double etc

18035
32-bit	64bit
i went from 64bit xp back to 32-bit due to 90 of the software i was using only being 32-bit anyway and i had issues with drivers and some software with 64bit

18050
32-bit	64bit
so if you are looking to install windows-vista go 64bit if you are keeping xp stay at 32-bit

18056
msbuild	nant
a nant build scripting will do it but i think the most commonly accepted methods now is to use msbuild

18060
32-bit	64bit
i went from 64bit xp back to 32-bit due to 90 of the software i was using only being 32-bit anyway and i had issues with drivers and some software with 64bit

18072
contains	lookup
searchstring should contain the values like phillip fry one long string contains all of the lookup strings separated by spaces

18075
ms-access	oracle
back a few years ago i was working with oracle databases and was using primarily toad with a little bit of ms-access as my tools of choice to prototype the queries i was using in my applications

18076
32-bit	64bit
you can always create vm image to test under 32-bit from a 64bit os

18086
equals	getter
now this class is a monster as in frankenstein it has 167 field members all of them of type string 167 getter setter pairs 1 for each field a constructor that receives all 167 fields as parameters an equals methods that compares all 167 fields in a strange way

18097
base-class	inherited
in c# if i have an inherited class with a default constructor do i have to explicitly call the base-class constructor or will it be implicitly called

18115
derived-class	base-class
a derived-class is built upon the base-class

18132
entity-framework	ado.net
so the ado.net entity-framework has gotten a little bit of bad press in the form of blog entries and a petition but i don t want to rush to judgement

18132
entity-framework	ado.net
finally what are thoughts on using nhibernate which has been around for a long time and may be more mature than the ado.net entity-framework

18141
32-bit	64bit
i switched from 32-bit vista to 64bit and haven t looked back

18141
32-bit	64bit
if you re really unsure use vista s much improved multi-boot functionality and install 32-bit xp and 64bit vista on the same machine on different partitions

18148
digits	zero
a single zero or one or more digits not starting with 0 or nothing so long as a period follows

18167
versioning	staging
however on the staging versioning of the same server there s a linked server that points to the production database

18173
entity-framework	ado.net
microsoft have all but admitted that the ado.net entity-framework isn t an orm i can t find a reference currently

18215
fclose	fopen
not an answer but i find the whole fopen fread fclose thing very dull to peruse when looking at code

18216
having	union
since cards do not have the same properties and often multiple values for the same property i decided to use the union table approach to store data instead of having a really big column structure in my card table

18223
triggers	insert
i have a table in a sql-server 2005 database with a triggers that is supposed to add a record to a different table whenever a new record is insert

18223
triggers	insert
it seems to work fine but if i execute an insert into on the master table that uses a subquery as the source of the values the triggers only inserts one record in the other table even though multiple records were added to the master

18226
order	add
i needed to add to the string and break it up on spaces in order to work

18229
triggers	insert
your triggers is only using the first row from insert

18229
triggers	insert
the insert table you get in triggers would contain all the rows

18230
triggers	insert
the triggers only fires once for each insert statment executed - not once for each record inserted

18230
triggers	insert
in your triggers you can access the virtual table called insert for details of the records insert

18241
putty	pscp
take a look at putty psftp and pscp or winscp for windows or rsync and openssh for unixes

18249
octal	hex
this one takes most of what has already been mentioned into consideration but include hex and octal numbers negative scientific infinity and has removed decimal scientific 4e3.2 is not valid

18267
any	set
neall i d add a set -e on the second line because you don t want the live site being replaced if the rsync fails for any reason

18267
any	set
set -e causes the scripting to exit if any of its commands fail

18289
double	int
and int tricks for comparing double and floats are nice but tend to make it more difficult for the various cpu pipelines to handle effectively

18293
constructor	object
and yes i know that suggesting that means you shouldn t attempt to do interesting stuff in constructor of global object

18295
python	ruby
jsp for java rails for ruby django for python etc

18307
ruby	php
the ones i have most experience with and therefore will be talking about here are php eruby and ruby on rails

18307
ruby	php
using php and eruby you have to do most things yourself - whereas ruby on rails will do lots of stuff for you useful but can also be dangerous if you don t know what you re doing

18307
ruby	php
php is more well known and used than eruby but i like the ruby language so i tend to like using eruby

18307
ruby	php
php or ruby and some don t

18324
32-bit	16-bit
i need to mix 32-bit and 16-bit code because i m trying to return to real-mode from protected mode

18324
32-bit	16-bit
so how do i get nasm to successfully assemble code where i mix 32-bit and 16-bit code in the same file

18335
ruby-on-rails	grails
i ve been learning ruby-on-rails and grails and the latter is far easier to learn

18335
ruby-on-rails	grails
i truly feel that grails has brighter future than ruby-on-rails

18359
32-bit	16-bit
i can t imagine that people switch back to 16-bit mode from 32-bit mode very often anymore

18364
32-bit	16-bit
in bits 32 mode the reverse is true 32-bit instructions require no prefixes whereas instructions using 16-bit data need an 0x66 and those working on 16-bit addresses need an 0x67.

18370
forwarding	port
plus if you use their client tunnelier you get some bonus features like mapping shares port forwarding setup up server side etc. if you don t use their client it will still work with the open source ssh clients

18397
16-bit	ia-32
look at the intel ia-32 software developer s guide volume 3 chapter 16 mixing 16-bit and 32-bit code

18406
linux	bsd
if you are on systems with the bsd backtrace functionality available linux osx 1.5 bsd of course you can do this programmatically in your signal handler

18413
substring	charindex
i ve tried a bunch of variations on substring charindex convert and replace but i still can t seem to get something that works in all combinations

18448
.net	wcf
it seems wcf could ve been an option but i prefer not to upgrade from .net 2.0

18451
sql-server	mysql
i don t know if this works in sql-server but within mysql you can use several tricks to convert character data into numbers

18451
sql-server	mysql
might not work in sql-server but future searches may help the odd mysql user -d

18454
value	field
you d probably be much better off changing and 5-10 to store 2 value in 2 field

18492
cryptography	security
for security we use a saml token based system built on the cryptography classes in system.security

18505
click	mouse
what i would like to do instead is send simulate a mouse click the windows s button on the taskbar which i am hoping will bring the windows to the front

18521
click	mouse
i used this in a program where i needed to simulate click and mouse movements

18521
keyboard	mouse
global mouse and keyboard library

18563
32-bit	x86
since those libraries are 32-bit you need to set the build to x86 to ensure the app will run as an x86 process if on an x64 machine it will run in wow

18627
profiling	debugging
after doing some manual debugging the basic profiling for mono on linux didn t help much we were able to narrow the issue down to a specific chunk of code

18654
32-bit	64bit
this enables high- precision computations and 64bit arithmetic to be performed in fewer clock-cycles as compared to 32-bit microprocessors

18655
web-applications	web-services
web-applications windows services web-services b2b interaction you name it

18655
put	get
one thing i have to put up here at the top in response to several similar answers orthogonality and separation of concerns often get cited as reasons to go entity orm

18672
put	get
if you do use windows you can get a whole slew of unix command-line tools from here - unzip them and put them somewhere in your path

18691
managed-code	unmanaged
you should be able to make an unmanaged that performs the operations you want using mapi and then invoke that dll from your managed-code

18702
implements	extends
the question is is it possible to extends forever the webservice time out and finally how do you implements your web-services to handle this issue

18705
project-server	ms-project
i need to be able to create basic ms-project items tasks projects resources etc. programmatically from my app to my project-server 2003 install and haven t found any good examples

18753
click	mouse
another approach which we have implemented for our product at work is to record user events such as mouse click and key events in an event scripting

18753
recording	playing
edit this is also a terrific qa tool during beta testing for instances just have your users recording their actions and if there s a crash you have a good chance of easily reproducing the problem by just playing back the scripting

18772
authentication	login
windows authentication is not enabled so i cannot login

18807
contains	sorted
if the argument column contains the ordered clause the query processor has requested that the rows output be returned in the order in which the clustered index has sorted them

18828
attributes	properties
when it comes to adding ever single attributes or properties they are usually overkill especially as they often become out of date quickly once code is written

18837
subdirectories	symlink
another possibility is that usr or one of its subdirectories is a symlink

18856
python	ruby
after logo move to python or ruby

18856
python	java
you can move to c# or java after that though they don t offer much that python doesn t already have

18856
quicksort	mergesort
this is where you teach the really advanced algorithms like mergesort and quicksort

18865
snowflake-schema	data-warehouse
if your doing allot of reporting complex selected with many joins then you should look at creating a data-warehouse with a star or snowflake-schema

18870
environment	building
in your c# project set a conditional-compilation symbols csharp make sure no such preprocessor definition exists in the c++ building environment

18876
ruby-on-rails	django
this isn t any more elegant than what you have stipulated so i wonder if any of the django or ruby-on-rails guys can provide any input

18877
ncover	fxcop
all the results msbuild ncover nunit fxcop etc are in xml so you can build relativity simple report pages out of xslt

18879
authentication	login
my read of the question was that the server is set up to use sql authentication only and perhaps you don t know the sa password or any other sql login credentials

18908
silverlight	wpf
then again i m in the client app space wpf and silverlight

18925
any	set
it s set up so it only works on localhost and i couldn t find any workarounds to make it work

18928
order	join
my rule of thumb is to use a loop join when the top row has very few rows compared to the bottom a merge when the sets are roughly equal and order and a hash for everything else

18943
ubuntu	debian
i realise that with apt.conf that you could set chmod 600 which it isn t by default on ubuntu debian

18965
any	set
unroll any cursor loops and convert into set based update insert statements

18977
difference	factors
i ve found you can spend a lot of time and money building a comprehensive ad-hoc reporting suite and after the first month or two of wow factors 99 of the reports generated will be the same report with minor difference in a fixed set of parameters

19016
javascript	dom
as for javascript bugs and horrible dom support you still have that in ie7 and ie8

19025
sql-server	oracle
i work mostly with oracle but microsoft sql-server works pretty much the same way

19030
organization	naming
i have a bunch of files tv episodes although that is fairly arbitrary that i want to check match a specific naming organization scheme

19042
diagram	erd
the tool we found most valuable in these review sessions were erd s class diagram and sequences diagram

19042
diagram	erd
erd s and class diagram were done only in visual-studio so the time required to create them was trivial for the students

19069
javascript	dom
which makes sure the javascript is loaded and the dom is ready before doing your stuff

19079
coalesce	isnull
terrapin there are a few other difference between isnull and coalesce that are worth mentioning besides ansi compliance which is a big one for me

19122
stdin	pipe
of course you re using a pipe and of course you re using stdin and stdout of the respective parts of the command

19127
navigation	styling
i have a page using lists for navigation javascript changes the styling to display or not on mouseover

19138
environment	execution
function-call expression can also be considered statements of course but unless the execution environment has a special built-in variables to hold the returned value there is no way to retrieve it

19179
command-line	cmd
calling a cmd-line from a gui spawns external processes for each cmd and is more disruptive to the os

19185
keyboard	mouse
there is some documentation on the internet that shows that windows changes the behavior of the notifyicon.balloontipshown command if the user is currently idle and this is detected by checking for keyboard and mouse events

19186
negative-number	integer
this way java doesn t interpret the byte as a negative-number and flip the sign bit on the integer also

19187
detect	move
if there are new messages for user hold on to them until you detect any move with the mouse

19187
keyboard	mouse
see detecting idle time with mouse and keyboard hooks

19210
perl	c++
there were 30 c++ projects which needed compiling and various .net java things and the odd perl script

19224
decrement	increment
this blurring of expression and statements occurs in all the c-derivatives c++ c# and java which still have some statements like while but which allow almost any expression to be used as a statement in c# only assignment call increment and decrement expression may be used as statements

19224
haskell	lisp
haskell icon lisp and ml are all languages that don t have syntactic statements mdash

19229
jsonp	ajax
plus is jsonp really considered ajax since it doesn t actually use the xmlhttprequest object

19291
authentication	login
in my experience i have a login control and in the onauthenticate event i would set authentication to false.

19307
jqmodal	jquery
i would like to recommend this jquery plugin though jqmodal

19308
oracle	mysql
i ve done this in oracle and mysql before

19326
value	field
i set the value to an instance field

19329
firefox	safari
i tested it in firefox 3 true and false in safari ie7 and opera

19360
environment	building
then in my nant scripting i have a task that copies the current building environment plus _ app-config and copy it to app-config

19366
stream	send
moving changes between stream is really easy just selected the change send it to the change palette and selected the destination stream

19370
cassini	iis
you are on vista iis got better 7 cassini stayed crappy

19370
hosts-file	hosts
so just start this app on iis with a hosts header and a hostss-file entry

19383
output	cat
when the buffer is empty at some point tail will have to wait for cat to output more data

19383
tail	eof
the operating systemd will signals tail when their is no more incoming data with an eof

19395
swing	awt
aside from interface builder which is included as part of the xcode tools you can also use qt gtk+ awt swing for your java background tk squeak for your smalltalk background shoes very cool little ruby gui toolkit fxruby more ruby wxwidgets xulrunner and others i m sure i ve forgotten

19398
put	get
you can put in a conditional statement or several and when conditions are met properly you can use a goto statement to get out of all the loops instead of having a break statement at each level of nesting with a conditional statement for each

19419
postgresql	oracle
it goes through methods for doing this in mysql postgresql microsoft sql server ibm db2 and oracle the following is copied from that link

19433
flac	mp3
re-encoding audio file from flac - mp3 or vice versa

19437
export	report
i m using a custom font for report headers and when deployed to the server it does not render correctly when i print or export to pdf tiff

19466
passthru	exec
how can i check file-permissions without having to run operating system specific command via passthru or exec

19467
flac	mp3
just about every language has bindings to c so you ll probably want to get the applicable c libraries for encoding decoding mp3 s and flac files

19553
instances	private
in the c++ versioning of the status class i can write a test on some private bool bischecked in the destructor and ring some bells when someone doesn t check this instances

19555
postgresql	mysql
i m currently a fan of postgresql which is also freely available and i think if you read the licensing of mysql actually turns out to have a more amenable license for commercial use

19589
.net	wcf
using c# .net 3.5 and wcf i m trying to write out some of the wcf configuration in a client application the name of the server the client is connecting to

19590
ref	out
if you really want to required the user to retrieve the result of myfunction you might want to void it instead and use an out or ref variables

19654
python	php
but currently one of the developers has seen the light of django the company has only developed in php to date while the other developer is concerned that introducing a new language python is a bad idea right now

19700
ruby-on-rails	django
from what i ve seen the django framework is also a great tooklit for web development giving much the same developer performance boost ruby-on-rails is touted to give

19700
python	php
how will this move fragment the maintenance between php and python code

19715
perl	php
also none of my co-workers were really perl or php gurus

19715
python	php
so if you re talking about new projects with people who currently use php but aren t super-experts and don t love that language then i think switching to python is a no-brainer

19732
boolean	int
use int instead of boolean

19732
double-pointer	pointers
in principle such a thing could be written cmpxchg the underlying processor instruction can operate on 8 16 32 and 64-bit operands on x86 8 16 32 64 and 128-bit operands on x64 but in practice most apis stick to pointers and double-pointers 32 and 64-bit on x86 64 and 128-bit on x64 operands because they re all you really need

19760
any	set
any chance you can set up your server as a vpn endpoint

19767
jprofiler	yourkit
as mentioned both jprofiler and yourkit are both fairly good and not prohibitively expensive

19782
expression	evaluation
it is probable that evaluation the long expression in your java file consumes lots of memory and because this is being done in conjunction with the compilation of other classes the vm just runs out of stack spaces

19793
istream	ostream
the best thing to do is create public print ostream and read istream functions

19796
jtable	jlist
i d probably be looking to use a jtable rather than a jlist and since the default rendering of a checkbox is rather ugly i d probably be looking to drop in a custom tablemodel cellrenderer and celleditor to represent a boolean value

19893
communication	messages
i have two applications written in java that communication with each other using xml messages over the network

19943
python	php
it s far easier to find php programmers than python programmers

19963
export	report
ladoucep i don t seem to be able to export the report without data

19998
contains	any
if you re looking at any methods calls regardless of the source then a regex could probably work but would be tricky to get right does your regex properly ignore strings that contains methods-call like contents
