1130
duplicates	sorted
pattern5	
also since the data is sorted given a non-key field the rest of the table doesnâ t need to be searched for duplicates values once a higher value is found

1300
msbuild	nant
pattern1	
in short i am actually quite happy with msbuild especially since it s the official compiler front end and a bit uncomfortable with nant but i do not want to judge prematurely

1820
testdriven.net	xunit.net
pattern1	
i like testdriven.net even though i use resharper and i m pretty happy with xunit.net

1971
python	perl
pattern4	
i think programmer comfort is my main reason to choose python but i think perl is still better supported

2328
callback	methods
pattern5	
so again i need a way for the page viewstate to be updated on callback after the ajax methods is fired

2360
keyboard	mouse
pattern4	
go to system preferences keyboard and mouse then choose keyboard shortcuts

3455
parallels	vmware
pattern0	
another option is vmware fusion which is much better than parallels in my opinion + windows-xp + sql-server management studio

3829
xcopy	cmd
pattern8	
powershell scripts might be useful too and surely more flexible than xcopy and other dos cmd

5132
groovy	java
pattern10	
just a bit of a question is the reason they are choosing grails because groovy is closer in syntax to java than ruby or because they want access to java

5607
any	set
pattern5	
with identity page fill factors is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to 100 - rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one

6906
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
pattern7	
pure .net in visual-studio is better than win32 obviously but developing against the mono libraries perhaps using the sharpdevelop ide is probably an even better approach

8920
installation	uninstall
pattern4	
to move the installation you will need to uninstall all editions of 2008 you have installed including any express editions and then the choose installation location option should enable

9144
python	c++
pattern5	
honestly i doubt that you ve got a lot of incoming developers who suck with c++ but would be awesome with python anyway

12937
haskell	lisp
pattern1	
imperative languages like java and c# solve a certain set of problems pretty well but it also helps to think in a functional manner sometimes such as with haskell and lisp

15838
any	set
pattern5	
the practice of programming be improved using any of c s native utilities if i set the i variables to be a register variables

16581
msbuild	nant
pattern4	
i have used both msbuild and nant and i much prefer msbuild mainly because it requires a lot less configuration by default

16714
value	field
pattern0	
if you need to assert for example that the value of the small element is less than the value of the big element or even more complex business rules involving multiple field you probably want schematron or a hybrid approach

17120
msbuild	nant
pattern5	
before leveraging cruisecontrol to it s fullest extent you need to create an automated build scripting that can be run by msbuild or nant

22074
illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception
pattern10	
in my mind illegalargumentexception seems more specific than using a nullpointerexception since it s telling me that the problem was with an argument i passed to the methods and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the methods

22695
remote-debugging	debugging
pattern10	
remote-debugging is obviously more tricky to get it to work correctly you might have to map the remote url with a php script in your workspace than a local debugging setup which is pretty easy to configure if you are on a mac or a linux desktop

23203
haskell	scheme
pattern7	
i really like thompsonâ s â œhaskell the craft of functional programmingâ because itâ s well written and haskell allows an easier start than other functional languages while being completely pure unlike lisp or scheme

24707
wicket	spring
pattern1	
that goes doubly so if you are using your own db code instead of hibernate or some other framework i was never completely happy with wicket hibernate or spring integration

24995
scala	java
pattern5	
classes can be written in scala then extended in java for example

25275
ruby	php
pattern1	
i am not familiar with ruby on rails but the following is untested php code

25701
jdom	xom
pattern4	
i ve worked with jdom as well and there s absolutely nothing wrong with it although i do prefer xom

27439
postgresql	mysql
pattern10	
from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysql is less correct less compliant but faster

27443
postgresql	mysql
pattern7	
in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end

28276
parallels	vmware
pattern0	
vmware is beefer and sucks more of the system s performance away by default also seems to perform somewhat better than parallels but can have serious graphical problems depending on your setup particularly if you try to use unity mode

28354
parallels	vmware
pattern1	
i am quite happy with parallels but i m not sure i wouldn t use vmware fusion the next time

28700
python	ruby
pattern5	
it stands as much of a chance to be installed as python or ruby

29557
mstest	nunit
pattern8	
i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.

29923
bazaar	git
pattern7	
in git you can do the same with playing around in the index staging area but bazaar has a better ui for it

30114
perl	c++
pattern10	
some people also use artistic style command line tool although it requires perl and works better with c++ code than with c#

30841
value	field
pattern5	
in field to summarize selected value in type of summary selected sum under evaluate selected for each record

31611
32-bit	64bit
pattern5	
one word of warning - jdbc - access queries which bridge using odbc do not work on 64bit systems as there exist no 64bit access database drivers the driver is included into 32-bit copies of windows and can only be accessed by 32-bit processes

33243
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern0	
the easiest way to generate elegant html and css is to use asp.net-mvc framework where you have much more control over html generation than with webforms

33321
webforms	asp.net
pattern6	
in asp.net webforms what is the best chioce for providing a righ ui a la ajax

34295
aquamacs	emacs
pattern4	
if it is emacs you want i would recommend aquamacs more mac-like or carbon emacs more gnu-emacs-like

34645
any	set
pattern5	
soft limits could be set by any user while hard limits are changeable only by root

34941
perl	php
pattern1	
for perl at least the first option is sufficient i m not familiar with php

35409
any	set
pattern5	
the second since it basically says that for given z and first-order property p you can construct x âˆˆ z p x but to generate the russell set you would need z v the class of all sets which is not a set cannot be generated from any of the given axioms

38773
ruby-on-rails	grails
pattern7	
i can say that the ruby-on-rails community is much larger i m talking about ruby-on-rails vs grails not ruby-on-rails vs java and very helpful

39343
basic	vba
pattern1	
openoffice has a basic interpreter which is largely compatible with vba

40117
httphandler	httpcontext
pattern5	
httpcontext exposes the current instance for the request under the httpcontext.current property however the current context can also be passed in httphandler in the processrequest methods

41720
asp.net-mvc	webforms
pattern1	
so start with asp.net-mvc and you will easily be able to move in to webforms if needed

42751
external	host
pattern5	
all those details may be specified external either programmatically in a service host or via the configuration file

43472
hide	show
pattern5	
if you append a span contains ellipse to the end of each query a simple logical test in javascript with a bit of css manipulation could be used to hide show them as needed

44034
any	set
pattern4	
i set up a little ajax app that compares any number of catalog instances to a master and shows the diffs

44195
union-all	union
pattern0	
union will be slower than union-all because union will filtering out dups

44248
data-structures	linked-list
pattern0	
might perform better is with data-structures like a linked-list where random access means traversing the list

44292
methods	extend
pattern4	
in java the thing to do would be to extend stringcomparator override the compare methods making the us and canada special cases then sort the list or arrays passing in your new comparator as the sort algorithm

44443
postgresql	oracle
pattern1	
i guess i was wondering if postgresql or mysql have any obvious advantages in these areas i am primarily familiar with oracle

44821
windows-mobile	windows-ce
pattern5	
does this mean that my executable can only be run on windows-mobile devices instead of any generic windows-ce installation

45512
bubble-sort	quicksort
pattern0	
i m sure there s a codinghorror article about this. also many algorithms have degenerate cases where the code does more than is necessary using quicksort on nearly order data could be slower than a bubble-sort with an early-out check

46165
export	report
pattern5	
you can then have ssrs export the report to about 10 different formats and send to the client including pdf excel html etc

46296
bazaar	git
pattern1	
i m not familiar with bazaar but git doesn t track file renames

47674
m2eclipse	maven
pattern10	
in other words m2eclipse is more friendly to the maven way

47827
web-crawler	seo
pattern0	
the seo guy mentioned that semantic valid html gets more points by web-crawler than jumbled messy html

47929
udp	tcp
pattern10	
udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp windows size and round-trip time rtt

48015
textmate	emacs
pattern7	
textmate is a better emacs for macs though that won t help you with solaris

48103
division	modulo
pattern0	
a side effect of many division routines is the modulo - so in few cases should division actually be faster than modulo

48772
sql-server	postgresql
pattern1	
i have never hand-coded object creation code for sql-server and foreign key decleration is seemingly different between sql-server and postgresql

49953
python	java
pattern0	pattern10	
java has much better performance than python and has way better tool support

49953
python	java
pattern0	
sometimes those things matter a lot and java is the better language than python for a task

50360
profiling	trace
pattern5	
the long-term difference might be that stored procedures are many many times easier for a dba to manage and tune whereas hundreds of different queries that have to be gleaned from profiling trace are a nightmare

50909
youtube	vimeo
pattern0	
vimeo will always have fewer users than youtube because the user experience is poor for low bitrate users

51580
json	xml
pattern8	
also i don t see how xml s angle brackets are less human readable than json s square brackets curly brackets and quotes

52893
webforms	asp.net
pattern1	
if you are quite happy with webforms today then maybe asp.net mvc isn t for you

53602
outlook-calendar	exchange-server
pattern5	
i am looking for a solution to export shared outlook-calendar yes i m using exchange-server and yes i can copy calendar to my local folders which would allow me to export

54403
debian	linux
pattern6	
debian live provides the best tools for building a linux live cd

54817
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
pattern4	
this seems like an object state invalid scenario to me so i d pick invalidoperationexception over argumentexception the parameters are valid but not at this point in the objects life

54827
scala	java
pattern7	
scala has much lighter syntax than java has a repl is statically typed and runs on the jvm - you might give that a shot as well

56371
silverlight	wpf
pattern2	
if you re determined to have rich-client style development and your audience is small for admins only then i d probably recommend wpf over silverlight as it currently provides a richer set of tools and controls

57528
vbscript	jscript
pattern5	
i seem to recall reading somewhere that the command object shouldn t be used in vbscript or jscript because of security vulnerabilities but i can t seem to find that article

58301
directx	gdi
pattern0	
speed is usually faster than gdi and slower than directx and depends greatly on how you do things seen something to work 60 times faster after rewriting in a sensible way

58306
any	set
pattern4	
i want to choose any two records from the set and be able to show all simple paths between the chosen records

58363
memcached	apc
pattern4	
i would recommend memcached or apc

58437
if-statement	loops
pattern0	
it s not as clean as i d like it to be so i d still add comments but it s better than an if-statement or adding the first or last item outside loops

59192
linux	osx
pattern4	
it is cross-platform win linux osx

60910
aquamacs	emacs
pattern7	
however i m not really much of an emacs user and the preferences menu in aquamacs is less than clear on where and how one might make such a change

61192
python	c++
pattern4	
i recommend python as it s not only a sexy language but also very widely used and easy to integrate with c++ through boost.python

61734
python	ruby
pattern0	
ruby will expose you to more concepts than python does due to it being more liberal in how it handles things like lambda functions code blocks eval and so on

63067
web-services	security
pattern5	
the problem we are seeing is that it expects the requests to be formatted using web-services security so we are doing all the correct signing etc

63865
c++	lua
pattern5	
it is also possible to expose whole c++ classes to be used in lua

63908
expression-blend	wpf
pattern4	
so i highly recommend expression-blend for a wpf programmer

64644
emacs	vim
pattern4	
i don t think you would want to wait 10 seconds for your text editor to become ready ...if you are going to spend some serious time coding then spend some time and learn to use vim emacs too but i recommend vim

65873
serialization	marshalling
pattern5	
although serialization is used here it is also common for this process to be referred as marshalling

66508
silverlight	wpf
pattern3	
every industry expert i ve heard on podcasts blogs and interviews recommend learning silverlight first and then gradually moving to wpf which is a huge ui framework

69410
celementtree	elementtree
pattern10	
personally i like celementtree which is a faster c-based implementation of elementtree which is a dom-like model

69545
richfaces	icefaces
pattern8	
there is icefaces which provides more semantic support than richfaces .also you can try nitobi suite which also provides similar kinda solution.if you are not satisfied with any of these i suggest try to write your own part extending the sun faces

70423
quicksort	heapsort
pattern0	
but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average

70440
quicksort	mergesort
pattern10	
quicksort is usually faster than mergesort just because it s easier to code a tight implementation and the operations it does can go faster

70440
quicksort	mergesort
pattern10	
it s because that quicksort is generally faster that people use it instead of mergesort

70486
python	ruby
pattern4	
if i was starting today maybe i would pick python or ruby but i don t know enough about them to make a judgement call

70627
quicksort	mergesort
pattern10	
quicksort is not better it is well suited for a different kind of application than mergesort

70708
similarity	distance
pattern7	
after finding questions with words from query we might want to calculate distance between words we are interested in in questions so question with phrases similarity text ranks higher than question with discussing similarity you hear following phrases... text

70881
multiplication	addition
pattern5	pattern7	
precedence rules specify priority of operators which operators will be evaluated first multiplication has higher precedence than addition pemdas

71371
children	nodes
pattern5	
the last parameter to builder.node is arrays list of other nodes to be append as children according to the wiki

71412
jedit	emacs
pattern1	
other than that i m quite happy with jedit - it s the best general editor i ve found so far for linux ducks as hordes of vi and emacs users light up their flame cannons

72214
updating	updates
pattern5	
you can start a replication by creating a database from scratch and you can control either the updates will be done by updating the available client database or simply recreating the database

73236
python	php
pattern4	
i personally prefer python but php will work as well

74174
itextsharp	itext
pattern4	
i can however recommend itextsharp which is a .net port of the java itext

74327
malloc	free
pattern0	pattern0	
this is also the reason why gc can be faster than malloc free

74878
any	set
pattern5	
it can be set on any versioned directory and its value is a multi-line table of subdirectories relative to the versioned directory on which the property is set and fully qualified absolute subversion repository urls.

74931
postgresql	mysql
pattern0	
with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use postgresql performed better than mysql

74992
bash	zsh
pattern2	
i prefer zsh over bash because of its support for very powerful file globbing variable expansion modifiers and faster tab completion

76111
exception-handling	error-handling
pattern0	
after all i think your error-handling process will be much smoother with exception-handling than trigger_error and stuff

77166
python	php
pattern10	
since python is far less ubiquitous than php i wouldn t be surprised if hosting developer and other maintenance costs for it long term would have it fit this scenario

77328
textwrangler	bbedit
pattern0	
i really do not get the appeal it s marginally better than textwrangler bbedit s free little brother but if you re spending money you may as well buy the better tool for a few dollars more

77794
version-control	git
pattern0	
they both provide basic distributed version-control as in offline commit and merging multiple branches are both written in python and are both slower than git

77883
bazaar	git
pattern7	
bazaar is imho easier to learn than git

77945
quicksort	mergesort
pattern10	
quicksort is not better than mergesort

79628
instance-variables	local-variables
pattern0	pattern0	
i would hypothesize that the amount of effort increases dramatically when we try to understand classes with more than nine instance-variables or methods with more than 9 local-variables

79771
multiplication	multiplying
pattern10	
multiplication is slightly more complex as it needs an integer multiplying followed by a scale back such as 0.72 2 becomes 72 200 becomes 14400 becomes 144 scaleback becomes 1.44

79774
any	set
pattern5	
so for example if i have an expiry set to 08 march 2008 i want that value to be returned to any client - no matter what their timezone is

79979
any	set
pattern5	
though be careful - the dataloadoptions must be set before any query is sent to the database - if not an exception-handling is thrown no idea why it s like this in linq2sql - probably will be fixed in a later version
