50002
32-bit	64bit
the 32-bit kernel that is capable of loading and running 64bit binaries has to have some 64bit code to handle memory mapping program loading and a few other 64bit issues

50002
32-bit	64bit
however the scheduler and many other os operations aren t required to work in the 64bit mode in order to deal with other issues - it switches the processor to 32-bit mode and back as needed to handle drivers tasks memory allocation and mapping interrupts etc

50003
versioning	upgrade
so i guess our solution will be to upgrade our development install with the full versioning of sql 2005 we have an msdn subscription of course

50011
driver	kernel
if it doesn t go away it s currently locked waiting on some kernel resource probably a buggy driver and there is nothing short of a reboot you could do to make the process go away

50011
linux	unix
unix based systems like linux also have that problem where processes could survive a kill -9 if they are in what s known as uninterruptible sleep shown by top and ps as state d at which point the processes sleep so well that they can t process incoming signals which is what kill does - sending signals

50033
contains	set
the .net generated code for a form with the defaultbutton attributes set contains poor javascript that allows the functionality to work in ie but not in other browsers firefox specifcially

50048
environment	building
the msbuilding everett environment msbee has been announced and soon this will be a reasonably supported scenario and we ll all be able to building both 1.1 and 2.0 versioning of .net code on visual-studio 2005

50064
swing	awt
this is pretty simple i come from a swing awt background

50079
png	gif
i m after loaders for bmp gif jpg png and tga

50103
constructor	object
i created an object for each table each with constructor instance properties and methods create-update-delete commands a bunch of finder functions and icomparable sorting functions

50104
any	set
since the modal-dialog is on the page you re free to set any document variables you want

50170
google-chrome	opera
but this doesn t seem to generate markers in either ff3 google-chrome or ie8 beta 2 and if i recall correctly not opera either although i ve since uninstalled opera

50177
duplicates	contains
for example if both of your collections are hash sets they cannot contains duplicates

50177
contains	elements
also checking whether a hash set contains some elements is very fast

50182
joystick	mouse
is there a good library to use for gathering user input in linux from the mouse keyboard joystick that doesn t force you to create a visible windows to do so

50184
union-all	union
in oracle union does not support blob or clob column types union-all does

50194
version-control	git
it would be ideal to have them using version-control but i think that both subversion and git are too technical for non-technical office staff

50199
publish-subscribe	observer-pattern
you may want to consider doing a publish-subscribe observer-pattern -- define a status changed event on a base page and create a custom control that sets up a delegate and event handler to listen for status updates

50206
.net	wcf
since you are limited to .net 2.0 wcf is perhaps not an option

50218
shared-libraries	ldd
use ldd to list shared-libraries for each executable

50220
joystick	keyboard
i m not sure off the top of my head for keyboard or joystick

50245
order	add
you might want to add sort -g at the end to get the libraries in order of usage

50266
macros	basic
in this form some basic preprocessing such as macros expansion is done on the operands of the #include directive and the result is expected to match one of the two other forms

50280
firefox	safari
the floated content and the content that has an additional margin both appear fine in firefox ie but on safari one of the divs is completely hidden

50307
floating	margins
i tried floating that content right and additionally tried floating it left and setting the positioning with the thinking that both divs would start out at left 0 where setting the margins of the right would move it over

50315
transparency	frame
the workaround is to use a transparency flash frame or just use a flash button to call the dialogue box

50315
credentials	integrated
the integrated windows authentication used on our intranet is not used when the flash file attempts to upload the files prompting the user for credentials

50356
profiling	trace
round 1 - you can start a profiling trace and compare the execution times

50359
average	median
compare the average and median execution time of each methods

50360
profiling	trace
the long-term difference might be that stored procedures are many many times easier for a dba to manage and tune whereas hundreds of different queries that have to be gleaned from profiling trace are a nightmare

50362
perl	ruby
really though this is probably more a perl ruby python job than a pure shell script

50371
tortoisecvs	winmerge
i use winmerge for diffs but it doesn t work with the three way merge maybe a better question would be is there a way to force tortoisesvn to merge like tortoisecvs

50378
put	get
you need to put the burden of proof back on him- get him to convince you otherwise- and that will force him to do the research and discover the answer for himself

50386
code-generation	mygeneration
btw i ll be using mygeneration to do the code-generation templates

50388
revision	svn
svn and git etc. are tools designed for programmers - if you re just looking for a good way to manage document revision and keep a history i m guessing there are better tools for your particular platform though i don t know enough to recommend a particular one

50394
required	checked
i m trying to get a webservice up and running that actually required to checked whois databases

50412
selected	button
response to edit can you clarify what you mean by this selected box is populated by a set of radio button

50412
contains	elements
a selected elements cannot legally contains input type radio elementss

50438
sql-server	oracle
i don t know much about sql-server but i do know that the oracle oci calls are faster than using odbc

50456
version-control	cvs
don t forget about version-control using cvs or subversion

50472
binary	hex
there are 26 characters in the alphabet and we have a number system just like hex or binary just with an unusual character set a..z representing positionally the powers of 26 26 2 26 1 26 0

50488
cassini	iis
since for various reasons i can t use iis for an asp.net website i m developing i run cassini from the command line to test the site

50518
silverlight	wpf
i m working on moving a client server application created with c# and winforms into the soa wpf silverlight world

50525
expression	evaluation
i was thinking that there might be an implicit up cast or overflow bit check and that will be factored into the evaluation of this expression

50573
methods	extend
the reentrantlock does allow you to get its owner but its a protected methods so you d have to extend this

50573
thread-dump	jvm
there are non-programmatic methods to find the lock owners such as signaling the jvm to issue a thread-dump to stderr that are useful to determine the cause of deadlocks

50585
click	mouse
how do you capture the mouse events move and click over top of a shockwave director object not flash in firefox via javascript

50595
flotr	flot
flotr ++even prettier charts than flot +-uses prototype which i ve never worked with -no pie charts either

50595
flotr	flot
in a nutshell for tiny little simple graphs i d use the google charts api but for my current project an internal reporting tool it ll likely be flot though if it was client-facing code i d probably either look further or give flotr prototype a try

50596
callback	methods
the manual uses the terms callback and callable interchangeably however callback traditionally refers to a string or arrays value that acts like a function pointer referencing a function or class methods for future invocation

50596
callback	methods
objects with an __invoke methods including anonymous functions fall under the category callable and can be used the same way but i personally don t associate these with the legacy callback term

50601
pixels	line
pixels and points are related by dpi so you change the dpi and suddenly your pixel fixed value don t line up with your point fixed value

50632
unsigned-integer	int
otherwise if both operands have signed int types or both have unsigned-int types the operand with the type of lesser int conversion rank is converted to the type of the operand with greater rank

50632
unsigned-integer	int
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned-int type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed int type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned-int type

50632
unsigned-integer	int
otherwise if the type of the operand with signed int type can represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned-int type then the operand with unsigned-int type is converted to the type of the operand with signed int type

50632
unsigned-integer	int
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned-int type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed int type

50651
indesign-server	indesign
are you using indesign or indesign-server

50704
communication	messages
additional thanks to some answers so far though i should mention that most of the time the messages will be person to person communication rather than system messages

50747
internet-explorer	firefox
firefox displays it properly but ie7 gives me the default unhelpful internet-explorer error page

50798
put	get
i m not sure what you mean about recognizing a path - if any of the above paths are passed as a parameter to a program the shell will put the entire string in one variables - you don t have to parsing multiple arguments to get the entire path

50822
export	report
there are a number of different types of plugins that the framework can handle account export report etc.

50822
communication	messages
communication is via publish-subscribe with the messages broker sitting in the middle gathering all published messages types and managing subscription

50842
malloc	free
first you have to provide the entrypoints for malloc and free and friends

50848
malloc	free
since you re worried about memory-leaks and talking about malloc free i assume you re in c

50853
any	set
i have a relationship between two entities e1 and e2 and e1 has a collection of e2 however i have a similar relationship set up between e2 and e3 yet e2 does not contain a collection of e3 s any reason why this would happen

50861
realloc	malloc
you can set __malloc_hook __free_hook and __realloc_hook to point to functions which will be called from malloc realloc and free respectively

50873
abstract	extends
then why not just extends an abstract

50909
youtube	vimeo
vimeo will always have fewer users than youtube because the user experience is poor for low bitrate users

50931
rewrite	rule
how can i rewrite the above rule so that subdomains do not get redirected

50942
configuration	environment
i have found that to get this to work i can use an environment variables configurationuration to set the connection string of the connection manager that i am reading my package configuration from

50942
environment	restart
although i had to restart the sql-server agent before it could find the new environment variables

50960
stubs	tdd
also by applying tdd you typically end up writing your code in a way where you can supply test mocks and stubs

50965
append	input
encryption processing by 8 byte blocks i don t want to save pre-encrypted file size so append 0x00 to input data and leave them there after decoding

50977
web-applications	security
creating more secure swf web-applications security controls within the html code

51000
registration	login
i have seen many sites hide it behind a link under the standard login registration page like this

51014
haskell	ocaml
languages with type inference like ocaml and haskell will probably make this easier on you although their error messages can be confusing as well

51021
rescue	throw
ruby has two different exception-handling mechanisms throw catch and raise rescue

51027
postgresql	mysql
rdbms mysql postgresql etc..

51036
oodbms	db4o
db4o as mentioned by eric is an object-oriented database management system oodbms

51037
rescue	throw
catch throw are not the same as raise rescue

51037
rescue	throw
catch throw allows you to quickly exit blocks back to a point where a catch is defined for a specific symbols raise rescue is the real exception-handling handling stuff involving the exception-handling object

51042
subtract	time
also a little silly but you could try picking an arbitrary day and embedding each time in it using datetime.datetime.combine then subtract

51047
exif	xmp
you can embed your data in the xmp tag within a jpeg or exif or iptc fields-for that matter

51056
haskell	ocaml
i agree that haskell s type classes are really well done but it s a bit different in that haskell has no oo semantics but ocaml does support oo

51063
windows-xp	windows
if you are on windows-xp and don t have the debugging tools for windows installed you can get a memory dump using ntsd.exe

51067
packaging	building
the book eclipse rich client platform designing coding and packaging java tm applications provides a detailed introduction to building rcp applications

51069
windows-xp	windows
if you don t have forfiles installed on your machine copy it from any windows server 2003 to your windows-xp machine at windir system32

51069
windows-xp	windows
this is possible since the exe is fully compatible between windows server 2003 and windows-xp

51069
windows-server	windows
later versions of windows and windows-server have it installed by default

51100
32-bit	16-bit
look up the jump from 16-bit computing to 32-bit computing

51101
ubuntu	linux
linux supports a technology called pae that lets you use more than 4gb of memory however i don t know whether ubuntu has it on by default

51103
postgresql	oracle
also note that this will work in oracle and postgresql i think but not ms sql

51111
worksheet	excel
in excel you would likely just write code to open the other worksheet modify it and then save the data

51115
firebird	oracle
however if you decide to not use oracle light i would highly recommend you to take a look at firebird

51118
sql-server	oracle
for the most part you can treat it as if you were running on sql-server or oracle

51118
oracle	mysql
entityframework will have 3rd party adapters mysql oracle and a few others soon after release

51146
click	mouse
when i click the mouse the tip disappears

51159
firefox	safari
css3 will have last-child too this is currently supported by firefox safari but not ie 6 7 beta 8

51199
put	get
if you have to concatenate large strings put the string parts into an arrays and use the arrays.join methods to get the overall string

51200
tuples	any
in any case because it s python you can start with a tuples and then change it to an instance of a custom class without having to change any code in the caller

51203
32-bit	64bit
i ve used insure++ on 32-bit and 64bit apps on linux and it worked okay

51210
controller	routes
salt for additional logic where we want different controller logic routes etc

51218
flicker	blink
your cursor will still blink but it ll blink after the percent sign rather than under the first digits and with one control character instead of three you may get less flicker

51224
digits	zero
single digits months can start with a leading zero eg 03 12 2008

51224
digits	zero
single digits days can start with a leading zero eg 3 02 2008

51227
value	field
what i would do is use a regex to match a few date formats and then use a separate function to validate the value of the date field so extracted

51239
progress-bar	progress
the progress-bar class manages the progress and the format of the line is given by a number of widget

51242
beautifulsoup	mechanize
this is probably overkill for such a simple task but if you plan to do more than that then it s saner to start from these tools mechanize beautifulsoup because they are much easier to use than the alternatives urllib to get content and regexen or some other parsing to parsing html

51244
web-hosting	hosting
the issue before used to be cost but sql-server 2005 express is free and there are lots of web-hosting companies which offer full hosting with sql-server for less than 5.00 a month

51255
javadoc	doxygen
doxygen generates javadoc style documentation although it looks like it s primarily intended to generate documentation from custom markup within your comments

51302
png	gif
the img tag lets you embed external image files jpeg gif png swf files and movie clips inside text fields

51302
display	height
i ve noticed that text fields have trouble with properly measuring their height if the images display in them are left or right aligned with text flowing around them

51307
execute	prepare
this utility methods combines prepare execute and fetchall_arrayref into a single call

51356
textbox	button
i have a list of items with textbox to input order and an apply order button that saves new values to the database and reorders reloads items on the page with the new ordering applied

51368
contains	set
positioning a div contains the spinner above the chart image with it s css display attributes set to none

51385
postgresql	mysql
postgresql sqlite and mysql as databases

51385
ruby	php
notepad++ for editing and script programming php ruby

51409
ubuntu	linux
the packages that could use more than 4gb of memory on ubuntu and other linux distro s are compiled with pae support

51492
attributes	properties
also i want it to be as close to xml as possible there must be support for attributes as well as for properties

51496
python	java
edit protocol buffers are made to be used programatically there are bindings for c++ java python ... so they may not be suited for your purpose

51500
software-quality	metrics
i d posted a list of software-quality metrics that i could think of off the top of my head that include

51512
python	java
yeah java has gotten better since 1.5 but for example you can iterate through a string in python with this same construct

51512
python	java
java has some of this but usually in java it takes half a page of code to get an instance of a class whereas in python it is about 3 lines

51521
dictionary	arrays
but again you shouldn t ever have to actually read it load it into whatever language you are using and it should be transformed into native arrays dictionary variables whatever

51521
json	xml
oh i do find json far nicer to parse than xml i ve used it in javascript and the simplejson python module - about one command and it s nicely transformed into a native python dictionary or a javascript object thus the name

51550
document	element
soup.title finds the first title element anywhere in the html document

51553
python	java
postgres 8.3 takes 200 ms to execute this query on my macbook pro while java and python perform the same calculation in under 20 ms 350 000 rows

51553
python	java
i wrote some tests in java and python for context and they crush sql except for pure python

51553
python	java
no the python code and java code do all the work in house so to speak

51580
json	xml
also i don t see how xml s angle brackets are less human readable than json s square brackets curly brackets and quotes

51602
malloc	free
you only need to manually free strings when you manually allocate the memory yourself using the malloc function in c or the new operator in c++

51619
push	pull
i want to make centralized push pull git repository available to all my team members over the internet

51624
silverlight	wpf
the rich presentational capabilities of wpf and silverlight mean developers like me will be working closely with graphic designers more often these days as is the case in my next project

51624
silverlight	wpf
so i responded ok but what about xaml files in wpf silverlight

51640
file-descriptor	stdin
you shouldn t be comparing the file-descriptor with anything unless checking for stdin stdout stderr or doing math with it

51642
revision	svn
this may be a bit off topic i m replying specifically to your question about source control and graphics but you can put binary data images etc. into source control and in my opinion in a lot of cases should -- they just take up more disk space and you can t use a diff view to analyze what has changed in any meaningful way but what you do gain is a history of commit messages documenting each revision rollback ability and the ability to easily archive tagging a revision in svn terms all files be they visual assets documentation source code whatever belonging to a specific release version together

51656
usb-flash-drive	floppy
removable the drive is a removable storage device such as a floppy disk drive or a usb-flash-drive

51664
malloc	free
there are also potential problems if you are passing memory between your main .exe and .dll files as if each of these static links the runtime you can end up with malloc free mismatch problems

51668
python	java
to be a little fairer your test for java and python should cover the cost of acquiring the data in the first place ideally loading it off disk

51673
sql-server	mysql
i m coming from a ms sql-server mysql background and ids11 seems overly complex i am sure with good reason

51687
modal-dialog	lightbox
has anyone implemented lightbox style background dimming on a modal-dialog box in a mfc non .net app

51726
dictionary	hashmap
i typically write a function that performs a query using sql and then puts the results into either a list or dictionary in java i d use either an arraylist or a hashmap

51730
handler	service
in order to do this i think you d need to create a cocoa application that was registered with os x launch service as the default role handler for smb links

51751
postback	ajax
i have a asp.net website that is failing on ajax postback both with asp.net ajax and a 3rd part control in ie

51764
arrays	map
i return information within arrays or map

51793
value	field
mail from gets set to the from property value and if you set sender it only adds another header field in the data section

51829
base-class	inherited
it sounds like the simplest thing to do here may be to create an abstract base-class with all of the common gis members and then to inherited the other x classes that will have nothing more than the necessary nhibernate mapping

51866
having	select
to do this i m using ms vc++ .net 2003 and mappoint europe 2006 to do this but am having problems as when i select insert activex control no mappoint control appears in the list of options

51879
versioning	migrate
migrate the database to the latest versioning

51887
windows-xp	windows
so my question is there any way to find out the operating system overheads scheduling overhead on a typical windows system i run windows-xp if my applications says it ran for 60 milliseconds out of that 60 msec how much time really was used by my app

51901
csv	xml
just last week i used regex find replace to convert a csv file to an xml file

51927
contains	elements
how do i figure out if an arrays contains an elements

51932
msbuild	nant
i ve used cc.net with nant and msbuild with great success would highly recommend it

51933
python	java
i still can t see why the java python tests are invalid

51934
put	get
every gis data of the same type should be a class but my user has the possibility to get new set of data and put it in the database

51936
linux	unix
also you may want to take a look at the windows resource kits tools which include timeit.exe similar to time on unix linux to give you elapsed and process times

51948
environment	building
i m building a c++ mfc program in a multilingual environment

51953
updating	updates
it works out very well if you just want to display textual updates on progress and avoids the need for an updating dialog at all

51968
msbuild	nant
i used cc.net together with nant and msbuild

51968
msbuild	nant
nant was used to call msbuild to build the visual-studio .sln files and do all the other build steps like running tests etc

51994
keyboard	mouse
getting a big external monitor will help as will a nice mouse and keyboard

52051
comma	words
removes any non-alphanumeric characters spaces comma exclamation points etc. to allow for full sequences as above as well as simple words

52062
jgrapht	jgraph
checkout jgrapht for a very simple and powerful java graph library that is pretty well done and to allay any confusion is different than jgraph

52074
linux	unix
that means on windows it uses and on unix linux mono it uses

52098
keydown	keyup
edit apparently i can capture the keydown and keyup events on the combobox which allows me to set the focus or tab to the next control

52100
profiling	trace
your dbas will be much happier with you because they will have one place to go for query tuning the sql will be easy to read and they won t have to dig through profiling trace to find the many different queries being generated by your code

52101
arrays	loops
it is bad practice to use for...in loops to itterate over arrays

52116
keydown	keyup
i believe directionals are only capture on keydown and keyup not on keypress

52122
python	ruby
python and ruby are duck-typed

52122
python	ruby
because dependency injection is easier in dynamically typed languages the ruby python developers feel like their language understands the lessons of oo much better than other statically typed counterparts

52137
python	ruby
the duck typing comments here are more attributing to the fact that ruby and python are more dynamic than c#

52140
dialog	pop-up
when we chose flash 6 years ago we did so for its large number of features for user interaction like dragging stuff opening and closing menus tree navigation elements pop-up dialog etc

52179
put	get
in the end i can probably put up with 200 ms response times but knowing that 7 ms is a possible target makes me feel unsatisfied as even 20-50 ms times would enable more users to have more up to date queries and get rid of a lots of caching and precomputed hacks

52179
postgresql	mysql
i just checked the timings using mysql 5 and they are slightly worse than postgresql

52255
contains	any
variant contains any variables except

52256
administration	account
i need to check programmatically in .net whether a given user domain account is a member of the built-in administration grouping on a current computer the one where the application gets executed

52266
keyboard	mouse
if you had one controllers running on the box in front of which you sit you could use keyboard and mouse input to switch it between open sockets with different renderers

52280
javascript	dom
firebug - a myriad of productivity enhancing tools includes javascript debugger dom inspector allows you to edit the css html on the fly which is highly valuable for troubleshooing layout and display problems

52295
json	xml
restful with xml json and rss outputs

52302
python	perl
i don t have an answer to the tool question but i will say it is fairly easy in any text processing language perl python etc to randomly generate sentences from a bnf grammar and slightly more verbose in a bigger language java c etc but it shouldn t be too hard to roll your own

52324
scripting-language	dsl
i ve done exactly as hazzen commented using an embedded dsl in a scripting-language

52347
required	checked
the simplest way is to set a cookie via javascript and checked for it on postback.however if you re looking to minimize spam you should actually have the browser perform a simple task which required javascript execution

52357
stderr	stdout
usually stderr is the same as stdout so clog is the same as cout

52357
stderr	stdout
is it possible to redirect clog cerr cout stdin stdout and or stderr

52365
stderr	stdout
is it possible to redirect clog cerr cout stdin stdout and or stderr

52373
internet-explorer	firefox
it only works on internet-explorer or if you have the firefox extension installed

52381
shell	bash
if you re in a posix shell environment i m really thinking of bash you can redirect any

52382
value	field
you could check - have javascript that populate a hidden form field with a specific value after the page loads

52382
value	field
then when the page posts back to the server check that hidden form field the expected value

52390
reflection	runtime
when an exception-handling is thrown in addition to the stack unwinding operations etc that take place which others have mentioned you should be aware that a whole bunch of runtime reflection related stuff happens in order to populate the members of the exception-handling class such as the stack trace object and the various type members etc

52395
32-bit	64bit
object references are 4 8 bytes in a 32-bit 64bit jvm

52401
yourkit	jvm
so the only correct way is to ask the jvm which a good profiling i use yourkit which probably isn t what you want

52414
vbscript	jscript
a lot of people use vbscript for classic asp but you can use javascript jscript on the server as an alternative

52426
.net-framework-version	.net
in iis for web app this is quite easy just go to the property of the virtual directory application and go to the asp.net tab you should see what version of .net you are actually using or rather what version of asp.net which is pretty much tied into the .net-framework-version

52430
cursor	row
is there an easier better way to calculate the date difference between the current row and the next row in my initial result set without using a cursor and temp table

52449
constructor	object
i am building a constructor to return an object based on its name rather than its id

52456
version-control	cvs
cvs is a long way from state of the art in version-control

52458
profiling	debugging
jvmti is the debugging and profiling protocol

52469
licensing	platform
but i m having a little trouble separating the tools from the platform itself in regards to the licensing

52486
internationalization	localization
flash used well allows easy localization and internationalization

52541
webmail	gmail
sure there is webmail but even gmail is far away from the comfort of modern outlook or thunderbird clients

52541
google-chrome	firefox
google google-chrome ie8 and firefox 3.1 start to go in a better direction but it will take years for them to be mature enough to create javascript applications that actually can fully replace desktop apps

52542
google-docs	spreadsheet
about 1 of users actually use google-docs spreadsheet full-time

52549
subtraction	addition
addition subtraction multiplication division

52551
google-docs	spreadsheet
compare microsoft office words and excel with google-docs and spreadsheet

52563
display	width
however if i try to do this for the textbox the effect is different and the textbox takes its default row count as width even if i set display block for the textbox

52565
boost	stl
really c++ templates are the enabling technology for stl and much of boost and c doesn t have them

52582
profiling	trace
a profiling trace can help a lot

52590
while-loop	loops
in the case above i d probably use a while-loops instead so the multiple expressions on init and loops would be more obvious

52616
cvs	git
i would look at a few options cvs subversion git bazaar visual sourcesafe and see which one s meet your team s desires the best

52621
windows-xp	windows
we already allow them to use sql express but we wanted to see if we can suggest windows-xp as a low cost alternative to windows server

52633
margins	padding
your problem is that the 100 width does not include any padding or margins value

52634
linqdatasource	gridview
i ve got a linqdatasource that points to my model and a gridview that consumes it

52634
linqdatasource	sqldatasource
i thought it might have to do with the linqdatasource so i added a sqldatasource and the same thing happens

52646
frame	width
so i thought iframe - even though i m not a fan of frames i thought that i could create a frame that matched the width and height of the content so that it would appear native

52670
put	get
that would constitute one spot to get those resources and also the ones the asp.net asp.net-mvc team put out

52691
jgrapht	jgraph
if you were using jgraph you should give a try to jgrapht which is designed for algorithms

52702
content-disposition	content-type
basically the idea is to open the file as a stream and then to write the file stream to the reponse specifying the content-type and content-disposition headers

52702
content-disposition	content-type
content-disposition is used to preserve the file name content-type of course to clue the browser about what app to open to view the file

52702
stream	send
so the real final solution will not open the entire file into a single byte arrays but rather will open the file as a stream and then send the file down to the client in bite size chunks perhaps roughly 10k in size

52703
ubuntu	linux
machine running ubuntu linux 8.04 with php version 5.2.4-2ubuntu5.3

52711
virtual-machine	vmware
one other thing my development machine is a vmware virtual-machine

52725
gridview	formview
the bind method really isn t for the repeater it s more for the formview or gridview where you are editing just one item in the list not every item in the list

52778
environment	building
in my current environment we have a clean building machine which has an exact copy of all committed changes nothing more nothing less

52778
environment	building
what do you do in your environment to isolate changes for test building and release

52785
javascript	dom
in javascript i add a div to the dom

52786
environment	building
i prefer to make and test building on my local machine environment before committing or promoting any changes

52792
document	element
the div needs to be added to an element for it to be part of the document

52795
click	mouse
it doesn t let you specify what monitor an app starts on but it lets you move an app to the another monitor and keep its aspect ratio intact with one mouse click

52844
wxpython	gtk
if it makes a difference i am using wxpython and so far i have only tested my code on linux using the gtk backend but i do plan to make it multi-platform and using it on windows and mac using the native backends

52855
remote-debugging	debugging
there are at least four different ways to do user-mode remote debugging using windbg as documented in the remote-debuggingging section of the debuggingging tools for windows help file

52871
any	set
i get to launch the app in the normal way without worry about getting windbg to set the right working directory pass any command-line arguments etc

52875
parentheses	operators
if you intended that the result of the operators be the templates argument then you d need to enclose the expression in parentheses

52876
webforms	asp.net
since you are no using webforms you cannot use any asp.net control

52876
webforms	asp.net
it is a nice framework if you are sick and tired of asp.net webforms and want to perform everything on your own

52881
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
also i don t think it is so much that asp.net mvc is so much better than cakephp or codeigniter ruby-on-rails etc. the great thing about asp.net mvc and other asp.net-based technologies such as monorail is that developers who are using asp.net now have the option of following the mvc pattern using tools and languages they are familiar with

52893
webforms	asp.net
if you are quite happy with webforms today then maybe asp.net mvc isn t for you

52893
asp.net-mvc	webforms
webforms is also inherently difficult to test and while you can use mvp it s not a great solution for a web environment... compared to asp.net-mvc

52896
margins	padding
the correct box model states that the width applies only to the content and padding and margins add on to it

52896
margins	padding
the original ie box model also known as quirks-mode include padding and margins in the width

52939
breadth-first-search	dijkstra
of course depending on the size of the graph you want to solve you could first try simpler algorithms like breadth-first-search or dijkstra s algorithm basically every search algorithm will do and for every one you will need a cost function or similar anyway

52946
python	c++
python c++ weave multi-language procedural

52981
command-line	cmd
db21034e the cmd was processed as an sql statement because it was not a valid cmd-line processor cmd

52984
code-coverage	emma
how do i setup an ant task to generate emma code-coverage reports

52991
silverlight	wpf
often you download a silverlight or wpf sample application from the web and open it up in blend just to have blend crash on you because the code doesn t run well inside the designer

52991
silverlight	wpf
if your designer is new to xaml wpf and silverlight start by introducing them to the project team and have them do some basic designs in the tools they know

52998
ninject	moq
this is an approach to api creation that newer libraries like ninject and moq are using

53010
margins	padding
the gist of it is that you assign a large amount of padding to the bottom of the column and a negative margins of the same size

53010
margins	padding
more or less the padding margins value allow the box to keep expanding until it reaches the end of the wrapper which is determined by the column with the most content and any extra spaces generated by the padding is cut off as overflow

53023
account	api
you can usually get an account with an sms service provider and send messages using an api soap resful http smpp ....

53025
constructor	object
i might have a view object that spawns a deleteobjectcommand instance due to some user action passing references to two of its own private member functions one for success one for failure let s say deleteobjectsuccesshandler and deleteobjectfailurehandler in this example as callback function references to the command class s constructor

53056
hashtable	set
if you do this just keep in mind that the hashtable s size needs to be set bigger than your dataset when you start otherwise you are going to rehash the data which will triggers reinserts and more equals evaluations though possibly more realistic

53056
gethashcode	tostring
for some objects not this one a quick hashcode can be generated by tostring .gethashcode certainly not optimal but useful as people tend to return something close to the identity of the object from tostring and that is exactly what gethashcode is looking for

53063
runas	cmd
use runas cmd to run gacutil as a user with local admin rights to register the dll to gac

53094
contains	any
this is also easier to deal with than costants as you can put any type of value within the property arrays string int etc whereas constants cannot contains arrayss

53106
value	field
get the value of assemblyqualifiedname and paste it into the typename field

53108
value	field
given a parentid is it possible to write an sql statement to add up all the value field under that parentid and recurse down the branch of the tree

53112
wordpress	concrete
to give a concrete and representative example suppose i would like to use subversion and eclipse to develop plugins for wordpress

53126
.when	ready
develop on the ide as you would normally then .when you re ready to test check in to your local repository

53172
32-bit	64bit
this must be useable on 32-bit machines as it will be shipped to random people who are not expected to have 64bit machines

53181
any	set
the problem is that any user can read those but only an administrator or by extension your setup install program can set them

53184
32-bit	64bit
this version is for 32-bit ints but the logic can be extended for 64bit or higher

53196
checkbox	textbox
if you don t want the user to be able to input a straight-out connection string you can put together one made up of four textbox and a checkbox

53200
parentheses	braces
the preferred way of wrapping long lines is by using python implied line continuation inside parentheses brackets and braces

53217
difference	count
if done right the user should get the best experince out of the game without having to go into the settings screen and tweak themselves and you should have to worry less as a level designer about keeping the polygon count the same across difference scenes

53246
beautifulsoup	elementtree
python developer fredrik lundh author of elementtree among other things has a function to unsecape html entities on his website which works with decimal hex and named entities beautifulsoup will not work with the hex ones

53248
32-bit	64bit
i wonder if there are difference between 32-bit and 64bit operating systems because i am certain both my server and home computer are running the same version of .net

53260
postdata	request
obviously if necessary the login page could dynamically generate a form with all the post parameters to pass them along though that seems messy but even then i don t know of any way for the login page to redirect the user on to their intended page while keeping the postdata in the request

53287
contains	set
most databases these days have a set of tables which contains data about the layout of your actual schema tables quite handy for this sort of thing

53295
web-services	api
they only provide a java web-services api

53308
ruby	php
you can do web service clients in .net php ruby or pretty much any modern web technology out there

53339
.net	wcf
if you opt for the second route and need to put some of the original gui code into a controller the controller and service can communicate via wcf .net remoting or plain socket connections with a protocol you define yourself

53347
export	report
it works on my machine but when deployed to the webserver the icons export print etc on the crystal report toolbar do not display or work

53359
binary	octal
also be aware of the affects that the current accepted solution may have on parsing hex octal and binary numbers

53359
binary	octal
in ruby numbers that start with 0x or 0x are hex 0b or 0b are binary and just 0 are octal

53471
debugging	trace
if you are in a network you can also try debugging by getting a network trace

53475
attributes	properties
attributes are just properties usually

53486
solaris	unix
at university when i was doing most things under unix solaris i used gdb

53507
httpresponse	httprequest
this is true because it uses the new abstractions classes for httpcontext httprequest httpresponse etc

53507
asp.net-mvc	webforms
sometimes webforms and the rich third party control vendor availability will be preferable and in some cases raw simplicity and fine-grained html control will favor asp.net-mvc

53538
sql-server	mysql
in mysql you can use the roughly equivalent match function in the order by section but i haven t found any equivalence in sql-server

53546
32-bit	64bit
note that not all 32-bit kernels are capable of running 64bit processes

53548
gethashcode	equals
we had a requirement to overload the equalss operator and therefore the gethashcode function of our objects as they had become volatile and stateless and sourcing themselves directly from data so in one place of the application we needed to ensure that an object would be viewed as equals to another object if it was sourced from the same data not just if it was the same reference

53562
persistence	hibernate
what are the steps required to enable hibernate s second-level cache when using the java persistence api annotations entities

53571
code-coverage	emma
if you do this it s a good idea to use a code-coverage tool like emma to see if your private methods are in fact being executed from your tests

53602
outlook-calendar	exchange-server
i am looking for a solution to export shared outlook-calendar yes i m using exchange-server and yes i can copy calendar to my local folders which would allow me to export

53616
python	ruby
using a dynamic scripting language like python boo ruby etc

53639
python	php
your backend could be php or python but you want to use the controls from the asp.net toolkit is there a successful way to do this

53676
enterprise-manager	toad
when trying to connect to an oracle user via toad quest software or any other means oracle enterprise-manager i simply get the error

53692
required	checked
i favour designing any build-system for a particular project such that it required checked out a single module eg

53692
environment	building
where possible all tools used by the building environment should be runnable simply by checking out the module myprojectbuildingenvironmen rather than requiring machine level install

53692
configuration	environment
as a final note the script for starting the build should always examine the environment and tell the user if any tools are missing or any machine configuration needs to be tweaked to successfully complete the build

53695
postgresql	mysql
can t you live with postgresql or mysql

53715
ondestroy	oncreate
tbaseform has oncreate and ondestroy procedure with the code to do this but if someone ie me forgot to add inherited to the oncreate on tanyotherform would delphi call it for me

53716
virtual-machine	vmware
i use a mac therefore my windows-vista and xp is virtualized in a vmware or parallels virtual-machine

53729
macros	vba
as a general tip if you know how to do something in excel but don t know how to do it in vba you could just record a macros and look at the recorded vba-code works at least most of the time

53753
keyboard	mouse
i use a great piece of software called synergy this allows me to use one keyboard and mouse across 3 machines and use the copy paste buffer between machines including images

53766
perl	c++
we have perl scripts wrapping our pipeline which includes clearcase vs2005 c++ intel fortran inno setup

53766
webserver	host
we use cron jobs on unix to schedule the build and host a simple apache webserver to view and monitor the build

53767
selected	button
right click anywhere on the page selected inspect element and then click the resources button

53800
logout	login
it s the capability to keep running through login logout cycles i need

53802
javascript	dom
i m currently working on a javascript tool that during the course of its execution will ultimately traverse each node in the dom

53816
textile	bbcode
one common way to do this is to use a markup like textile markdown or bbcode

53820
windows-xp	windows
be as soon as i click in a windows opened by windowss explorer or as soon as i open windowss explorer i m using windowss-xp the full screen windows is minimized.

53822
implements	extends
since you say you have no control over it might i recommend extracting an interface from it of the methods that you do care about and making a mydbconnection extends db_connection class that implements your interface

53826
32-bit	x86
there s also a small scripting if you are interested in the x86 32-bit specific flags that are the most optimized

53835
packaging	building
i d define building as something like preparing packaging and deploying all artifacts of a software system

53835
interpreter	runtime
interpreter languages have the disadvantage that syntactic or structural meaning calling a methods with wrong parameters etc. errors normally will only be detected at runtime if you don t have a separate step in your build which checks for such errors with phplint

53835
simpletest	phpunit
thus automated testcases like unit-tests - see phpunit or simpletest - and frontend-tests - see selenium are all the more important for big php projects to ensure the good health of the code

53835
ruby	php
there s a great build-tool like ant for java or rake for ruby for php too phing

53839
keyboard	mouse
characters can change appearances make sounds move other characters respond to the keyboard and mouse etc

53868
sql-server	mysql
i used hibernate in my previous job to connect to both mysql and sql-server but i have since switched over to .net so currently i work with linq and i really enjoy it

53883
debian-based	ubuntu
the erlang compiling process described in ciaran s post described for ubuntu 6.10 btw can be easily skipped using apt command in any debian-based distro

53913
xsl-fo	xslt
i m trying to produce sheets of photographs with captions arranged in a grid using xslt and xsl-fo

53925
pointers	stack
you can also try to get the value from the stack pointers register with some assembly

53925
pointers	stack
you better not do it close to the end because your estimation address of local variables or value from stack pointers is probably a bit too optimistic

53925
pointers	stack
it s not uncommon to address memory beyond the stack pointers

53937
common-lisp	lisp
in emacs lisp and common-lisp you have the position function

53937
common-lisp	lisp
if you re learning lisp make sure you have a look at practical common-lisp and or the little schemer

53967
dictionary	map
i have a class that map objects to objects but unlike dictionary it maps them both ways

53988
double-quotes	single-quotes
you ll need to escape them for php too unless you change your double-quotes to single-quotes

53989
required	checked
i can think of one upside and three downsides you don t need the 100+ lines of html javascript and css that are otherwise required but you have no plugins detection no versioning checked and you lose your best seo option progressive enhancement

53999
ienumerator	ienumerable
just implement the ienumerable interface no need to implement the ienumerator unless you want to do some special things in the enumerator which for your case doesn t seem to be needed

54019
linux	unix
a href rel nofollow noreferrer http_load a on a linux unix client

54026
placeholder	required
well i can but that would required scanning innerhtml content for scripting tags and replacing them in the string by placeholder and then inserting them using the dom

54050
user-roles	account
we have an asp.net application that manages it s own user-roles and permission database and we have recently added a field to the user table to hold the windows domain account

54090
webserver	host
vista home basic only has enough iis features to host wcf services and does not have any of webserver features for hosting static files asp.net etc

54114
document	element
thanks to the wonders of javascript though you can just assign your own function to the write methods of the document object which uses innerhtml on an element of your choosing to append the supplied content

54147
textbox	button
i want to insert some special characters at the caret inside textbox using javascript on a button

54159
python	php
why do you want to use the asp.net ajax toolkit with php python

54159
jquery	dojo
have you considered other non asp.net specific ajax libraries like jquery dojo mootools yui

54159
python	php
asp.net ajax and the asp.net ajax toolkit is asp.net centric you ll gain more flexibility using other ajax libraries with php python

54162
textbox	button
note that if the user pushes a button focus on the textbox will be lost and there will be no caret position

54167
textbox	onblur
i m not sure if you can capture the caret position but if you can you can avoid jason cohen s concern by capturing the location in relation to the string using the textbox s onblur event

54188
put	get
or put another way can part of the write be complete and get interrupted and then the read happen

54219
any	set
our editor works by loading a set of files deserializing them working out the relationships between them and keeping track of any bad states it can find

54230
children	tree
in his examples his user grouping are set up as a cascading tree with the most general user type being at the top of the tree and its children branching off for each more restricted access type

54242
16-bit	8bit
the width of the bus between the cpu and ram can affect the atomic nature a correctly aligned 16bit write on an 8086 was atomic whereas the same write on an 8088 wasn t because the 8088 only had an 8bit bus whereas the 8086 had a 16-bit bus

54243
pointers	stack
if you call a function pointers that is null it can be 0x00000000 and if you corrupt your call stack the return can pop any random value into eip

54249
electronics	temperature
i m thinking the temperature in the safe while not enough to damage paper will damage the delicate electronics in a flash drive or warp the platters on a hard-drive

54270
google-chrome	firefox
google google-chrome and the upcoming firefox 2.1 promise an order of magnitude better performance in javascript

54382
methods	extend
extend properties and override the properties class storetoxml methods to call your new class s save methods

54403
debian	linux
debian live provides the best tools for building a linux live cd

54403
ubuntu	debian
sudo apt-get install live-helper # from debian unstable which should work fine from ubuntu

54440
selected	listbox
i want to add the selected item from the treeview to the listbox control using databinding if it can work with databinding

54444
interlocked	atomicity
use atomicity operations like interlocked on windows and the equivalent on linux

54481
perl	php
the standard design usually follows what getopt does there are getopt libraries for many languages .net python c perl php etc

54503
revision	svn
when executed via the shell script i get the following error looks like there is some problem with the process execution of svn that i use to get the log data for the revision

54527
textmate	vim
in regards to code chunks i have found and started using a vim plug-in called snipmate which mimics textmate s snippets feature

54578
stderr	stdout
bonus for technical explanation of why the app normally writes output to the cmd shell but when stdout and or stderr are redirected then the app writes nothing to the console or to stdout stderr

54595
z-index	overlap
you really are left to do it on your own that is manually walk through the elements you re interested in and compare their positioning size z-index to your x y point and see if they overlap

54656
getter	setter
however as soon as the data requires flow control getter setter that maintain or protect an internal state or starts acquring any major functionality basically more object-like it will get upgrade to a class to better communicate intent

54674
autotools	gnu
i m wondering if there is any nice and neat tool to replace the gnu autotools or make to build a very large c++ project which are such a complicated thing to use

54696
command-line	tasklist
the only way i can think of doing it is by invoking a command-line application that does the job for you and then screenscraping the output like linux s ps and windows s tasklist

54708
gridview	datalist
i can t seem to get at the data the way i would in say a datalist or a gridview and i can t seem to come up with anything else on google or quickly leverage this one to do what i want

54717
python	perl
there are however languages like perl and python that are particularly suited to quickly solving problems

54717
python	perl
i would suggest learning either perl or python and then use your judgement on when to use it

54720
groovy	java
because you re a java developer and you mention that you have java everywhere you might look at groovy

54750
perl	php
perl for quick text processing php for small internal web applications .net for our main product cygwin for filesystem stuff

54773
data-access	nhibernate
and here is a detailed post by the nhibernate team blog on data-access with nhibernate including implementing paging

54782
perl	ruby
but if i were you i would pick a scripting language like python ruby or perl and start trying to solve some of these small problems with this language

54808
spaces	output
are there great competitors in the merge data onto form and output a pdf spaces

54811
uptime	reboot
if someone will swear at the computer and looses productivity while it reboot when your software goes down then uptime is worth spending thousands on most internal software

54817
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
this seems like an object state invalid scenario to me so i d pick invalidoperationexception over argumentexception the parameters are valid but not at this point in the objects life

54819
expectations	assertions
however as this post suggests if you prefer separating your expectations from your verifications assertions you should opt for the fluent syntax

54827
groovy	java
since you already know java you can try jvm languages like groovy jruby beanshell etc

54827
scala	java
scala has much lighter syntax than java has a repl is statically typed and runs on the jvm - you might give that a shot as well

54830
typedef	struct
struct are also handy for various metaprogramming tasks like traits templates that just expose a bunch of dependent typedef

54887
exception-handling	try-catch
you should be catching the exception-handling in a try-catch block

54963
selected	checkbox
the idea is that for each of these innumerable dropdowns and checkbox if the dropdown has something selected the user wants to match that item

54984
selected	button
if you also want to disable the windows â œsend error reportâ dialog on your computer right-click on the â œmy computerâ icon selected â œpropertiesâ switch to the â œadvancedâ tab and click on the â œerror reportingâ button

54984
radio-button	selected
in the options dialog selected the â œdisable error reportingâ radio-button

55012
oracle	mysql
sql server mysql oracle and their brethren are servers

55019
command-line	cmd
ctrl + up down in a cmd windows scroll back forward cmd-line like the mouse wheel

55029
http	ssl
i d suggest looking at the request in the code that renders the form and if it is not using ssl issue a redirect to the http url

55031
expression	evaluation
short-circuiting can improve performance by not evaluation an expression that cannot alter the result of the logical operation

55031
contains	any
for example if the expression include a call to a function procedure that procedure is not called if the expression is short-circuited and any additional code contains in the function does not run

55041
python	java
you write your backend code in python and the frontend code in java and possibly some javascript which is then compiled to javascript

55041
json	xml
you can just use json or xml interfaces just like with other ajax frameworks

55048
checkbox	textbox
when i do a rename in resharper there s a checkbox below the textbox where you type the new name that says synchronise file name with class name

55067
formatting	import
there you can get your import organized ctrl+shift+o and formatting of code ctrl + shift + f

55093
unsafe	out
as it turns out i can t even find an unsafe way to cast between the things

55130
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

55133
variables	boolean
isset checks whether a variables or expression returns a null value or not and it returns a boolean which can be evaluated by the first part of your ternary without any errors

55147
dialog	pop-up
however for a variety of reasons it needs to be embedded in the parent control not a pop-up dialog

55964
installation	upgrade
do i have to do manual work like saving the installation folder in a registry key upon first installing and then read this key upon upgrade

55983
exception-handling	try-catch
i ve seen too many try-catch blocks where the catch does nothing but rethrow the exception-handling

55993
value	field
a const is a compile-time constant whereas readonly allows a value to be calculated at run-time and set in the constructor or field initializer

55999

to associate your name with your assemblies in the eyes of windows you ll need to get a digital-certificate the portion of the pfx file contains your name signed by a trusted authority

56124
32-bit	64bit
can i run a 64bit vmware image on a 32-bit machine

56132
32-bit	64bit
i honestly doubt it for a number of reasons but the most important one is that there are some instructions that are allowed in 32-bit mode but not in 64bit mode

56132
32-bit	64bit
specifically the rex prefix that is used to encode some instructions and registers in 64bit mode is a byte of the form 0x4f 0x40 but in 32-bit mode the same byte is either inc or dec with a fixed operand

56135
.net	wcf
wcf communication options in the .net 3.5

56137
.net	wcf
there is also .net remoting which i found quite cool but i guess they are obsoleting it now that they have wcf

56164
silverlight	wpf
on julian dominguezâ s blog you ll find an article about how to do something very similar in silverlight which should be easily adaptable to wpf

56164
textchanged	textbox
if it is add a handler to the textchanged event on the textbox that will call the command specified in the property

56190

i like to use double-quotes around strings that are used for interpolation or that are natural language messages and single-quotes for small symbol-like strings but will break the rules if the strings contains quotes or if i forget

56198
32-bit	64bit
you can t run a 64bit vm session on a 32-bit processor

56198
32-bit	64bit
however you can run a 64bit vm session if you have a 64bit processor but have installed a 32-bit host os and your processor supports the right extensions

56223
32-bit	64bit
i have a 64bit debian running in vmware on windows-xp 32-bit

56227
revision	svn
i would like to start tagging my deployed binaries with the latest svn revision number

56227
revision	svn
however because svn is file-based and not directory project-based i need to scan through all the directory s and subdirectory s files in order to determine the highest revision number

56241
revision	svn
svn info will show you the working copy s revision number see the revision line in the output from svn info

56250
32-bit	64bit
if you have 64bit hardware and a 32-bit operating system then maybe

56258
revision	svn
here s part of our build script our c# application gets the svn revision number included

56267
updating	updates
i d suggest either updating before running info or if you ve already updates for your build you re golden or using svn info url-to-source

56269
elementtree	lxml
another way is using the e factory builder from lxml available in elementtree too

56284
debugging	trace
besides it sounds very weird to autogenerate an own exception just to find get a stack trace for a debugging

56297
key-value	key
the properties are basically just key-value pairs however there are some special key like the svn executable if this property exists for a file subversion will set the filesystems s executable bit for that file when checking the file out

56298

56332
32-bit	64bit
if you have 32-bit hardware no you cannot run a 64bit guest os

56337

shutdown	restart
i have noticed that after the iis pool is restart after a idle shutdown or a recycle the application takes up to 20 seconds before it is back online and application_start is reached

56366
silverlight	wpf
if administration portal is part of application and will only be used from computers where your application is installed there are plenty of advantages of going fully silverlight - or even wpf

56368
silverlight	wpf
i would definitely go for a full silverlight application specially if you have good experience from wpf

56368
silverlight	wpf
you will be able to reuse your knowledge from wpf and should be able to pick up silverlight fairly quickly

56368
silverlight	wpf
silverlight also has all the hooks needed for great accessibility support as the ui automation api from wpf is brought into silverlight

56371
silverlight	wpf
if you re determined to have rich-client style development and your audience is small for admins only then i d probably recommend wpf over silverlight as it currently provides a richer set of tools and controls

56373
eclemma	emma
using emma in eclipse via the eclemma plugins the methods call is display as not being covered even though the code within the methods is

56388
pointers	stack
so i m sitting here playing catch up listening to stack overflow podcast #20 and joel is talking about the excel guys at ms who wrote their own compiler to improve the performance of code that worked with pointers and it got me wondering

56412
webserver	upload
if you want to keep it really basic simply upload a version.txt to a webserver that contains an integer version number

56418
environment	execution
in managed environment you ll be shot and hanged not necessarily in that order for loading executable content from the web and then actually execution it

56418
updating	updates
before updating make sure that you have write-permission to the install directory and warn the user if you do not or just don t updates at all

56424
frame-rate	fps
however when we swapped out the card for one with 512 mb of ram the frame-rate struggles to get above 40 fps

56433
lgpl	gpl
there might be a perfectly good library that i can t use in my commercial application because of a viral license gpl vs lgpl

56436
scheme	let
let s just remember that competitive advantage is not always almost never in the big scheme of things due to software and thus many many people can use existing components without risking their business

56445
duplicates	elements
my goal is to have a working application enhanced when javascript is enabled without the need to duplicates or recreate elements of the app

56460
order	add
but we also can t just add various measurements like this ad infinitum since given enough statistics any particular shuffle will appear highly unlikely for some reason this is one of very few shuffles in which cards x y z appear in order

56463
shell	bash
also if you re using a shell such as bash in cygwin and you re familiar with emacs consider using eshell the emacs shell instead

56464
json	xml
the only changes you would need in your asp.net-mvc app would be to handle the ajax requests and return the data as json xml etc

56466
chi-squared	probability
for a very simple test on a card shuffling algorithm you could do a lot of shuffles and then run a chi-squared test that the probability of each card turning up in any positioning was uniform

56487
any	set
i m using fox since foxpro 2.5 to visual-foxpro 9 and you are never forced in any way to hard-code a path you can use set path to syourpath you can embed the icons and bitmaps in your exe app file and therefore there s no need of including this resources externally

56537
callback	methods
the setupauth and checkaccess methods are called in the appcontroller s beforefilter callback

56568
between	sql-in
that beats sql-in a situation where given two dates how many workdays are there between the two dates

while for most datetime operations i would normally convert to unixtime and perform addition subtraction etc

56596
typedef	struct
typedef struct _image_nt_headers

56596
typedef	struct
typedef struct _image_optional_header

56596
value	field
there is a simple way to obtain these value using getmodulehandle null will give you the imagebase handle of your module address where you ll find a image_dos_header structure which will help you to find the image_nt_headers structure imagebase+image_dos_header.e_lfanew - image_nt_headers and there you ll find those field sizeofstackreserve and sizeofstackcommit

56611
json	xml
how to escape xml content with xsl to safely output it as json

56613
constructor	object
as an aside rather than using a datatable you can set the datasource of the datagridview to a bindingsource object with the datasource of the bindingsource object set to a bindinglist your class which you populate by passing an ilist into the constructor

56615
google-chrome	safari
google google-chrome and safari have a very similar console and right-click options for inspect element

56630
switching	screens
it will be in one place if you scroll to the top of the page and as you scroll down at some point where its original home is about to scroll off the page it will switching to fixed positioning and stay on your screens

56632
associations	model
the great thing about using the ruby-on-rails activerecord as a model in asp.net-mvc is that it gives you an automatic orm object relational mapper and easy way to create associations between models

56645
web-deployment	web
one solution appears to be web-deployment projects wdps an add-on for visual-studio and msbuild available that builds a web project to a directory and can optionally merge assemblies and alter the web.config file

56655
updating	updates
no sooner had i posted the above updates than a colleague laptop failed after updating the video driver

56682
directory	folder
scanning an entire directory recursively will not work for me because the folder is much too large

56695
archive	backup
you can speed this up by using the archive bit though it may mess up your backup software so proceed carefully

56695
any	set
scan all the files - any with the archive bit set have changed

56698
hash	md5
i have been looking into using a md5 hash but i can t find any good examples of traversing an object like this and returning a manifest of the specific differences not just indicating that they are different

56713
instrumentation	profiling
it is a slightly different mindset to a traditional profiling that instrumentation the code

56723

56860
principles	lsp
i have heard that the liskov substitution principles lsp is a fundamental principles of object oriented design

56873
inherited	subclass
the gang of four stated in their book because inherited exposes a subclass to details of its parent s implementation it s often said that inherited breaks encapsulation

56878
base-class	inherited
one important difference is that you can only inherited one base-class but you can implement many interfaces

56878
base-class	inherited
so you only want to use a base-class if you are absolutely certain that you won t need to also inherited a different base-class

56896
handler	service
the only solution i was able to find since the owner of the web service was unwilling to change anything on his end was to write a handler class that axis would plug into the pipeline which would delete the bom from the message if it existed

56900
strtotime	mktime
you can use a combinations of strtotime mktime and date todo the arithmetic

56904
principles	lsp
the liskov substitution principles lsp lsp is a concept in object oriented programming that states

56904
principles	lsp
this allows us to use good object oriented principles like encapsulation and reuse and doesnâ t violate lsp

56905
arrays	loops
i stepped through asp.net ajax javascript files and what i discovered is the process goes into an endless loops trying to figure out the type of the arrays object

56912
base-class	inherited
theoretically you can override them from a higher base-class but essentially an interface allows you to add on only the things you need into a class without the need for inherited

56961
protected	public
base classes can declare protected and public functions that can be accessed by derivations

56986

57006
hide	show
apparently ie8 show the cells by default and you have to hide it with empty-cells hide but it doesn t work at all in ie7 which hide by default

your only alternative in 2008 is to get your users to upgrade their framework versioning now

57287
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m thinking webforms not asp.net-mvc though i suppose since this isn t a traditional page the difference may be minimal

57291
websphere	ibm
i was hoping there would be a similar mechanism for websphere that doesn t involve calling the ibm libraries or rely on rad to be installed on your workstation

57310
jython	jacl
one way to do it could be using jython or jacl scripting

57310
contains	set
edit especially the wsadminlib.py.zip download near the bottom of the page contains a huge set of examples and helper functions to get you started

57316
implements	abstract
on the other hand when you implements a bunch of services that share a common functionality you can either separate the common functionality into a complete separate class or you can move it up into a common base-class and make it abstract so that nobody can instantiate the base-class

57316
any	set
interfaces are fixed you release an interface as a contract for a set of functionality that any type can implement

57320
upgrade	migrate
if you have a few spare cycles you could migrate a separate branch of your apps in your scm which is running with the 3.5 runtime and when you actually need to upgrade you have a working branch assuming that you keep it up-to-date with some bi-weekly merge

57358
debugging	exit
my solution is to arrange my normal windows exactly like i want them then start debugging an application and once again arrange all of the windows the way i want usually making it as similar to my normal layout as possible then stopping the debugger and doing a file exit so that vs saves my settings

57370
constructor	object
you are passing object on the stack to the constructor and then holding references to their temporary addresses

57392
having	select
a benefit to having a dba involved in security logic for your application is that the different app features and roles can be partitioned in the database down to views so that even if dynamic sql and generic select statements are needed the damage from an sql vulnerability can be constrained

57399
registration	login
maybe you could set a cookie with a value that you associate with the email and put something up on the login registration page if you were unable to deliver the mail

57406
sql-server	oracle
i m familiar with sql-server indexed views or oracle materialized views we use them in our olap applications

57416
solaris	bsd
for linux bsd solaris

57424
python	java
i m fairly language agnostic - c java python etc are all fine

57434
javascript	dom
a classic simple mistake homebrew output filters make is to catch only and but miss things like which can break user-controlled output out into the attribute space of an html tag where javascript can be attached to the dom

57439
constructor	object
my problem is that createinstance fails with a no parameterless constructor defined for this object error unless i pass true on the non-public parameter

57463
constructor	private
if you absolutely require that the constructor be private you can try something like this

57465
versioning	migrate
i recently migrate a small project from 2.0 to 3.5 and didn t encounter any specific problems as the framework versioning are backwards compatible

57478
webforms	asp.net
i have never upgraded an asp.net application so i don t know about webforms but i guess it will work the same as winforms stuff

57479
firefox	safari
in all other browsers aside from firefox ie6 7 opera safari my append call actually appends the information below my existing option - select an

57492
pointers	stack
a pointers has its own memory address and size on the stack 4 bytes on x86 whereas a reference shares the same memory address with the original variables but also takes up some space on the stack

57492
pointers	stack
note what a pointers points to can be on the stack or heap

57492
pointers	stack
my claim in this statement is not that a pointers must point to the stack

57493
selected	textbox
the problem i have is that it is possible to enter a new value into a textbox selected save from the file menu and never persist the new value the one visible in the textbox because accessing the menu does not remove focus from the textbox

57496
xsd	xml
in addition to the app configuration stuff mentioned above if you use any xsd validation you will need to replace some code around loading and validating xml

57509
children	tree
the naive approach is to build a tree with the source node as the root and all its connections as its children

57523
startup	launch
make this virtual computer auto login to windows tweakui can set this up and then just launch the gui app using a shortcut to the startup folder

57528
vbscript	jscript
i seem to recall reading somewhere that the command object shouldn t be used in vbscript or jscript because of security vulnerabilities but i can t seem to find that article

app needs to run on the .net compact-framework v.3.5

57547
hotmail	gmail
my university does not allow our student-mailbox to forward to a private email account everybody uses either gmail or hotmail here

57573
expression	evaluation
the comma operator combines the two expression either side of it into one evaluation them both in left-to-right order

57573
for-loop	loops
indeed i seem to remember steve mcconnell s code complete advising against even using comma operators in a for-loop for readability and maintainability loops should be controlled by only one variable and the expressions in the for line itself should only contain loop-control code not other extra bits of initialisation or loop maintenance

57609
put	get
right now i m placing the cal values into registry keys that get put into the os image at build time

57615
response	timeout
we assume a timeout means empty response

57632
variables	boolean
one alternative would be to uses boolean variables in if-statement but these would need to be reset after every use

57641
profiling	debugging
phped also offers great debugging and profiling and the ability to add watches breakpoints etc in php code

57641
profiling	debugging
browser plugins also enable quick integration with firefox or ie visit slow url with browser then click button to profiling or debugging

57686
callback	methods
specify a callback methods that will store its data and set evt

57720
difference	datediff
it takes into account the fact that datediff computes the difference without considering what month or day it is so the month diff between 8 31 and 9 1 is 1 month and handles that with a case statement that decrements the result where appropriate

57722
forms-authentication	credentials
i ve created a site using the asp.net login controls and forms-authentication for membership credentials for an asp.net web application

57730
continuous-integration	build-server
i also run these builds on a cruisecontrol controlled continuous-integration build-server

57759
firefox	opera
i ve tried installing some other commercial apps opera foxit firefox only firefox will install under nonadmin and only if you select something other than program files which i was aware is off limits to nonadmin acounts

57760
authentication	login
the first block will call the login method and grab the authentication cookie out of the response

57762
build-server	msdeploy
msdeploy seems really interesting but unless i m interpreting the literature incorrectly doesn t help in the scenario of deploying from the output of a build-server

57762
configuration	environment
but even for deploying from one environment to another one would have to manually change configuration settings and web service urls etc

57767
arrays	loops
in this case each serves as an iterator whereas keys actually generates the entire arrays before loops starts

57776
any	set
i have a free standing set of files not affiliated with any c# project at all that reside in a complicated nested directory structure

57792
pascal	basic

57802
jruby	mri
actually production-ready mri and jruby

57803
decimal	hex
how do you convert decimal values to their hex equivalent in javascript

57807
decimal	hex
the code below will convert the decimal value d to hex

57815
administration	account
typically i create a domain user with only the specific rights on the network which i will require the server to have to write to the network backup drive i then add the account to local power users or local administration depending on what needs to be done on the machine however this isn t required

57836
hashtable	set
usually the union of the set of visited nodes and the set of not-visited child nodes the set of seen nodes is stored in a hashtable

57836
arrays	map
if you have really big number of states you might indeed need a bit arrays as mentioned by joseph bui 57509 but unless your states can be used directly or indirectly as indices to that arrays you will need to use a hash function to map states to indices

57880
managed-code	native-code
in addition to lou s advise for starting the debuggingger you can selected which debugging engines are used when attaching to an existing process by click on selected... in the attach to process dialog and choosing both managed-code and native-code

57884
prism	mef
mef s heritage ala prism certainly shows through but i think it would be odd if it didn t given that both frameworks are about composition

57912
value	field
in this same editing process users can define and change a list of valid value that can be stored in these user created field if the user wants to limit what can be in the field

57912
value	field
when the user changes the list of valid entries for a field if they remove one of the valid value they are allowed to choose a new valid value to map any rows that have this now invalid value in it so that they now have a valid value again

57912
updating	updates
the problem is i ve been trying to get them to updates under a single transaction but whenever the code gets to the part where it changes the schema of that table all of the other changes updating value in rows be it in the table where the schema changed or not.

57922
profiling	trace
if you have access to the database server try running a sql profiling trace while testing the scenario you outlined

57923
perl	php
i ve been writing c c++ code for almost twenty years and i know perl python php and some java as well and i m teaching myself javascript

57936
environment	execution
microsoft generally doesn t use the term virtual-machine in reference to a .net managed execution environment

57936
environment	execution
.net s bytecode il is somewhat different from java bytecode in that it was explicitly designed to be compiled into native code prior to execution in the managed environment whereas java was designed to be interpreter but the concept of platform-independent code is similar

57936
contains	set
the .net is basically a huge set of libraries provided by microsoft contains thousands of classes that can be used to develop applications

57936
contains	any
a compiled c# .exe contains platform-independent code that can be run in any .net-compatible environment including mono

57941
interpreter	runtime
all the .net languages do a similar thing compiling to il intermediate language which the .net runtime interpreter

57945
intermediate-language	cil
when you compile c# code to a .exe it is compiled to common intermediate-language cil bytecode

57958
checkboxlist	gridview
i can t argue with the utility of gridview repeater checkboxlist etc so i use them when i need that functionality

57965
compact-framework	.net
this function is available in .net compact-framework version 2.0 and better

58000
configuration	environment
i ve looked into the -dump-configuration switch to get the configuration files but this has a couple of problems 1 the generated configuration file has absolute paths which doesn t work in our environment some developers use macs some windows machines and 2 only works right when run from the ide so can t be build into the build process

58037
windows-xp	windows
also note that you effectively restrict your users to windows-xp sp2+ and windows vista

58038
.when	ready
then .when 1.4 is ready - it would be say 1.4.3500.0

58044
any	set
keep in mind any app can create its own set of registry keys and values so it s not just ms who would be necessary to such an effort

58055
base	zero
i was just saying that in my limited experience with linux the segment base is always zero

58070
getter	setter
so the classes folder had just the class properties and getter setter

58072
sigaction	signals
you can of course use a simple signals handler for this job too look at man sigaction for more info

58124
json	xml
to me the best java - json parser is xstream yes i m really talking about json not about xml

58125
decimal	hex
python developer fredrik lundh author of elementtree among other things has such a function on his website which works with decimal hex and named entities

58167
polymorphism	override
so difference between override and reintroduce is in polymorphism

58168
python	java
unlike java where there are exceptions that must be declared to be raised and some that don t have to be but that s another story any python code may raise any exception at any time

58175
pascal	delphi
you might take a look at free pascal as it includes a 64 bit version and is mostly delphi compatible syntax

58195
debugging	trace
fdt enterprise also supports debugging including breakpoints and stepping through your code not just trace

58197
deployment	install
localsystem definitely has the privileges to install applications that s how windows update and software deployment in active directory work so it should be able to uninstall as well

58218
actionscript	mxml
mxml just provides a quick way to build the ui etc but if you want to do it yourself with actionscript there s nothing stopping you this would also probably be easier if you already have that ui in as2 code

58232
keyboard	mouse
the way we use it is to replace users inputs by automating mouse mouse and clicks and keyboard presses

58242
pointers	stack
i actually wrote another post on stack overflow asking if there are other better approaches unsafe c# and pointers for 2d rendering good or bad

58248
firefox	safari
unless you re using some really esoteric browser features in general if something works in firefox i ve found it works without modification in windows safari

58262
expression-blend	wpf
you could try looking into wpf using visual-studio and or expression-blend

58270
entity-framework	ado.net
the ado.net entity-framework has the added advantage that your database tables can be viewed as entity classes inheriting from each other or as columns from multiple tables aggregated into a single entity

58280
handler	service
is it possible to use an unhandledexception handler in a windows service

58280
handler	service
this component adds a handler to system.appdomain.currentdomain.unhandledexception but as far as i can tell this doesnâ t achieve anything win a windows service so i end up with this pattern in my 2 or 4 service entry points

58301
directx	gdi
speed is usually faster than gdi and slower than directx and depends greatly on how you do things seen something to work 60 times faster after rewriting in a sensible way

58306
any	set
i want to choose any two records from the set and be able to show all simple paths between the chosen records

58354
contains	set
write a c# methods that takes a string which contains a set of words a sentence and rotates those words x number of places to the right

58358
linked-list	arrays
i enjoy the classic what s the difference between a linked-list and an arrayslist or between a linked list and an arrays vector and why would you choose one or the other

58363
memcached	apc
i would recommend memcached or apc

58369
textbox	onblur
first you can use each textbox s onblur event to set a variables to this so you always know the most recent active textbox

58369
firefox	opera
then there s an ie way to get the cursor position that also works in opera and an easier way in firefox

58375
filtering	sorting
if its something that will take fewer lines of clr code to tackle it string manipulation complex custom sorting or filtering etc. use this approach

58398
keyboard	mouse
if you plan on working off of the laptop by itself without external mouse kb monitor more than 60 of the time than the macbook pro with it s larger keyboard and monitor would be better suited

58406

58418
display	outline
this article outline how server side code can be executed to define the menu items that will be display

58431
arrays	loops
everything seemed rather messy the problem being that you can not just loops through the arrays concatenating the strings as you would add one too many commas either before or after the last string

58432
firefox	safari
i m assuming you would like to be ablt to use if globally or at least in ie firefox not just be installing safari as other have suggested

58437
if-statement	loops
it s not as clean as i d like it to be so i d still add comments but it s better than an if-statement or adding the first or last item outside loops

58441
concatenation	comma
in reality you would write this in a more generic way to reuse the same algorithm but abstract away the data type doesn t have to be strings and the operation doesn t have to be concatenation with a comma in the middle

58443
textbox	button
suppose you have a textbox in a windows and a toolbar with a save button in it

58443
textbox	button
in that situation if you edit the textbox and click the save button with the mouse there is a problem

58443
textbox	button
when clicking on a button in a toolbar the textbox does not lose focus

58450
exception-handling	try-catch
so because me.onstart args is called from within the try portion of a try-catch block i assume that anything that happens within the onstart methods is effectively wrapped by that try-catch block and therefore any exception-handling that occur aren t technically unhandled as they are actually handled in the servicequeuedmaincallback try-catch

58458
project-management	scrum
incidentally tdd works very well with a scrum style approach to project-management which is also usually light on documentation

58476
ubuntu-server	ubuntu
more recently we have even started to pick servers running ubuntu-server so that they most closely match our ubuntu desktop development machines

58477
moss	wss
as tyler commented you can run moss wss on vista but it s not supported

58486
search-engine	seo
google search-engine ranking factors by an seo company

58500
quicktime	qtkit
if you want to manipulate the camera directly from your code you must use the quicktime capture apis or the cocoa qtkit capture wrapper much better

58515
perl	php
most languages nowadays - perl mention by jon ericson php javascript - have a join function or method and this is by far the most elegant solution

58520
environment	building
we need to regularly synchronize many dozens of binary files project executable and dlls between many developers at several different locations so that every developer has an up to date environment to building and test at

58528
continuous-integration	build-process
you should look into continuous-integration and having some kind of centralised build-process

58537
constructor	object
his widgetholder takes a reference to a value object in the constructor

58537
constructor	object
as soon as the constructor returns that passed-by-value object will be destroyed and so you ll hold a reference to a destroyed object

58543
display	height
the cms display a footer so setting the height to 1 million pixels is not a good idea

58621
hash	md5
how do i make an md5 hash of a string with delphi

58638
contains	set
how do i take a set of polygons which contains arbitrary values and create a corresponding bitmap where each pixel containss the value of the polygon at that location

58647
methods	extend
however you could extend it and extend windowworkspace to use your new smartpartinfo override the onapplysmartpartinfo methods

58689
contains	any
if button are the only control you want to resize automatically you can also use bcm_getidealsize message button_getidealsize macros windows-xp and up only to retrieve optimal width and height that fits anything the button contains though it looks pretty ugly without any margins applied around the button s text

58700
windows-vista	windows
edit robocopy was introduced as a standard feature of windows-vista and windows server 2008

58701
output	mode
there s no particular python output mode but you can apparently improve the results by setting optmize_output_java to yes

58709

python	php
a non-open source approach is pdf creator pilot which provides more language options including c++ c# delphi asp asp.net vb vb.net vbscript php and python

58775
.when	ready
it can be important advantage for a server to operate in it s own pace and supply clients with data .when it is ready

58779
nested	order
but just to illustrate the point in order to make this code overflow on a typical computer the directories would have to be nested a few thousand times

58785
command-line	cmd
robocopy or robust file copy is a cmd-line directory and or file replication cmd

58785
windows-vista	windows
it has been available as part of the windows resource kit starting with windows nt 4.0 and was first introduced as a standard feature in windows-vista and windows server 2008

when interviewing recently i was often asked to implement a data structure usually linked-list or hashmap

58835
arcgis	gdal
i was originally using arcgis 9.2 but that doesn t work well with c# and 64bit so i am now using gdal

58843
base-class	subclass
this can surprise you especially when you subclass something and don t mark your version of the virtual methods as const - in that case the compile could fail on some function you ve never heard of before that was written for the base-class

58851
any	set
i am running an application through gdb and i want to set a breakpoint for any time a specific variables is accessed changed

58929
postgresql	mysql
postgresql db2 mysql and mssql all refuse to run the first query as it s ambiguous

58945
parentheses	operators
my favorite trick is using the null coalesce operators and parentheses to automagically instantiate collections for me

58957
value	field
by explicitly defining the column as from parts ie left side you will get a non null value assuming that the field has data in parts

58964
reflection	runtime
reflection proved too complex in terms of development effort tracking runtime errors etc

59006
getter	setter
the way getter and setter work a rectangle should satisfy the following invariant

59018
children	tree
hierarchical structure easy definition of a document tree with automatic links to siblings parents and children

59093
actionscript	mxml
flex seems to be thier name for the flex builder ide based on eclipse and the general approach of building flash files using mxml and actionscript rather than the normal flash tools

59093
actionscript	mxml
i think the mxml and actionscript approach flex is designed to appeal much more to programmers where as the flash side is designed more to appeal to graphic designers

59097
profiling	trace
if you are sure it is in the database layer i would recommend taking a profiling trace and bringing down the execution time of the most expensive queries

59097
versioning	upgrade
if you need more advanced database features sql-server express can be seamlessly upgrade to more sophisticated versioning of sql-server

59132
testng	junit
they all support junit and most support testng as well

59192
linux	osx
it is cross-platform win linux osx

59200
ipad	ios
ios 5 includes messaging for ipod touch and ipad devices so while i ve not yet tested this myself it may be that all ios devices will be able to send sms via mfmessagecomposeviewcontroller

59200
ipad	ios
keep in mind that this won t work on phones without ios 4 and it won t work on the ipod touch or the ipad except perhaps under ios 5

59225
streamreader	streamwriter
if you don t specify an encoding when you use most text i o classes you will write utf-8 with no bom and read by first checking for a bom then assuming utf-8 i know for sure streamreader and streamwriter behave this way. this is pretty safe for dumb text editors that won t understand a bom but kind of cruddy for smarter ones that could display utf-8 or the situation where you re actually writing characters outside the standard ascii range

59260
google-chrome	safari
so to do have a tooltip show up in both ie and firefox safari google-chrome opera use both an alt attribute and a title attribute

59276

what would be the difference if i replaced all calls to count column_name to

59298
msbuild	nant
we use a combination of cruisecontrol nant msbuild to generate a release version of the app

difference	count
is there any difference to the results or performance if i replace the count with count x

59332
difference	count
s the difference between count column and count

59345
python	perl
skype uses postgresql together with python and they have improved pl python to it s current state so i would doubt that python support is far behind perl

59369
difference	count
another minor difference between using and a specific column is that in the column case you can add the keyword distinct and restrict the count to distinct values

59385
difference	count
the major performance difference is that count can be satisfied by examining the primary key on the table

59389
triggers	insert
this can be done with simple on insert triggers which in turn call dblink to update another copy

59391
difference	count
in the referenced question it was asked what the difference was when using count and count somecolumnname and sqlmenace s answer was spot on

59412
difference	count
that may have been the case long long ago but any self-respecting query optimizer will choose some fast methods to count the rows in the table - there is no performance difference between

59416
defined	declare
this explicit declare that the particular specialization is defined elsewhere

59434
racket	scheme
racket formerly dr scheme has a nice editor several different scheme dialects an attempt at visual debugging lots of libraries and can run on most platforms

59436
web-applications	enterprise
as much as we would all like to say it is a benefit to programmers to be language agnostic is it really feasible to support multiple enterprise web-applications of the same type all written in different languages

59451
silverlight	wpf
i ve seen plenty of examples for wpf but nothing for silverlight

59460
httphandler	httpmodule
i did the parsing of the user-agent string at the page level but of course you could do this kind of logic in the httpmodule or httphandler level also

59480
hide	show
this is likely due to blocking from one of the controls wrapping it my gut feeling is that it s the popupcontrolextender - it tends to have odd behavior with updatepanel as it is intended to manage the events inside it for it s show hide purposes

59481
boost	stl
see boost pointer container for a container that does the automatic deletion of contained pointers for you while maintaining a syntax very close to ordinary stl containers

59554
instances	private
doanotherthing arguments returns i have a private instances of a variables and a function local-variables .

59600
versioning	upgrade
personally i would suggest you stick with delphi maybe just upgrade to a new versioning

59600
versioning	upgrade
another option would be to upgrade to a more resent versioning of delphi for .net and port your code to .net that way

59636
arguments	default
another interesting use of references is to supply a default arguments of a user-defined type

59638
