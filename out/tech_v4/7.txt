70035
python	ruby
if you want to stay on the oop side learn python or ruby both languages provide an easy way to create bindings to use your c++ code from a script for efficiency reasons

70035
haskell	lisp
if you need another approach to programming learn a functional language like lisp or haskell

70035
c++	lua
and if you need to include a fast and small scripting language inside your c++ application try lua

70035
scala	java
last but not least if you know java and hate it you can try scala a language where you can mix your java classes with your scala code very interesting

70046
seam	jsf
they basically abstract all the sql jpa in a seam component that jsf can easily use

70074
rescue	throw
now if do_aws_stuff throw a nameerror my rescue block gets triggers

70074
superclass	subclass
it seems that amazon amazon-web-services error isn t the superclass of the generated error - i guess since it s a module everything is a subclass of it

70083
installation	upgrade
there are plenty of 3rd-party addons for different payment-providers and other things and the built-in download-manager handles the installation of these as well as upgrade to the core code really well

70109
webforms	asp.net
i m writing an asp.net webforms with some dropdownlist controls on it

70109
selected	button
then user changes selected item in one of dropdowns asp.net doesn t seem to handle selectedindexchanged event until form is submitted with a submit button click

70136
hash	md5
2 in a client-server aplication with direct connection with the db to compare the user sent password to the application not the db user password hash with md5 so that the password not travel by the .net in plain text

70175
communication	messages
imap is a protocols for communication to a messages storage the actual storage is standardised in other ways

70179
constructor	object
factory classes are useful for when the object type that they return has a private constructor when different factory classes set different properties on the returning object or when a specific factory type is coupled with its returning concrete type

70179
constructor	private
ado.net data services has its own special dataservicehostfactory and asp.net has its applicationserviceshostfactory since its services have private constructor

70200
windows-xp	windows
that will get you into trouble with windows-xp in limited access mode as well as with windows vista

70239
javascript	dom
via a plugin you will be able to register your own mime type and then manipulate javascript the dom

70257
erlang	lua
it supports a large range of languages c c++ lua erlang ... and you can even write your own output formatter

70261
vba	vb6
unfortunately you can t use a vb6 vba function as a callback directly as vb6 only generates stdcall functions rather than the cdecl functions sqlite expects

70292
webforms	asp.net
as i put together each asp.net page its clear that most of the time i could use the standard html tags just as easily as the webforms controls

70296
hide	show
however if you remove the parameter to application.run then the application will be started with no form shown and you will be free to show and hide forms as much as you like

70299
daemons	systemd
on the systemd you are initiating the transfer from you can run an ssh-agent daemons and add the private half of the key to the agent

70299
linux	unix
this should be do-able on either a unix linux system or on windows platform using pageant and pscp

70307
macros	let
let s say you programed a macros to jump to the head of a line insert a tab and then jump down one line

70357
document	element
the resource located by the href attributes value is parsing as an xml document and the children of the xsl stylesheet element in this document replace the xsl include element in the including document

70361
attributes	properties
i would rather push it so css so for the few controls i have done in the past i have simply stuck a string properties which allows you so type in the string which in then slung in a style attributes when rendering

70361
attributes	properties
i know i could also use the cssclass properties and apply the class attributes

70375
gethashcode	equals
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode methods for each object must return the same value

70375
gethashcode	equals
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different value

70375
gethashcode	equals
the gethashcode methods for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return-value of the object s equals methods

70377
directory	folder
is there any way to prevent visual-studio from creating a vsmacros80 folder in my default project directory

70384
emacs	vim
vim is rapidly turning into the emacs of the new century

70388
compression	streaming
so they re not compatible in the sense that one methods can use a streaming from the other but they employ the same compression algorithm

70392
bazaar	git
is there a distributed version control system git bazaar mercurial darcs etc. that can handle files larger than available ram

70402
quicksort	mergesort
they re both o nlogn and yet most people use quicksort instead of mergesort

70405
tokenize	parsing
i m doing simple string input parsing and i am in need of a string tokenize

70410
virtual-machine	vmware
one way would be to use the team foundation system client under windows in vmware and check out or whatever tfs calls it your sources to a directory on your mac that s shared with the virtual-machine

70421
mergesort	in-place
is in-place mergesort requires extra memory linear to number of elements to be sorted

70423
quicksort	heapsort
but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average

70427
quicksort	mergesort
i m a bigger fan of mergesort than i am of quicksort for these reasons

70428
stable-sort	mergesort
mergesort is a stable-sort unlike

70428
quicksort	heapsort
quicksort and heapsort and can be

70428
quicksort	in-place
variant of quicksort with in-place

70430
quicksort	mergesort
i think there are also issues with the amount of storage needed for mergesort which is Ã® n that quicksort implementations don t have

70440
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is usually faster than mergesort just because it s easier to code a tight implementation and the operations it does can go faster

70440
quicksort	mergesort
it s because that quicksort is generally faster that people use it instead of mergesort

70440
quicksort	mergesort
i personally often will use mergesort or a quicksort variant that degrades to mergesort when quicksort does poorly

70447
iframe	popup
directing to http page from http page unintentionally - note that this includes fake pages such as about blank i ve seen this used as iframe placeholders this will needlessly and unpleasantly popup a warning

70447
authentication	access-token
non-secure cookie - security-related cookies such as sessionid authentication token access-token etc. must be set with the secure attribute set

70452
quicksort	mergesort
i d like to add that of the three algoritms mentioned so far mergesort quicksort and heapsort only mergesort is stable

70453
python	perl
shell script perl or python or is there anything else

70459
perl	ruby
in one of my talks on the subject i even give an example of a test suite written in perl c ruby and html yes html -- you d have to see it

70473
python	perl
which can be combined together to do pretty much anything you can achieve using perl or python

70473
perl	ruby
on the other hand if the processes you want to automate are complex not just a linear sequence of steps then you ll probably find that writing the scripts in perl or python or even ruby

70486
python	ruby
it is maybe not as up to date as python or ruby but it does have massive library support from cpan

70486
python	ruby
if i was starting today maybe i would pick python or ruby but i don t know enough about them to make a judgement call

70488
python	perl
python has well-implemented o-o features for multiple inheritance polymorphism and encapsulation.n summary it seems to me that python dominates perl in most applications except for fairly short shell-script sorts of applications and there they are roughly comparable

70489
perl	awk
go for all three of them start with bash awk sed plus fileutils grep find and so on and then move up the abstraction hierarchy with perl and python

70489
python	perl
i say start with bash and friends because they are ubiquitous some machines will not have perl or python installed and you ll feel helpless there especially in traditional unix land ie not linux

70500
python	ruby
for more focus on code reuse and readability maintainability i d want to step it up it up to python or ruby

70511
python	ruby
python and ruby are roughly equivalent

70511
python	ruby
learn at least python or ruby well

70522
protected	public
therefore the rule of thumb is to try to define static nested-class with as limited scope as possible private class protected public and then convert it to inner class by removing static identifier and loosen the scope if it s really necessary

70527
getter	setter
if you re using eclipse then it has the capabilities to auto generate the getter and setter methods for the internal attributes it can be a usefull and timesaving tool

70533
linux	unix
when choosing a scripting language to help automate your linux unix environment the most important thing in my opinion is.

70533
vbscript	perl
i am currently working in an environment where the lead unix guy is a real script head but he has mainly restrained himself to using bash with some perl and windows vbscript thrown in for good luck

70535
getter	setter
there is a standard pattern for getter and setter in java called bean properties

70536
cryptography	security
cryptography is not the solution to your security problems

70546
model-view-controller	dependency-injection
if said system is the components of a single application then there are various techniques such as those involving asp.net-mvc model-view-controller and interfaces for ioc dependency-injection that facilitate decoupling of components

70546
json	xml
then there are things like json which is like xml but optimized and google protocol buffers which optimizes the interop but is typically precompiled and not late-coupled

70548
getter	setter
most ides for java will automatically generate getter and setter code for you if you want them to

70548
getter	setter
eclipse even include automated-refactoring that will allow you to wrap a property up in a getter and setter and it will modify all the code that accesses the property directly to make it use the getter and or setter

70556
connection-pooling	pool
this would be something like a set of user-controls sitting on a form or a pool of database connections and a connection-pooling class

70558
constructor	object
i normally do this by having a second constructor that i call passing in the mock object

70558
constructor	object
the normal constructor would have just loaded the com object as normal

70561
switching	screens
if it s an old crt imac then you can t switch off the screens without switching the computer off - the convection from the crt is used to cool the processor

70613
anonymous-class	nested-class
an anonymous-class is a perfect example of a non-static nested-class which just has no name associated with it and can t be referenced later

70618
constructor	object
at the time of constructor call there is no object created yet so the polymorphism does not make any sense

70621
xcopy	cmd
rather than using xcopy we managed to use the -source dirpath cmd with unc addresses to the servers with msdeploy

70621
archive	backup
we then pipe this output to a log file which is then moved to the backup archive for reference

70627
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is not better it is well suited for a different kind of application than mergesort

70653
turbogears	django
i have found several method in web framework such as django or turbogears

70687
contains	set
if the parent contains multiple constructor the Ã¢ ÅsimplestÃ¢ one is called Ã¢ ÅsimplestÃ¢ as determined by a rather complex set of rules not worth bothering to learn in detail--just pay attention to what netbeans or eclipse tell you.

70687
implements	extends
such a declaration creates a new instances of an unnamed class which extends object and implements interfacename

70687
constructor	object
if you want a local inner class which implements multiple interfaces or which implements interfaces while extending some class other than object or which specifies its own constructor you re stuck creating a regular named local inner class

70705
bison	yacc
does having the allowed language syntax in a yacc or bison format give me a leg up

70708
contains	lookup
from my rather small experience developing full-text search engines i would lookup questions which contains some words from query in your case query is your question

70708
similarity	distance
after finding questions with words from query we might want to calculate distance between words we are interested in in questions so question with phrases similarity text ranks higher than question with discussing similarity you hear following phrases... text

70723
bison	yacc
yacc bison definitely gives you a leg up since good linting would require parsing the program

70740
environment	building
we use vmware-server as part of our building-system to provide a known environment to run automated db upgrade against so we end up rollback state as part of each building driven by cruisecontrol and have found this interface to be rock solid

70741
subtract	time
in the second loop you can subtract 1 from the index instead of producing an unnecessary 0th output list element that needs to be shift ed off and where you unnecessarily iterate m n time where m is the number of output lists and n is the number of unique elements iterating over the unique elements would reduce the iterations to just n which is a significant win in typical use cases where m is much larger than n and would simplify the code

70742
required	checked
i administrate several oracle-apps environment and currently checked profiling options in lots of environment by loading up forms in each environment and manually checkeding each variables which required a lot of time

70745
solaris	linux
date on linux converts to epoch but not on solaris

70771
versioning	migrate
yes is the long versioning for rake db migrate down

70771
versioning	migrate
in the meantime you may try to unset versioning before you call migrate .

70772
linkedhashmap	treemap
if you want a reliable iteratior order there s linkedhashmap and treemap

70783
python	ruby
the great news is that languages like python and ruby are open sourced and you can download and study the c source code in order to better understand how it s done

70848
stdin	pipe
it gives you a unidirectional pipe with which you can access stdin and stdout of the program

70848
linux	unix
popen is standard on modern unix and unix-like os of which linux is one -

70848
openbsd	linux
in linux and openbsd popen produces unidirectional pipes which are read-only or write-only

70848
freebsd	netbsd
on os x freebsd and netbsd popen produces bidirectional pipes

70851
subtraction	addition
the traditional bodmas brackets orders division multiplication addition subtraction or pedmas parentheses exponents division multiplication addition subtraction are just subsets of all the possible operations and denote the order that such operations should be applied in

70858
stdin	pipe
create two pipes with pipe ... one for stdin one for stdout

70858
stdin	pipe
in the child process the one where fork ... returns 0 dup ... the pipe to stdin stdout

70881
multiplication	addition
precedence rules specify priority of operators which operators will be evaluated first multiplication has higher precedence than addition pemdas

70884
revision	updates
to recover a file that has been removed from the repository you essentially need to updates that file to its last revision number before it was actually deleted

70890
value	field
- instance however i m fed-up with the opening of pdf s and cutting and pasting value into field that i wish to record

70890
richfaces	dojo
i have seen the ability to draw custom images in other ria toolkits dojo but i can t see a way of doing this inside of richfaces

70900
subclassing	superclass
the name scrambling is used to ensure that subclassing don t accidentally override the private methods and attributes of their superclass

70902
contains	any
as such they can contains the exact same things that any other perl scripting can

70916
rubinius	jruby
the work done by the jruby and rubinius teams in creating a ruby spec is probably the most important outcome so far as it will help ensure that all implementations remain compatible

70924
required	checked
a lock structure is smaller in size and it required less atomicity operations to checked set release

70943
sql-server	oracle
both sql-server and oracle and i believe also others dbs support encryption of data at the database level

70945
bison	yacc
antlr looks to be an alternative path to the more common ok i heard about them before yacc bison approach which it turns out also commonly use lex flex as a front end

70998
graphviz	doxygen
for best results particularly when creating documentation for c++ install graphviz and enable in your doxygen configuration file

70999
haskell	perl
progress on perl 6 is slow but steady pugs perl 6 over haskell has been stalled for a while but audrey might resume workingon it soon

71014
.net	wcf
in .net world you can use datacontractserializer class from wcf or javascriptserializer asp.net

71065
solaris	unix
we have a collection of commercial mfc c++ applications which we sell using stingray objective toolkit we have source code license and have ported it in the past to solaris irix hp-ux aix using bristol technologies windu windows api on unix including mfc

71074
display	outline
i can make firefox not display the ugly dotted focus outline on links with this

71082
macros	basic
they either use teamprise explorer which is a standalone gui client to tfs compiled as a universal binary or they have macros inside xcode that perform basic check-out and get operations in-conjunction with the tfs command line tf

71082
macros	let
if you want more details around the macros approach then let me know

71087
inner-classes	superclass
so suppose you want to share some methods for internal use between some unrelated classes e.g for string manipulation you can create sub classes of them as inner-classes of a class that has all the needed methods and the sub classes could use methods both from their superclass and from the outer class

71104
versioning	migrate
when db migrate queries env versioning it actually requests the versioning parameter which you set calling rake

71104
versioning	migrate
when you call rake db migrate you don t pass any versioning

71105
verilog	hdl
ladder logic can be transformed to one of the modern hdl s like verilog

71118
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in almost all browsers firefox ie google-chrome but whenever the page is opened in ie it prompts javascript error like

71150
directory	folder
i just found it out myself if you add a trailing backslash to the project folder setting changing it from c dev to c dev the vsmacros80 directory will no longer be created

71152
execute	prepare
it offers features like prepare + execute emulation for dbs that don t support it properly and allows you to use placeholder which is good practice to avoid sql-injection problems

71152
postgresql	oracle
it will work with mysql mysqli pgsql postgresql oci8 oracle sqllite msql mssql microsoft sql server sybase informix fbsql ibase odbc

71172
attributes	properties
have you tried adding the fetchtype properties to your relationship attributes

71190
any	set
you can unit test your clr code inside of vs using any of the standard unit-testing frameworks nunit mstest and you don t have to write a bunch of set up and tear down scripting that can be difficult to manage

71195
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
are the obfuscation binaries really safe from reverse-engineering

71196
ubuntu	linux
i use it with eclipse in linux ubuntu and fedora core windows xp and mac os x.5

71214
malloc	free
it emulates your program and intercepts calls to malloc free etc

71226
datagridview	databound
i am using a .net windows forms datagridview and i need to edit a databound column that binds on a boolean datatable column

71232
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
it s possible that the obfuscation binaries aren t safe from reverse-engineering just like it s possible that your bike lock might be breakable pickable

71240
installation	environment
depending on the installation environment your installer may also need to ask the user for a server port since your application may not be able to use the default http port

71242
google-chrome	safari
there are anti-aliasing differences between safari 3.1 and google google-chrome for whatever that s worth

71242
text-rendering	gdi
this will doubtless be because safari on windows uses its own text-rendering and antialiasing layer instead of windows s gdi

71283
inno-setup	nsis
msi is a fundamentally different way of working inno-setup nsis most other install take a code-centric approach you program the steps to install your data

71290
unmanaged	c++-cli
this sample code makes use of the toolhelp32 library from the sdk so i would recommend turning this sample code into an unmanaged c++-cli library with a simple interface like suspendprocess uint processid

71297
output	mode
if you are just producing a string then you should set the output mode of the stylesheet to text by including the following as a child of the xsl stylesheet

71317
machine-code	decompiling
in contrast to obfuscators .net reactor completely stops any decompiling by mixing any pure .net-assembly written in c# vb.net delphi.net j# msil... with native machine-code

71322
google-chrome	safari
firefox opera safari google google-chrome all work

71336
notepad++	jedit
jedit was kinda big in 2004 but now notepad++ seems to have taken the lead on windows

71349
cursor	row
first function moves the cursor to the last non-empty row in the column

71371
children	nodes
the last parameter to builder.node is arrays list of other nodes to be append as children according to the wiki

71374
windows-xp	windows
windows vista but my main target is windows-xp

71381
environment	building
fyi current environment is ant for j2me building

71397
emacs	vim
you can easily do things in vim in the normal course of editing that would require you to drop down to scripting in emacs

71406
bazaar	git
at least hg bazaar and git can use external merge utilities

71412
jedit	emacs
other than that i m quite happy with jedit - it s the best general editor i ve found so far for linux ducks as hordes of vi and emacs users light up their flame cannons

71429
teamviewer	vmware
should i use a vmware virtual workstation with some remote logon software like realvnc teamviewer logmein whatever... or should i invest in a full vdi system like sun or vmware provide

71436
contains	any
as an enum s definition doesn t contains any code that could depend on other code using the enum it s usually not a problem to define the enum completely when you re first declaring it

71436
implements	abstract
if you need a deeper degree of concealment for your implementation details you can break it into an abstract interface only consisting of pure virtual-functions and a concrete completely concealed class implements inheriting the interface

71451
forwarding	port
everything from redirection servers to just forwarding a port in your firewall to an ssh server and setting up the various tunnels

71468
python	java
preferably something that can be used from a windows command-line and or can be included easily in a java python program

71475
directory	folder
when the user clicks one of the those items the contents of the related directory are zipped in place and the resulting zip file is stored in a cache folder

71477
google-chrome	firefox
strangely firefox google-chrome does not prompt error but ie does which is bit difirefoxerent than what it used to be

71482
put	get
put on some music close down your email and get busy

71496
environment	building
the c++ name-mangling differs alot between different compilers and it s unlikely that a library built for visual-c++ will be possible to link from another building environment in windows

71511
google-chrome	firefox
sorry firefox google-chrome both report this error but in very silent way

71511
google-chrome	firefox
you need to go to firefox 3.0 javascript errors dialog to see if is there any error and for google-chrome you need to go to javascript console

71511
google-chrome	firefox
in my view there should be at least some ui indications like icon would turn red for such errors in firefox 3.0 as well as google-chrome

71541
user-input	output
xss a cross-site scripting vulnerability occurs when an application include strings from external sources user-input fetched from other websites etc in its x html css ecmascript or other browser-parsed output without proper escaping hoping that special characters like less-than in x html single or double quotes ecmascript will never appear

71546
text-rendering	gdi
5000+ text-rendering is slow even with gdi especially if you need scrolling

71552
text-rendering	gdi
gdi+ text-rendering performance article on his blog which answers the raw speed question on his system gdi drawtext was about 6 times faster than gdi+ drawstring

71594
order	add
i don t yet have the ability to add comments so i m adding this as an answer it was suggested by joel spolsky that such questions would be best phrased as one tool per answer please - this would allow voting on individual development tools thus is more likely to give you a list in order of popularity of the best tools to have

71631
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
many frameworks like ruby-on-rails java struts or cakephp practice this seperation of program layers

71635
session-cookies	cookies
make you any session-cookies or all cookies you use httponly

71642
textmate	jedit
i also paid for textmate and ultraedit at different times both very good but in the end jedit comes out on top for me

71645
updating	updates
b would be faster performance wise while reading your setup but it will require you more maintenance code when you will updates your class updating each function

71665
selected	cell
if selectionmode is not fullrowselect you ll want to additionally override setselectedcellcore and not call the base setselectedcellcore for rows you don t want selected as setselectedrowcore will only kick in if you click the row header and not an individual cell

71696
nstextview	appkit
see the section nstextview drawing redirection api in the 10.4 appkit release notes

71743
sitemesh	tapestry
i have used sitemesh and it is good for wrapping a set of pages in standard headers and footers but tapestry is better for creating components which are used on many pages possibly many times per page

71743
sitemesh	tapestry
tapestry components can take other components as parameters which allows the sitemesh style wrapping

71750
safari	opera
fyi this hack only targets safari 3 and also targets opera 9

71766
instances	private
in delphi i want to be able to create an private object that s associated with a class and access it from all instances of that class

71786
notepad++	jedit
the most highly recommended editors are jedit and notepad++

71790
httphandler	httpmodule
you could use an httphandler instead of an httpmodule

71798
bash	glob
an easy way in perl probably easily adaptable to bash is to glob the filenames in an arrays then get the sequence number and remove those that are not divisible by 4

71815
kate	nano
until now all work on the codebase has been done purely with nano or perhaps kate

71817
base-class	subclass
therefore it would be nice to modify the base-class in such a way that in a subclass the docstring of execute is automatically replaced with that of _execute

71826
versioning	upgrade
firstly the different versioning of oracle you re using is the reason for the table statistics error - i had the same issue when some of our oracle 10g databases got upgrade to release 2 and some were still on release 1 and i was swapping .dmp files between them

71861
haskell	c++
though it started primarily as a java ide it s been extended via plugins to support many others including c++ flex haskell and coldfusion to name a few and can fairly easily be adapted to a new language if support isn t already out there

71878
switching	router
if things like spanning tree protocols are enabled on a switching then you may find that what may have been the router card to begin with may not be anymore

71889
any	set
note that this class variables will be writable from any class instance hence you can set it up somewhere else in the code usually based on some condition type of logger etc.

71890
windows-xp	windows
for what it s worth i have had no trouble using sharpziplib to create zips on a windows mobile device and open them with winzip or windows-xp s built-in compressed folders feature and also no trouble producing zips on the desktop with sharpziplib and processing them with my own zip extraction utility basically a wrapper around zlib on the mobile device

71899
any	set
it works fine for realplayer and mplayer but the quicktime plugins doesn t respond to javascript if the hidden bit is set - is there any workaround for this

71915
sql-server	postgresql
i use sql-server not postgresql so i m not sure if this will work for you or not but pop rivett had a great article on creating an audit trail here

71929
ndepend	fxcop
corey my answer of using fxcop had assumed you were interested in removing unused private-members however to solve the problem with other cases you can try using ndepend

code-metrics	dead-code
source patrick smacchia s code-metrics on coupling dead-code design flaws and re-engineering

71977
notepad++	emacs
something like vi is great emacs is also fine or if you absolutely must be on windows something like notepad++ or jedit will be decent

71983
any	set
2 set a breakpoint at the last known location that examplestring is used or modified without any problem

72006
n-gram	words
there are a few ways you can also pay some attention to n-gram strings of two or more words kept in order

72018
perl	awk
passing the data through perl sed awk one-liners can help with getting it in the proper format and the shell script can easily handle prompting for filenames handling arguments etc

72020
contains	any
unless this returns the error code for invalid argument or any other error bytesavailable contains the amount of data available for unblocking read operations at that time

72027
wordpress	blogs
if you absolutely must scrape content look for microformats in the markup most blogs especially wordpress based blogs have this by default

72036
webforms	asp.net
what is the best way to implement mutliple default buttons on a asp.net webforms

72051
base-class	inherited
you develop a data model like you ve done with product which inherited from ar s base-class which provides great querying abilities

72054
textbox	button
use a helper function like this one to tie the textbox to their associated button

72063
quirks-mode	doctype
of course html validity may not be a requirement for you so long as it works in most browsers and then the quirks-mode switching mentioned will get you without the doctype many browsers will switch to quirks-mode possibly changing the layout

72066
strawberry-perl	activeperl
i primarily use activeperl but i really like where strawberry-perl is headed

72074
sql-server	oracle
linq to sql only supports sql-server so if you ve an oracle then the decision is already made - nhibernate

72081
derived-class	base-class
when you define a function in a derived-class then it hide all the functions with that name in the base-class

72081
derived-class	base-class
if the base-class function is virtual and has a compatible signature then the derived-class function also overrides the base-class function

72114
entity-framework	nhibernate
i have not tried the entity-framework but i definitely would recommend nhibernate over linq to sql

72117
installation	building
if you were building perl code to be executed on a windows machine other than your own i would consider writing it with an eye towards a default or as default as i could get it as perl installation executing it

72126
subclassing	metaclass
you could then wrap this up in a metaclass to make it easier for people who are subclassing

72163
remote-desktop	rdp
on windows i always use remote-desktop rdp but on xp that only works on the pro versioning not the home versioning

72166
penetration-testing	security
we have hundreds of websites which were developed in asp .net and java and we are paying lot of money for an external agency to do a penetration-testing for our sites to check for security loopholes

72178
data-structures	map
if a tripple map is too tedious to use then is implementing other data-structures not worth the effort

72180
constructor	object
use python module zipfile to create zip archive but as the file specify stringio object zipfile constructor requires file-like object

72181
macros	let
the only solution i can think of is what kronoz says record a macros with c-x c-y c-x and then let the argument of c-u go to kmacros-end-and-call-macros instead that s c-u 9 c-x e or even just c-9 c-x e or m-9 c-x e

72192
base-class	subclass
since you don t want to override the one in the base-class you d have to give each subclass its own copy of execute

72206
arrays	map
use that as a hash function for a map or hashtable not as an arrays index you need to deal with collisions

72214
updating	updates
you can start a replication by creating a database from scratch and you can control either the updates will be done by updating the available client database or simply recreating the database

72218
show	next
1st page is contactlist next page is contact c0001 which show the contact details and the list of telephone numbers

72230
mocking	tdd
there is no need of mocking frameworks to do tdd

72244
selection	highlight
for an example of why it might be desirable to suppress selection see simile timeline which uses drag-and-drop to explore the timeline during which accidental vertical mouse movement causes the labels to be highlight unexpectedly which looks weird

72266
tuples	any
you could use a hash_set of any hashable type - for example turn each tuples into a string x y z

72267
order	add
another issue that occurs when using selected is that there are idiots who choose to add new fields in the middle fo the table always a bad practice if you use selected as the basis for an insert then suddenly your column order may be wrong and you may try to insert the social security number into the honorarium the amoutn of money a speaker may get paid to pick a non-random example which could be a very bad thing for data integrity

72274
decrement	increment
using recursion you re incurring the cost of a function-call with each iteration whereas with a loop the only thing you usually pay is an increment decrement

72278
credentials	ntlm
on intranet with nt domain you can use ntlm to pass windows credentials directly to servers in intranet perimeter without any need to duplicate sessions

72328
value	field
the clr likes to optimize instructions so when you access a field in code it might not always access the current value of the field it might be from the stack etc

72328
value	field
marking a field as volatile ensures that the current value of the field is accessed by the instruction

72399
internet-explorer	firefox
for me this has caused problems with pdf files among other types and for maybe-not-so-obscure reasons also with .zip files both under internet-explorer and firefox

72418
row	col
setfromrow will setup the object from an associative arrays of col value pairs and get as row will essentially serialization the object as col value pairs

72444
malloc	free
i ve changed the code to use malloc free

72456
.when	ready
.when you are ready to commit diffly makes it easy to selected the files you want to check-in and assemble a useful commit message.

72456
bug-tracking	bugzilla
bugzilla is a defect tracking system or bug-tracking system

72456
webmail	gmail
gmail is a new kind of webmail built on the idea that email can be more intuitive efficient and useful.

72464
google-chrome	safari
in safari the password label and input box are directly below the email label and input box while in google-chrome the password label and input box are indented approximately 75 pixels to the right

72469
dynamic-programming	memoization
you may want to look into memoization and dynamic-programming

72493
data-access	ado.net
the ado.net ole db provider is for generic data-access where you don t have a specific provider for your database

72496
value	field
this slot in the vmt can be used to store any 4-byte value but if you want to store you could always allocate a record with all the field you could wish for

72515
value	field
is it possible to change the type of control that is used for the value field of a property

72518
attributes	properties
i can t comment yet but note that by default visual-studio 2008 automatically steps over properties so the debuggerstepthrough attributes is no longer needed in that case

72528
checkbox	textbox
how would you create a database in microsoft access that is searchable only by certain fields and controlled by only a few necessary textbox and checkbox on a form so it is easy to use - no difficult queries

72528
checkbox	textbox
you have several textbox and several corresponding checkboxes on a form and when the checkbox next to the text box is checked the text box is enabled and you can then search by what is entered into said text box

72540
authentication	login
we are changing our remote login security process at my workplace and we are concerned that the new system does not use multi-factor authentication as the old one did

72541
postback	ajax
we ve implemented ajax using the asp.net update panel to avoid visible postback

72545
installation	building
by default the cpan installation process requires that tests pass after the building before a module will be installed

72556
treeview	grid
i am playing with microsoft s treeview control and i am trying to force a data update of some sorts while editing a node s label similar to updatedata for a grid

72580
linux	osx
by cross-platform i mean currently mac osx windows and linux

72605
command-line	cmd
you can use exec to run a cmd-line script such as cmd-line php and if you pipe the output to a file then your script won t wait for the cmd to finish

72633
double	int
but as you already have a working c# code porting it to actionscript might requires a redesign due to actionscript having a different way of thinking programming they use different primitive data types for example they use just a number instead of int float double etc

72643
click	mouse
for a question that vague all that i can answer is open ms-access and click the mouse a few times

72651
dialog	pop-up
you then have the choice of showing just a small pop-up windows below the property area or a full blown dialog box

72653
any	set
features most used by myself include integrated grep search which can include use of regular expressions with a nice user-interface code navigation ctrl-g for quser-interfaceck search and jump to any methods in unit custom key combinations eg you could set ctrl-shift-b to buser-interfaceld-all ascii chart for any installed system fonts

72662
development-environment	publishing
the only minor annoyance is that the debugging parameters execution path deployment-target etc. are stored in one of those files don t know which so if you have a standard for them you won t be able to publishing it via scm for other developers to have the entire development-environment ready to use

72664
configuration	upgrade
in response to your edit yes what you describe will prevent doing upgrade other than delete reinstall and remote configuration since the msi database won t know anything about the contents of your installer

72667
business-process	integration
my question is should i rewrite my workflow to make it a state machine to follow a best practice for human integration in a business-process or is the suspend activity a reasonable solution

72692
arrays	map
later on you could do all sorts of other processing on that file by the same file say you d want to have arrays and a hash map of them you could redefine q to do another job and be done with it

72708
sharepoint-designer	wspbuilder
for page layouts i use sharepoint-designer to create and tweak them and then put them into a wspbuilder solution in visual-studio and package them into a solution

72735
webforms	asp.net
also i may be jumping the gun a bit here but you could use the asp.net mvc stuff not yet officially released as of this writing which gets away from the webforms and gives you total control over the markup generated

72749
sql-server	postgresql
you don t mention what product but sql-server 2008 and postgresql and others i m sure allow you to create filtered indexes so you could create a covering index where is_deleted 0 mitigating some of the negatives of this particular approach

72760
unsigned	short
in visual-studio 2008 you may get a compiler error because bstr is defined as a pointer to unsigned short while wchar_t is a native type

72773
moss	wss
sharepoint 2007 both moss and wss exposes document libraries via web dav allowing you to create document via essentially filesystems level activities saving document to a location

72780
ordinals	numeric
since ordinals comparisons are actually looking at the characters numeric unicode value they won t be the best choice when you re sorting alphabetically

72785
subclassing	base-class
i agree that the simplest most pythonic way of approaching this is to simply redefine execute in your subclassing and have it call the execute methods of the base-class

72796
command-prompt	cmd
based on the help for the start cmd the first parameter is the name of the newly created cmd-prompt windows and the second and third should be the path to the application and its parameters respectively

72799
delphi	c++
i for one have windows development experience with builder c++ almost delphi and mfc almost qt with a bit more time working with builder c++

72820
decompression	gunzip
i ve used gzipstream to compress the output from the .net xmlserializer and it has worked perfectly fine to decompression the result with gunzip in cygwin winzip and another gzipstream

72820
cygwin	gnu
using the file utility in cygwin reveals that there is indeed a difference between the same file compressed with gzipstream and with gnu gzip probably header information as others has stated in this thread

72826
getter	setter
basically it generates a superclass with the getter setter and many other code-generation options

72828
rewrite	rule
i think you ll want to capture the http_host value and then use that in the rewrite rule

72844
blacklist	whitelist
either use a blacklist of stuff you do not want or preferably a whitelist set

72858
configuration	installation
that includes all the installation + configuration and stuff

72888
capitalize	substring
however if you are not working with a .net langauge then it depends on what the input looks like - if you have two separate fields for the first name and the last name then you can just capitalize the first letter lower the rest of it using substring

72908
textbox	button
so if the save button you are clicking on takes the focus then it will cause the update automatically because the textbox will lose focus

72921
message	alert
the difference is that instead of an alert message as in levik s answer i open a new windows similar to jacob s answer

72942
stderr	stdout
enable tracing logging in all third party apps and libraries you are using such that the errors are logged to files instead of stdout or stderr

72951
versioning	upgrade
i did and i even upgrade from 2.x versioning to 3.x

73008
webforms	asp.net
edit the site is built on asp.net webforms

73021
pascal	ada
in c++ ada pascal and other languages that support pass-by-reference you can actually change the variable that was passed

73046
value	field
my solution was to wrap the connection objects returned by odbc.odbc ... and pyodbc.pyodbc ... by a delegate class which contains the desired time representation function as the value of an extra field and which delegates all other field requests to the original connection object

73065
mouseover	mousedown
this has the advantage that normal win32 forms functionality will continue to work such as taskbar-flashing of the form when you click on one of its modal dialogs or the management of mouseover mousedown events would still work normally etc

73076
32-bit	64bit
the volatile keyword won t prevent potential corruption if the data cannot be handled atomically for example if the loop counter was of type long long 64bit then it would require two 32-bit operations to update the value in the middle of which an interrupt can occur and change the data

73084
sql-server	oracle
why not just use instr for oracle or charindex for sql-server combined with substring

73085
value	field
your value objects need some kind of identity field

73087
display	width
is there a standard x gnome program that will display the x y width and depth in pixels of a windows that i selected

73094
centering	fixed
use this technique and simply specify a fixed width for the centering column

73101
google-chrome	safari
i ve got a psp it has a browser that s based on webkit also google google-chrome and safari use webkit engine so pretty any site that works fine on safari google-chrome will work fine on psp

73101
opera-mini	safari
so generally if you want to target mobile devices you will have to make sure your ecommerce website works fine in small resolutions it doesn t use activex since it won t work on iphone safari opera-mini and psp browser etc

73109
innodb	myisam
the error shows up using both myisam and innodb table engines

73112
constructor	private
public protected and then private and within each section alphabetically although i often list constructor first and deconstructor last

73117
linked-list	hashmap
which will probably either be a hashmap based on time or a linked-list that iterates

73119
decrement	increment
increment a count for that function and line every time the constructor is called and decrement the count every time the destructor is called

73134
malloc	free
would i be better off changing this code to use malloc and free instead

73149
any	set
if the module s name does not contain any package information it is set to __main__ then relative imports are resolved as if the module were a top level module regardless of where the module is actually located on the filesystems

73150
snmp	mib
if that is not possible then it is okay to use oids as they should not change per the snmp mib guidelines

73150
snmp	mib
this is obvious but be sure to look at the attributes of the snmp mib variables

73157
malloc	free
yes that may since your allocating with new but deallocating with delelte yes malloc free is safer here but in c++ you should not use them since they won t handle de constructor

73176
click	mouse
the nice thing about madexcept is that it will generate a report for you with a full stack trace that will generally point you in the right direction as to what went wrong and can even include a screenshot as well has have this automatically emailed to you from the clients computer with a simple mouse click

73177
show	next
when the person asks for something the first time they get a bit of a wait and then it show up but if they refresh its immediate and then because its int he db its now part of the hourly updates for the next 24 hours from the last request

73191
click	mouse
last you need to override the wndproc to prevent the mouse interacting with the windows if the user tries something crazy like click on the darkened area

73191
.when	ready
.when you are ready to reverse the effect you dispose of the darkenarea instances and carry on

73195
getter	setter
getter and setter are uninteresing mostly so there is no need to read them

73202
bison	yacc
bison is readily available and at least on linux yacc is usually implements as bison

73217
web-services	api
i suggested trying to find out if the owners of the site have a published api often web-services for retrieving data from their system

73230
change-password	login
if a user saves the password on the login form ff3 is putting the saved password in the change-password dialoge on the profiling page even though its not the same input name as the login

73233
malloc	free
if you must do this then it might be clearer to use malloc and free in this case since then you or other programmers might be a little less likely to make assumptions about the types and sizes of the allocated objects

73236
python	php
i personally prefer python but php will work as well

73250
jface	swt
with the ongoing port of swt jface i plan to do more and work in d which i would have been done in java before

73254
return-type	arguments
the anonymous methods matches the delegate signature expected by the onlogin event void return-type + one object arguments

73259
callback	methods
delegates are equivalent to function pointers methods pointers callback take your pick and lambdas are pretty much simplified anonymous functions

73289
value	field
even if it were one of the multi domain value every appdomain always maintains a distinct copy of static field

73295
malloc	free
rather than switching to malloc free if only because it s a simpler change to make without making mistakes

73295
malloc	free
so i guess it s probably as easy to switch to malloc free after all

73305
required	checked
you may ask why we want this - the reason is we have an install that does a prereq checked and install anything required such as .net and we then downloads and execute the msi

73325
gedit	gnome
strange - no one mentioned gedit gnome or openkomodo windows mac gnu linux...

73326
ruby	php
there are a lot of frameworks based on ruby php python of course

73328
arrays	loops
just store a list of positions in an arrays and loops through with a different offset for each robot

73342
deployment	install
fortunately if you re using .net you can use clickonce deployment instead of an msi which should allow you to install to a folder in each user s profiling without requiring admin permissions

73350
sftp	ftp
built in ssh command line prompt sftp ftp etc support

73352
stretch	styles
if you really want the image to stretch to fit you can go a little further and add an image into that div and define its styles to fit width height 100

73363
stream	send
you could implements a stream that send data to outputdebugstring

73381
hide	next
then simply hide the part that is filled out and show the next part of the form.

73384
anonymous-class	abstract-class
you could do the same thing with nominal typing and implementing an anonymous-class that implements an interface or abstract-class but that ends up being a lot of code when only one function is needed

73393
required	checked
however you must note that any configuration changes that required changes to the registry probably i d have to double checked on that administration privileges

73399
javadoc	doxygen
edit i may have misread your question doxygen is a tool to generate documentation and models based off your code and javadoc

73415
environment	building
building off of icco s suggestion of svn i d actually suggest that if you are using subversion or similar for source control and if you aren t you should probably start you can keep the production environment up to date by putting the command to updates the repository into the post-commit hook

73418
xquery	xslt
you can tell tidy to generate xhtml which is a type of xml which means you can use all the usual xml tools like xslt and xquery on the results

73430
python	c++
python and c++ make a good combination see for example pygame

73468
shutdown	exit
i m coding the shutdown of a multithreading server.if everything goes as it should all the threads exit by their own but there s a small chance that a thread gets stuck.in this case it would be convenient to have a non-blocking join so i could do

73471
any	set
i have an editable datagridview with selectionmode set to fullrowselect so the whole row is highlighted when the user clicks on any cell

73471
highlight	cell
however i would like the cell that currently has focus to be highlight with a different back color so the user can clearly see what cell they are about to edit

73498
selected	button
when i m initializing a dialog i d like to selected one of the radio button on the form

73498
selected	button
how can i selected one of the several radio button

73514
entity-framework	ado.net
it has a host of issues that make it difficult to use in many enterprise situations -- which is why ms offers entity-framework ado.net 3.0

73518
wireless-connection	ethernet
for instances how do i say all connections to stackoverflow.com should use my wireless-connection while all other sites will use my ethernet

73519
boost	stl
i would like to remove stl boost debugging symbols from libraries and executable for two reasons

73519
boost	stl
debugging jumps into stl boost code which is annoying

73543
duplicates	elements
naming the input elements a duplicates reserved word thinking name methods reset etc.

73556
user-controls	treeview
meanwhile found the same hack-ish solution with forcing the focus to some other control not very elegant but works even though it s a bit harder for me since i use a treeview as part of a user-controls

73561
cryptography	security
by the way if you develop networked applications and care about data security the least you should do is read a book like practical cryptography by niels ferguson and bruce schneier and probably further reading that s more focused on web application security would be a good idea

73562
administration	account
you may have some sucess by adding a local account to the administration grouping and joining the server to the new domain

73574
http	ssl
ssl..or rather https http over ssl sends all http content over ssl and as http content and headers are in fact the same thing this means the headers are encrypted as well

73588
selected	button
use checkradiobutton to set select one button in a grouping and getcheckedradiobutton to retrieve the id of the selected button

73599
hotmail	gmail
how can i send an email by java application using gmail yahoo or hotmail

73621
command-line	cmd
but to direct traffic through the other interface use the cmd-line route cmd to add a route to the specific ip address you re wanting to redirect

73635
webserver	host
having a certificate is not enough you have to configure the webserver to encrypt the connections that is to use the certificate for that domain or virtual host

73667
perl	ruby
how can i start an interactive console for perl similar to the irb command for ruby or python for python

73670
tunnel	vpn
one caveat with modifying routes - vpn tunnel are not too happy about chnages in static routes once the vpn is set up so be sure to set it up at windows boot up after the nics are initialized through some scripting

73670
tunnel	vpn
static routes- these will work fine unless you are using a vpn tunnel

73687
cherrypy	django
if you want something simple without having to make your own framework while still not being all inclusive django you might want to try cherrypy

73688
toupper	tolower
so you are gonna have to call toupper on the first char and tolower on the remaining characters

73698
python	perl
there isn t an interactive console for perl built in like python does

73704
python	c++
python and c++ is a good choice but other style like c# c++ works

73704
python	c++
for scientific visualization python c++ is accepted like vtk s bindings in python

73719
swt	awt
in general most languages winforms java awt swt etc have an image or background image property that allows you to use images for button

73722
http	ssl
yes if you are using the https http over ssl protocol instead of plain http

73745
put	get
after a couple years i don t get all the files off that i put on them

73747
getter	setter
it will be true for property getter and setter

73753
conditional	operators
operators produces an assignable result 3 is assigned to the result of the conditional

73763
constructor	private
then you need to make the constructor private to prevent users to create their own foo

73763
instances	private
then you create a private static final foo field to hold the only instances and a public static foo getinstances methods to return it

73763
instances	private
you can use a private static class to load the instances

73765
shell	bash
it s a full on shell you can use it in replacement of bash for example but uses perl syntax

73777
archive	backup
1 backup to some optical media on a regular basis say burn it to dvd once a month and archive it offsite

73791
instances	self
that means if you change self in one test changes will not carry over to other tests since self will refer to a different instances

73876
javascript	dom
you could use javascript to traverse and pass the dom than make a call into your wcf service from the javascript when all the ajax calls are complete

73891
worksheet	excel
in excel vba this function will give you the content of any cell in any worksheet

73900
arrays	loops
just imagine it as being a 2d arrays of sorts and apply the same logic to loops through cells

73905
centering	fixed
have a fluid centering with fixed width sidebars

73930
assign	add
what do i need to add to my .spec file to create the desktop shortcut and assign an icon to the shortcut during install of my .rpm

73933
methods	extend
i have a custom category disciplines in my methods plugin which i want to use to contain existing disciplines from the scrum plugin and epf openup library as well as a few of my own some are new and others extend the openup ones

73933
order	add
i can add them simply order them as desired and view them in the browsing perspective and preview tab

73939
stream	send
the server can then send a stream of javascript commands like

73959
json	xml
jersey makes it easy to expose restful web services as xml and or json

73985
ruby	php
unlike ruby python php etc d tries to be almost as fast as c even if it is less dynamic and slightly more difficult to program in than scripting languages

73986
postgresql	mysql
you can start with a desktop tool like microsoft access or use the free sql server express or postgresql or mysql

73997
spring	guice
if you want to use pre-request injection such as in a web application you might find guice is quite a bit faster for dependency injection than spring

74003
gnome	kde
gnome will generally look in the kde icon directory to see if there are other icons there also..

74058
ifconfig	linux
however any mainstream linux distribution should have either the ifconfig program or the ip program or both

74075
debugging	trace
if you are using gdb or ddd to debugging you may be able to get away with removing the boost source files from the source path so it can t trace into the functions

74092
contains	any
i have a function in python which is iterating over the attributes returned from dir obj and i want to check to see if any of the objects contains within is a function methods built-in function etc

74108
highlight	selected
but for large datasets i need to be able to selected nodes and highlight all neighbours

74131
oracle	mysql
because the underlying file type excel spreadsheet vs openoffice oracle vs mysql etc

74139
json	xml
well you could store the data in a format you could read but which maintained the integrity of your data xml or json for instance

74174
itextsharp	itext
i can however recommend itextsharp which is a .net port of the java itext

74188
display	height
i ve created a listbox to display items in grouping where the grouping are wrapped right to left when they can no longer fit within the height of the listbox s panels

74198
decimal	hex
hex - decimal

74198
decimal	hex
decimal - hex

74200
administration	account
i have done this in the past to ensure that only the administration account can shut down a computer

74206
click	mouse
i have been playing with this for a while but the closest i have gotten is a button that opens the paste special dialog box and requires another couple of mouse click to paste the contents of the clipboard as unformatted text

74213
compact-framework	.net
windows mobile 6 devices come with .net compact-framework 2.0 in rom and also expose .net apis for a lot of things camera system notifications email contacts ...

74218
restart	reload
hup reload without restart

74223
decimal	hex
to convert from decimal to hex do.

74223
decimal	hex
to convert from hex to decimal do either.

74231
updating	updates
updates 2nd recordset with data available in the first recordset either by adding new records or updating existing records

74236
malloc	free
looking at the source it appears that someone did a search and replace for malloc and free and the above is the result

74240
fwrite	fclose
see fopen fread fwrite and fclose for a starting point

74269
updating	updates
after updating one of the objects fields i want the screen to updates

74273
sql-server	mysql
say if you use sqlite it is gears for smaller application but for web application you might a bigger one like mysql or sql-server

74297
sql-server	oracle
if you think you are going to ever need one of the heavyweights sql-server oracle you should start with one of those at the beginning

74299
sql-server	mysql
so if i m doing .net sql-server python via django or pylons mysql or sqlite

74327
malloc	free
this is also the reason why gc can be faster than malloc free

74327
decrement	increment
but the management cost of having to increment and decrement counters upon each pointers assignment cost a lot of time and some kind of garbage-collection is still needed to reclaim cycles

74340
compact-framework	.net
it covers a lot of topics in mobile development with the .net compact-framework and also the windows mobile platform

74340
windows-mobile	windows-ce
you also might want to learn about windows-ce which windows-mobile is a flavor of

74341
jquery	dojo
i ve rolled my own for years but when playing with others stay far far away from dojo + jquery

74346
google-docs	spreadsheet
also google-docs especially spreadsheet and forms are nice and free

74368
hotmail	gmail
i am trying to create an email two column flexible layout which works in outlook 07 i have created a successful version in outlook 03 hotmail gmail yahoo and aol in both ie and mozilla firefox however when testing in outlook 07 it stripes out my float left css

74372
solaris	linux
i am involved in the process of porting a system containing several hundreds of ksh scripts from aix solaris and hpux to linux

74372
solaris	linux
on aix solaris and hpux the output is flag true on linux the output is flag false

74372
solaris	aix
on aix solaris and hpux ksh is a variant of ksh88

74372
solaris	aix
on aix solaris and hpux dtksh and ksh93 where i have them installed are consistent with ksh

74372
solaris	linux
on aix solaris and linux bash is consistent giving the incorrect from my perspective result of flag false

74378
background-color	display
inside of my style rule declarations i keep all my rules well order going from display attributes positioning size margin border padding background-color text attributes line attributes word attributes to font-attributes

74386
delphi	c++
is it possible to call managed code specifically ironruby or ironpython from unamanaged code such as c++ or delphi

74386
python	ruby
for example we have an application written in delphi that is being moved to c#.net we d like to provide ruby or python scripting in our new application to replace vbscript

74386
python	ruby
however we would need to provide ruby python scripting in the old delphi application

74386
ironpython	ironruby
is it possible to use the managed dlls provided by ironruby ironpython from delphi code

74400
semantics	keyword
the static keyword in the above example is redundant a nested interface is automatically static and can be removed with no effect on semantics

74400
modifiers	final
the same goes for public on interface methods and public final on interface fields - the modifiers are redundant and just add clutter to the source code

74401
c++	lua
if your target is a pc i think you can try c# or embed lua in your c++ app and run scripts for high-level stuff

74406
postgresql	oracle
starting with a proper database like oracle or sql server or mysql postgresql if you are looking for free options is a good idea

74409
svg	vml
i m starting to think that it would be a simpler though less flexible to just use the free svg continent maps on wikipedia convert them to png and create an image map of all the countries - then use canvas and vml to draw an element on top of the countries - but this just seems like a huge pain and very error-prone compared to a flash solution

74420
delphi	c++
basically you are enabling your .net classes to be called through com activex from your win32 code delphi or c++

74421
versioning	migrate
it might be easier to install a more modern versioning of amy shell on the aix hp-ux boxes and just migrate your scripting to use sh

74446
solaris	aix
aix and solaris use versions of the original ksh so the kornshell.org version is usually feature- and bug- complete

74446
solaris	sunos
having cut my teeth with sunos solaris installing kornshell.org ksh is usually one of the first things i do on a new linux box.

74474
sql-server	oracle
now from working with oracle and sql-server 05 08 all i can tell you is that if you want the creme of the crop for stability scalability and flexibility then these two are your best bet

74483
arrays	loops
the ide comes with over 100 examples some language examples loops some learning examples arrays some fully-functional games and sims pong missile command game of life

74513
penetration-testing	burp
by far the most popular web app penetration-testing tool among security professionals is burp suite which you can find at

74513
value	field
well-known default form field names and value

74515
constructor	private
i have all the private fields then the public then the constructor then the main then the methods that main calls in the order they are called

74520
sql-server	oracle
but if your writing a customized solution for a large enterprise which must share data among multiple campuses and has a good sized it department then the decision of oracle vs sql-server would come down to what does the customer most likely already have deployed

74539
python	perl
but i have known programmers who wrote a perl or python script to try commenting out each include line one at a time and then compile each file

74547
environment	building
whatever tool does this would need to know your building environment as well

74552
perl	awk
parallelism means awk and perl and

74552
perl	awk
python and perl look ok while awk

74552
python	perl
and perl and python and perl do

74566
python	lua
lua and python are both popular for higher-level scripting

74585
ref	out
that s what ref and out parameters c# are for

74596
capacity	storage
i have seen significant performance gains from using the ensurecapacity int capacity methods call on an instance of stringbuilder before using it for any string storage

74599
.when	ready
i manually detach handler .when they are handling things i m not quite ready to handle yet possibly because i m using the wrong events

74625
macvim	vim
edit note that i m aware of the vim gvim cream and macvim etc. variants of vi

74625
macvim	vim
i ve been using vim more precisely macvim in my day to day professional life since last december

74662
bug-tracking	fogbugz
we also have fogbugz for bug-tracking

74668
checkmarx	owasp
these include fortify and ouncelabs expensive and for many languages visualstudio.net codeanalysis for .net and c++ free with vsts decent but not great owasp s lapse for java free decent not great checkmarx not cheap fantastic tool for .net and java but high overhead and many more

74675
command-line	cmd
once you know your specific windows cmd-line cmd for invoking make or g++ on your code then you create a pre-build event in your visual-studio project

74675
stderr	stdout
the scripting can print to stdout or stderr and that output should be visible to you in the visual-studio build output windows the windows that usually shows stuff like build 3 succeeded 0 failed

74680
value	field
in your keyup event listener call the store s filtering methods see doc passing the field name and the value from the text field

74688
zipoutputstream	zipfile
you can use java s zipfile and zipentry classes to read the contents of a jar file then use zipoutputstream to create a new one

74713
where-clause	sql
in anything but a flat single-table data structure this is not a trivial task because the from clause of the sql is dependent on the tables queried in the where-clause

74715
margins	padding
a guideline though is if you set width on an element don t set margins or padding on the same element

74720
external	host
if you are using tomcat check out psi probe which lets you monitor internal and external memory consumption as well as a host of other areas

74756
versioning	upgrade
when you need to upgrade to a new versioning of the library just reference the new file name versioning from the relevant pages

74782
eruby	erb
what s the difference between eruby and erb

74782
eruby	erb
my plan is to templates the configuration-files using embedded ruby via either eruby or erb within the source files to do things like iteratively generate all the interface configuration blocks for a router these blocks are all very similar differing only in a label and an ip-address

74782
eruby	erb
which when run through an embedded ruby interpreter either erb or eruby produces the following output

74801
export	csv
it can do charts of these parameters export to csv show the number of classes loaded the number of instances deadlocks threads etc.

74807
eruby	erb
erb is pure ruby eruby is written in c so it s a bit faster

74823
eruby	erb
eruby is an external executable while erb is a library within ruby

74823
ruby	php
you would use the former if you wanted independent processing of your template files quick-and-dirty php replacement and the latter if you needed to process them within the context of some other ruby script

74823
eruby	erb
it is more common to use erb simply because it is more flexible but i ll admit that i have been guilty of dabbling in eruby to execute .rhtml files for quick little utility websites

74841
interpreter	runtime
attackers control the runtime memory of the flash interpreter so that anyone who knows how to use a programmable debugger can alter any variables including the current score at any time or alter the program itself

74844
shell	bash
my question is what are the advantages of using kornshell ksh or bash shell

74846
shell	bash
sudo bash will basically switch you over to running a shell as root although it s probably best to stay as su as little as possible

74857
perl	tcl
according to this vim-enhanced is just vim with the perl python tcl and cscope options compiled in. you should be able to find everything you need to know about these compile options in the documentation

74867
linux	unix
on linux unix you can easyly make a jvm crash by sending it a signal to the running process

74872
shell	bash
z shell has a good combination of ksh s unique features with the nice things that bash provides plus a lot more stuff on top of that

74878
any	set
it can be set on any versioned directory and its value is a multi-line table of subdirectories relative to the versioned directory on which the property is set and fully qualified absolute subversion repository urls.

74879
xsd	xml
i am looking for a tool which will take an xml instance document and output a corresponding xsd schema

74904
button	popup
for my implementation i put the iframe in a modal popup and added a button with style display none to handle the closing of the popup

74913
margins	padding
microsoft lost and now it s either width or margins padding border for an element

74921
scriptaculous	jquery
i tried prototype and scriptaculous first but then switched to jquery and there is no looking back

74931
postgresql	mysql
with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use postgresql performed better than mysql

74936
shell	bash
bin sh on linux is actually bash but if you re aiming for cross-platform scripts you re better off sticking to features of the original bourne shell or writing it in something like perl

74937
shell	bash
you could simply use the bash shell arguments like this

74970
python	java
antlr creates native parsers in java python and .net

74971
yacc	cup
i would imagine you could use tools like lex flex cup antlr or yacc or their equivalents for whatever programming language you are using

74982
click	mouse
for visual-studio it only takes a few mouse click and then just changing the return value essentially

74984
quirks-mode	doctype
note to get ie working better make sure you have a valid doctype so it does not revert to quirks-mode

74992
bash	zsh
i don t have experience with ksh but i have used both bash and zsh

74992
bash	zsh
i prefer zsh over bash because of its support for very powerful file globbing variable expansion modifiers and faster tab completion

75003
string.format	stringbuilder
on a side note string + variables is also more performant that the string.format approach generally that uses a stringbuilder internally when in doubt.

75015
put	get
put all the ideas together and you might get a model-t.

75021
tcpdf	fpdf
so if you want place another pdf inside another dynamically generated pdf document like an image use fpdi + fpdf tcpdf

75057
change-password	registration
what is the best way of ensuring that a user supplied password is a strong password in a registration or change-password form

75060
cpu-architecture	x86
java and x86 both have solid and standardized memory models - i m not so sure about clr but if all else fails you ll have build upon the memory model of your target cpu-architecture

75103
pixels	line
for those curious the most common methods of padding edges in intra compression such as jpeg images is to mirror the line of pixels before the edge

75106
pixels	line
the image dimensions being multiples of 8 or 16 is not going to affect the size on disk very much but you can get dramatic savings if you can line up the visual contents to the 8x8 pixels grid such as if there is a repeating pattern or textures in the image

75114
linux	unix
this is a bit of a unix vs linux battle

75114
solaris	unix
most unix systems like solaris aix and hpux have ksh as default

75118
fflush	gets
caveat like with using cfheader cfcontent you need to do this before the cache gets fflush to the browser since it s basically doing the same thing without having to store the file

75134
fadeout	fadein
the fadeout and the fadein run simultaneously how do i make them run one after the other

75151
csv	xml
learn macros because vim is the best for automated tasks and snippet insertion like formatting a few words into a complex xml tag or converting a csv to an html table

75182
linux	bsd
assume a standard bsd or linux system

75185
directory	folder
enter that as the only content in your index.php in your root directory and any requests sent to that folder will then redirect the user to the forum

75193
emacs	vim
i remember when i first started learning emacs it was after i was already very comfortable with vim and i was in the same or similar boat that you were where i knew how to get a lot done in another editor so as i started using emacs it was always painfully slow

75205
put	get
synchronizing via collections.synchronizedxxx won t do good since it does not guarantee iterator safety it only synchronizes writes and reads via put get set .

75243
common-lisp	lisp
i would add practical common-lisp by peter seibel to the lisp list

75244
contains	any
also the remove listener methods are likely unneeded since the listener contains no exterior references to any other instances but they can be added to make code reviews go smoother

75246
textbox	button
you can also replace Ã¢ Åon loadÃ¢ with Ã¢ Åon clickÃ¢ for button or Ã¢ Åon changeÃ¢ for textbox

75298
void	main
if you re just running a regular java program then i would imagine you re stuck with public static void main string arguments try .

75301
any	set
as a general rule of thumb if i have to set the value of the string more than once or if there are any append to the string then it needs to be a string builder

75303
macros	basic
some languages like javascript adapted basic features like garbage collection and lexical closures but all the stuff that might actually change how you write programs on a large scale like powerful macros the code-as-data thing and custom control structures only seems to propagate within other functional languages none of which are practical to use for non-trivial projects

75319
icollection	ienumerable
in most cases public apis will expose ilist or icollection or ienumerable as appropriate

75325
contains	any
resource forks are generic and can contains any number kind of resources

75338
web-deployment	web
web-deployment projects - provides additional functionality to build and deploy web sites and web-applications source

75362
project-management	project
i use the excellent trac project-management system for my personal project and i use it s wiki as a brainstorming and note-taking tool

75399
environment	building
do you have a full building environment install gcc make etc.

75399
selected	button
in the future you should bockquote output like this selected the text and click the quote button

75426
exception-handling	try-catch
this sqlconnection will be closed without needing to explicitly call the .close function and this will happen even if an exception-handling is thrown without the need for a try-catch finally

75470
triggers	insert
however if you do not have control over the inserts you can add a triggers to certain db systems that will give you access to the data that are modified insert or deleted

75477
numeric	zero
in addition to the standard approach of mixing alpha numeric and symbols i noticed when i registered with myopenid last week the password checker tells you if your password is based on a dictionary word even if you add numbers or replace alphas with similar numbers using zero instead of o 1 instead of i etc.

75491
emacs	vim
you can edit it with emacs or vim or eclipse or whatever you are most comfortable with

75493
any	set
talend should be able to handle all versions of excel and output the result set in any format you require including loading it directly into a database if need be

75506
solaris	linux
javafx desktop will run on windows mac linux and solaris at fcs and will require java se

75506
solaris	linux
support for linux and solaris will be forthcoming

75506
javafx	swing
one important platform distinction is that javafx desktop will support swing components while javafx mobile will not only scene graph for graphics

75513
callback	methods
you can use asynccallbacks to specify a delegate to a methods and then specify callback methodss that get called once the execution of the target methods completes

75514
python	ruby
python or ruby

75514
lisp	let
see paul graham s thoughts on this in the question i like lisp but my company won t let me use it

75567
ghostscript	imagemagick
use imagemagick or better yet ghostscript

75590
png	gif
you could also use pdf2ps ps2image and then convert from the resulting image to tiff with other utilities i remember paul paul - yet another image viewer display png tiff gif jpg etc.

75591
cakephp	symfony
depending on the project i ve turned it around and used cakephp or symfony tools for generating the forms and a blend of plain x html form coding

75614
administration	account
however on vista and 2008 this only works if you are using an administration account

75621
value	field
the issue i m having is that the page should work using the form s initial value unbound but i can t access the cleaned_data field unless i call is_valid

75633
configuration	environment
the solution we use is to have only the single configuration file web.config app.config but we add a special section to the file that contains settings for all environment

75633
configuration	environment
there is a local dev qa production sections each containing the configurationuration keys relevant to that environment in our configuration file s

75638
scheme	lua
the guys behind lua have repeatedly listed scheme and lisp as major influences on lua and lua has even been described as scheme without the parentheses

75654
constructor	object
in java and .net the object members are zero null initialized before any constructor is run and is at this point that the object life time begins

75654
constructor	object
so when you enter the constructor you ve already got an initialized object

75654
constructor	object
in c++ the object life time only begins when the constructor finishes although member variables and base classes are fully constructed before it starts

75654
constructor	object
the problem with the java .net definition of object lifetime is that it s harder to make sure the object always meets its invariant without having to put in special cases for when the object is initialized but the constructor hasn t run

75671
multicast	vlan
if the switching your host is attached to does not have igmp snooping enabled then all hosts on the same vlan will receive the additional multicast traffic which could lead them to experience the same problems as mentioned above

75700
rollback	commit
i want to use annotations based transactions transactional to not mess around with transactionstatus commit save and rollback

75705
dbase	dbf
i have searched for various techniques on how to read write dbase iii dbf files using oledb or odbc with c# .net

75714
double	int
currently i use int double strings and enumerations so the code will have to be adaptive based on the type

75732
margins	padding
i ve seen numerous people mentions that you shouldn t use widths and padding or margins on the same element with css

75736
haskell	ocaml
why aren t lisp haskell ocaml or f# modern

75739
numeric	digits
this allows for an optional plus minus sign at the beginning one optional decimal point and the rest numeric digits

75747
filtering	sorting
i d prefer to render each list item as a single cell with complex rendering for instance the way that stackoverflow shows its lists of questions. i d also like to get as much of the sharepoint-standard ui as possible such as the sorting filtering and paging controls

75749
contains	elements
one issue with this is that it can become difficult to know which css file contains the style elements i m interested in but i organize my projects with aptana which has search tools

75758
margins	padding
because some browsers treat the width as the total width of the element including the padding and the margins and others treat the width as the base width to which the padding and margins are added

75782
teamcity	msbuild
by using msbuild tasks you are more prepared to move into a continuous integration system like cruisecontrol.net or teamcity

75789
margins	padding
i ve never come across a problem caused by using width padding and or margins together

75789
quirks-mode	doctype
so long as you have a valid doctype and are not in quirks-mode you will have a predictable box model and therefor should use whichever is most appropriate out of margin padding to represent what you are trying to do

75789
margins	padding
margins applies outside of borders padding applies inside of borders

75792
raid	xen
the raid controllers in those does not play well with the xen kernel

75797
margins	padding
are you stating that padding and or margins value shouldn t co-exist with a dom element that also has a width value assigned to it

75797
margins	padding
it would be difficult to achieve the layout you re looking for usually without some margins or padding value

75798
profiling	debugging
however it s written in python which means there s little real support in the way of deployment packaging debugging profiling and other tools that make building and maintaining applications much easier

75798
python	ruby
ruby has similar issues and although i do like ruby much better than i like python i get the impression that rails is roughly in the same boat at django when it comes to managing supporting the app

75810
postgresql	oracle
same interface so if you like me use oracle ms-sql mysql and postgresql then at least your day to day query management tool will look the same for all platforms

75811
margins	padding
summary ie rendering width different then the standard rendering if padding and margins used with width or height

75822
conditional	operators
the problem occurs because the conditional operators doesn t look at how the value is used assigned in this case to determine the type of the expression -- just the true false values

75827
postback	ajax
if you are using ajax you may also be doing a callback not a full postback

75833
margins	padding
it s outline might not actually match up to the expected 400pixels 300 pixels size plus 2 30pixels padding plus 2 20 pixels margins

75833
margins	padding
that said i personally use widths along with padding and margins and have no problems with it

75833
margins	padding
if you limit yourself to not using widths when using padding margins that means you are peppering your code with a lot of non-semantic cruft

75869
value	field
you have to store the value somewhere so you are limited to the query string and hidden form field

75892
innodb	myisam
postgresql is acid-compliant like innodb and when well-tuned nearly as speedy as myisam

75904
gnome	xfce
many common desktops including gnome kde and xfce where relevant implements the specifications laid out by freedesktop.org

75935
xsd	xml
xml schema should be based on a xsd provided

75941
data-structures	dictionary
the national institute of standards and technology nist online dictionary of algorithms and data-structures lists this problem as all simple paths and recommends a depth-first search

75943
javascript	dom
i m inserting the whole thing into the dom but the javascript isn t being run

75959
sql-server	oracle
i would like my project to be able to run on both the sql-server and oracle data stores with minimal effort

75959
sql-server	oracle
again i am trying to write an application that can query and update data from a sql-server or oracle with minimal effort using the entity framework

75973
alias	pwd
it sounds like you want to join the tables alias as pwd and ewd in your snippet based first on an exact match and if that fails then on the like comparison you have now

75985
versioning	upgrade
if the distro ever comes out with an official package for a newer versioning of some random module it will automatically be install when you apt-get upgrade

75994
dialog	pop-up
another feature that i find useful is that it can pop-up a dialog box that shows all the javascript and css scripting used on the page

76010
printf	strcat
use getenv to get the value of an environment variables then use printf or strcat to compose the path

76012
lisp	let
as a simple example let s suppose you want lisp to use curly braces rather than parentheses

76029
account	userid
that is any account with a real posix userid owning actual running processes

76040
slimdx	xna
there is also slimdx which is under constant development as a means of providing a lean wrapper of directx in a similar fashion as managed directx which was i believe discontinued by microsoft in favor of xna

76111
exception-handling	error-handling
the idea of exception-handling is elegant and makes the error-handling process so smooth

76111
exception-handling	error-handling
after all i think your error-handling process will be much smoother with exception-handling than trigger_error and stuff

76127
command-prompt	cmd
use the sc cmd like this you need to be on a cmd-prompt to execute the cmds in this post

76132
pascal	scheme
algorithms in c 1st edition by sedgewick taught me all about algorithms as well as teaching me all about the pitfalls of documentation and copy pasting code as all the example code in this version was taken from the algorithms in pascal version and were simply passed through a simple code translator which did not adjust for the different indexing scheme

76156
managed-code	native-code
you can mix native-code calls to c-style libraries with .net managed-code quite seamlessly and take advantage of .net gc and libraries

76198
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
cakephp is really good really close to ruby-on-rails 1.2

76216
methods	extend
1 extend list class - and add the join methods to it

76221
associations	model
i d model role as an associations class between users and roles thus

76231
base-class	accessor
a base-class must be able to depend on state which means restricting access to data through accessor methods

76279
selected	cell
when you copy paste a textbox excel will place the new textbox over whichever cell is currently selected

76286
data-members	private
item 22 declare data-members private

76295
firefox	safari
tested and working in firefox 2 safari 3.1.2 for windows ie 6 and opera 9.52

76305
any	set
but any set of z coordinates that a keep the same x-y distance between the points and b keep the shape a rectangle will work

76305
any	set
so any member of this infinite set will do z0+i z1+i z2+i z3+i | i - r

76319
safari	opera
then we need to think of opera and safari and

76326
authentication	login
when you redirect to the other server on the same domain check to see if the authentication cookie exists that was created by the authentication server and if it exists and has valid data auto login the user

76328
perl	ruby
php5 has a magic method __call that can be defined on any class that is invoked when an undefined method is called -- it is roughly equivalent to ruby s method_missing or perl s autoload

76329
authentication	login
basic authentication sends the login information in the http headers with every request but it s the browser that does this when it sees a new server new password request

76334
cos	sin
i generally use gcc and recall that it can calculate certain value at compile-time when all inputs are known ex sin cos etc...

76348
postgresql	oracle
for databases where it doesn t work hsqldb oracle postgresql etc you will need to futz with database-specific tricks

76368
sql-server	oracle
if you use a database that supports xml type like oracle or ms sql-server you can construct xml right in your sql queries and retrieve xml directly from the database bypassing population of dataset

76368
xsd	xml
in case your database schema is not directly mapped to the given xsd you already have a typed dataset or a set of xml-serializable business objects and those objects are serialized into xml that doesn t conform to xsd you re provided with then you can use xslt to transform your xml to another xml document which will be compliant with the given xsd

76408
perl	ruby
the languages to choose from are perl python and ruby

76424
attributes	properties
xmlelement.attributes.remove methods are working fine for arbitrary attributes resulting in the removed attributes being removed from xmldocument.outerxml properties

76458
lookup	any
generally if you must have the best indexed lookup performance it s best to build a list first and then turn it into a arrays thus paying a small penalty at first but avoiding any later

76458
dictionary	arrays
however even with a dictionary you have to be careful not to let it resize it s internal arrays an o n operation

76470
python	perl
but both perl and python can be used

76508
groovy	java
if you re looking for a scripting language that will play well with java you might want to look at groovy

76638
specifications	w3c
as per w3c specifications

76671
hosts-file	hosts
check their hosts

76742
stdin	pipe
if cat gets something on the stdin it will echo it to the stdout so you ll have to pipe it to cat output

76763
procmail	exim
if exim or sendmail is what s writing into the pipe then procmail is a good answer because it ll give you filelock serialization and you can put it all in the same file

76767
octree	r-tree
the book foundation of multidimensional and metrics data-structures can help you decide which data structure is fastest for range queries octree kd-trees r-tree ..

76787
managed-code	unmanaged
when the managed-code calls into the unmanaged world the parameters have to be marshalled so it seems there could be a slight performance hit but you d have to do some testing to see if the marshalling is significant or not

76789
innodb	myisam
you need to benchmarking your own application myisam vs innodb

76790
.when	ready
if the application is too tightly woven then it sounds like you need to hire some cobol scripters to help pull out the isolated services so you can depricate them .when you are ready

76793
children	nodes
unfortunately there are several sets of nested nodes the purpose of some of them is just to hold a collection of their children

76810
sql-server	oracle
change one map and your application goes from working with peoplesoft on oracle to working with microsoft dynamics on sql-server

76811
put	get
the only allowed verbs are get put post and delete

76811
json	xml
in practice though most of this falls away and rest usually just refers to simple http requests that return results in json while soap is a more complex api that communicates by passing xml around

76826
attributes	properties
you can simply decorate your class properties with some attributes and the rest is all done for you

76829
linux	unix
the various unix and linux implementations have various different source level implementations of ksh some of which are real ksh some of which are pdksh implementations and some of which are just symlinks to some other shell that has a ksh personality

76833
lighttpd	apache
at the very least use apache but if you can use lighttpd or another high-performance webserver

76854
firefox	opera
unfortunately around 45-50 of our client base uses ie6 while the other half are pretty much equally split between firefox and webkit-based browsers with a sprinkling of opera users

76855
web-applications	webserver
each of our production webserver maintains its own cache for separate web sites asp.net web-applications

76858
output	cat
even if you use the same ksh you ll still call all kinds of external commands grep ps cat etc... part of them will have different parameters and different output from system to system

76873
sql-server	mysql
mysql is only free if you forego a lot of the useful tools offered with the licenses and it s probably at least as of 2008 going to be a little more work to get it to scale like sql-server

76882
basic	vba
what is the best online guide or resource site to provide me with the basic as well as a comparison or lookup guide with equivalent functions features in vba versus python

76882
data-structures	dictionary
i am also have issues with data-structures such as dictionary and so forth

76883
web-config	app-config
yes you need to configure it in your configuration file probably not web-config for a test library but app-config

76890
ruby-on-rails	grails
i ve also heard very good things about grails which uses groovy on top of spring and is modeled after ruby-on-rails

76922
margins	padding

76948
csv	xml
set up the email to go to your address or a new address on your server and change the format to csv or xml

76986
instrumentation	debugging
for gdb to make sense of your core file you must tell gcc to instrumentation the binary with debugging symbols to do this you compile with the -g flag

76987
margins	padding
a lot of people still cling to notions about faulty box-models in ie and reckon that if you start messing around with element widths padding and margins you re going to get into trouble

76989
vba	vb6
vba as in what was implemented as part of office 2000 2003 and vb6 have been deprecated in favor of .net technologies

77003
factors	matrix
as you don t have the original projection matrix further ambiguity is introduced by an arbitary scaling factors that exists in any projection

77008
decrement	increment
it has range validation the input will always be numeric and it has those nifty increment decrement button

77018
json	xml
there is nothing useful in soap that can t be done with rest for transport and json xml or even plain text for data representation

77031
sql-server	mysql
i m a sql-server guy but f your application is that simple then the free version of mysql should do the job

77035
data-structures	tree
in any program requiring complex data-structures i create a strict clear-cut tree of objects containing other objects - using owner pointers

77045
udp	tcp
rather than using raw sockets some applications use a higher numbered tcp or udp port

77060
raw-sockets	packets
you don t need to use raw-sockets to send and receive icmp packets

77062
cursor	row
if you have no choice than to go row by row creating a fast_forward cursor

77066
any	set
also you will find out if you have broken any reflection easily if you have a good set of unit acceptance tests

77082
show	next
the first row is the date the second row show a line of data and all the next rows are data rows until data of a new date comes in in which case there will be another sub-header row

77086
python	php
i know that serving a python base webpage via cgi is slower than php because of its long start up every time

77089
getter	setter
most importantly watch for the existence of setter and getter indicating that you are operating on value from a class and not asking the class to operate on it s own value --or using extends without applying the liskov substitution principle stuff like that

77092
contains	any
with the identical contains sequence including characters if any from the original

77092
any	set

you could effectively fake a multi-color scatter-plot by using a line-plot with white lines and colored shape markers at the points you want to display

77162
linux	unix
it is available for almost any unix system on earth bsds mac os linux and windows via cygwin or mingw

77162
kdevelop	kde
a number of ides are supporting the gcc c++ compiler kdevelop under linux kde or dev-cpp as mentioned in other posts

77166
python	php
since python is far less ubiquitous than php i wouldn t be surprised if hosting developer and other maintenance costs for it long term would have it fit this scenario

77202
sql-server	postgresql
personally i find that given the hoops that you need to jump through to ensure that an access solution is reasonably trouble-free it is much less trouble to implement an instance of msde sql-server express or postgresql

77207
document	element
a document library is a list with each element being a file+metadata

77211
linux	unix
best of all if you thought you knew linux unix wait until you use it everyday on your desktop

77220
python	php
php and python are similiar enough to not warrent any kind of switching

77224
linux	unix
on linux unix macosx use core files you can enable them with ulimit or compatible system call

77232
benchmarking	profiling
you ll have to benchmarking and or profiling your application on production grade hardware to find out

77234
memcheck	valgrind
valgrind memcheck is an excellent free one

77257
nested	order
if you break down the relational calculus or even look at an explain plan oracle you can easily see which indexes are being used in which order and if any table scans or nested operations are occurring

77266
decimal	hex
can i persuade operator in c++ to read both a hex value and and a decimal value

77266
decimal	hex
i d like the same istringstream to be able to read both hex and decimal

77278
solaris	linux
its web site says it can cross compile win32 linux and solaris

77278
solaris	linux
according to its web site it works on windows mac os x linux solaris aix and hp-ux

77278
solaris	unix
based on the test reports it works on the windows mac os x linux netbsd and solaris but theoretically it should work on other unix systems as well

77297
python	php
there s no point in attempting to convince your employer to port from php to python especially not for an existing system which is what i think you implied in your question

77310
traceroute	ping
ping and traceroute use the icmp protocols

77310
udp	tcp
like udp and tcp this is accessible through the normal sockets api

77310
udp	tcp
only udp and tcp port numbers less than 1024 are protected from use other than by root

77310
traceroute	ping
if you really want to see how ping and traceroute work you can download an example c code implementation for them from codeproject

77317
textbox	button
the 3 different views are basically the same form but have different textbox shown depending upon what button the user selects

77328
textwrangler	bbedit
i really do not get the appeal it s marginally better than textwrangler bbedit s free little brother but if you re spending money you may as well buy the better tool for a few dollars more

77359
decimal	octal
putting a std dec indicates decimal numbers std oct indicates octal

77360
octal	hex
it will be able to parsing 10 dec as 10 decimal 0x10 hex as 16 decimal and 010 octal as 8 decimal

77387
contains	elements
returns an arrays contains all of the elements in this collection

77397
session-cookies	cookies
ruby-on-rails session-cookiess are tamper-proof by default so you really don t have to worry about a cookies being modified on the client end

77442
fogbugz	trac
a bug feature tracking system that is currently in-place and in-use by the team trac sourceforge fogbugz etc

77445
constructor	object
you cannot write virtual functions to for instance return the desired size of the object and have the default constructor initialize each item

77485
bazaar	git
what do folks here see as the relative strengths and weaknesses of git mercurial and bazaar

77496
sendmessage	message
i faced a similar issue some months ago where some unknown but probably mine app was preventing shutdown so i wrote some quick code that used enumwindows to enumerate all the top level windows sent each one a wm_queryendsession message noted what the return-value from sendmessage was and stopped the enumerator if anyone returned false

77498
interlocked	atomicity
on windows interlocked exchange add is guaranteed to be atomicity

77551
sortedlist	sorted
if the data you are loading is already sorted insertions into the sortedlist should not be slow

77594
environment	building
there s one wrapper scripting that invokes all the object scriptinging so that you can deploy the current db building to whatever environment you want

77610
country-codes	iso
side note i have found it usefull to have country tables that also include the iso abbreviations country-codes

77620
unordered	iterator
it will work with almost any unordered stl-like containers with bidirectional iterator

77625
innodb	myisam
i ve worked on a high-volume system using mysql and i ve tried both myisam and innodb

77625
innodb	myisam
of course i have no idea what your application is but hopefully this gives you some insight into some of the issues with myisam and innodb

77639
constructor	object
it seems to me that a constructor should fail -- and thus refuse to create an object -- if the object isn t complete

77639
constructor	object
i.e. the constructor should have a contract with its caller to provide a functional and working object on which methods can be called meaningfully

77643
virtualization	vmware
with respect to performance-testing i ve been very skeptical of using vmware or other virtualization processes

77663
linked-list	nodes
to implement a linked-list that can handle any kind of object the linked-list and the nodess in a hypothetical nodes inner class must be generic if you want the list to contain only one type of object

77665
build-process	release
when release day came around the operations team would follow the release notes and pick up the scripts from source control and run the package against the database with the .net application we used during the nightly build-process which would automatically package the scripts in transactions so if something failed it would automatically roll back and no impact to the database was made

77672
any	set
for any new project there s a set procedure

77681
constructor	private
if you need to validate something during construction make the constructor private and define a public static factory method

77683
scala	java
for example reductio for java scala and quickcheck for haskell

77691
dictionary	arrays
so for example instead of defining a structure consisting of a string and an integer and then having to implement a whole set of objects and methods on how to access an arrays of those structures and so forth you can just make a dictionary

77693
profiling	debugging
debugging profiling and other tools

77693
ruby-on-rails	django
none of this frameworks comes close to the power of django or ruby-on-rails

77693
profiling	debugging
the downside is it s written in php and as far as i know php doesn t have superb tools for debugging profiling and packaging of apps

77694
value	field
you ll have access to your cck field value with field_name 0 value

77701
remote-debugging	debugging
remote-debugging is a godsend for debugging visual issues

77705
constructor	object
the constructor s job is to bring the object into a usable state

77705
constructor	object
the constructor merely brings the object into a sleeper state in which it refuses to do any work

77705
constructor	object
one-stage constructor should throw if they fail to fully initialize the object

77705
constructor	object
if the object cannot be initialized it must not be allowed to exist so the constructor must throw

77709
type-safety	generics
as a result of generics being used the compiler can perform compile-time checks on code for type-safety are you trying to put an int into that list of strings

77709
double	int
allows you to write code which is applicable to many types with the same underlying behaviour a dictionary string int uses the same underlying code as a dictionary datetime double

77717
perl	ruby
also for the same reason servers that have neither python nor ruby installed are still likely to have perl on them again making it important to have some familiarity with

77717
perl	ruby
in terms of libraries i do not know how ruby and python compare against each other Ã¢ i do know that perl has them beat by a margin

77717
python	ruby
and if you are only looking to do things in some particular area which is well covered by libraries for python or ruby the mass of other stuff on cpan isnÃ¢ t necessarily an advantage

77721
constructor	object
in general i have found that code that is easier to port and maintain results if constructor are written so they do not fail and code that can fail is placed in a separate method that returns an error code and leaves the object in an inert state

77724
g++	gcc
i agree with iulian Ã¨ erbÃ¤Ænoiu code blocks is a very good solution usable both from linux it will use g++ gcc and from windows it will use either the ms compiler or gcc

77727
bazaar	cvs
bazaar is reasonably fast very fast for trees with shallow history but presently scales poorly with history length and is easy-to-learn to those familiar with the command-line interfaces of traditional scms cvs svn etc

77727
revision	svn
while globally unique revision-id identifiers are available for all revision tree-local revnos standard revision numbers more akin to those used by svn or other more conventional scms are used in place of content hashes for identifying revision

77727
bazaar	git
about the author i use git and perforce for work and bazaar for my personal projects and as an embedded library

77731
python	ruby
i m looking for a python analogue to this library since the website only has java .net ruby versions available

77735
double	int
also if you basically have int arithmetic in double here we use double to hold int values in certain cases your arithmetic will be correct

77740
constructor	object
this is not the only option it could finish the constructor and build an object but with a method iscoherent returning false in order to be able to signal an incoherent state that may be preferable in certain case in order to avoid a brutal interruption of the execution workflow due to an exception

77748
debian	linux
the server is linux debian 4.0

77765
constructor	object
well if the object in the stack can throw in their constructors constructing the temporary to return to the caller you can t guarantee that you won t lose data decrement stack pointer construct return value using copy constructor of value in stack which throws and now have a stack that just lost an item

77766
constructor	object
you absolutely should throw an exception from a constructor if you re unable to create a valid object

77789
constructor	object
so as a corrolary to never return a zombie object form a constructor init

77789
initializer	setter
that an object inplementing this interface may not respond correctly to any calls except property setter until initializer has been called

77794
version-control	git
they both provide basic distributed version-control as in offline commit and merging multiple branches are both written in python and are both slower than git

77827
click	mouse
it s always tough to imagine how that will look - maybe new tech will become a more immersive experience incorporating more senses then just sight and sound touch is a good candidate as well as something that allows for full-range-motion interaction rather then the 2d point and click mouse interface

77834
perforce	cvs
the only real difference between cvs subversion clearcase perforce visualsourcesafe and all the other cvcses is in the workflow performance and integration that each product offers

77836
python	c++
if possible provide a code example please c++ or python preferred

77847
dependency-injection	repository-pattern
with the repository-pattern i can create an inmemoryrepository so that i can test domain logic in isolation and use dependency-injection in the application to have the service layer instantiate a sqlrepository for example

77862
environment	building
my last job i worked at they had a huge project that needed to building for the target-platform lynxos as well as an emulation environment winxp

77883
bazaar	git
bazaar is imho easier to learn than git

77893

i d model role as an associations class between users and roles ...

77909
lotus	ibm
lotus notes ibm

77914
restart	reload
it is fine to require user-input on server startup but not restart or reload

77943
bazaar	git
what do folks here see as the relative strengths and weaknesses of git mercurial and bazaar

77945
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is not better than mergesort

77945
quicksort	mergesort
but computers are so fast today that the additional overhead of a mergesort is negligible and the risk of a very slow quicksort far outweighs the insignificant overhead of a mergesort in most cases

77951
constructor	object
a constructor should throw an exception when it is unable to complete the construction of said object

77951
constructor	object
for example if the constructor is supposed to allocate 1024 kb of ram and it fails to do so it should throw an exception this way the caller of the constructor knows that the object is not ready to be used and there is an error somewhere that needs to be fixed

77963
temporary	copy
in c++ this expression tells the compiler to create 3 objects on the stack perform addition and copy the resultant value from the temporary object into the existing object a

77975
hotmail	gmail
also keep in mind many people use webmail such as gmail hotmail yahoo mail etc

77992
push	pull
simply looking to push data to and pull data from sap

78018
build-process	msbuild
i want to enable each user to define their own build-process with msbuild tasks but i don t want that to necessarily affect the other developers

78020
constructor	object
throw an exception if you re unable to initialize the object in the constructor one example are illegal arguments

78024
postgresql	mysql
i think the only way to know for sure what is going on is to look through the code or get one of the mysql postgresql programmers in here to say how it processes fk constraints

78044
versioning	upgrade
so you have to upgrade mongrel to a versioning that supports --clean to get around the stale pid file issue monit alone can t do this

78048
python	perl
would this be better done in python perl powershell or something else entirely

78053
worksheet	excel
i ve been trying to retrieve the locations of all the page breaks on a given excel 2003 worksheet over com

78055
stateless	stateful
overall it sounds like the current implementation is abusively using session objects to try and simulate a stateful application in a supposedly stateless environment

78055
web-applications	scalability
for web-applications where the user is repeatedly accessing the same data and typically has a fairly long session per use of the site some caching if necessary in session objects can actually help scalability by reducing the load on the db server

78062
export	report
the matrix in ssrs sql-server report services 2005 seems to have issues with certain the border styles when export to xls but not pdf or web view

78095

if the exit code of the child indicates an error then restart it else exit

78102
stderr	stdout
it can capture stderr and stdout

78103
perl	ruby
ruby is a lovely language to learn - and lacks some of the cruft in perl 5

78104
children	tree
a quad tree is a 2 dimensional tree in which at each level a node has 4 children each of which covers 1 4 of the area of the parent node

78104
children	tree
an oct tree is a 3 dimensional tree in which at each level a node has 8 children each of which contains 1 8th of the volume of the parent node

78104
contains	any
intersection algorithms work by starting at the top of the tree and recursively traversing into any child nodes that intersect the object being tested at some point you get to leaf nodes which contains the actual objects

78106
python	ruby
as your question is tool writing and exploit development i would recommend ruby if you choose metasploit or python if you choose canvas

78111
show	next
the first column indicates the child frame pointers the second column indicates the return address of the methods that is executing the next three columns show the first 3 parameters that were passed to the methods and the last part is the dll name nv4_disp and the offset of the methods that is being executed +0x48b94

78121
quicksort	mergesort
probably your best bet would be quicksort or mergesort

78125
g++	gcc
the following code snippet correctly gives a warning in c and an error in c++ using gcc g++ respectively tested with versions 3.4.5 and 4.2.1

78128

firefox	safari
further webmail as fail-over squirrelmail on mail server in firefox camino safari

78156
windows-mobile	windows-ce
note that the article you re pointing to is from the windows-mobile windows-ce sdk

78157
driver	kernel
the software architecture involves a kernel driver that reads data into a pool of buffering and a userland app that writes the data to a file on the mounted removable device

78157
driver	kernel
this is enough to cause the kernel driver to run out of buffering - and even if i could increase the number of buffering the video data has to be synchronised ideally within 40ms with other things that are going on in real time

78158
value	field
you ll have access to your cck field value with field_name 0 value

78185
pointers	stack
many stacks that do not allocate memory are examples of such data-structures because you can add a value to the stack then move the end pointers or remove a value from the stack after moving the end pointers

78188
webserver	security
as for security with fastcgi you could technically run the php process under a different user from the default webserver user

78217
python	php
must be able to be accessed from any number of web applications on just about any platform windows nix php asp c# python django et cetera

78217
postgresql	mysql
use ldap ad for authentication only tie ldap users to a most robust profile authorization server using some sort of traditional database mssql postgresql mysql or document based db couchdb simpledb et cetera

78231
buffering	capture
it might make sense to structure the application in such a way that the encoding capture you didn t mention video capture so i m making an assumption here - you might want to add more information task runs in its own thread and buffering its output in userland - then a second thread can handle writing to the device

78231
filesystems	fat
if you re sure that for larger writes you can get sufficient throughput and i m not sure that s the case but the filesystems might be doing something stupid like updating the fat after every write then having an encoding thread piping data to a writing thread with sufficient buffering in the writing thread to avoid stalls

78235
constructor	object
p.s. note that in c++ constructor can throw and you doesn t want an exception in the middle of a dll loading so be sure your global object won t be using exception without a very very good reason

78238
put	get
i can put together a very nice looking app the prototypes look slick - but when i need to interact with the user to ask questions get input i have to use wx

78250
compact-framework	.net
the best advise i can give you is stop right now and start using .net compact-framework

78284
fwrite	fopen
make sure you are using a low-level api for writing to the disk don t use user-mode caching functions like fopen fread fwrite use the low-level functions open read write

78294
udp	tcp
traditionally this means that you want to craft all of the layer 4 header tcp udp icmp.

78300
command-line	cmd
you can call the cmd-line from php and the cmd is

78315
disposable	dispose
the standard pattern is for your base-class to implements idisposable and the non-virtual dispose methods and to implements a virtual dispose bool methods which those classes which hold disposable resources must override

78315
compact-framework	.net
warning for windows mobile developers vs2005 and 2008 .net compact-framework 2.0 and 3.5 many non-controls that you drop onto your designer surface menu bars timers hardwarebuttons derive from system.componentmodel.component which implements a finalizer

78336
solaris	linux
on linux it would be something like dev hda or dev sda but on solaris i am getting a bit lost in the partitions and what the device is called

78339
sequences	subset
are there tools that given a sequences of patches to a file can give the moral equivalent of a diff between the first and last versions but only including a subset of those patches

78340
postgresql	mysql
use ldap ad for authentication only tie ldap users to a most robust profile authorization server using some sort of traditional database mssql postgresql mysql or document based db couchdb simpledb et cetera

78368
malloc	free
if you use malloc free instead of new delete malloc and free won t care about the type

78368
malloc	free
so if you re using a c-like pod plain old data like a build-in type or a struct you can malloc some type and free another

78383
32-bit	64bit
on mac os x that means you need to use the functions listed in atomic 3 to perform truly atomic-across-all-cpus operations on 32-bit 64bit and pointer-sized quantities

78383
pointers	stack
use the latter for any atomic operations on pointers so you re 32 64-bit compatible automatically. that goes whether you want to do things like atomic compare-and-swap increment decrement spin locking or stack queue management

78426
defined	declare
forwarding declare the class and then defined it in the cpp file and initializer only the enum-like value

78431
output	cat
hg cat file.txt output the most recently committed version of file.txt

78439
compare-and-swap	atomicity
there isn t a provided atomicity get or set for either 32 or 64bit integers but you can build that out of the provided compare-and-swap

78446
matplotlib	chaco
the main advantages of chaco are its speed relative to matplotlib and its integration with enthought s traits api for interactive applications

78450
any	set
in any style command the first row index may be set to one of the special strings splitlast or splitfirst to indicate that the style should be used only for the last row of a split table or the first row of a continuation

78457
webmail	gmail
also i think if you send as both text plain and text html gmail users of the webmail user-interface have no choice but to view the text html version

78462
expectations	assertions
this gives more expressiveness for writing tests and also forces to think about the invariant expectations that your code should fullfill it s harder to write assertions

78472
memory-management	out-of-memory
sometimes it confuses os memory-management a little you see it when windows runs out-of-memory and asks java to free some up java touches all it s objects causing them to be loaded in from the swapfile windows screams in agony and dies but i don t think that s what you are seeing

78474
double	int
using only ansi c what is the best way to with fair certainty determine if a c style string is either a int or a real number i.e float double

78487
atoi	atof
atoi and atof will convert or return a 0 if it can t

78497
shell	bash

78536
deep-copy	object
how can i clone or deep-copy an object so that the cloned object can be modified without any changes being reflected in the original object

78561
python	ruby
there are more pentesting libraries available in python than in ruby but not enough to offset metasploit

78561
python	ruby
ready integration with windbg for remote windows kernel debugging there s still no good answer in ruby for kernel debugging which is why i still occasionally use python

78561
penetration-testing	owasp
spikeproxy for web penetration-testing also owasp pantera

78561
python	ruby
both ruby and python have java variants you can use to get access to tools like that

78561
python	ruby
also both ruby and python offer

78561
python	ruby
you re not going to go wrong with either language though for mainstream pentest work metasploit probably edges out all the python benefits and at present for x86 reversing work python superior debugging interfaces edge out all the ruby benefits

78565
atoi	atof
don t use atoi and atof as these functions return 0 on failure

78569
atoi	atof
atoi and atof will convert the number even if there are trailing non numerical characters

78580
atoi	atof
using sscanf you can be certain if the string is a float or int or whatever without having to special case 0 as is the case with atoi and atof solution

78585
scriptaculous	jquery
i ve been playing with scriptaculous and jquery

78587
deep-copy	object
clone should do a memberwise copy and perform a deep-copy on any member that requires it then return the resulting object

78591
asterisk	pbx
asterisk is the open-source pbx that you can use to

78627
strtol	atoi
use strtol strtoll not atoi to check integers

78627
atoi	atof
atoi and atof convert the initial part of the string but don t tell you whether or not they used all of the string

78630
windows-vista	windows
interactive services no longer work - or at least no longer show ui - on windows-vista and windows server 2008 due to session 0 isolation

78631
contains	elements
this has the advantage that arrays elements may contains spaces or other members of ifs

78641
openmesh	cgal
i ve tried both cgal and openmesh but both fail miserably in the last point

78646
put	get
normally i say put as little in pl sql as possible - it is typically a lot less maintainable - at one of my last jobs i really saw how messy and hard to work with it could get

78688
hash	md5
generate a random something fairly long then tack the score to the end and maybe the name or something else static then sha1 md5 it and pass both to the server verify that the random hash to be equal to the hash

the underlying sql lib is fully tested with postgresql has a toy sqlite backend and a somewhat tested oracle backend

78741
methods	extend
now you could extend string with a small methods called red

python	c++
if your algorithm is sufficiently complex the fact that the input is xml becomes irrelevant to your choice of tool - i.e roll your own in c++ python whatever

78816
textbox	button
what i have is a form with a bunch of controls ranging from textbox to radio button each of these controls are like database filtering and when the user hits search button a sql string i would really like it to be a linq query because i have changed to linq to sql gets generated from the completed controls and run

78847
datagrid	textbox
asp.net 1.1 - i have a datagrid on an aspx page that is databound and displays a value within a textbox

78847
textbox	button
the user is able to change this value then click on a button where the code behind basically iterates through each datagriditem in the grid does a findcontrol for the id of the textbox then assigns the .text value to a variables which is then used to update the database

78863
publish-subscribe	observer-pattern
boost signals is another commonly used library you might come across to do observer-pattern aka publish-subscribe

78892
32-bit	64bit
note it uses x264 assembly syntax which makes it more portable to 32-bit vs 64bit etc

78907
json	xml
if you re using or can migrate to .net 3.5 then there s a new binding explicitly created to support scenarios like this where you want your service to be exposed not as a soap service but as fully rest-like service or simply as xml json over http

78918
processor	cpu
while earlier we never even noticed the cpu load now the processor usage was way up

78974
any	set

78974
any	set
i there any way to set this in the c# code say with an attributes or something like that

78979
put	get
and once you get started you ll want to put an mcu everywhere

78983
perforce	cvs
has anyone come across best practices for moving from cvs to perforce

79022
contains	any
html 5 is even more permissive saying only that an id must contains at least one character and may not contains any space characters

79022
having	select
you can select that element in css as #first .name and in jquery like so but if you forget the backslash you will have a perfectly valid selector looking for an element with id first and also having class name

79041
children	nodes
i m needing to hide a top nodes so i have to make a list of all the children of that certain nodes for 4 they will be 9 6 14 16

79047
attributes	properties
take a more declarative approach and decorate your classes interfaces and or properties with some custom attributes then write some generic glue code that binds your user-interface to your model

79066
perl	ruby
in perl and ruby pattern m

79097
solaris	linux
vi is nice because it s on every unix-type computer mac os x solaris linux

79111

79112
breadth-first-search	depth-first-search
checkout bfs breadth-first-search and dfs depth-first-search

79115

i tried graffiti and dotnetnuke and thought both were troublesome then i tried umbraco based on a recommendation from a friend and i love it

79118
asterisk	ivr
i have successfully tried asterisk with lumenvox for a speech recognition ivr

79118
h.323	sip
it also supports a wide range of voip protocols sip h.323 iax .

79118
asterisk	pbx
asterisk is an open source software pbx that runs primarily on linux

79163
bitwise-and	xor
by use of the bitwise-and or | and xor operators

79182
quicksort	mergesort
as others have noted worst case of quicksort is o n 2 while mergesort and heapsort stay at o nlogn

79197
silverlight	wpf
also i want to avoid duplicates as feed might already have items when a question is tagged with both wpf and silverlight

79214
kdevelop	kde
kdevelop is nice especially if you run kde

79219
perforce	cvs
if converting from vss to perforce is a real pain you can convert vss to cvs and then to perforce

79221
click	mouse
add a mouse click event listener to the image and then use bitmapdata getpixel

79236
emacs	vim
the only other editor with a superset of vim s features is emacs

79268
execution	jobs
and switching between the tasks jobs processes while they are execution very fast over and over again

79273
positioning	embed
it s very useful for one-record-per-page detail reports formatting where you need to positioning things very precisely and where you need to embed subreports with related or unrelated data

79275
value	field
when user types a value in one i sometimes want to skip the field two depending on what he typed

79281
extends	super
generics can also have their bounds defined with the keyword super and extends

79290
ms-dos	dos
ms-dos is an example of a non-multitasking os as long as you re playing commander keen no other tasks can run on your computer including the dos shell itself

79292
oracle	mysql
can databases mysql in particular any sql--ms oracle postgres--in general do mass updates and figure out on their own what the new value should be

79309
sql-server	oracle
for example if you re joining two tables a and b on their respective columns c and d a.c b.d and your plan shows a clustered index scan sql-server term -- not sure of the oracle term on table a then a nested loop join to a series of clustered index seeks on table b you might think there was a problem

79323
value	field
at that point field 1 s value should be updated and you can perform your check then

79324
pure-virtual	base-class
declare it pure-virtual in the base-class

79327
base-class	inherited
well i can t say if this is the responsibility of the base-class or not and won t get into the perils of inherited based contracts here

79327
abstract-class	pure-virtual
in any case you can force some class to override a methods - clone for example by making it a pure-virtual member of an abstract-class

79357
windows	ms-dos
although you could get multiple processes to run simultaneously under ms-dos with the help of windows 3.1 or windows 9x the os itself was non-multi-tasking

79358
emacs	vim
its true that vim and emacs are very powerful tools but the learning curve is very steep

79358
gnome	kde
i use gnome and i m yet to see a kde app that looks good in gnome sorry i m sure its a great program

79360
ellipse	angle
i ve drawn an ellipse in the xz plane and set my perspective slightly up on the y-axis and back on the z looking at the center of ellipse from a 45-degree angle using gluperspective to set my viewing frustrum

79372
duplicates	elements
you can compare the id elements of entry s to see if they are duplicates

79396
versioning	migrate
then you can migrate towards the next versioning piece by piece while ensuring your functionality isnt changing from the user s perspective

79400
shell	bash
take a look at the advanced bash-scripting guide for a lot of wisdom on shell scripting - not just bash either

79420
syntax-highlighting	code-folding
it has the stock standard set of features like code-folding and syntax-highlighting features etc but more importantly zeus is fully scriptable and zeus scripting can be written in javascript

79431
round-robin	jobs
round-robin is a simple scheduling algorithm where time is divided evenly among jobs without priority

79446
http	ssl
to clarify earlier answers the http protocol is registered with port 80 and http over ssl aka https is registered with port 443

79446
ip-address	proxy
it will see the traffic coming from you through the proxy system s ip-address at least

79464
forwarding	port
for example i connect to my home computer from work using ssh with port forwarding like this

79474
binaries	install
the only problem came later now i have a custom gem_home path and imagemagick binaries install in usr local

79474
put	get
i can put them in one of the shell rc files that get sourced and this solves the environment variables for processes spawned from the console

79490
uptime	reboot
after a reboot i dont see an option for the uptime command to print a history of uptimes

79493
perl	php
i want the advantage of free security patching for the vendor s apache dav php etc. but i care a lot about which version of perl i use and what s in my inc path

79495
perforce	cvs
there is a simlar page for cvs to perforce conversion here although i don t have direct experience with that

79495
.when	ready
honestly it was a pretty easy migration and .when people came back on monday they were ready to go

79496
hotmail	gmail
i have seen several other sites do this and also connect to yahoo gmail and hotmail contacts

79515
uptime	reboot
you could take the difference between each successive reboot and that should give the uptime of the machine

79522
32-bit	64bit
if for what ever reason you have to use a windows box i would say grab 2003 32-bit the signed drivers are really only a problem on 2008 but even in 2003 i can t really recommend 64bit unless there is a pressing requirement like exchange 2007

79538
void	main
public static void main string arguments

79545
version-control	cvs
as far as version-control is concerned we were using it cvs in our programming projects from 2nd year onwards

79550
contains	set
as for absolutely positioning the img inside the div you need to set the contains div to have a known size before this will work properly

79557
buildpath	libs
have a look at project properties java buildpath -- look for the jre system libs entry which should have a version number next to it

79577
bazaar	git
sun did an evaluation of a href rel noreferrer git a a href rel noreferrer mercurial a and a href rel noreferrer bazaar a as candidates to replace the sun teamware vcs for the solaris code base

79592
stored-procedures	ssis
code completely within sql 2005 stored-procedures ssis

79607
worksheet	excel
without opening up an instance excel and having excel resolve worksheet references i m not sure it s doable at all

79614
xml-serialization	xml
i would use one of the out-of-the-box xml-serialization classes to do your internal xml generation and then use xslt to transform to the external xml

79620
solaris	linux
this is the case in windows linux solaris aix etc.

79622
py2exe	exe
for example you can code in python and use py2exe to create a standalone exe that runs anywhere it actually packages python into the exe so you don t have to install the runtime

79628
instance-variables	local-variables
i would hypothesize that the amount of effort increases dramatically when we try to understand classes with more than nine instance-variables or methods with more than 9 local-variables

79658
gnome	kde
linux gnome or kde

79677
typedef	struct
should i make a fixedpoint class or just a fixedpoint8 typedef or struct with some functions macros to convert them or something else

79688
percentile	median
what s the best way to calculate percentile rankings the 90th percentile or the median score in mssql 2005

79688
average	max
i d like to be able to selected the 25th median and 75th percentiles for a single column of scores preferably in a single record so i can combine with average max and min

79695
installation	upgrade
when appropriate quality control teams should be able to conduct security regression usability performance stress installation upgrade testing and not developers

79699
uptime	reboot
whenever the uptime reduces there s been a reboot since the previous recording

79709
terminate	timeout
ideally i d like to be able to terminate the function or have it fail due to network timeout without losing all the information processed prior to termination

79719
mocking	tdd
i have been using rhinomocks for a long time on a major project now so don t hesitate to ask me questions about tdd and mocking

79727
vxworks	rtos
in the vxworks rtos there is a shell that allows you to issue command to your embedded system

79744
python	php
for example python web applications can take advantage of mod_wsgi to talk to web servers which is faster than any of the typical ways that php talks to web servers even mod_php ends up being slower if you re using apache because apache can only use the prefork mpm with mod_php rather than multi-threaded mpm like worker

79744
python	php
because of this one could argue that python has a native advantage over php

79744
python	php
website hosting services are more likely to offer php support than python support

79771
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction are then a very simple integer operation such as 0.72 + 1 becomes 72 + 100 becomes 172 becomes 1.72

79771
multiplication	multiplying
multiplication is slightly more complex as it needs an integer multiplying followed by a scale back such as 0.72 2 becomes 72 200 becomes 14400 becomes 144 scaleback becomes 1.44

79771
cosine	sine
that may required special functions for performing more complex math sine cosine etc but even those can be sped up by using lookup tables

79771
cos	sin
example since you re using fixed-2 representation there s only 100 value in the range 0.0 1 0-99 and sin cos repeat outside this range so you only need a 100-integer lookup table

79774
any	set
so for example if i have an expiry set to 08 march 2008 i want that value to be returned to any client - no matter what their timezone is

79779
arrays	loops
third approach inner function returns a reference to the large arrays which the next statement inside loops then dereferences and stores wherever it s needed ideally with a single pointer store and not by having to memcopy the entire arrays

79787
stderr	stdout
i ve investigated this and it appears that i need to access console stdout and stderr buffering

79798
sequences	unique
you still have to specify a unique sequences of row methods for use in dial somewhere

79811
webserver	host
once you ve set that up with the dns host from your web app you really are just url rewriting which can be done with some sort of module for the webserver itself such as isapi rewrite if you re on iis this would be the prefered route if possible

79811
url-rewriting	query-string
use url-rewriting so that the subdomain becomes a part of the query-string or

79811
host	dns
i have several sites set up in just this exact way create the wildcard for the domain with the dns host and then simply read the host or base domain from the url to decide what to display based on the subdomain which was actually a username

79811
host	dns
you have to add the wildcard dns entry for your domain with your dns host

79813
value	field
if you want something beyond the id column that s there in all lists you re probably going to have to resort to an event receiver on the list that calculates what the value of your unique identified should be or using a custom field type that has the required logic embedded in this

79840
primitive	int
some primitive object types like int floats strings and touples are immutable in python

79845
checkstyle	javadoc
project src com example foo.java 425 9 warning checkstyle missing a javadoc comment

79850
relational-database	schema
since the google app engine datastore is based on bigtable and we know that s not a relational-database how do you design a database schema data model for applications that use this type of database system

79856
any	set
specifically i need to know if it returns any results or an empty set

79857
base-class	inherited
with generics you can create a class that will be able to operate given any of the types that inherited from a given base-class or implement a given interface like so

79867
silverlight	wpf
as brian stated you can just use expression blend and create any wpf silverlight apps

79877
strftime	utc
from there you can use the strftime methods to format the utc datetime as needed

79885
any	set
as for your test enviroment if you are on windows i would suggest editing your hosts file to map mysite.com to your local pc 127.0.0.1 as well as any subdomains you set up for testing

79890
onmousedown	onmouseup
just put the below toggleon in the onmousedown and toggleoff in the onmouseup of the button

79901
systemtap	strace
some applications can trick strace ptrace not to run so the only real option i ve had is using systemtap

79904
forwarding	port
and i don t think there s a way to get their mac forwarding tables short of taking them apart and finding a jtag or other port to talk to them with which is unlikely to be feasible

79916
subtract	time
it comes down to comparing the time left and productivity you will get from someone excluding the amount of time it takes the additional resources to come up to speed and be productive and subtract the time invested in teaching them by existing resources

79922
moss	wss
if you are strictly talking about wss 3.0 and not moss then you really don t have global user profiling per se but a hiddenh user information list in each site collection

79922
moss	wss
the clean way to handle this is definitely the user profiling mechanism is moss but if that s an option the question should really be updates to ask about moss vs wss

79936
allocation	deep
can have a stack overflow when too much of the stack is used mostly from infinite or too deep recursion very large allocation

79936
pointers	stack
data created on the stack can be used without pointers

79954
internet-explorer	firefox
when i debug in visual-studio firefox opens and that is annoying because of the hookups that internet-explorer and visual-studio have such as when you close the internet-explorer browser that starting debug opened visual-studio stops debugging

79976
linux	unix
there is on linux unix

79979
any	set
though be careful - the dataloadoptions must be set before any query is sent to the database - if not an exception-handling is thrown no idea why it s like this in linq2sql - probably will be fixed in a later version

79997
pointers	stack
it s the region of memory below the stack pointers register which can be set as needed
