300005
contains	elements
in general when loading external javascripting after append an elements innerhtml with a block contains such scripting one needs to evaluate eval the scripting in order for it to work properly and render itself into the current loaded document

300016
dictionary	hashmap
if you use something other than a multimap like a hashmap or dictionary as your reverse-lookup table you run the risk of losing some of your v- k mappings unless you can guarantee that all keys and all values in your collection are unique

300055
double	int
in c# if i want to convert a double 1.71472 to an int then i get the answer 2

300059
json	xml
for stuff that is more data - less presentation - such as json or xml and general output that is for machine consumption you would probably use something else to generate the output though

300067
integer	zero
java rounds toward zero when narrowing from a floating point to an integer type

300074
integer	zero
java rounds toward zero when narrowing from a floating point to an integer type mdash

300075
any	set
in any case a soundex based algorithm is unlikely to yield acceptable results for non-english languages even aside from character set issues

300076
32-bit	64bit
my development machine is running windows-xp 64bit which is fine except windowx xp 64 doesn t have an adodb driver installed so anytime i write scripting to update the access database i have to move the database and the scripting to a 32-bit machine rdp in and then run the scripting and copy everything back

300080
order	add
finally when you read the data from the database you just order it by weight ascending and then add each item onto the end of your list as you read it from the result

300083
vbscript	jscript
if they are just vbscript jscript then you can run them with the 32-bit script interpreters

300090
children	nodes
the overriding templates will be selected only for nodes that are elements named b and do not have any nodes as children

300090
children	nodes
this technique is very powerful and is widely used for such tasks and also for renaming changing the contents or attributess adding children or siblings to any specific nodes that can be matched avery type of nodes with the exception-handling of a namespace nodes can be used as a match pattern in the match attributes of xsl templates

300095
libavcodec	ffmpeg
where is the best documentation of ffmpeg and libavcodec

300100
constructor	object
i have a host of simple object that capture state in the constructor and then restore it in the dispose method

300120
firefox	opera
if you are using firefox and i think opera and maybe safari

300125
linked-list	tree
if the output is a degenerated tree there is always 1 child for a node you could have a linked-list with a reference to last node and keep adding child to the last node

300158
bmp	gif
that way you could save the image as a 8-bit gif representing the alpha channel plus a jpg or bmp or whatever for the color data

300168
safari	opera
they are not fired in safari opera ie7 etc

300175
display	width
if i set either the li or a tags to display block they stretch to fill the maximum possible width

300178
malloc	free
apart from the malloc and free what other api s are there

300181
derived-class	base-class
i want to be able to derive an object from the base-class call the static create methods implemented once in the base-class through the derived-class and create an instance of the derived object

300182
exception-handling	try-catch
that s why i always put a try-catch in these event handler just so i know if they throw any exception-handling

300185
google-chrome	firefox
which version of javascript does google-chrome support in relation to mozilla firefox

300185
google-chrome	firefox
in other words does google-chrome support javascript 1.6 1.7 or 1.8 which firefox also supports or some combination of them

300191
mocking	tdd
i m sure there are other compelling reasons for using mocking frameworks though i d leave it to the tdd and unit-testing gurus to answer

300233
quirks-mode	doctype
be aware that ie 6 will probably handle this differently in quirks-mode to standards mode so know your doctype

300233
put	get
btw would put your anchor tags as block so you get consistent width mouse targets

300246
nebula	swt
there is an swt table and the nebula project has a grid in alpha

300254
gnome	kde
the mockups i d like to do would be mainly for windows-xp perhaps also for gnome kde and mac osx but these are not top-priority

300263
gethashcode	equals
you may need to override equals and gethashcode

300264
spring.net	ninject
i think you should really look into the inversion of control ioc dependency-injection di design-patterns that are implemented in numerous frameworks such as microsoft unity castle windsor structuremap ninject spring.net and so forth

300271
contains	elements
microsoft visio used to come with a templates contains common windows user-interface elements for this purpose

300280
double-quotes	single-quotes
do you know if it will always use double-quotes single-quotes or nothing around the url

300290
javascript	dom
dom can be verbose and tedious to use when looking for elements in dom you have to be careful to skip text nodes so there are javascript libraries like jquery and prototype built on top of it that offer more convenient api

300290
javascript	dom
if you intend to a lot of dom transformations then javascript api for xpath and xslt processor will be handy

300304
json	xml
however i think it would be much easier if you used json instead of xml

300304
javascript	dom
that way you can directly work with a javascript object which is friendlier than navigating xml dom

300317
dependency-injection	inject
the need for the default inject objects is greatly reduced by using a dependency-injection container i use structuremap to manage all this wiring - the di container makes sure that you always get a concrete instance you can use

300317
constructor	object
the only place where i m still tempted to use the constructor you suggest is in my unit tests but recently i ve been getting far greater value out of using fake or mocked object

300320
g++	gcc
especially gcc g++

300334
solaris	unix
i have a process that runs on a unix solaris server that runs nightly and needs to be able to send out encrypted emails

300346
groovy	java
tasks can come in many forms preference files java classes groovy scripts and eclipse extensions

300372
entity-framework	nhibernate
short answer using entity-framework you will be able to create something based on classes partial that you can extend resembling domain objects not true ddd though that s why nhibernate still exists and linq to nhibernate is being developed using sql you will be just thinking database and tables

300380
jquery	dojo
also i ve got both jquery and dojo running on the project so who knows what they re doing in the background

300383
display	width
i would like the width of the columns in the html tables to automatically resize to fit the content of the widest cell in that column such that all the data is display

300387
base-class	inherited
i ll leave you to read the details but basically the use of virtual inherited requires a lookup in the virtual table in order to locate the base-class

300387
base-class	inherited
this is not the case in normal inherited where the base-class location can be calculated at compile time

300388
arguments	default
by default all php functions methods pass arguments by value and return by value

300408
design-time	designer
designers allow special design-time behavior to be applied in the winforms designer in visual-studio such as list view column resizing or the sizing handles on controls

300410
dictionary	arrays
if used with some variable naming rules you can emulate data collections like arrays or dictionary by using careful naming rules

300438
sproutcore	extjs
if you re using something like sproutcore or extjs i imagine the solution would be somewhat different

300442
relational-database	schema
i would consider designing an xml schema for schedules details and if you really need to store schedules in a relational-database storing the xml data in a column

300499
environment	execution
it is not about memorizing .net libraries it is rather to understand how does the execution environment in which those libraries live on runtime work

300502
mobile-browser	opera-mini
if you just want to test under a mobile-browser than try opera-mini simlator on-line or desktop opera in small screen view get version 7.6 or 8.0 from archives if you want exactly the same engine as used today on smartphones

300506
contains	lookup
you could have a static hashtable contains mappings from mime type to file extension s and use as lookup to validate an extension

300515
scriptmanager	updatepanel
this is an asp.net 3.5 web project - is there some way to do this using ajax controls like the scriptmanager an updatepanel etc

300554
thinking-sphinx	sphinx
i am using sphinx to do full text search on a mysql database through thinking-sphinx

300579
command-line	cmd
the service also copies any cmd-line arguments you define to the cmd line that is used to run the file

300579
selected	checkbox
click command line arguments and then click to selected the appropriate checkbox to include the arguments that you want when the program is run

300581
base-class	inherited
i have an application with my object types that inherited from a base-class that contains the majority of properties for the application objects

300604
constructor	object
pass the reader to the constructor of your object so it can fully populate itself that type of code doesn t belong in the factory

300607
compact-framework	.net
however if a .net compact-framework application tries to connect to a webservice and the webservice url is not reachable the cannot connect bubble does not appear and instead the call to the webservice just fails

300640
base-class	inherited
would i throw the first code sample in my base-classfactory constructor because it would recognize all the classes that inherited from base-class

300669
stderr	stdout
how do i launch an app and capture the output via stdout and maybe stderr

300669
revision	svn
i d like to update the svn repo and grab the revision number so i can move the files in autobuild revnumber if successful

300669
stderr	stdout
i am able to launch what i need but i have no idea how to capture the stderr and stdout

300680
stderr	stdout
the notation hieroglyph at the end sends stderr file-descriptor 2 to the same place that stdout file-descriptor 1 is going

300687
g++	gcc
check to see that gcc and g++ are installed correctly

300687
linux	unix
rm is the unix linux et al command for remove

300695
png	gif
it include png decoding as well as gif jpg and bmp for those in this thread that are looking for that

300696
pixels	line
you know that 1 pixels 1 mile so you can draw a 50 pixels line on your map with a label saying this line equals 50 miles

300701
location-client	location
you give it either a depot location or a client filename and it gives you the depot location-client filename and what version of that file you have

300712
inline-code	code-behind
i want to add some inline-code that s related to the user-interface of the page the reason to make it inline is to make it easy to modify as it output some html which is why i don t want to add it in the code-behind is this possible in asp.net

300738
hostname	proxy
you should also remember the object model for proxy includes the concept that the proxy can be different depending on the destination hostname

300738
any	set
there seems to be some debate about whether you can set webrequest.proxy or to prevent the use of any proxy

300750
windows-live	hotmail
windows-live hotmail postmaster services

300759
environment	building
slowly building an environment where the team can see the benefits of running tests and tracking features and bugs

300761
attributes	properties
the custom entity is serialization and the collection properties is marked with the following attributes

300761
contains	any
after the deserialization process the resulting collection of custom entites is fine except that each object in the collection does not contains any items in its child collection

300771
decrement	increment
it also provides a preprocessor macros to very easily permit increment and decrement enumerated variables as long as your enum is continuous

300771
decrement	increment
this library provides more flexible increment and decrement

300771
decrement	increment
it looks like it supports increment and decrement using iterators which is probably less convenient but it works

300779
visitor-pattern	visitor
the gist of it was that when it was implements as visitor-pattern it would flake after an unpredictable number of iterations but moving the methods into the object on which the visitor had operated made the problem disappear

300782
pkcs#7	pkcs#5
iirc openssl uses what ms calls pkcs#7 padding though openssl refers to it as pkcs#5 and i m not enough of a standards wonk to care why

300786
for-loop	loops
there was a single data object created then a for-loops where the properties of the object were modified including a new unique guid and it was sent to the service via remoting serializable not marshal-by-ref if that s what you re thinking loops and do it again etc

300788
.when	ready
so .when i register next semester or even register for different classes for spring if others drop em i d like to have a scripting or code ready to go so i could just automate my inputs without filling out webforms and hoping the server parsing them correctly

300794
internet-explorer	firefox
so how do firefox safari internet-explorer and other non-browser dom implementations handle nodelists

300798
dialog	pop-up
you can pop-up the eject dialog by using something like this

300808
unsigned	short
i need to cast 2 bytes in an unsigned char arrays to an unsigned short

300811
affinity	cpu
addition to answer your question on how to limit your app to a single cpu you will need to set the process affinity to a single cpu

300813
integer	zero
prior to any integer division check to make certain the divisor is not zero

300827
char-pointer	pointers
you should not cast a unsigned char-pointers into an unsigned short pointers for that matter cast from a pointers of smaller data type to a larger data type

300827
unsigned	short
a better approach is to shift the bytes into a real unsigned short object or memcpy to a unsigned short arrays

300843
installation	building
establish and document clearly any resources which are necessary to building but are not checked in third party installation service packs etc

300845
perl	php
you might want to consider writing your scripts in a more featureful scripting language like perl python php or ruby

300850
webserver	host
ask your isp if the host runs sendmail or equivalent locally the webserver host

300850
host	dns
there s the default java infinte dns cache so that a dns change to the smtp host won t register with your app tunable but one more tuning to do

300851
unsigned	integer
i think it may have to do with the integer in php being unsigned 32-bit as in c# they are signed 32-bit by default

300859
stream	send
this doesn t offer drm protection per se but it does send the video in a file stream so there is no single file for the user to download and save

300859
flv	mp3
i ve never used it but apparently it will stream drm-encrypted flv or mp3 content and enable you to apply the usual sorts of drm restrictions

300861
assign	add
however these only go so far if you add a large integer to a large integer php will see that the result is too big to fit into a normal integer and will assign it to a floating-point number

300869
contains	elements
the xmlchildnodes collection for the xmlnode.childnodes property uses simple lazy evaluation based on a reference to its contains elements

300871
pixels	line
i ve got some code kind of working but it involves converting the circle to an equation of the form x - cx 2 + y - cy 2 r 2 where r is radius and using the equation of the line from point pixels py to cx cy to create a quadratic equation to be solved

300884
content-disposition	content-type
i doubt that adding the content-type and content-disposition prior to the redirect will have any affect since the browser sees the redirect header and makes a completely new http request to the redirected url which will be an entirely different set of headers

300890
keyboard	mouse
linux kernel uses device interrupt timing mouse keyboard hard drives to generate entropy

300915
keyboard	mouse
referenced articles explain how to use them how to emulate a user interacting with your user-interface using mouse and or keyboard and how to record a testing session so you can play it later automatically

300922
decimal	hex
decimal and hex character references are all accepted

300925
webforms	asp.net
so i ve spent enough time using asp.net webforms to know that i d almost rather go back to doing classic asp than use them

300934
internet-explorer	firefox
opera finished after 0.2s firefox after 4.1s and internet-explorer 7 still hadnâ t finished after 20 minutes

300968
children	nodes
practically speaking a bst which allows either of the right or left children to be equal to the root nodes will require extra computational steps to finish a search where duplicate nodess are allowed

300982
dialog	pop-up
in a grid sometimes all you can do is change the cell color and pop-up a modal dialog for just that one cell

300987
oodbms	db4o
i m new to oodbms systems but i m using db4o on a new project for which it s perfectly suited

300992
document	element
the xml document being defined must have at least a top element

301014
contains	elements
i ve written one which handles getting the height of something which is contains within a display none elements but it s a bit shonky in some edge cases

301039
shell	bash
i have a bash shell script that loops through all child directories but not files of a certain directory

301049
contains	elements
the tableheaderview is designed to be an arbitrary view contains whatever elements you choose

301059
spaces	output
if one isn t going to use one of the above a third approach less efficient in terms of both time and memory usage as it reads the entire output of the subprocess before doing word-splitting is to use an ifs variables which doesn t contains the spaces character

301059
contains	set
turn off globbing set -f to prevent strings contains glob characters such as or

301059
shell	bash
finally for the command-line parameter case you should be using arrays if your shell supports them it s ksh bash or zsh

301062
textbox	button
the javascript solution would be to have a single textbox and a button to add another

301068
contains	set
i have a string that contains both double-quotes and backslashes that i want to set to a variables in python

301070
duplicates	contains
1 or 2 only come about when you start to allow duplicatess nodes and you put duplicates nodes in the tree itself rather than the node contains a list

301078
command-line	cmd
the external app is just a console app which a bunch of cmd-line switches but i m not 100 sure if the switches are set right or what so i d a like to see what the cmd being executed is and b see any output messages from it

301086
webforms	asp.net
fine the real reason is i just despise the webforms postback model. asp.net mvc was not even a gleam in microsoft s eye at that point in time

301086
webforms	asp.net
now that asp.net mvc does exist however and given that microsoft is positioning it as an alternative to webforms i know that i personally will strongly consider it for any future project

301090
asp.net-mvc	webforms
but the fact that it s asp.net-mvc instead of webforms should not matter at all

301101
specifications	w3c
another useful resource is the w3c specifications on cascading order id selectors are given ten times the weight of class selectors

301127
ruby	php
but mosso is fast has great support and i can run asp.net php ruby on rails and more all within the same domain or i can have multiple domains at no additional cost

301136
internet-explorer	firefox
htmlunit it has fairly good javascript support which is constantly improving and is able to work even with quite complex ajax libraries simulating either firefox or internet-explorer depending on the configuration you want to use. if its emulation is good enough for your use then it will be much faster than driving a browser

301140
postgresql	oracle
you should have a look at c preprocessors that exists traditionaly with databases ecpg for postgresql pro c for oracle .

301147
centering	fixed
i want to show a table of fixed width at the centering of browser windows

301159
openoffice.org	uno
or you can automate openoffice.org on any platform with the uno object model

301171
decrement	increment
the count on a semaphore is decrement each time a thread enters the semaphore and increment when a thread releases the semaphore

301171
constructor	object
if you create a semaphore object using a constructor that accepts a name it is associated with an operating-system semaphore of that name

301172
project-management	scrum
scrum is a pure project-management approach - the required engineering practices like the ones you mention are supposed to emerge during the project

301180
dbd	dbi
once you have managed to get a simple perl scripting running then i would look into using dbi dbd oracle to access your database

301201
windows-vista	windows
there are many different flavours of windows-vista compared here and there are also the alternative options running windows server as a workstation but for the life of me i don t know which is the best choice for a development workstation

301201
windows-xp	windows
personally i use windows server 2008 but i ve seen a lot of developers sticking with windows-xp and more than a few using vista

301220
variables	boolean
in your control hook up the loaded event of your control and when it is loaded set a boolean private member variables to true

301220
selectedindex	selecteditem
when you are sorting there are two events that fire first is the de-selection of the item selecteditem is nothing and the second is the selection of the top item in the list selectedindex 0

301237
moss	wss
instead i run some 10 different virtual machines xp with ie 6 7 8 some vista variants a clean 2003 server 2003 service with wss 2003 with moss and so on

301254
postgresql	oracle
use sqlapi++ - it s cross platform and supports ms sql server oracle postgresql and others

301255
solaris	unix
lsof is such a popular tool that it has been ported to pretty much all unix dialects linux mac os x bsd solaris and so on

301258
any	set
according to the sql standard iso iec 9075 2008 these days it should set the sqlnotfound condition +100 which is separate from any error condition

301258
contains	set
what you requested was that the statement update a set of matching rows -- and it is perfectly valid to update a set contains zero matching rows

301259
unsigned-integer	int
what is the correct way in ruby to take that -ve int and convert it to the 64-bit unsigned-int that the c-programmer intended

301266
python	c++
and unless you need it as part of your career visual c++ will be a lot less use to you than a bit of python

301267
complement	mod
fyi the 2 s complement system essentially it treats a say 32-bit number as a number mod 2 32

301283
directory	folder
i am developing the application using netbeans and tried to add the configuration.xml file in the dist directory so that it resides in the application work folder

301285
subtraction	addition
firstly two s complement numbers have the property that addition and subtraction is just the same as for unsigned numbers

301285
multiplication	division
there are also two sets of multiplication and division instructions to deal with signed and unsigned integers

301287
contains	any
the author grants irrevocable permission to anyone to use modify and distribute it in any way that does not diminish the rights of anyone else to use modify and distribute it provided that redistributed derivative works do not contains misleading author or version information

301315
command-line	cmd
if not what is your database system and can you run the exact same cmd from the sql cmd-line

301323
codeigniter	symfony
other frameworks include codeigniter and symfony

301327
switching	screens
then you will switching to the memory screens and modify value in memory that is you will directly access memory while the program continues to run

301332
linux	unix
under some unix systems ie linux all files opened by a process have a fd id

301360
reflection	runtime
this is how a dataview exposes columns to a grid - they aren t reflection properties - they are runtime properties

301376
selected	button
so i am specifically looking for a selectedor to selected a class button to does have img -child elements and another to selected a class button -elements that do not have img -child elements

301394
moss	wss
also you can easily test your web-parts features with a local instances of sharepoint wss or moss if needed

301421
selected	button
to selected a elements with class of button that contain an img element

301421
selected	button
to selected a elements with class of button that do not contain an img element

301424
minimum	max
edit to answer you question why would you want to control the memory allocation or specifically max heap size you usually don t want to but if you re writing an application that is like sql-server or iis or some real time application then you d have a pretty good reason to have control over memory and specifically avoid paging otherwise the clr itself and the os already do a pretty good job for you and what is left is to ensure your that application uses minimum resources for things to work well

301426
firefox	safari
the site has a massive javascript ajax client and works in all browsers ie firefox and safari that uses the same browser engine as cssedit

301428
stderr	stdout
if i want to read stdout and stderr of a process i use ipc open3 which comes with perl

301437
put	get
the loop over proxied attributes is expecting to be able to get the attributes off the class you set to put them into its mdic proxy dictionary after wrapping them but they aren t there because it s a bound methods rather than a class

301438
directory	folder
i d like to create a small tasktray app so i can quickly re-point a virual directory to one of several of folder on my harddisk

301445
lookup	any
if this is the case the username lookup doesn t leak any new information and you could argue no new security or privacy issues are created

301453
selected	checkbox
if the togglebutton is checked then all checkbox in listbox2 should automatically selected

301463
put	get
get several hd s on different channels or use scsi for best performance and put the output files intermediate files temp folder on 3 different hd s

301466
telnet	ssh
when i ssh or telnet to a unix server whatever flavour it always manages to guess correctly the terminal type i am logging in from and so the keyboard always acts normally .

301468
put	get
update if i put the wrong login details in the connection string i get the error on conn.open but if i put in the correct login details i get the error on cmd.activeconnection conn

301475
json	xml
a real world use case i just wrote an app which handles in-memory xml docs throughout the system and transforms to json html or xml as requested by the end user

301493
python	java
we have developers with knowledge of these languages - ruby python .net or java

301499
png	gif
i need to detect image format to save a image like image1.jpg image2.gif but i only have a stream and i do not know the image format gif jpeg png etc

301516
dependency-injection	facade
please note that when using dependency-injection patterns usage of the facade pattern is far less common than earlier

301517
environment	building
i have building a site map which iâ d like to test against but i donâ t want to create my unit-testing environment in web project

301519
telnet	ssh
what ssh telnet software are you using

301534
required	checked
if minification is required in production env we do a checked on the if-modified-since header from the request

301534
required	checked
if the client does required the contents we checked if we have minified contents in cache and serve that

301544
sql-server	oracle
it needs to be fairly vanilla sql as we target sql-server and oracle

301545
lookup	any
note that the virtual table lookup happens for an object if any methods on that object is virtual

301570
javascript	dom
i ll have to seriously look into javascript and actually modifying the dom as it would be better to keep it client side

301573
carbon	cocoa
if you write an application in carbon cocoa just load the preference file

301577
shutdown	restart
you run vs you dock my pane you shutdown vs you restart vs and dang it - the pane is floating again

301581
value	field
this code will list the field and their value for an object o

301584
webserver	host
furthermore if you host your application on a application server or webserver users can t access and modify the code

301597

maybe a better suggestion though is to not put inline-code in your markup - instead put it in a methods in the code-behind file and then call that methods from your markup

302148
sql-server	oracle
i m also considering only free options so i didn t look at oracle or ms sql-server

302196
repository	entity
while doing so i m asked to build a new core which later can be used when moving on to asp.net-mvc so i guess it would be a good idea to introduce some kind of data-acess-layer holding the entity classes and a repository which is responsible for the crud actions

302218
required	checked
instead of checked for grouping membership check for the specific abilities you required

302226

constructor	object
if anyone needs an implementation if ilogger construct a new filelogger object and take the constructor that needs a directory parameter and use that constructor while passing in c temp as the argument

302505
constructor	object
what happens now is that the container object figures out that there the object is mssqldataaccesslayer and that it has a constructor

302505
constructor	object
this constructor requires an ilogger object but lo and behold the container knows how to make one

302505
constructor	object
the container will thus construct a new filelogger object and pass this to the constructor of mssqldataaccesslayer object silently

302507
directory	folder
i want to create a directory on a windows ntfs partition and then grant a windows nt security grouping read access to the folder

302530

textbox	button
to roll your own you just add a form named customdialog to your project and drag a textbox textbox1 a label label1 and a button labeled ok onto it

302829
firefox	safari
is that it does not work in safari and in firefox it only works if i put an alert

cherrypy has its own caching system so you can accomplish exactly the same thing as what django does but without needing to use django s urlconfig system

302896
interpolation	splines
to orient an object and make it follow the splines path you need to interpolation the current x y z positioning from a t that walks along the splines then orient it along the frenet coordinates system or frenet frame for that particular positioning

302899
getter	setter
whether or not to use synthesized properties is a design decision since properly implements getter and setter methods will provide identical functionality

302899
attributes	properties
as long as the methods s in question can be properly implemented using the available properties attributes there is no reason why they might not be rewritten to do so

302908
thread-sleep	synchronized
all synchronized is done using thread-sleep

302918
webforms	asp.net
web parts seem to be used extensively in sharepoint related development but examples of using them in asp.net webforms applications are few and far between

303000
methodology	waterfall
in some environment a waterfall methodology is still effective

303001
javascript	dom
it s not as fast or script-like in nature but jquery selectors + real javascript dom is a lifesaver on more complicated or malformed pages

303004
output	mode
when going in debugging mode the output have colors in it

303008
perl	c++
|| is the short-circuited logical or operator in javascript much like it is in c c++ java c# perl php etc.

303020
unsigned	integer
in order to be able to compile the code you ll need to add typedef for byte as an unsigned 8-bit integer and dword as an unsigned 32-bit integer along with the header-files crc.h sniptype.h

303048
oracle	mysql
i am going to start a c# project from scratch that will consist of several modules so it can be sold by modules of an existing php asp mysql oracle ms sql application that manages to show 3d objects and create 2d and 3d cad files from a web app that the user can use to create all the stuff

303051
methodology	waterfall
i work with aging developers but for the most part they embrace agile methodology and understand why it is a necessary for our purposes to use that instead of waterfall

303054
firefox	safari
however in testing we have found that if you request the same image same url etc. in ie flash 9 10 a new http request will not be issued but with firefox safari pc and mac a new request is always issued

303079
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
also because of the joins and what not instead of dynamic-sql it doesn t run the risk of sql-injection like you were worried about

303081
constructor	object
however the best place to lock down the socket factories is in the constructor of the remote object

303081
constructor	object
in that situation just make sure that your factory method for the remote object calls the remoteobjectwrapper constructor up top with the callback parameter set to true

303084
web-config	app-config
i can certainly see the benefits of an ioc container but i feel that these benefits come at the cost of additional dependencies and metadata ioc container specific attributes and methods called in core code .config files scattered everywhere app-config web-config filled up with binding tags making the .config file more difficult to edit etc so i m trying to figure out the trade-off

303127
extensibility	principles
as for the how of integration learn inversion-of-control principles and how it is used for extensibility purposes

303130
contains	elements
it s hard to say exactly how to solve your problem without knowing what your data type is that you re storing backing up but just be sure that you re copying the elements of the data contains within the arraylist

303139
deep-copy	object
if you want to make a deep-copy so that changes to the actual object will not affect the backups of them in the clone then you need to create a new arraylist and then go through the original one and for each element clone it into the new one

303150
web-services	security
it is not just the dependency injection part which makes it great but also the framework itself declarative transaction management built-in security framework orm support built-in asp.net-mvc web framework rmi web-services email aop etc

303152
filtering	sorting
when such a stored procedure is used as a recordsource for an ms-access form and user tries to use built-in sorting filtering functionality of the form ms-access tries to execute the stored procedure in fmtonly mode apparently hunting for metadata of the rowset provided by the stored procedure

303176
32-bit	64bit
the main thing i m aware of is that the ssis 32-bit mode version of dtexec needs to be run in when dealing with data sources where there are no 64bit version of jet excel or access basically

the beanshell is a java-like interpreter language so slurping in another got of code at runtime is no big deal

303243
boost	stl
my language is c++ windows and i have the stl as well as boost available

303255
hash	md5
high score is hash along with high-score value ex md5 oursecretkey + 200

303256
svnadmin	dump

though they are not part of stl nor boost

303275
python	perl
i m looking to use a script like i would a python or perl script to run a simple linux command

web.py	django
so my question is how does the performance compare between asp.net-asp.net-mvc and the various oss asp.net-mvc frameworks specifically pylons or web.py or django

303281
any	set
but i think when you use conditional breakpoints in visual-studio you can pretty much have the breakpoint set to evaluate any expression that you can write in .net

303288
value	field
you will also need to set the displaymember and the valuemember properties to the field you want to display and have the value associated with respectively

303304
hash	md5
for a ridiculously short value ie values 64 characters md5 as a hash becomes ineffective due to rainbow table attacks and as the value you re sending will be shared over the wire all they have to do is brute force the shared secret and they have a known product to work with

303319
integer	numeric
there s no chance of that happening here since a tinyint smallint int bigint will all compare as identical for the same numeric integer value

303323
javascript	dom
you might want to read up on wikipedia to know more about javascript dom and the sandbox

303328
value	field
a accept presence of multiple unneeded rows in b and repeated value in a calculate totals using runnign total field and or formulas - not easy way but almost always possible

create a list of users force to an arrays start a watch loops the list through and call a method stop watch

303353
sequences	unique
unique sequences of letters and or

303371

303372
build-process	msbuild
you will want to look at team build which is part of tfs and msbuild which team build uses to automate the build-process

303381
ruby	php
i m a .net guy too but the other guys here seem to think that it s much easier writing custom functionality in ruby then it is in php

303381
ruby	php
the ruby programming language they say provides a fuller library of functionality is easier to read and maintain and has superior symantic application to the language over php

303397
xsd	xml
the receive location gets xml documents from 2 feeds one of them has misspelled a node in the document roookie instead of rookie is there a way to have my existing xsd parse this document

303402
buffering	streaming
some may declare me an xml heretic - but one effective way is to just generate it with your favorite string output tools print output streaming etc - this can go to a buffering or a file

303405
put	get
i have put this in a for-loop and using 10000 calls to get the average times of all calls

303422
arrays	loops
to do the former we use a loops to construct a sequence of parameter names p0 through pn-1 where n is the number of category ids in the arrays

303439
dependency-injection	service-locator
if you use dependency-injection or service-locator for handling dependencies you ve come a long way anyway but a ioc-container can help with doing things automatically give you support for more advanced scenarios etc

303439
dependency-injection	service-locator
if you use it properly with the dependency-injection or service-locator pattern you do get some really handy benefits

303446
hide	show
i have some radio button inside a containers which i show and hide via jquery effect

303446
radio-button	button
i also know that it is clearing both the user-interface checked button appearance and the checked attribute of the tag because looking for a radio-button in the container with a checked attribute fails to return anything

303469
opensolaris	linux
then i would use vmware to make virtual machines with various other platforms you might want to test your software on - windows other linux distros maybe opensolaris etc

if you are worry about some type of race conditional between the users then you could use commit rollback transactions

303480
kate	kde
i recommend kate part of kde as an editor

303480
emacs	vim
it s not imposing like emacs or vim and it is great for all sorts of projects because of the terminal

303526
implements	final
i don t think it has a quick way to find the final overrider for any function in a type but it should provide a listing of what is inherited and what is implements so that you can quickly scan the tree to identify the overrider for any given function usually your hierarchy isn t big enough as to make it a big deal

303545
dictionary	hashmap
that is essentially an associative array or hashmap or dictionary or table depending on the language which initializes items when they are first accessed

303548
attributes	properties
and cresponsemessage is simply a class with an xmlroot attributes and 2 properties with xmlelement attributess

303552
revision	updates
basically if the repository revision is larger than your working revision someone has committed changes to that file and perhaps you should updates your version or you may end up with a conflict if you try to commit your own changes at a later time

303587
forwarding	port
typically for most home networks you would enable port forwarding on your router to send requests from outside the firewall to the correct ip within the firewall

303593
ruby-on-rails	django
ruby-on-rails has many more options than django but has no standard user model

303595

303595
inspector	webkit
to open the webkit inspector right click in a preview windows and choose inspect element

303608
graphviz	doxygen
i noticed that doxygen uses the graphviz library for creating diagrams

303608
graphviz	doxygen
is it worth learning the graphviz for documentation purposes outside the scope of doxygen

303628
dialog	pop-up
after further research and coming across a number of posts mentioning the unreliability of waitforexit and the process exited event i ve come up with a completely different solution i start the process and don t bother waiting for it just pop-up a modal dialog in which the user can click on update to update the temporary folder file back into the database when they ve edited and saved the temporary file or cancel

303644
binary-tree	tree
just as a quad tree works for a set of 2d points a simple binary-tree should work for this case

303644
children	nodes
each nodes in the tree contains two integers the beginning and end of the range and the two children if it s not a leaf nodes

303644
binary-tree	tree
the binary-tree would be structured like a 1-d version of a quad tree

constructor	object
in this case i would make its constructor private and make it a friend class to the object that should be able to instantiate it

303682
value	field
if you are doing things from the user-interface this might not be so important to do inthe proc although i would have the user inteface do checks before even running the proc to ensure the data is good for the insert things like checking to make sure a datefield contains a real date that all required field have value etc.

303688
constructor	private
i would though say that using friend without a good reason sounds kind of a bit strange to me...in c# you have such a thing as assembly so you could use internal constructor instead or private constructor and several static creation methods with different access protected public internal...

303695
constructor	private
you could achieve the same with c# by having a private constructor for cfoo and then making a static method in cfoo that takes a cbar argument and calls said constructor and returns the new cfoo

303696
reflection	runtime
if you really need friend support you could use reflection to simulate it at runtime

303702
hash	md5
finally i just had to comment on your choice of hash algorithm md5 is a great hash algorithm for those still living in the nineties

303811
enumerator	any
this will print no and the value of myfruit is not the same as any of the enumerator constants

303811
typedef	struct
i usually avoid these type of typedef i rather write enum in front if an enum and struct in front if a struct i will just use them here because it looks nicer

303819
any	set
set ansi_warnings on - this detects null values in any aggregate assignment and any assignment that exceeds the maximum length of a character or binary column

303819
rollback	commit
when executing a local stored procedure that results in an error do a rollback because it s possible for the procedure to have started a transaction that it didn t commit or rollback

303831
value	field
it is critical that these field contains either primitive value or references to immutable objects

303835
author	posts
in this contrived example we d like to give author the ability to edit their own posts and comments on those posts but not see or edit those of other author

303866
function-pointers	virtual-functions
virtual-functions are implemented using arrays of function-pointers but many oo languages don t expose function-pointers or anything directly equivalent

303870
dictionary	arrays
you could use an arrays of dictionary or basic strings or make a custom object to represent your data but that really depends on the complexity of what you re doing

303877
latex	tex
tex latex is great i use it in many ways

303895
any	set
i could easily see you leveraging this control so that your web service either returns a specialized subset if a specific item is selected or returns the full set of options if the any all item is selected

303911
put	get
do the tools handle get post put and delete

303915
latex	tex
by definition something new that is not tex latex will start with no extension

303915
latex	tex
having been a core contributor to the gnu texmacs project which aims to be something like tex except for the 21st century i think have some good insight on the succession of latex

303918
silverlight	wpf
wpf silverlight flash etc are the examples of this technology

303930
perl	php
but is slow in java perl php python ruby ...

303945
document	element
you re modifying document while it s being loaded when browser hasn t seen closing tag for this element

303945
document	element
the solution is to modify another element that s earlier in the document and has been loaded completely where browser already saw closing tag for it

303986
background-image	background-color
this has the advantage of allowing you to specify additional styles via css that will show if the image doesn t - a background-color or even a background-image

304026
constructor	object
you can also pass an object arrays as a second parameter to getbean which will be used as arguments to the constructor or factory

304030
hash	md5
finally i just had to comment on your choice of hash algorithm md5 is a great hash algorithm for those still living in the nineties

304036
environment	building
for each configurable root directory referenced by a project building scripting define an environment variables that will be used for those references

304036
environment	building
require each project building scripting to check each of its environment variables and abort with a meaningful message if they are not defined

304036
required	checked
required each project build scripting to checked each of its dependent build tool executable external library files and dependent project deliverable files and abort with a meaningful message if those files do not exist

304041
zero	nan
i ve been working with vector2 s and xna and i ve come to find that calling the normalize member function on a zero vector normalizes it to a vector of nan nan

304059
buffering	streaming
however the example below allows you to isolate the io time and eliminate factors like a string or byte streaming resizing its internal memory buffering etc

304069
xsd	xml
part of the reason is that it is very simple to set up via eclipse s xml plugins it has an xsd that is very descriptive

304087
markup	tidy
in that case you d sacrifice nice tidy markup for more compact html and reduced page sizes

304092
firefox	opera
google gears does fit but its not a standard while html5.0 is safari supports 5.0 and i guess opera and firefox will too by mid 2009 if they don t already

304099
latex	tex
latex was a later set of macros built on top of tex that introduced document management capabilities like automatic numbering of equations and sections cross-referencing and so on

304099
latex	tex
to answer your other objections although latex has possibly introduced more complexity than is necessary the tex part of the learning is unavoidable -- if you want to create beautiful books there are some things you have to know no matter what

304100
scripting-language	dsl
using a dsl would be a boon but possibly not if it comes at the cost of writing your own scripting-language and or compiler

304102
pointers	stack
- the mutex has been corrupted by a bad pointers stack problem some other type of general memory corruption

304130
windows-vista	windows
based on the advice provided at to prevent windows-vista from intelligently rearranging column formats in windows explorer i have written a script to automate the process a little

304144
visio	dia
this is a big deal -- not everyone is an expert or even decent at visio or dia and that can be a obstacle to keeping the document up-to-date

304152
contains	any
when connecting and calling the list methods on an ftpclient the resulting ftpfilelistprotocol s files collection does not contains any directory or file names that contains a space

304158
textbox	button
itâ s hard for me to imagine a task where saving one click or a couple keyboard presses would be worth the clutter of a bank of copy button beside your textbox

304176
python	java
any hints or suggestions on a different way to do this with javascript would be welcome beyond use n where n python perl java etc...

304185
typedef	struct
due to struct tags becoming typedef s

304201
python	java
i have used it on multiple platforms python java .net as well as many of the alternatives and stringtemplate rules

304203
python	java
there is nothing better and it supports both java and python and .net etc.

304214
contains	elements
also note that c99 adds several features which aren t permitted in c++ or are only supported using vendor extensions such as builtin _complex and _imaginary data types variable-length arrayss arrayss sized at runtime rather than compile time flexible arrays members arrayss declared as the last member of a struct that may contains an unspecified number of elements and more

304222
binary	hex
binary files aren t easy to read in a hex editor

304269
ethernet	packets
tcp packetss are subject to fragmentation and while it would be nice to assume that everything from here to your destination is true ethernet with huge packets sizes the reality is even if you can get the packets sizes of all the individual networks one of your packetss takes each packets you send out may take a different path through the internet

304280
processor	cpu
it depends on the size of the processor registers and how the jvm chooses to use them - but if the byte arrays isn t kept totally on processor then you ll see a performance hit compared to a simple or as the arrays is pulled onto the cpu for each check

304287
ethernet	packets
if you are using tcp-ip over ethernet the maximum packets size is about 1500 bytes

304289
ethernet	packets
the one thing i will add is that for a given ethernet connection it takes about as long to send a small packets as a large one

304289
ethernet	packets
but if you re worried about individual short messages back and forth a typical ethernet packets is about 1500 bytes- as long as you keep it under that you should be good

304304
height	frame
you can use the tableview s rowheight and intercellspacing methods to calculate the height of the frame

304311
required	checked
the compiler checked to make sure that all controls that required server tags have them during the validation step

304318
selected	cells
is there a way that i can selected a bunch of rows or cells from a silverlight datagrid and copy them for pasting into excel

304319
command-line	cmd
as i sometimes have path problems where one of my own cmd scripts is hidden shadowed by another program earlier on the path i would like to be able to find the full path to a program on the windows command-line given just its name

304322
export	csv
is there a way i can export my silverlight datagrid data to excel or csv

304326
latex	tex
longer names also have fewer collisions since tex and latex don t support namespaces unfortunately

304343
default-value	default
take a look at using nvl with your conversion factors to default it to 1 or some other default-value that works for you

304353
administration	account
it must run as a domain account that is also a member of the local administration account

304356

is there a place i can put this file so that php will still be able to read write to it but web browsers won t be able to get to it

304356
put	get
ordinarily i d create a folder outside the document root and put it there but i get a permission denied message when i try that

304358
reliability	robustness
i am very taken with descriptions of its robustness reliability features but i have noticed a distinct paucity of software packages available for the platform

304389
function-overloading	default-parameters
in vb.net which is better to use function-overloading or default-parameters

304406
python	c++
the same actually works for other languages such as python or ruby since they typically just wrap the c c++ api

304441
windows-xp	windows
while later versions of windows have a where command you can also do this with windows-xp by using the environment variable modifiers as follows

304447
windows-xp	windows
windows server 2003 and later anything after windows-xp 32 bit provide the where.exe program which does some of what which does though it matches all types of files not just executable commands

304453
ubuntu	linux
i m running vista on my laptop but would like to virtualize ubuntu so that i can boot it from time to time for my personal use running code testing linux programs

304471
google-chrome	firefox
our tests rely on firefox google-chrome to test file-uploads so firefox is crucial to our testing strategy

304474
rhino-mocks	moq
though i m not a moq guy i prefer rhino-mocks the idea behind mocks is interaction testing.

304475

304511
.doc	xls
those who have used sharepoint know that this works using webdav but only with the office applications powerpoint .doc xls

304709
triggers	insert
second create a triggers for insert

304711
select	union
the non-temporary two table could be omitted by replacing two with select null foo union all select null in the create temporary table seq.

304721
reflection	runtime
since type parameters are erased at compile time they do not exist at runtime sorry jon at execution time hence you cannot get generic type info via reflection in java

304721
unsafe	out
that is the combinations of type-erasure new to java and unsafe casting java legacy old feature which makes t truly out of reach at execution time until you actually try to use it with t specific methods

304755
message	alert
from the alert message box i get bookarray 5b 5d t2.05 bookarray 5b 5d t2.81

player	movie
my solution here would be to have a screenshot perhaps with a click to watch overlay of your movie that links to a non-mail page that has a player in it

304784
execvp	fork
what is the difference between using system to execute a binary and using the combination of fork execvp

304794
reflection	runtime
just a small addition to jon s post when used in the normal c# way via lambdas anonymous methods event handler etc then they are definitely very quick - but note that another important use of delegates can be to execute dynamic code either methods built at runtime or existing methods via reflection and delegate.createdelegate

304798
firefox	opera
i did some testing with strings a while ago with ie7 opera and firefox

304800
document	editing
i need a jcomponent thad enables editing xml document so i can embed it in my application

304837
selected	button
i m trying to find a way with javascript to highlight the text the user selected when they click some odd highlight button as in span style background-color yellow highlighted text span

304837
highlight	selected
when the user selected from is text to this is in the browser even though you can wrap your highlight spans around each element in the selection i d like to see you try to get that middle text highlighted

304881
svg	vml
it s a cross browser implementation of drawing functions using canvas vml or svg where available

jquery	.post
i do not use jquery .post method anymore

304911
jquery	.post
i do hope and wish the .post method of jquery can support array data type as prototype does

304925
keyboard	mouse
the thread that handles mouse keyboard input may be such a thread

304932
windows-xp	windows
it happens on windows-xp as well as on windows vista

304967
any	set
are there any utilities that can examine a set of managed assemblies and tell you whether any of the types in one namespace depend on any in another

304975
installation	environment
it s also reasonable to expect that this environment should be configured for the installation so testing the environment variables and exiting with a sensible diagnostic possibly suggesting they run oraenv is a good first start

305008
directory	folder
make a bin folder in the solution directory same level as the project directories

305008
folder	dir
whatever libraries directly referenced by your projects goes to a references or libs folder sometimes i ve also tried putting them in bin too but in this case you need to remember to disable copying of references to output dir when adding the reference to your project which becomes tedious on large projects

305023
command-line	cmd
so we thought we could create a quick console app that would be run as its id and would call the pgp cmd via the command-line

305039
private-key	rsa
but if you have a real public private-key scheme rsa it s really a moot point since the public key isn t a secret it s not supposed to be

305040
groovy	java
unlike java in groovy anything can be used in a switch statement not just primitive types

305067

305092
methods	extend
in the system.linq namespace we can now extend our ienumerable s to have the any and count extension methods

305107
delphi	c++
we have a lot of dll-libraries written in both delphi and c++ builder and use sharemem and borlndmm.dll

305121
function-call	inline
the jit compiler in the runtime will never inline a function-call that crosses an assembly boundary which has a performance implication

305156
required	checked
if you are starting with something that has a .length or .count such as etc - then this will be the fastest option since it doesn t need to go through the getenumerator movenext dispose sequences required by any to checked for a non-empty sequences

305156
difference	count
however note that the linq-to-objects implementation of count does check for using .count as an optimisation - so if your underlying data-source is directly a list collection there won t be a huge difference

305179
execute	prepare
i m using the mysqli extension in php and i m wondering is there possibly any way to see a prepare query as it will be execute on the server the query is something like this

305186

postgresql	mysql
iâ m looking for anything that supports mysql postgresql and derby

305316
malloc	free
backtrace_symbols allocates memory using malloc and you use free to free it - if you re crashing because of memory corruption your malloc arena is very likely to be corrupt and cause a double fault

305316
malloc	free
malloc and free protect the malloc arena with a lock internally

305316
malloc	free
you might have faulted in the middle of a malloc free with the lock taken which will cause these function or anything that calls them to dead lock

305382
getter	setter
but i cant find where to locate the getter and setter access modifiers

305414
pointers	stack
technically it s not erased when the function is abandoned either - stack pointers is merely changed

305434
having	select
secondly i don t know in advance what kind of query might be run this form lets me just type select count name from dbusers against a dozen databases without having to first think about replicating the dbusers table to a master db

eclipse-rcp	rcp
i m aware of eclipse-rcp s osgi stuff and also netbeans rcp has something here

305473
linux	unix
if you ve never worked with unix or linux then i d say that learning to deal with ruby-on-rails on windows would be easier than learning unix linux from the ground up

305473
linux	unix
but i m pretty familiar with unix linux so this is not a big change for me to make

305480
hide	show
the easier option was rather then removing and adding the columns was to add all of the columns and then just selectively hide show the desired set of columns

305482
compact-framework	.net
have a look at this article improving .net compact-framework http communications using httpwebrequest and custom asp.net providers in msdn

command-prompt	cmd
i have also seen an instance where the system.data.sqlserverce.dll in the gac was the wrong file version and i had replace the dll in the gac from a cmd command-prompt

305554
primitive	int
just to clarify i want to know what actually happens to the contents of the static pointer or any other primitive type like an int or a float and not to the memory it is pointing to

305555
selected	listbox
how to get the last selected item in a .net forms multiselect listbox

305555
selected	listbox
apparently if i select an item in the listbox and then select another 10 the selected item is the first one

305570
reflection	runtime
if for some reason you need to keep the parameter as an string maybe is introduced by user you can use reflection to build an expression tree at runtime

305600
value	field
edit quick sidenote the password field is actually a securestring type object so msdn suggests filling the value in this way

305629
configuration	environment
on one project where we had 4 environment development test staging and production we developed a system where the application selected the appropriate configuration based on the machine name it was deployed to

305633
triggers	insert
if you re using triggers after before_update insert it would be an immediate move other methods would result in having different types of data in the first shard active until it is cleaned-up

305667
attributes	properties
because some times you will need to tune up some widgets in order to work as you want they to work and if you don t really know understand the properties attributes of every widget then you will be in troubles

305726
lgpl	gpl
libavl is licensed under the lgpl as of versioning 2.0.3 hashlib is gpl

if you re certain the incoming strings will be able to convert to int or double without a hitch the .parse is faster

305739
put	get
redirecting using http redirection to a receipt page using a normal get request after a post put request will make it possible to refresh the page without getting warned about resubmitting

305764
required	checked
upcasting to object doesn t required an execution time checked - it will always work and is just a no-op basically

305764
required	checked
downcasting required an execution time checked to make sure you re not casting a stream to a string for example

305771
any	set
then i have done any cleanup and validation before inserting the data from the second set of work tables into the database

305773
playstation	xbox360
i m leaning towards mpeg-4 h.264 given that it is supported in linux mac os x the flash player ipods playstation 3 xbox360 and support is forthcoming in silverlight and windows-media-player 12

305781
contains	any
considering a large system with hundreds of assemblies what is the easiest way to determine which other projects in the large system depend on a specific assembly when there isn t any way to create a single visual-studio solution that contains all the projects

305803
any	set
i agree that if your data format has any sort of complexity you should create a set of custom classes to parsing and hold the data perform validation and do any other appropriate model tasks for instance return a human readable description although some would argue this would be better to put into a separate view class

305804
google-chrome	firefox
the real question isn t how to cache an image but why does ie use a browser cached image when firefox safari google-chrome etc do not

305805
push	pull
why can t i just treat github like a master and push pull from it onto all of my personal repos on different computers

305809
any	set
unfortunately the class doesn t have any way to set a default view mode

305833
command-line	cmd
it s a lot faster to do 2 quick clicks than pop up a cmd-line cd to the right place issue the cmd etc

305843
build-server	teamcity
i have a unit test that works fine locally but when uploaded to teamcity build-server fails with the process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.

305846
oracle	mysql
how can i import data from an oracle database to a mysql database by using ctl file generate with toad for oracle

305847
driver	kernel
programmatically it s a matter of writing a kernel driver that reads the windows handle table

305867
libavcodec	ffmpeg
if you don t mind using lgpl code i d suggest looking at ffmpeg s libavcodec and libavformat

305879
oracle	mysql
it only supports loading data into oracle it does not have functionality to load data into mysql

305894
firefox	opera
we are only supporting ie6 and above + recent versions of firefox safari webkit and opera

305895
temporary	copy
the usual non-memory way of doing what you re trying to do is to copy the file from the original to a temporary file inserting the data at the right point and then do a rename replace of the original file

305905
solaris	linux
it should run at least under linux and solaris and not require installation of any additional packages

305905
solaris	linux
my guess would be to get a list of all processes and their parents by parsing files in proc or by parsing the output of ps neither of which seems portable between linux and solaris

305913
selected	button
then after selected a value i press enter didn t bother with a submit button and see how my breakpoint halts the code

305920
design-time	designer

you just have to specify the wsdl location and the event handler and call the service

305938
attributes	properties
step 2 set the storage parameter of the column attributes to this member name and fill in the properties getter and setters

305943
javascript	dom
the same should be possible in .net although html dom javascript won t know about c#

305960
data-structures	tree
multiway tree are used to implement data-structures on disk like a relational database-table

305960
binary-tree	tree
the depth of a multiway tree is much less than a binary-tree for the same elements meaning that few seeks on disk are required to locate a node

305971
temporary	copy
obviously the final merge doesn t need to copy the data or even create a temporary file

305972
getter	setter
i just wanted to add that it is because you are only using the getter not the setter

export	csv
edit if you had to do any transformations i believe you can export to m excel certainly to a csv then on the m sql import do your mappings and such

306016
instances	destroy
you could use a custom smart pointers class which automatically creates and destroy an instances

306033
contains	any
return an arrays of strings from the methods contains any business

306033
error-code	hresult
so i never tried out inheriting from comexception and checking whether the error-code got correctly converted to an hresult

306056
environment	restart
what happens is when environment variables are added removed changed the services environment does not recognize this until it restart

306056
environment	restart
this means that in order for a service to pickup a change in environment variables a system restart needs to occur

306067
32-bit	16-bit
a near address was 16-bit and was an offset into the current segment one of cs ds es ss depending on the instruction a far was 32-bit and consisted of a segment and an offset

306076
dependency-injection	singleton
however i d recommend never coding a singleton yourself and using a dependency-injection ioc framework to handle the life-cycle of services

306101
linux	bsd
for linux and bsd you want to use a href rel nofollow noreferrer clock_gettime a

306106
g++	gcc
g++ gcc 3.3.2

306114
textpad	gedit
for other code textpad on windows gedit on linux

306118
selected	checkbox
for word 2003 create a style then modify the style selected format language and check the checkbox do not check spelling or grammar

306128
authentication	logout
in particular note at the bottom that if your user s authentication to access your site you should do an abandon of the session upon logout so that session states don t persist

306131
parameter-passing	argument-passing
ironically although i m usually picky about these terms i still use parameter-passing when i should probably talk about argument-passing

306132
google-chrome	firefox
now firefox opera google-chrome safari all work as they are supposed to

306155
agile-processes	agile
i m in a new contract where they seem to have gone overboard with agile including hiring a consultant merely for facilitating agile-processes

306161
persistence	hibernate
according to java persistence with hibernate cascade orphan delete is not available as a jpa annotations

306165
external	embed
if you insist on loading resources from external file rather than embed the resources into the assembly

306175
ssl-certificate	ssl
if you are trying with ssl enabled and you are not getting a pop up box about accepting the tree ca s trusted root certficate then perhaps the ca or the ssl-certificate taht the edirectory server is user has expired or is broken

306184
any	set
my advice would be to target the selectors with a universal rule .foo and then parsing back over to get the last foo with javascript and set any additional styling you ll need

306209
getter	setter
the controllers calls the setter and the views calls the getter

306222
superclass	metaclass
note that in python 3 the syntax for specifying metaclass changed and the basestring abstract superclass was removed which requires something like the following to be used instead

306222
base-class	metaclass
if desired it s possible to write code which is compatible both both python 2.6+ and 3.x but doing so requires using a slightly more complicated technique which dynamically creates the needed abstract base-class thereby avoiding syntax errors due to the metaclass syntax difference

306224
dictionary	hashmap
a dictionary uses a hashmap internally for performance so it is good in that regard

306233
deployment	install
update since it s a deployment project which finally produces an executable install i m not able to work with msbuild instead i m using the devenv from the command-prompt

306241
logging	trace
2 if we are talking about logging an exception thrown in code for sys admins and developers to read then the matter becomes more of taking the exception s message and stack trace to be recorded in either a log file an email or the event viewer so that it can be handled differently depending on how urgent is it that someone looks into this

306243
value	field
i tried redefining the arguments as variants and then i can find the value i want in the value2 field

306246
revision	svn
embedding svn revision number at compile time in a windows app

306252
firefox	safari
whenever i align them correctly in safari usually using vertical-align baseline on the input they re completely off in firefox and ie

306252
firefox	safari
fix it in firefox and safari and ie are inevitably messed up

306261
web-config	app-config
you can add the equivalent to a web-config file called app-config that compiles into a file named for the dll or exe project of your code behind

306263
scala	java
other languages like scala and groovy and ports to the jvm like ruby and python will continue to give life to the java platform even after the java language itself has gone the way of cobol

306279
np-complete	sat
this theorem show that sat is np-complete by encoding the operation of any nondeterministic turing machine by a boolean formula in such a way that the machine accepts if and only if that formula is satisfiable

306281
constructor	object
each of them simply takes a constructor of the type you want to do something to so that when you go to invoke the dosomething you will actually invoke a factory very simple just creating an instance of your icanhavesomethingdone class from the input type to create an instance of a class which implements the dosomethingtome method and which has the proper code for the underlying object

306285
selected	cells
i m unable to find the containing nodes for several simultaneously selected cells

306285
selected	cells
for a single cell it s doable with parentelement but for several selected cells parentelement is the tr node that houses the td cells

306285
selected	cells
i can t figure out how to extract node references to only those td cells inside that tr that have been selected due to lack of anchornode focusnode and the various offsets that w3c dom provides

306285
selected	cells
i ve already got the table creation and the style modification for individual cells as well as grouping of selected cells implemented for w3c compliant browsers but i m completely stuck with the ie implementation

306285
selected	cell
a table cell that has not been explicitly selected with ctrl cmd-clicking but has the text cursor inside it must have its background color changed

306285
selected	cells
several explicitly selected table cells ctrl cmd-clicked shift-selected or just painted over with the mouse must have their background colors changed

306285
selected	cells
this has to work for contiguous rectangular selections as well as for scattered individual selected cells

306285
selected	cells
that is in the case of several tables in the editing area the modification will take place for one or more tables that either have cursor focus scenario 1 or have selected cells in them scenario 2

306286
methods	extend
for instance anything you can do with a closure you can do with a subclass without repeating business logic--what you end up with looks worse because of layers of braces extra class definitions but is often more reusable you can extend the class you use to implement your callback but you can t extend a closure methods you have to rewrite it.

306286
scala	java
if you are looking for a java upgrade however look at scala

306297
perl	ruby
think larry wall perl guido python matz ruby odersky scala hickey clojure etc

306309
web-config	app-config
it sounds like you do not understand how web-config app-config work if i m reading you correctly

306309
web-config	app-config
if you actually run your dal as a service or a separate console application or something then and only then would you need to give the dal project it s own app-config web-config file

306319
subtract	add
can you just add subtract 2 147 483 648 2 31 to the regular int

306319
subtract	add
subtract on the way in add coming out

306336
strcmp	strlen
yes description 0 0 clears the string from strxxx functions pow strlen description 0 strcmp description 0 and std string description are all true

306336
memset	free
no description 0 0 is not the same thing as free description or memset description 0 sizeof description

306391
callback	methods
instead of objects for callback methodss using interfaces i can wrap a methods in a delegate and pass that on

306409
contains	elements
then add the capicom.wxs to your installer in that file create a componentgroup elements that contains the component s elements s

306425
registration	login
what i m truly hoping to do is extend the built-in classes to simply create registration and login forms since my user class is working just fine from terminal

306425
registration	login
my problem it seems since i m new to the framework is properly including these files in my project and generating the html forms for registration and login

306433
sql-server	oracle
i ve to do this in oracle sql-server and mysql4 so vendor specific hacks are welcome

306443
contains	elements
i would like the five divs to take up all the room in the contains elements

306457
http	ssl
some elements may not list http or https in this case whichever was used for the page will be used for these items if the page request is under ssl then these images will come encrypted while if the page request is not under ssl then these will come unencrypted

306461
dictionary	map
i just came across sglib while looking for a c implementation of a map dictionary container

306467
bazaar	git
some people prefer distributed version control systems such as git mercurial or bazaar

306509
triggers	insert
if you add a raise exception-handling inside your triggers function can you still do insert updates

306517
associations	model
i have a polymorphic associations in a ruby on ruby-on-rails model

306529
selected	button
if not use some ajax to update values on the server-side as soon as they are selected rather than when you click the next previous button

306541
selected	button
when i selected a transaction and click an edit button i need to decide whether to show an adjustmenttransactioneditorform or an issuetransactioneditorform

306544
linux	unix
look for opendir on unix linux or findfirstfile on windows

306593
margins	padding
this code assumes that you re using a reset like eric meyer s that doesn t override form input margins and padding hence putting margin and padding resets in the input css

306593
firefox	safari
both ie 6 and 7 will notice it but safari and firefox will properly ignore it

306593
firefox	safari
setting this and then relatively positioning upwards behaved almost identically in safari firefox and ie with only a pixel or two of discrepancy

306593
space	input
the major problem in working with alignment is that ie sticks a bunch of mysterious space around input elements

306593
margins	padding
it isn t padding or margins and it s damned persistent

306593
firefox	safari
setting a width and height on the checkbox and then overflow hidden for some reason cuts off the extra space and allows ie s positioning to act very similarly to safari and firefox

306600
output	mode
basically you need to configure your project to still output pdbs even when running in release mode

306602
arrays	loops
many existing loops counters and arrays references are defined as system.uint32 instead of the int32 i would have used

306620
python	php
see the php python eclipse and other open source projects who put a lot of importance into backwards compatibility

306622
speex	mp3
is is there some sort of library that would allow me to convert a speex file to an mp3 file

306647
unsigned	zero
to cast an unsigned int to an unsigned long it just had stuff zero in the upper bytes

306652
authentication	login
i am playing around with the idea already of writing my own authentication login windows for the external server and if the user trys to login with their ad credentials on the external server i will be able to detect that and redirect them to the internal server

306652
credentials	security
as an additional thought - is there a way to pull just enough of ad into a sql database to allow me to authenticate users to the sql database from the external server using their ad credentials without creating any security issues

306657
htmlspecialchars	addslashes
use htmlspecialchars in html xml prepared statements or at least addslashes when building sql queries json_encode when inserting values into scripting rawurlencode when append url components escapeshellargs when constructing shell commands etc

306661
python	ruby
i d suggest python ruby or c#

306663
mp3	wma
on i found this piece of code for wma to mp3 conversion you should be able to craft something similar for your needs

306664
accumulate	grouping
over the years you have accumulate a motley assorted grouping of hardware and software

306667
number-theory	primes
if you re only interested in small really relative term when used in number-theory primes you re probably using int or long

306672
updating	updates
i like the idea of it being something like xml or at least editable in a text-editor so that updating doesn t necessarily require vs to updates the file

306676
type-conversion	int
otherwise the parameter type-conversion to int decimal date etc. should eliminate any attempt to inject sql via the parameter

306689
base	zero
also in general test the base zero case the maximum case and at least one median middle case

306694
constructor	object
the listeners were registered on the original object not the copy - if you decide to use copy constructor as a basis for a prototype pattern then you ll end up with the same listeners listening to practically every object in the system

306694
constructor	object
if you find yourself repeating the same bit of code just after the construction of the object every time you use that constructor say more than 3-4 times then revisiting this decision may be fruitful

306697
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie but it doesn t work in firefox or google-chrome

306698
resource-files	resx
sounds like a perfect candidate for resx resource-files in the app_globalresources folder

306732
variables	boolean
of course i could simple providing an additional boolean variables isusername and use that like this

306736
data-access	nhibernate
even better would be a data-access solution such as nhibernate or linqtosql which handles the plumbing for you and prevents you from having to write the whole thing yourself

306766
default-value	default
the default operator also supports a default-value such as

306808
factors	primes
another note on testing in addition to testing known primess to see if your function correctly identifies them as primes also test known composite numbers to make sure you re not getting false positives. to make sure you get that square root function thing right pick some composite numbers that have a primes factors as close as possible to their square root

306837
show	next
for example click next to a submission in the submission web part and all of the submission items attached to that submission will show up

306859
highlight	selected
i hit m one and the first item is highlight i hit m 3 more times and i can see half a selecteded row it s at the bottom of the visible area hit m two more times and i can t see the selected row then m one more time and the first m entry is visible and selecteded again

306861
any	set
prevent any outgoing packets from the machine except to a set of authentication workstations - so you can t install your spyware

306867
internet-explorer	firefox
the soe that my company uses has the proxy set up already for firefox and internet-explorer and i cannot ask them to reconfigure their browser because that is fairly complicated

306869
modifiers	final
well i don t know about the use of the final modifiers in this case or its effect on the gc

306874
pointers	stack
i m lacking the full power of boost bind - like i can t handle methods pointers - but i also realized that by doing this i ve got a stack processor

306877
contains	elements
i wanted to deserialize an xml message contains an elements that can be marked into a class with a property of type int

306894
convention	standards
as a beginning programmer i m trying to settle on a standards naming convention for myself

306920
contains	elements
each row contains a dynamically created panels of form elements

306920
textbox	button
instead of pulling all my data to begin with and building each new row as i databind is there a way to simple create the row with the panel full of textbox and dropdownlists on the fly when the user clicks the expand button

306925
stderr	stdout
the real issue was that wxpython by default redirects stdout stderr to a popup windows that quickly disappeared after an uncaught exception-handling

306931
sniffing	traffic
the ssl traffic isn t very prone to sniffing very difficult to decrypt so that allows the encryption and decryption to happen server-side which imho is more secure

306931
financial	banking
look at banking scenarios and other financial institutions for a starting point and then go from there

306935
environment	restart
ides obscure things in an attempt to help you getthingsdone which works great when you know what you re doing and know your target environment but when you restart out they just get in the way and hide what s important

306935
python	php
i m moving from php to python at the moment and i could ve just jumped on the django band-wagon to getthingsdone but i know that if i came across a problem i wouldn t know where to begin to fix it

306947
contains	elements
or as the w3c put it if the height of the contains block is not specified explicitly it depends on content height and this elements is not absolutely positioninged the value computes to auto . as you can see we also need to give the body positioning absolute

306947
margins	padding
this example also divides the width into five equal columns with borders and some padding and margins just for fun

306947
margins	padding
this is because the sections that divide the width have no padding margins or borders

306947
scrollbar	margin
to get the div to fill the height of the windows but alas when adding margin padding and borders the rendered height of the div becomes greater than the viewport resulting in a vertical scrollbar

306954
for-loop	loops
you could also do a simple for-loops instead of the while loops over the iterator

306966
modifiers	final
so off the top of my head i m going to say no the final modifiers doesn t help the gc reduce its workload

306967
cassini	iis
it requires using the visual-studio development server cassini during development instead of your local iis see the properties box on the project

306974
populate	row
actually it isn t performing badly since my original sql query can populate every single row and i have enabled paging on the gridview

306977
input-field	checkbox
instead of trying to manipulate the checkbox control you could always build your own implementation using images javascript and hidden input-field

306977
jquery	.post
i believe jquery has a plugin to allow for this custom behavior as well will look for the link and .post here if i can find it

307006
stderr	stdout
we simply redirect stdout and stderr

307049
tree	trie
a trie is basically a tree for storing a large list of similar strings which provides fast lookup of strings like a hashtable and allows you to iterate over them in alphabetical order

307049
lookup	any
for any prefix that you enter for example t or te you can easily lookup all of the words that start with that prefix

307051
version-control	cvs
i use intellij integrated with cvs on a regular basis and by far the best feature of the integration of version-control inside the ide is line-by-line indications of what is added edited or deleted along with easy access mouse hover tool tip to the pre-edit changes

307083
click	mouse
if i click on a field on this 2nd view and i press â enterâ â confirmâ is executed so it is a matter of moving the focus of the mouse from the first page to the other one

307083
value	field
the value of the field is display so the code goes through there

307084
culture	french
the api allows me to change culture when creating a voice but the default english voice cannot pronounce the french words correctly

307096
spacing	layout
when using tables in a css-based layout i ve noticed if i have a table with 4 columns 2 on the side are small for spacing 2 in the middle are for content when i type content in one of the two middle columns it will stay at the top which is perfect

307130
boolean	int
the built-in types such as long int boolean etc

307136
salesforce	force.com
this book is called force.com cookbook published by salesforce itself

307144
value	field
after this is done there s no way for the local variables reference to magically change to null even if another thread is resetting field s value half-way through

307156
children	nodes
you say you want an object representation which i would interpret to mean that nodess become objects and the attributes and children of the nodes are represented as attributes of the object possibly according to some schema

307156
elementtree	lxml
of course a third option is given a concrete representation of the xml using elementtree or lxml you can build your own custom model around that

307156
lxml.html	lxml
lxml.html is an example of that extending the base interface of lxml with some html-specific functionality

307167
xargs	zcat
which costs one invocation of find one invocation of xargs a few invocations of zcat and one invocation of agrep

307170
.when	ready
is it so small that you could end up with the systemd still working on the first batch .when another versioning is ready to be sent out

307200
bitwise-operators	operators
note that the bitwise-operators and shift operators operate on 32-bit ints so in that case the max safe integer is 2 31 -1 or 2147483647

307210
perl	php
i m doing a php site which displays code examples in various languages c# php perl ruby etc.

307225
any	set
otherwise a lock is acquired excluding any other thread that might set the field to non-null but permitting any thread to set field to null

307225
any	set
if any thread does set field to null nothing should have changed

307225
value	field
if another thread had already acquired the lock after the current thread s check and set the field to a non-null value the second check will detect that

307232
getter	setter
i am very curious about the possibility of providing immutability for java beans by beans here i mean classes with an empty constructor providing getter and setter for members

307238
getter	setter
from a performance and design perspective using annotations on getters is a better idea than member variables because the getter setter are called using reflection if placed on the field than a methods

307267
value	field
if it needs to be handled on client-side use the javascript split methods to parsing the name field value

307272
firefox	opera
i did a simple test with a formula x- x+1 -1 and the largest value of x i can get to work on safari opera and firefox tested on os x is 9e15

307279
log4net	nlog
we are using log4net replacing nlog in our asp.net web application

307286
data-access	ado.net
i am yet to understand why but in the mean time i have replaced the large table data-access model with straight forward ado.net calls

307288
m2eclipse	maven
other options are pax construct m2eclipse maven bnd

307289
web-services	api
we have a set of web-services which is also our internal api

307289
global-asax	web-config
but again...they share the same web-config file and it works fine...can they somehow share global-asax or whatever

307299
16-bit	8bit
say you were lazy and wanted to do some 16-bit math on an 8bit arrays

307330
exception-handling	try-catch
wrap everything in a try-catch block then throw a new exception-handling on an error condition like a database failure

307348
click	mouse
i also want if possible to create a mask using the alpha channel information to know whether the mouse has been click on the image or on the transparent area

307363
temporary	copy
is there anyway to set an execution path for the tested dll so it can find resource folders when mbunit copy files into a temporary folder without using dependency-injection

307364
firefox	safari
i have a gallery i quickly coded up for a small site and under firefox 3 and safari 3 works fine

307370
contains	any
i can cut this to 700 milliseconds if i don t read the dataset s schema and just let readxml infer the schema but then the resulting dataset doesn t contains any constraints

307415
reentrant	pthreads
i believe pthreads also supplies a reentrant version of strtok called strtok_r

307419
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade from delphi 4 to delphi 2009 primarily because of unicode but also because of the many improvements everywhere in delphi since my versioning

307419
versioning	upgrade
also embarcadero still gives a special upgrade price that borland and then code gear did for all previous versioning owners

307423
execute	declare
creating it in the base application.cfc is useless because that code hasn t yet execute by the time the inheriting cfc is being declare

307427
defined	declare
when you declare it without defining it in the same compilation unit you re indicating that it s defined somewhere else - this means the linker phase will try to find it in one of the other compilation units or libraries

307431
message	alert
at strategic points through your code put in an alert with a unique message

307448
webserver	host
edit my webserver is running on the lamp stack although it is a shared host so i don t have root

307452
exception-handling	try-catch
what an exception-handling gives you is the ability to put it in a try-catch block giving you the opportunity to correct the error and continue on with the program or display a friendly error message and generate a log

307478
development-environment	platform
how do you go about detecting dead code in an automated or semi-automated fashion in a native c++ application on the windows platform with the visual-studio 2005 development-environment

307480
sql-server	mysql
beware of articles comparing old versions of mysql to ms sql-server

307482
latex	tex
it s a set of macros for tex that can be used instead of latex

307500
selected	cell
using jquery i am trying to selected the div in the second cell of the third row

307509
contains	elements
sometimes it contains only one elements

307532
symlink	unlink
note that this is not actually a fully atomicity operation but it does happen very quickly since the ln command both unlink and then immediately recreates the symlink

307541
xsd	xml
it s great the way it allows you to define a form based on an xsd xml schema and then allow the user to edit xml without knowing it is an xml file

307545
defined	declare
if the class declare any non-inline non-pure virtual-functions the first one is chosen as the â œkey methodsâ for the class and the vtable is only emitted in the translation unit where the key methods is defined

307565
contains	set
you must make sure you have correct write permission set for the bucket and the bucket contains no objects

307568
javadoc	doxygen
use javadoc or doxygen to generate the api documentation

307585
attributes	properties
there is an attributes to hide properties from intellisense

307585
attributes	properties
there are some other attributes that affect intellisense and the properties explorer you might want to look up.

307616
xsd	xml
i was wondering if there s a way i can automate the generation of xml files from xsd schemas given that i have the data and the labels

307616
python	java
i d like to do this in python java

307636
sql-server	oracle
i am able to create and execute a dts package that copies tables from a remote oracle to a local sql-server but want to setup the connection to the oracle as a linked server

307684
authentication	login
just need to use find a simple way to have ad authentication as the login for a sharepoint site

307695
contains	any
essentially my data structure in this case an nsarray might contains several nsdictionary instances at any given time each one having the same keys potentially different values

307696
account	api
so with the recent news that microsoft skydrive is going to get bumped to 25gb of storage per account does anyone know if skydrive has an api

307699
udp	tcp
the reason for that is because there are many different ways to communicate using sockets tcp udp etc

307704
python	java
later languages like java and python make it a snap by comparison

307712
nsuserdefaults	nsstring
they may be related to data-format changes but if you use just nsuserdefaults and standard plist-storable objects nsstring nsdictionary nsnumber nsarray nsnumber and primitive you should be safe

307735
shell	bash
it is therefore in the korn shell and in the posix shells including specifically bash

307737
textchanged	textbox
when the textbox is created in pageload it s textchanged event was fired

307737
textchanged	textbox
but when i dynamically delete and recreated the textbox the textchanged was not fired

307748
put	get
how would make a news feed friendly database-design so that it wouldn t be extremely expensive to get all of the items query to put in the news feed

307751
required	checked
returning an error code required discipline because the error code must be explicitly checked and then passed up

307751
debugging	trace
it s better for debugging because you can get a stack trace of where the exception occurred and because you can build in top level exception handlers to catch problems that should have been caught elsewhere

307753
postback	ajax
the postback are just for validation and ajax calls

307766
findcontrol	webforms
unfortunately we have a lot of webforms that utilize the tabcontainer and converting all the references to child controls from simple property refences to findcontrol calls will be quite burdensome

307773
unique	words
in this case with 6 letters you d have 26 6 308915776 possible unique ids minus bad words which should be enough for your need of 10000

307776
python	java
i am coming from a java background but i am fairly confident that the same principles will apply in python

307776
python	java
it is my understanding that python uses a similar if not identical method dispatch mechanism to java and will therefore be subject to the same limitations

307793
derived-class	base-class
if you have a pointers or reference to a base-class and your code needs to know the derived-class of the object then it violates liskov substitution principle

307802
xsd	xml
then associate an xsd schema to this xml document

307849
void	main
public static void main string arguments

307874
sqldatasource	detailsview
the detailsview is associated with a sqldatasource authors

307882
specifications	w3c
i m was wondering a if there s any specificationsific reason why this doesn t work from a w3c html specifications perspecificationstive and b what the right way to go about getting draggable table rows is

307884
keyboard	mouse
you would typically start with an nsview subclass to represent your canvas and handle drawing and mouse keyboard events

307884
nstextview	nscell
depending on how complex the drawing code is you might put everything in your nstextview subclass or make an nscell subclass that would take some work out of the nstextview

307885
dictionary	arrays
you can also save a dictionary or an arrays to your apps documents folder then load that file back in on launch

307895
acceptance-testing	bdd
we have been using bdd - behaviour driven development from dan north s perspective as a mechanism to record user acceptance-testing and drive development on a couple of projects with decent success

307899
filtering	sorting
calculated fields on forms can t be used for sorting filtering and can be annoying in how slowly they display in some situations

307899
grouping	sorting
but in general don t put calculations in a recordsource that you re not going to operate on as a group filtering sorting grouping

307900
scons	cmake
just to be clear i am aware that better windows build systems exist cmake scons but they usually generate vs project files themselves and i need to integrate this project into existing vs build system so it is desirable that i have just plain vs project files not generated ones

307908
dictionary	arrays
you can write your own command wrapper that takes an arg arrays constructs and runs the commands and returns the results dictionary

307963
interpreter	runtime
if you do have some static state somewhere another option that sometimes works is threadstatic - which the runtime interpreter as this static field is unique per thread

308000
delphi	c++
i haven t tried it but what might help you is if you research the codecentral expert which is a package to help search the codecentral website from within delphi and c++ builder

308020
mac-address	ethernet
can t say for your particular case but i ve used one of the two tools mentioned over here to spoof change the mac-address of the ethernet adapter on windows-vista before

308045
instances	self
when a methods definition is decorated we don t know whether to automatically give it a self parameter or not the decorator could turn the function into a static methods which has no self or a class methods which has a funny kind of self that refers to a class instead of an instances or it could do something completely different it s trivial to write a decorator that implements classmethods or staticmethods in pure python

308053
authentication	login
you can also relatively simply have the user login on one site and automatically be logged into the other sites by sharing authentication tickets -- provided they are all on the same root domain

308054
json	xml
what i want to know is - how could i use javascript to submit a number in a form i ll worry about validation and models later how should i write my test function so that it returns something readable by the javascript i m assuming return true probably wouldn t work perhaps xml or json or something like that

308061
constructor	object
this code breaks because when the object of descendent is made it calls the base class constructor and we have a virtual method call in base class constructor which in turn calls the derived class s method and hence it crashes since randomvalue is not intialized by that time

308065
textbox	button
the value in the page where cancel button is there in a textbox should be caught in the dropdownlist

308075
virtual-functions	base-class
at the time of the constructor call only the base-class and its virtual-functions exist so you get the lowest-level version of the virtual function defined at the time

308075
constructor	object
obviously as you can see managed code works differently because iirc the entire object is built before the constructors are called and thus you get the subclass virtual function before the subclass constructor

308081
selection	cell
i ve tried overriding -setselected animated for each uitableviewcell but trying to fudge the required behavior is tricky as it s difficult to separate the real unselections from the ones where the uitableview thinks i ve unselected due to selection of another cell

308104
order	add
if you consider the cascading order of css could you not just add a css style at the very end of all your previous css definition in order to cancel any css effect you currently have for tooltip effect

308105
cygwin	gnu
thanks to jouni making it clear that gnu does maintain emacs calc i have figured out that there is a cygwin install of emacs that does include calc

308111
stdin	pipe
just have the parent open the child with redirected pipe using the process class and have the child read from stdin using console.read

308112
deployment	install
how to make sure all the dlls shall be copied to the deployment directory when we need to give these files for customer where they don t install all the libraries mentioned above

308117
order	add
in order to add a record in a related table i have to set the id field of its parent

308117
order	add
in order to add the address record i have to have the corresponding contact id and i believe i can only get that after i create the contact record hence my use of saveorupdate twice

308153
python	php
that said you don t have to use php you could use any server side technology that allows uploading asp.net python etc

308202
profiling	debugging
you can also debugging run code coverage use some of the more popular profiling with it etc

308203
having	select
select count 1 as cnt data from workstationevent where serverdatetime mindate and serverdatetime maxdate and userid 1 grouping by data having count 1 threshold

308219
contains	any
what i can t seem to figure out is how to check if the first level here page #1 and page #2 has any children and if they do add the extra to contains the children

308221
edmx	dbml
i just added a ddl generation feature to huagati dbml edmx tools ver 1.47 release today

308241
jquery	dojo
jquery i ve found very overhyped but it did seem superior to dojo as a framework though again there were deep seated flaws iirc

308246
primitive	int
as said here switch works with the byte short char and int primitive data types

308246
integer	short
it also works with enumerated types and a few special classes that wrap certain primitive-types character byte short and integer

308246
parentheses	keyword
both instructions pop the key the value of the expression in the parentheses immediately following the switch keyword from the stack

308261
32-bit	64bit
edit i ve successfully tested an upgrade to sql2008 32-bit i m mostly concerned with any difference in the 64-bit version as i don t have a 64bit server i can test on at the moment i know you can t restore a sql2000 master database to 2008

308261
32-bit	64bit
can you restore a sql2008 32-bit master to sql2008 64bit

308287
constructor	object
you certainly can have multiple constructor each with unique argument signatures and then call the one you want when you instantiate a new object

308287
arguments	default
you can even have one constructor with default arguments on the end

308298
any	set
could someone tell me how we can set the username and password for any windows service

308300
linked-list	arrays
are there any good libraries preferably with commented source for standard datastructures linked-list arrays list queue stack etc. for x86 or others

308302
arguments	default
use default value on arguments to make a simpler version available

308302
constructor	private
you can of course have a separate private protected method that does all the initialization and let the constructor mainly deal with argument handling

308325
webforms	asp.net
i ve noticed a lot of talk about asp.net mvc lately but i haven t come across a clear or compelling description of when where or why i would want to use it over webforms

308325
webforms	asp.net
what are the gotchas with asp.net mvc i m aware of the gotchas with webforms

308325
webforms	asp.net
for our sample app what would i gain by using asp.net mvc instead of webforms

308325
webforms	asp.net
for our sample app what would i lose by using asp.net mvc instead of webforms

308337
contains	elements
everything which is not directly presented in the object model from the edm types can still be found in the metadataproperties which contains every xml property of the elements even the ones which are represented as typed properties

308375
contains	elements
generally block-level elements may contains inline elements and other block-level elements

308375
contains	elements
generally inline elements may contains only data and other inline elements

308383
boolean	int
once a block has been used for a given type int bit-field or boolean bit-field the compiler does not allocate any further bit fields of a different type until the next boundary

308383
16-bit	8bit
some processors can align to 8bit boundaries while others can only align to 16-bit boundaries

308389
boolean	int
if you grouping the boolean and int you would get a very different result

308396
attributes	properties
is it possible to get an object s attributes through the properties tag in struts

308404
ping	lan
the machine is hooked into the lan and can be pinged and can ping

308427
contains	set
contains a set of objects linked to a double

308441
gethashcode	equals
this doesn t override gethashcode or equals because you re not actually using those as it s in a value positioning

308449
version-control	git
it contains tools to put it under version-control supports git mercurial svn and more so you can have it alongside the code

308450
solaris	linux
i m currently working on a pet project and need to do c++ development on windows mac linux and solaris and i ve narrowed it down to netbeans and eclipse so i was wonderig which is more solid as a c++ editor

308450
emacs	vim
note i know i should be using emacs or vim but the issue is my theory at least that i m left handed so i use my right side design creativity of the brain more than the left side logic memory so i just simply cannot use emacs or vim my brain simply isn t compatible i tried them many times too even used emacs for a few months but it drove me crazy.

308491
push	pull
is it possible to get mercurial to show progress of long-running push or pull operation

308511
directory	folder
i have a .net 1.1 web application sitting in a folder called c inetpub wwwroot mytestapp where mytestapp is a virtual directory and is configured to be on asp.net version 1.1.4322 in iis 5.1

308511
directory	folder
in the root directory c inetpub wwwroot there is a web.config file for a .net2.0 application because the root folder contains some web pages written in .net2.0

308537
versioning	upgrade
try latest maven versioning usually upgrade to newer versionings solve issues

308545
windows-server	windows
i need to monitor my windows-server event logs so that i know if there is a problem with any of my asp.net websites iis errors windows login errors etc - errors that would end up in the event log rather than being handled by my application s error logging

308566
highlight	selected
row contains the item highlight briefly when a user selected it to show that the selection has been received

308566
selection	cells
you ll need to roll your own multiple selection style either with something like mail or using the checkmark accessory on your cells

308581
protected	public
is it better to have all the private-members then all the protected ones then all the public ones

308581
constructor	private
or should there be multiple private protected and public labels so that the operations can be kept separate from the constructor and so on

308594
primitive	int
the module then provides some primitive like unit memo and integral memo int and combinators for building more complex memo tables like and

308595
any	set
is there any way to prevent an updatepanelanimationextender from executing when the associated updatepanel is not updating is set to conditional updates

308597
data-members	private
then comes public data-members if any remember encapsulation is a good idea followed by any protected and or private methods and data-members

308609
credentials	security
despite that by policy this client enforces security by domain authentication among other things therefore this issue isn t seen as a security risk still my idea is to at least obfuscate that plain text credentials using perhaps a simple md5 or sha1 method so such sensitive data is not visible to the naked eye

308612
value	field
unlike java field don t get auto-initialized to null so a garbage uninitialized value is just as plausible as null

308612
pointers	stack
in c++ you can t fully validate the output with a null check - for all you know the function returned a pointers to an object on its own stack which has just been unwound

308614
strategy-pattern	command-pattern
specifically review command-pattern the strategy-pattern and plugins architecture as they will help you extend your solution set more easily

308615
convention	standards
now the problem is this csv file may contains some fields with soft carriage returns solitary r or n markers rather than the standards r n used in text files to end a line within some fields and the standards text mode i o class streamreader does not respect the standards convention and treats the soft carriage returns as hard carriage returns thus compromising the integrity of the csv file

308617
protected	public
i used to do things backwards to this with private then protected then public

308617
protected	public
i never use multiple public protected private sections - too confusing to follow in my opinion

308618
hash	md5
use some kind of one way hash function md5 sha1 ... and keep only password hash

308628
data-members	constructor
google favors this order typedef and enums constants constructor destructor methods including static-methods data-members including static data-members.

308659
logout	login
if i login twice then logout and login again i don t need two login i seem to have traced this to the fact that the cookie exists

308659
google-chrome	firefox
testing in firefox ie google-chrome on an xp machine

308660
protected	public
i usually define first the interface to be read that is public then protected then private stuff

308677
hash	md5
it is hard to understand the exact scheme you are thinking about but i assume the password is coming in from a request and you want to calculate the md5 hash in a jsp that the request is being sent to

308677
hash	md5
you could even be more secure if it isn t being done with http and use a javascript md5 library to hash the password before submitting it

308688
json	xml
the flexgrid plugin is quite sparse on doumentation however in a small section on the demo page there is a tut on creating a json serialized object this is a bit misleading because the grid requires a specific format i have ported the php code for xml option with a little monkey grease you can do the same for the json formatting

308693
contains	any
enums may be represented by signed or unsigned integral types according to whether they contains any negative values and what the compiler feels like

308698
.net	wcf
there are many different flavors that you can choose from .net 2.0 web services asmx wcf rest if you are using silverlight you may want to consider using wcf + linq to sql which is demonstrated here

308712
return-value	arguments
the return-value of strcat can simply be ignored it merely returns the same pointers as was passed in as the first arguments

308720
mouseover	mouseout
a good solution is to use mouseenter and mouseleave events instead of mouseover and mouseout

308720
mouseover	mouseout
the major difference between mouseenter mouseleave events and mouseover mouseout events is that the former don t bubble

308720
mouseleave	mouseenter
in this example the child paragraph of div#image still receive the mouseenter mouseleave events even if you aren t listening for them but the events won t bubble up to their parent element

308734
constructor	mutators
within the public interface it s convenient to grouping constructor property accessors and mutators and operators in distinct groupinging

308753
protected	public
i find that most of the time public protected private is the most useful to consumers of your class

308759
user-controls	wpf-controls
these user-controls contained only pure wpf-controls button lists etc

308761
printf	strcat
there are a couple of functions that can help you strcat and special versions of printf that allocate the buffer for you

before the strcat try or memset m 0 sizeof m

308813
declarative-services	apache-felix
i am using apache-felix and its declarative-services scr to wire the service dependencies between bundles

308814
logging	trace
there are many ways to do this for example with log4net enterprise library logging application block trace diagnostics or a roll your own approach

308817
textbox	button
if this is not a static html page but a asp.net jsp coldfusion or php page then you could have a drop down box with a list of all your sales people a textbox for comments and a contact us ie submit button

308847
hide	show
it would be easier to show hide the third dropdown rather than adding it dynamically

308888
debugging	trace
compile your programm with debugging info and you will see where it happens just let it run and look at the stack trace when it crashes

308889
protected	public
in addition any methods which a subclass could conceivably want to override which might mean all public methods plus potentially some protected ones used internally must be virtual

308891
any	set
check for any new cookies being set or the cakephp cookie having a different value

308892
embedded-linux	uclinux
i m looking for a good open source message bus that is suitable for embedded-linux devices linux and uclinux

308892
communication	messages
the messages bus would primarily be used by applications on our system.in order to communication configuration parameters etc so it doesn t need to satisfy realtime requirements

308894
rhino-mocks	moq
which seems to indicate that its a problem in castle s dynamicproxy which is used by moq and rhino-mocks

308901
postgresql	mysql
ea supports oracle mysql sql server multiple versions postgresql interbase db2 and access in one fell swoop

308912
tuples	any
is there any performance advantage to using lists over dictionary over tuples in python

308920
excel-vba	vba
a couple of choices for a urlencode function in vba are in this thread how can i url encode a string in excel-vba

308931
teamcity	msbuild
i currently have my solution comprising of 2 class librarys and a web site building within teamcity using msbuild

308931

i get an error becasue it is looking for a virtual path which i don t have as all i want to do it precompile the files i am not interested in publishing the site if i put a dummy path in i get another error correctly about it not being an application under iis

308957
export	report
since the upgrade we have found an issue with our report when export to excel

308961
ubuntu	debian
you can use the special package checkinstall for all packages which are not even in debian ubuntu yet

308964
data-structures	dictionary
the big difference is that tuples are immutable while lists and dictionary are mutable data-structures

308968
pthreads	openmp
use mpi for your node to node communication and synchronization and either openmp or pthreads for your more granular parallelization

308968
pthreads	openmp
think mpi for each machine and openmp or pthreads for each core

308971
selected	checkbox
you can configure to the ability to selected multiple values which are rendered as a dropdown list of checkbox

308993
iprincipal	iidentity
generally the user and the security context where the user interacts are different things and therefore if modelled in a generic way these should be separated as the iprincipal and iidentity interfacese do

308993
iprincipal	iidentity
and finally you should also consider whether you want to implelement the iidentity iprincipal with your own user class or just populate a genericprincipal genericidentity instances

308993
iprincipal	iidentity
the most important fact here is that iprincipal and iidentity instances must be serialization as they might go to other appdomains

308995
hide	show
use different views that show or hide specific columns and grant access to those views to different users roles

309042
value	field
you will need to use system.reflection and find the matching field make sure the datatypes are compatible and then compare the value

309058
contains	set
in your manifest file make sure you have the attributes main-class set to the name of the class contains your main methods

309059
forms-authentication	session-timeout
i have left the session-timeout as is and reduced the forms-authentication to 12 minutes for testing

309101
put	get
i know .useaccessibleheaders makes it put instead of but i cant get the to appear

pdf-viewer	acrobat
i m sure some of you noticed that if you have acrobat reader or any other pdf-viewer and open a pdf in firefox you will see it embedded inside your tab

309191
debian-based	ubuntu
however this is not a built in command but for debian-based distros like ubuntu you can simply install it with

309191
package-managers	nix
i would guess that it s available through most package-managers in other nix oss

309203
value	field
i used a new date object to fill a field in a mysql db but the actual value stored in that field is in my local timezone

309225
double	int
it can add int floats double decimals binarys hexadecimals regardless of whether they are signed unsogned how many bits they are etc.

309263
unsigned	short
in languages that have signed and unsigned types or a slew of similar types short int long or int8 int16 in32 then prefixes are useful despite what anybody else has or will say and they will you know it

309277
debian-based	ubuntu
installation was not a problem in ubuntu and any debian-based distro i suppose

309307
constructor	object
to me this means there shouldn t be a public parameterless constructor because that s going to be an object in an invalid state 99 of the time

309318
background-color	transparency
obviously you can add background images that represent button up and button down and make the background-color transparency

309378
superclass	inherited
unless you can fulfill the entire superclass contract and i know only of several classes that can prefer composition rather than inherited

309397
selected	cells
to enumerate which cells rows were selected say upon clicking a button simply iterate over the cells of the table looking for uitableviewcellaccessorycheckmark

309417
haskell	python
ideally i d like to see a language like python but with data types and type classes like haskell instead of objects

309437
multi-user	updates
how does one synchronise updates in disconnected multi-user environments such as websites and web-services

309470
authentication	login
forms based authentication is typically configured there and the default behavior is to redirect from a secure page to the login to authenticate if the user has not yet done so and one of the parameters it passes is the returnurl

309497
moss	wss
i suspect that sharepoint both moss 07 and wss 3.0 uses stored-procedures exclusively behind the scenes

309507
np-complete	np-hard
a problem is np-hard if and only if it s at least as hard as an np-complete problem

309507
traveling-salesman	np-complete
the more conventional traveling-salesman problem of finding the shortest route is np-hard not strictly np-complete

309512
fseek	ftell
i m not sure you can fseek ftell pipe streams like this

309516
arguments	default
since you could have multiple arguments to an action methods we use the argument name as the prefix by default

309543
groovy	java
i ve read that grails convention over configuration approach together with the benefits of dynamic languages groovy can really reduce the amount of boilerplate code that needs to be written while still leveraging best-of-breed java technologies such as spring and hibernate

309553
contains	set
i commonly find myself extracting common behavior out of classes into helper utility classes that contains nothing but a set of static-methods

309561
implements	abstract
zippackage implements the abstract package class and allows manipulation of zip files

309569
constructor	private
you could just declare a private constructor that does nothing

309571
constructor	private
don t bother making them abstract but include a private parameterless constructor to prevent them from ever being instantiated

309571
abstract	sealed
point of comparison for those interested in c# you would declare the class to be static making it abstract and sealed java s final in the compiled form and without any instances constructor at all

309586
access-vba	basic
error handling and debugging tips and techniques for microsoft access-vba and visual basic 6

309587
common-lisp	lisp
practical common-lisp freely available on the web has a good explanation for this and it is a very good book for learning lisp

309610
decrement	increment
a const_iterator is an iterator that points to a const element so while the iterator itself can be updates increment or decrement for example the element it points to can not be changed

309632
debugging	trace
that s what i would probably try though or just ignore the debugging trace output

309640
variables	boolean
for example you may keep a boolean variables flash false

309647
hide	show
then size your windows accordingly and or show and hide scrollbar so they re only show when absolutely necessary

309648
alpha	rgba
start by loading the bitmap as 32-bit rgba that is four bytes per pixels one red one green one blue and one for the alpha channel

309650
administration	account
when our tech support department install our app onto a computer running xp or vista they log in with an administration account the first time they run the app

309663
constructor	object
all you need to do is add the following after your super call in the constructor of your subclassed object

309670
getter	setter
synchronized your setter and getter here would only have the intended purpose of guaranteeing that multiple threads couldn t read variables between each others increment operations

309674
firefox	safari
it to work in ie 6 7 8 firefox and safari

309683
value	field
that is the field are all reset to their default value thereby confusing the user

309701
xsd	xml
xmlbeans - these tools let s you generate java files from xml schema definitions xsd so that you can import manipulate create and export xml files using javabeans-like method calls

309703
checkbox	button
radio button and checkbox are still input tags and will be in the inputs variables

309703
checkbox	button
the problem is you ll need to add handlers for the checked state to see which radio button and checkbox are selected

309703
radio-button	checkbox
even worse you can have more than one radio-button and checkbox with the same name.

309704
toolchain	platform
depending on your platform and toolchain there are many really useful static analysis packages that could help you to document the relationships between subsystems or components of your application

309715

buffering	streaming
the trick here is that we work in blocks and as such don t need other buffering streaming

309783
directory	folder
use 7-zip to extract it to a folder directory outside your windows python installation folder

is there any way to set an event handler without doing it manually in the classname.designer.cs file other than double clicking the user-interface element

309829
interpreter	runtime
if anexception-handling is an unchecked exception-handling if it does extend runtimeexception-handling then either is allowed by the java compiler and either is interpreter equivalently by the java runtime

309836
exception-handling	try-catch
an example of runtimeexception-handling is arrayoutofboundexception-handling imagine if you would have explicitly handle the exception-handling by declaring a throws or with a try-catch block every time you use a list

309876
rollback	commit
if you haven t changed anything then you can use either a commit or a rollback

309900
fckeditor	wysiwyg
almost didn t open the question because i thought it would have been mentioned already but fckeditor is a great freely available wysiwyg editor with a good team behind it

309927
constructor	private
for example you might have a bunch of constructor some public some protected some private - wouldn t you want them all grouping together

309928
triggers	insert
i think that the best approach is to write an event handler that will triggers on your least and copy the data user insert updated

309937
constructor	object
alternatively you could make the constructor private and the parsing method static having the parsing method return an instance of the object

309950
any	set
what you ve done here is made a cartesian result set by having the tables joined with the commas but not having any join criteria

309954

309991
attributes	properties
here s the properties and attributes on the column of interest

309994
linkbutton	onclick
one thing you could try is to have your linkbutton onclick event do its processing then register a page.clientscript.registerstartupscript with the popup code which will put some javascript into the tag to fire off after the page loads

310046
value	field
you just have to test the value dumped is the value that was assigned to the properties public field

310046
value	field
just ensure to assign a different value to each property field

310050
configuration	installation
i don t know of any gui tools but i thought that i d point out that if you install the nhibernate schmema files found in the root folder of the installation to c program files microsoft visual-studio 9.0 xml schemas you then get intellisense help with both the general configuration file and the mapping configuration file

310078
oracle	mysql
this ll be database dependent iirc mysql allows as an escape character while something like oracle expects quotes to be doubled my quoted string

310105
lookup	any
adding a foo type superclass doesn t add any value as it would literally be an empty package used only to enable lookup

310108
g++	gcc
but neither gcc nor g++ does even with all the warnings options i could think of -pedantic -wall -wextra

310108
g++	gcc
is there a way to make gcc and g++ warn about this

310108
g++	gcc
edit i just found that gcc -wconversion does the trick but the same option to g++ doesn t and i m really using c++ here so i need a solution for g++ and am now wondering why -wconversion doesn t seem to be it

310147

310223
administration	account
well more a horror than a .war time story maintaining an application that for no apparent reason demands to be ran under an administration user account

310264
click	mouse
yet again it is tedious boilerplate code but it is the sort of thing that a good ide like eclipse can auto-generate for you with just a few mouse click

310264
any	set
it would be relatively easy then to build a proxy for any object delegating all the get methods and trapping or ignoring the set methods as appropriate

310269
environment	building
i am unable to building my web application not web site in our building environment

310269
environment	building
we use dmake in our building environment this unfortunately is non negotiable therefore using msbuilding is not permitted and when invoking the asp.net precompiler through

310289

sql-server	mysql
my team recently did the opposite sql-server to mysql using the mysql migration toolkit for moving a fogbugz install from windows to linux and it worked very well

310354
ubuntu	linux
linux is no better at this either i have a default ubuntu install with dual-booting and it takes about a minute

310356
exception-handling	error-handling
when an exception-handling is thrown in your service catch it and in your error-handling code add the info to the errordata class

310377
filesystems	xfs
b if you can t move the files around then you might try different filesystems i think xfs might be good for directories with lots of entries

310383
double	int
if you return a double or float from your mbean jconsole seems to round it down to the nearest int

310406

310464
subtract	add
you then write your own routine to add subtract multiply and divide your byte arrays

310476
forwarding	port
the firewall would sit between the world and my server and use port forwarding to allow only ports 443 and 22 for maintenance to reach the server

310480
abstract-class	derived-class
if you then derive an abstract-class from it then something that is an attributes of the base class is not true of the derived-class which should set of klaxons that something s not right

310512
variables	boolean
i set a boolean variables for weather or not it was currently highlighting and added an if condition inside the textchange sub

310514
contains	elements
therefore if the value expression references such an object then the table will be considered to contains just one elements - the collection itself

310524
nswindow	nspanel
you should probably be using actual nswindow objects here instead of nspanel objects but since i don t know much about how your application works you ll have to look into that yourself

310525
callback	methods
the variables will be updated to true during execute and false when it reaches result or fault callback methods

310529
abstract-class	subclassing
a bit unusual but if you had some other subclass of the base class and the subclassing of the abstract-class had enough common stuff to justify the existance of the abstract-class like

310532
tuples	any
we are using many of the boost libraries thread filesystems signals function bind any asio smart_ptr tuples on an arcom vulcan which is admittedly pretty powerful for an embedded device 64m ram 533mhz xscale

310535
assign	add
this gave me the flexibility to add remove navigation items on various pages and also be able to assign multiple pages to the administrator navigation option when necessary

310541
environment	building
one cannot help but wish if only there was an environment that would automatically manage all these basic housekeeping aspects and let the it team focus on just building the application

310541
scalability	azure
azure provides highly scalability cloud storage with the ability to store data in blobs tables queues

310541
windows-server	windows
to make things even better windows azure team makes available a complete cloud experience on your desktop that allows developers to build and test their cloud applications on a local desktop and yes you don t need a windows-server for doing this.

310549
any	set
the sequencing of the result set can be different unless you impose an order on the results but that s legitimate in any dbms

310568
pointers	stack
it ended up being a problem with referencing an un-initialized pointers on stack

310629
ostream	std
in c++ i could do this by simply making my class methods use std istream and std ostream which could be a file a stringstream the console whatever

310633
perl	ruby
i don t know ruby but in perl i d do a little switch statement at the same time as getting the significant parts into 1 2 etc

310652

310659
websphere	ibm
disclaimer i work for ibm as a websphere consultant but i am not speaking for them in an official capacity

310661
arrays	map
map is another way to iterate useful when you want to transform one arrays into another

310664
controller	routes
i m having some trouble with asp.net-mvc beta and the idea of making routes controller actions parameters on those controller actions and html.actionlinks all work together

310679
peer	p2p
fully p2p protocols such as gnutella or gnutella2 or the simpler overnet made famous by storm worm are based on each client having a startup list of a few peer

310686
google-chrome	safari
check if the same thing happens in google-chrome if you have access to a windows box to see if it s a webkit issue or safari itself

310693
unique	words
assuming that you could get them indexed by google you could conceive of a system whereby each peer runs a web site with some unique rare words contains on a specific page

310710
attributes	properties
however the report.metrics properties or attributes of can be set for name class methods block and line

310715
websphere	ibm
disclaimer i am an ibm websphere consultant - although i am not contributing here in an official capacity

310744
versioning	upgrade
i only stopped using it when my versioning got old enough that the upgrade cost was significant

310765
audio	id3
i am not so much interested in the id3 tags but in the audio itself

310807
windows-xp	windows
it always works consistently under windowss-xp and never flashes the title bar windows

310841
network-protocols	tcp-ip
it turned out that i had not gone into the sql-server configuration manager and enabled tcp-ip and named pipes as network-protocols

310851
.net	wcf
since you are going from .net to .net i d recommend just doing a wcf call

310866
display	width
the best advice is perhaps to take a cue from the publishing world where this is a common practice for applications that display large amounts of high resolution graphics such as adobe indesign and keep track of exact measurements for controls - the x y coordinate positioning and height width

310875
configuration	upgrade
that way if you don t like the default configuration you can upgrade it yourself

310911
contains	any
any good reason why p .html 0 makes all paragraphs empty as opposed to contains the character 0

310913
vb.net	vb6
as you may have discovered vb6 does not have a ctype function like vb.net does

310913
vb.net	vb6
however the other conversion functions those that have names beginning with c which you may have encountered in vb.net code such as cint and cstr do exist in vb6 and you can use them to convert to and from non-object types

310913
vb.net	vb6
keep in mind that vb6 unlike vb.net does not support inheritance

310914
constructor	private
a constructor s prototype provides a way to share methods and values among instances via the instance s private property

310914
constructor	object
when called with new the function s this is set to reference a new object whose private property is set to reference the constructor s public prototype

310914
constructor	object
when called as a constructor a function returns its this object by default so there is no need for a separate return this

310919
value	field
0 chosen rather than 0 as its a table auto_increment field so 0 would not be a normal value

310932
forwarding	port
setup a ssh key so that you don t need to use passwords and tweak the .ssh authorized_keys file on the mysql system to only allow it to be used for port forwarding

310932
forwarding	port
for more info on ssh tricks see brian hatch s excellent series on ssh and port forwarding

310947
solaris	linux
i have switched from solaris to red hat linux and find myself regularly missing filemerge not to be confused with the apple tool of the same name as well as the solaris version of pstack which worked on core files just as well as pids

310952
arrays	loops
because when you move backwards the missing arrays indices do not interfere with the order of your loops

310963
relational-database	schema
mapping this to a relational-database schema for persistence however is tricky

310964
function-calls	main
though i ended up going with the second approach because it made function-calls smaller and it seemed to feel better from my reading it seems like i may be missing one of the main points of functional-programming in that this seems side-effecty

310983
dictionary	arrays
the dictionary should certainly be model object and you may want to turn your inner arrays into model objects as well

311000
firefox	safari
there are some problems with this widget left right arrow keys and home end keys are not working in firefox i am using a mac and none of any keys are working if i load the example page in safari

311058
oracle	mysql
in ms-sql server you use the top keyword while in mysql you use limit in oracle you have to use rownum etc

311064
factorization	logarithm
should practical quantum computing become a reality i am wondering if there are any public key cryptography algorithms that are based on np-complete problems rather than integer factorization or discrete logarithm

311069
children	nodes
with tree views you usually have to load the children of each displayed nodes

311080
postgresql	mysql

knapsack-problem	np-complete
while many forms have been broken checkout merkle-hellman based on a form of the np-complete knapsack-problem

311093
postgresql	mysql
measure transactions per second or even better requests per second with a web server stress tool like the grinder which can be scripted in jython with both mysql backend and postgresql and afterwards see if that makes a difference

you can then set a break point at any line by click on that line number on the left hand side of the editor windows

311148
oscommerce	cart
i have this in zen cart and probably oscommerce as well in the orders table and wondered why they went that way even more as they have an addresses table

311182
standard-library	boost
i tend not to use boost on stylistic grounds if a standard-library alternative will do

311202
python	java
i m also open to creating python interfaces to particularly good c c++ implementations or even to jython if there s a good java implementation

311236
configuration	environment
if this option is not available to you as part of the twisted api or the pure-ftpd server logging configuration then you may need to break out a network sniffer such as tcpdump snoop or wireshark assuming you re allowed to do this in your environment

311251
forwarding	port
alternatively it is possible that the device acts more like a proxy -- that it acts as the server-side endpoint for the connection before relaying on to your real server -- in which case it is possible that the product does something deeper although this isn t the case if the firewall really is port forwarding as you say

311252
constructor	object
if you use boost scoped_ptr no need for shared_ptr here you won t be sharing the pimpl with any other object and this is enforced by scoped_ptr being noncopyable you only need the pimpl destructor visible at the point you call the scoped_ptr constructor

311307
firefox	safari
is there an alternative to history.go -1 for firefox and safari

311312
value	field
the form field value are also accessible via the request.form collection which is a namevaluecollection if i recall

311317
directory	folder
i don t know where n x stores yours perhaps in a hidden folder in your root directory

311320
hashtable	set
for an in-use set expected to be this small a non-bucketed hashtable might be ok

311332
any	set
1. if i program my code which is amenable to tail call optimization last statement in a function recursive function being a function call only no other operation there then do i need to set any optimization level so that compiler does tco

311334
32-bit	64bit
remember that in windows 64 a pointer will be a 64bit quantity but long will still be a 32-bit quantity and your code is broken

311344
superclass	subclass
a subclass can be a new table with all the same columns as the superclass repeated

311344
superclass	subclass
this works well when you have an abstract superclass or subclass features that override the superclass

311344
superclass	subclass
a subclass can be just the unique columns with a join to the superclass table

311389
logout	login
- i logout and return to the login page

311447
ole-automation	com
this exception-handling is thrown when trying to convert a value that is outside the valid range of ole-automation dates to from a .net datetime value methods datetime.fromoadate and datetime.tooadate - which are also used implicitly for com interop

311448
versioning	upgrade
you should never go to the database directly as sharepoint isn t designed for that at all and there is no guarantee actually there s a specific warning that the structure of the database will be the same between versioning and upgrade and additionally when content is spread over several content databases in a farm there is no guarantee that a query that runs on one content database will do what you expect on another content database

311470
instances	self
the pattern if you do need global data at least in wpf is to have a static property that refers to a non-static instances of its self

311477
csv	tsv
ps. i looked at the source code of your message it looks like an odd mix of tsv tabs and csv coma

311490
communication	messages

311495
webforms	asp.net
the biggest difference between asp.net mvc and is webforms is the lifecycle of an page no difficult unnecessary postbacks clean coding enz

firefox	safari
in firefox and safari pages that are centered move a few pixels when the page is long enough for the scrollbar to appear

311504
firefox	safari
is there a workaround or a way to style the page so it doesn t jump around in firefox and safari

311507
development-environment	virtualbox
this time i think i m going to set the development-environment up on a virtualbox viewmodel and save it to an external hdd so that way i can bring the development-environment back up quickly after i fix the real computer

311518
constructor	private
as others stated make a private parameter-less constructor

311518
show	next
as others have show how it is done with other languages here comes how you do it in the next c++ versioning how to make a class non-instantiable

311520
click	mouse
i can image that if some add-ons could disable mouse click event the widget would not work any more

311556
python	java
while c++ is nice being able to leverage more than what exists in c++ like the incredible frameworks that exist in java and python lands could prove beneficial in the long run

311560
design-time	designer
this means that the parent will not have any instances of the child controls at design-time and look something like a shell in the designer

311560
prism	mef
the prism or mef sample apps which include some wpf examples should give you an idea of what is posssible

constructor	private
i don t declare utility classes abstract i declare them final and make the constructor private

311572
digits	base
numbers n such that the set of base 4 digits of n equals the set of base 6 digits of n

311609
perl	tcl
any of the scripting languages perl python tcl tk etc. have good mature and easy to use email handler libraries in fact you can get this sort of thing for most lanaguages so it should be quite straightforward to write the handler in one of those

311628
reverse-dns	dns
it included whitelists of ip-addresses ranges based on which were then updated automatically as needed by checking claimed user-agent strings and if the client claimed to be a legitimate spider but not on the whitelist it performed dns reverse-dns lookups to verify that the source ip-address corresponds to the claimed owner of the bots

311632
semantics	keyword
the dynamic keyword supports these exact semantics and will be in c# 4.0

311685
put	get
take the currently authentication user s user id and just put it in there instead of passing in another iuser to get the id of

311689
32-bit	64bit
having a 64bit pe header does seem to take precedence over the 32-bit only corflags

311689
32-bit	64bit
the win32 bootstrapper for .net seems to see that the pe header is not compatible with the current system 64bit on a 32-bit system

311714
e-commerce	product
for example the e-commerce module needs functionality to generate a file on the fly for product and i call and reference a methods in the cms to do this because file-handling is really a job for the cms

311733
spring.net	ninject
consider using techniques like dependency-injection see structuremap spring.net ninject to simplify instantiation if a simple factory doesn t give you the flexibility you need

311740
xquery	xslt
saxonsa xslt and xquery processor â by michael kay

311746
order	add
you do need to add another cross join each time your table exceeds an order of magnitude in size

311758

311782
xsd	xml
i m searching the xsd xml schema for the microsoft .net application configuration files

311786
convention	standards
if you ve got a fairly standards naming convention you could programmatically determine the files that would go together

311798
contains	any
so for your example you do have a 32-bit image as specified by the pe header contains an any cpu assembly as specified by the corflags for the assembly

311805
directory	folder
i am writing a test program to copy some file in application data folder on device to release directory on desktop

311811
postgresql	mysql
admitting firstly that i generally don t like mysql i will say that there has been writing on this topic regarding postgresql

311828
integer	zero
the only thing i can think of without seeing your validation code is that 025 is being interpreted as an octal number in c putting a zero before an integer means it s in base 8

311832
sendmessage	message
what you should do is wrap your sendmessage and the code which processes the message into a single type-safe interface

my hammers tend to lean towards ls find sort sed vi awk grep and comm

311869
perl	awk
if not awk perl or python can make those nice to haves out of thin air

311873
contains	any
however that doesn t make what i really wanted to know moot how do you optimize a query that contains values that are constant within any specific query but where i the programmer don t known in advance what value will be used

311881
python-mode	ropemacs
if i have to show emacs to software developers i show them something like jdee or python-mode with ropemacs

311883
hashmap	arrays
since i m doing this in gwt i though it might be the implementation of hashmap and the alternative approach i ve though takes a string arrays as input

311889
defined	declare
in the dynamic case the main program is linked with the c runtime import library something which declare what s in the dynamic library but doesn t actually defined it

311896
scheme	lisp
i think architecture with sockets was chosen for better portability between different lisp btw slime also supports clojure and mit scheme and os-es slime works on windows too

311909
postgresql	mysql
it is a core data-like framework in fact it can import core data models but works with postgresql though not mysql as far as i know

311923

312042
constructor	object
if the object is created later then a factory is passed to the constructor of x

312043
windows-hosting	hosting
although due to increased license costs windows-hosting plans will usually cost more and give you less spaces bandwidth than linux hosting plans you can still get enough room to play around with and deploy some apps on the web

312045
constructor	object
to make it testable the x constructor needs to ask for the object implementing the int interface

312051

when you declare the destructor you stop the compiler from generating one for you but you must defined it somewhere even if it is empty

312142
logging	trace
finally think about administration and logging how will you configure your firewall and trace packets through it to ensure it s doing what you want it to do

312144
value	field
-- paymenttype restricted field contains value like

312144
contains	lookup
baby table to lookup that can contains additional

312168
protected	public
so i guess there is one more field visibility other than private protected package protected and public

312175
required	checked
checked that this data is still valid by reading every byte into a hash or checksum required a day and increases the risk of drive failure

312178
private-members	object
however java allows this since both object t and this are of the same class test and can see each others private-members

312196
databound	formview
i m still missing exactly why it doesn t work just on formload but performing the change in the formview s databound event does the trick

312213
command-line	cmd
i want to use part of the output of a cmd run from the cmd-line in another xterm or as part of a different cmd

312213
perl	awk
use some combination of head tail awk sed perl cut etc.

312219
put	get
if you really think that creating those collections is expensive then instead of creating new ones all the time put the unused ones into a list and reuse them when new keys get added to your hashmap

312225
triggers	insert
whenever a new row was created in any table in the db you had to use a couple of stored-procedures to insert an entry in the root table before you could get to the actual table you cared about rather than the database doing the job for you with a few triggers simple triggers

312231
ruby	php
working with ruby is a pleasure much easier to learn than php and the rails framework is so well put together that you can with little effort produce some very elaborate web sites with advanced features all while learning how to do proper object oriented web programming

312231
put	get
don t get me wrong it s not that easy if you want to learn programming you need to put a lot of effort into it but in my own experience ruby-on-rails can bring you some instant results while letting you get deeper and deeper over time

312235
instances	private
the members are private to the class not any particular instances of the class

312244
subtract	addition
i m after an addition or fix to get winw and winh to the correct size of the scrollbar for each browser only if those browsers don t subtract the scrollbar from document.body.offsetwidth automatically

312312
visual-studio	release-mode
i have a visual-studio 2005 c++ program that runs differently in release-mode than it does in debug mode

312340
perl	php
i looked at php ruby perl and python as they are the most popular open source options

312340
ruby-on-rails	django
i didn t need any powerhorses if you will like ruby on ruby-on-rails or django since i just wanted to mess around with server side stuff and some sqlâ nothing serious

312369
constructor	object
if you depend on the compiler generated version and user code deletes a derived object through a pointer to a base class whose constructor is not virtual then the derived object s destructor will not be called possibly leaking resources

312413
rad-controls	telerik
apparently telerik has begun adding jquery to some of their rad-controls starting from release q3

312417
versioning	upgrade
if the os changes and a new versioning of the library is needed to work with it properly you have to provide an upgrade versioning of your binary

312428
static-class	inherited
case2 in case we have a static-class and we have to log the methods within what we can do to inherited this class from marshalbyrefobject calss in order to get logging works

312430
versioning	upgrade
if you are only to minor versioning behind there probably isn t much reason to upgrade

312447
sendmessage	message
so logs who are informatic like for example the function sendmessage that finished successfully or not will be audit logs but logs of any failure of the application to send that message who caused an exception-handling will be exception-handling logs

312468
safari	opera
not for me it doesn t it returns the same value as ie opera konqueror and safari

312473
environment	building
you need to building a performance test environment with real hardware and something which can simulate lots of clients

312477
exception-handling	try-catch
at exception-handling every methods body should be at least in a try-catch block at least with a general exception catch at the end

312477
logging	trace
put logging in the catch block add optional information besides the system message and the stack trace to indicate what caused the error then throw the error

312490
vbscript	jscript
anyone have a script jscript vbscript or similar in the spirit of this handy script but adding the msiuserealadmindetection property

312497
web-services	api
all your code is on your hosting server and from there is can make calls back to facebook s api web-services to get any needed data

312558
administration	account
my user s machines have normal user account and i m wondering if i can just deploy the dlls in the same folder as the application in the user s application data folder and reference them from code without needing to register them under an administration account on that machine

312559
any	set
modifying the customaction_noimpersonate.js referenced in the question gives this scripting which can add set any value in the properties table

312562
contains	any
if the file does not contains any chars 128 it won t change a thing it will even be the same size but you are prepared for the future

312565
business-objects	data-access
also under a project i now start to have sub systems that have all 3 data-access business-objects busiensslogic

312576
create-table	insert-into
but this only gives me the create-table sql not the insert-into sql

312579
defined	declare
i usually like to stick to the 1 class 1 file rule but when it comes to eventargs i actually like to declare them in the same file that i defined the delegation or event

312592
business-objects	data-access
and then services...and maybe persistence if you are using orm...it may be different if your using different approach but to be honest i am confused about names businesslogic data-access and business-objects

312594
sql-server	ms-access
don t think that moving to sql-server is going to improve performance of your queries ms-access often does a better job of optimizing the queries for you it knows what needs to be displayed and does lots of caching and optimization

312604
configuration	environment
we re running in a restricted environment where we don t have access to the server s file system and thus we cannot make tweaks and changes to our wcf configuration ourselves - we always have to find it managers to handle that

312612
.net	wcf
where and how can i download either these new wcf channel bits or where can i get my hands on a current .net 2.0 3.5 version of the tibco.ems .net client library

312612
.net	wcf
i ve had an opportunity to check out the native tibco.ems.dll from .net as well as their wcf implementation and my conclusion is use the native api

312613
c-strings	c++
c-strings lack the following aspects of their c++ counterparts

312620
value	field
i added additional field and entered test value the output clearly shows all dynamic input-field posted back to the server

312621
authentication	login
in order to authentication myself on the mail server gmx yahoo own website i need to store the login details inside the application which runs on the client system

312681
pascal	delphi
you need a bit of understanding in either pascal or delphi but this overview from thinkquest is pretty helpful from a programming stand-point

312699
arguments	default
what you can do is use default for the arguments eg

312703
instances	self
all instances methods in python have an explicit self arguments

312703
arguments	default
you can achieve a similar effect by using default methods arguments

312710
linux	osx
i have seen similar problems when sharing source between developers on linux osx and windows

312711
linux	unix
i ll bet this is caused by systems trying to convert text files created in a windows system to files being used by a unix linux system and back again

312736
linux	osx
under osx and linux fgets is actually defined as so it would be safe to use on those systems

312743
databound	datalist
when the datalist is databound the autopostback has not been handled yet the values in the itemcreated event are still the original values

312752
connection-pooling	pool
connection-pooling scheme normally resolve this by having some system to occasionally check that connections in the pool are healthy or having a timeout after which unused connections are dropped

312785
getter	setter
the only methods that the class had were getter setter

312794
python	ruby
what is the python equivalent of the following code in ruby

312795
getter	setter
in fact one would argue that beans and entity beans are essentially that - data containers with getter and setter

312795
getter	setter
i have seen certain sources the book clean code arguing that one should avoid methods with multiple parameters and instead pass them as a single object with getter and setter

312800
getter	setter
note that in this case you probably shouldn t use getter setter just make the data public

312816
output	args
also the output files are never named as args

312817
order	add
the advantages are it s easily extensible into using capital lowercase or using non-english latin characters think ã or cedille eszets and the like and you d still be getting an order set only need to add a collation

312821
swing	gwt
although you don t program to the swing api directly when writing gwt applications the gwt api is very similar in style to swing programming

312824
updating	updates
i haven t had any problems with my scripting updating to 1.6 and the new versioning fixes an issue i had with ie so i m satisfied with this updates

312837
innodb	myisam
frequently-updated tables may show performance improvement by moving them to innodb where they can benefit from row-level locking as opposed to myisam s table-level locking

312843
account	api
i don t know whether you can count on your users having their own account or whether you can programmatically create all the calendars you need on one account and just pull the per-calendar data through the api but it might be worth a look

312844
connection-pooling	pool
if your application is connection-pooling - the connection slots in the pool typically remain connected until they are needed

312844
traffic	packets
keepalives are essentially 0 len tcp packets ususally concidered neglegable traffic

312844
environment	execution
removes possibility of environment pollution - where other queries set special environment options that can interfere with query execution xact_abort transaction isolation levels..etc

312863
getter	setter
a passive struct-like java bean all getter and setter may represent a real-world thing

312863
python	java
while python has this java doesn t

312870
json	xml
because it s simple and very easy way to access that method you don t have to think if the string you re handling contains xml or xhtml or json or whatever you ll just pick one method from the general group of methods and that s it

312881
include	ssi
i am working in dreamweaver cs3 and want to use include commands either ssi or php but not have to keep putting my files up on hostgator in order to see if they are working

312889
command-prompt	cmd
you run things by typing cmd at the command-prompt and pressing enter

312893
updating	updates
there are bizzare limits on updating a table while refrencing the same table during an updates

312894
for-loop	arrays
run that code in for-loop each time assign a different variable place in an arrays perhaps or property of an object to your newly loaded e.target.content so you can access it outside of that oncomplete -type function

312924
cakephp	symfony
besides the excellent suggestions about test frameworks already given are you building your application with one of the php web frameworks that has automated testing built in such as symfony or cakephp

312925
authentication	login
the default behavior when a not authentication user clicks it is to redirect him her to login page and then pass the target page

312949
command-line	cmd
in a cmd-line email client like mutt you d do the former with the b cmd and the latter by typing |procmail

312956
silverlight	wpf
there is prism it was originally designed for wpf but there is now a silverlight release

312959
istream	std
the problem with using a pure std istream is that you would read but then you wouldn t have a way to put the transformed data back for the next step in the pipeline

312959
iostream	boost
boost has an sophisticated iostream library which can do many things

312960
contains	any
you may know that today 1024 bytes is enough to contains any input but you don t know how things will change tomorrow or next year

312967
mouseover	mouseout
i am trying to fade in a on mouseover and fade out on mouseout

312972
istream	ostream
i would make it so i would have methods in the class like tostream ostream os and fromstream istream then define

312975
mouseover	mouseout
two key difference i use the jquery hover event to associate mouseover and mouseout event handler such that child elements won t result in confusing behavior and i use the stop function to prevent animation from overlapping and canceling each other out

312980
output	mode
their output directed to output windows in vs if you are in debugging mode otherwise you can use debuggingview to see it

312982
xsd	xml
do you have an xsd for your xml document

312983
memcached	apc
i am now using memcached for storing user data and apc only for code

312993

with the following you should be able to use mssql syntax and get the same results as mssql such as selected datediff dd getdate dateadd dd 5 getdate from dual

313009
numeric	digits
the 00 after the colon is the format specifier 2 numeric digits

313016
shutdown	restart
run the script chuck it all into usr local yourproject and tell them where is the startup shutdown restart script

313023
arguments	default
add a new constructor that takes the arguments and calls the default constructor

313046
frame	width
it then manipulates the width and height of these linked windowss and it finally undocks them all from the linked windows frame

313054
superclass	subclass
even if animal was not supposed to be abstract i still have the problem that for some reason since the foreignkey is defined on animal and not one of its subclasses the superclass methods is being called instead of the subclass

313054
superclass	subclass
while experimenting with this i discovered that when django saves a subclassed model it does two things 1 it creates a row for the subclassed object in the superclass s table and 2 it makes the pk in the subclass table identical to the pk assign in the superclass table

313054
superclass	subclass
cat and dog will have disjoint pk sets and any subclass of animal will have a pk identical to the record of its superclass but unfortunately django does not perform any work behind the scenes a la i m an animal

313067
groovy	java
requires groovy on java 6 or a stax api and implementation such as woodstox in the classpath

313069
silverlight	wpf
it s probably worth learning a bit of normal wpf after that on the grounds that it may well be easier to experiment that way than with silverlight itself

313072
silverlight	wpf
wpf silverlight is another layer on top of that

313083
perl	php
the reason i chose perl in the first place is i m very familiar with perl more than php

313083
perl	php
which would be faster php or perl without mod_perl

313084
windows-vista	windows
i believe this works for most flavors of windows from windows 2000 right up to and including windows-vista

313100
contains	any
to access any kind of powershell variables where the name contains non-alphanumeric characters use the â notation as in

313112

there are a number of open source fat filesystems implementations around

313130
processor	cpu
gpu s specialized cpu s on graphics cards for example may contains hundreds of cores stream processor which operate in parallel to rendering the pixels on your screen

313176
versioning	migrate
with the new release of 2.2.2 i want to migrate to the new versioning

313199
updating	updates
but there is an occasional need to start a transaction before a whole collection of the objects start updating to ensure that the database is only actually updates if all objects in the collection succeed

313199
rollback	commit
transaction commit rollback should happen here

313230
rollback	commit
as mitch wheat already mentioned a transaction has context and is connection based so it will include your changes happening in the page methods and commit if all ok or rollback if there was an exception-handling

313230
nhibernate	ado.net
i would prefer spring.net framework transactions available for both ado.net and nhibernate versions because i believe they support better aop-based aspect oriented programming separation of concerns you will not have to couple your code with transaction code and mostly because these guys have been doing transactions in java for many years and i just trust them that they know what to do

313268
contains	any
i also want to catch this route any text after the domain name but it can t contains a in it no folders just files on the root

313275
base-class	inherited
suppose you can t change it because you re doing binary inherited or because it itself derives from a base-class you can t change

313276
base-class	inherited
without more information about why you need to inherited from marshalbyrefobject or why your base-class does not cannot

313303
base-class	inherited
can you create a base-class for the piece of your domain model that requires inherited from marshalbyrefobject

313307
keydown	keyup
also you re code will be more readable if you use the keydown event instead of the keyup event

313307
event-bubbling	keydown
you can also catch the key.enter for a grouping of related controls by using the keydown event of their container event-bubbling

313322
expression-blend	silverlight
if you are planning to create applications that will take advantage of silverlight s multimedia capabilities you might want to play around with expression-blend first and then study .net

313336
margins	padding
as was mentioned if you re trying to reduce the vertical height of an inline element top or bottom margins padding won t do anything

313344
export	report
anyway this project compiles and runs fine on my development machine vs 2008 but then when i publish it to the server which has the cr basic for vs 2008 runtime installed i get this error message when trying to export the report to pdf

313381
http	ssl
what is ssl and how does it relate to http

313383
sql-server	oracle
i need to craft an ansi 92 valid sql statement or at worst one that will work on oracle db2 and sql-server that will return all facilities related to a given reporting unit anywhere up the hierarchy

313386
http	ssl
https is just http over ssl

313387
http	ssl
https is just http used over ssl

313388
http	ssl
ssl and http are used for encrypted secure network communications

313410
firefox	safari
it works totally fine in safari firefox mac and pc and ie6 but for some reason it s not working in ie7

313417
sequences	unique
this is essentially the same approach as using a bit field but instead of dealing with raw bits you assign a unique letter to each day of the week and the daysofweek column just stores a sequences of letters indicating what days a course is held on

313417
value	field
cons the only real con is that like the bitfield approach this breaks the relational model by storing a variables number of value in a single field

313421
glut	glu
glu glut created objects are created at the origin of your current modelview space so you will need to translate rotate scale them to your desired location

313423
http	ssl
https http over ssl

313423
http	ssl
https is where the http protocol is run over ssl rather than directly over tcp and therefore the data exchanged is encrypted

313430
document	element
assign top left directly and changing positioning to absolute makes the element positioninged relatively to its parent if it was positioninged too absolute relative or fixed or to the document root

313432
python	c++
i m a c python programmer in c++ land working with the stl for the first time

313453
conditional	operators
start with the basic conditional loops operators precedence then move to object oriented technics design-patterns

313457
swing	awt
for example swing awt will typically be slower than something written directly for the native os

313458
swing	swt
see for example swt which are the graphical tools built by ibm i think meant to replace swing and give both native performance and look-and-feel

313463
document	editing
to clarify i m editing a document and i change a bunch of settings

313464
hashtable	set
and akusete is right you can and you should implement a set as a hashtable a set should be a generic container and not all objects can be sorted

313465
groovy	java
performance comparison - c++ java python ruby jython jruby groovy

313465
malloc	free
the malloc free approach deals with blocks of memory one at a time whereas the garbage-collection approach tends to deal with memory-management in large batches yielding more opportunities for optimization at the cost of some loss in predictability

313475
any	set
this command lets you record a set of keyboard inputs and replay them any number of times which is good for building advanced edit commands as well as automating repetitive tasks code reformatting

313481
country-codes	iso
code columns international currency codes usd ukp etc. iso country-codes us uk etc language codes en-us etc account segment codes etc

313483
include	ssi
ssi include or php include

313483
include	ssi
then how do i implement either ssi include statements or php include statements into my html to call up html files that include html images javascript and commands that call other javascript menu files

313490
svg	vml
it is cross-browser svg vml canvas silverlight and it looks like it fits the bill

313495
any	set
now you can map this macros to any set of keystrokes you like using the macross ide and the keyboard preferences

313500
include	ssi
the normal way to include files in ssi is

313512
execution	jobs
the scheduling provides a calendar for scheduling the execution of jobs similar to crontab or you could develop your own

313523
np-complete	np-hard
note that np-complete problems are also np-hard

313534
data-structures	tree
i would start out by taking a look at eternallyconfuzzled which contains great tutorials for basic data-structures an algorithms including linked lists and binary search tree sorting and searching algorithms

313540
any	set
if your family of sets that produce the given outcome is not monotone if it doesn t have the property that if a certain set of actions work then so will any superset then you can prove that there is no way of finding the shortest sequence without looking at all subsets

313543
swing	awt
is it possible to build the user interface in java using java s swing and awt libraries that operates an application primarily written in c#

313562
insertion-sort	quicksort
read the related wikipedia page skip the o n log n stuff and focus on the implementations of say insertion-sort merge sort and quicksort

313565
.when	ready
also .when you are ready to seek another career down the road teaching is an excellent choice

313569
communication	messages
communication of messages over the secure channel once it was established certain agreed crypto standards are used to enforce proper encryption decryption at sending and receiving side

313569
http	ssl
relation b w ssl and https https is secure http communication based on ssl protocol http over ssl as they say

313576
tablerow	layout
since it s easier and sensible to think of layout in the grid table format the availability of table tablerow table-cell table-caption table-column tablerow-group etc as css properties will ease layout implementation significantly

313581
children	nodes
i have a n-ary non sorted in any way tree and each nodes can have 0-n children

313598
double	int
besides this methods s argument is int while i need double

313605
binary-compatibility	legacy
binary-compatibility is not broken because it is possible to replace a legacy class file with a generic class file without changing or recompiling any client code

313617
constructor	object
i would also do lazy instantiation in the getter s of publics to make sure the object is available if it hasn t already been created rather than setting it in the constructor of mapinfowrapper

313641
contains	set
every set needs to be compared to every other one to see if they contains 2 or more shared elements

313649
publishing	release
when i publishing my asp.net site in release mode and set compilation debugging false will my asp.net and system.diagnostics tracing still work

313656
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is more of a subset of wpf and it s missing a few things which means your design style needs to be slightly different

313675
.net	wcf
make sure the service is running and exposing metadata this error is occuring in .net 2008 while executing the wcf application

313690
business-process	bpm
usually as part of a managed business-process as in bpm

314498
csv	xml
if that doesn t work i use a csv file or xml

314512

314786
associations	model
i know i can extend associations per model by passing a module

314800

if you have a situation where you need to know where a boolean value wasn t set for example if that unset value should inherit from a parent value the java boolean primitive and the equivalent in other languages is clearly not adequate

314820
parsing	comma
the short answer is i wouldn t use gawk to parsing csv if the csv contains awkward data where awkward means things like comma in the csv field data

314820
perl	awk
remember perl was originally written in part as an awk and sed killer - hence the a2p and s2p programs still distributed with perl which convert awk and sed scripts respectively into perl

314865
having	select
if you select a word it will highlight all of those words in the current document makes it easier to find misspellings without having to hit ctrl + f

314869

314907
contains	lookup
if it is instantiated with one kind of data but expected to provide another such as in resource lookup it should contains validation otherwise it probably shouldn t

314965
any	set
at almost a year into my current project i finally set up an automated build that pushes any new commits to the test server and man i wish i had done that on day one

314998
oracle	mysql
i don t know if it s with oracle or mysql but it s possible to do something like

315031
triggers	insert
i would probably do this with an insert triggers on the named entry table if you have all of the data you need to push to the tags table available

315068
primitive	int
note for the api of your dll try keeping the data types limited to primitive long int char etc. to prevent module boundary issues

315077
managed-code	unmanaged
creating instances of unmanaged classes in managed-code should not be possible

315078
click	mouse
my issue is that if the user click the mouse multiple times i have multiple instances of movediv getting called

315080
triggers	insert
if you are using triggers or something that insert rows.

315102
32-bit	64bit
heap fragmentation is just as much of an issue under 64bit as under 32-bit

315110
ironpython	cpython
i decided that i should write as much of the code as possible in python and django and target all the platforms cpython jython and ironpython

315113
stderr	stdout
you are right that you can preserve the original stdout and stderr with the redirections you showed but it is usually simpler for the people who have to maintain the scripting later to understand what s going on if you scope the redirected code as shown above

315133
dictionary	hashmap
you would use an array dictionary hashmap to associate strings with handles

315142
constructor	object
i like my object to do as much initialization in the constructor as possible and have a minimum number of mutators

315158
entity-framework	data-access
if you use dynamic sql why not use linq to entity-framework now ef is the recommend data-access technology from microsoft see this post clarifying the message on l2s futures from ado.net team blog and if you do an insert with ef the last identity id will available for you automatically i use it all the time it s easy

315183

315258
ruby	php
in general it will win over python ruby and php in baseline performance

315260

this might be a dependency injection container a beanbox style visual tool or simply reading json xml or properties files that you wrote by hand

315299
sql-server	oracle
it s new to sql-server 2005 and does the same thing that oracle s minus does

315307
getter	setter
so you can use this in the property getter and setter

315325
ruby-on-rails	django
i am very interested in learning a ruby on ruby-on-rails django type web technology but am currently using windows server 2008 for .net web applications. i have read that ror is not very performant on windows

315331
lookup	any
these clients coded using php and javascript might be checking the database very often impatient users even though there may not be any change to the database itself and the check will involve quite a lengthy query involving lots of lookup and cross referencing etc

315340
any	set
nearly all programming languages used are turing complete and while this affords the language to represent any computable algorithm it also comes with its own set of problems

315340
turing-complete	state-machines
regular expression used for matching strings and finite state-machines are used when lexing but i m wondering if there s a more general broadly language that s not turing-complete

315343
ruby-on-rails	django
there are good step-by-step tutorials available and ready-to-install bundles for both ruby-on-rails and django on windows

315382
if-statement	loops
conditional branches show up in if-statement and the control tests of for and while loops

315382
if-statement	loops
this includes if-statement loops of all sorts regular function calls and many more

315407
cos	sin
using a-star instead of brute force path-finding will be faster just like how bresenham circles are better than using sin cos

315429
boost	stl
example stl boost vs rolling your own containers and algos

315439
multiplication	addition
how fast addition is to multiplication how fast a vector is compared to a normal arrays or to the higher scale how certain algorithms compare

315447
getter	setter
the point is to provide getter and setter for those things that need to be in the objects contract

315454
python	java
i m going to use a psuedo c# java langauge to explain some concepts but you can transpose them to python

315454
arrays	loops
to render the board you loops through the gameboard arrays increasing by an offset of the piece size

315454
click	mouse
likewise resolving a mouse click back to a location in the arrays would be similar use the mouse location and offset to calculate the actual tile you are on

315462
ocaml	lisp
you should consider languages such as lisp f# ocaml and gilad bracha s new language newspeak

315495

315535
selected	cell
when adding single quotes around a string remember to add them outside your selected cell

315541
directory	folder
unless your users are going to an open folder with a directory listing of your images i don t think folder structure will significantly increase or decrease retrieval speeds for your users

315551
32-bit	64bit
32-bit applications can run on 32-bit os s and on 64bit os s

315552
javascript	dom
all is perfect except ie it load any javascript script that was putted in dom dynamically in asynchron way so document.write inside doubleclick scripts append nodes to the end of the document and not in my codeholder nodes

315561
windows	wow64
it is called wow64 windows on windows 64

315561
32-bit	64bit
this allows 32-bit processes to run natively on a 64bit machine

315564
exception-handling	try-catch
as with try-catch i do the normal flow and then handle exception-handling conditions

315569
xerces	jdom
other alternatives such as xerces xmlserializer or jdom xmloutputter are more direct methods less code but they are framework-specific

when creating a shape mousedown move mouseup this is handle by the board and it knows about his own snap flag

315626
panels	grid
itemscontrol from frameworkelement or from non-control classes that still participate in user-interface such as panels or grid

315626
dependency-properties	attached-properties
deriving from dependencyobject might be appropriate if you are defining a business or data storage object where you want dependency-properties to be active or if you are creating a service support class that will own attached-properties

315653
click	mouse
i assume that the board object traps mouse events first so that it can decide which shape has been click on

315668
fileinputstream	gzipinputstream
you can wrap for example a fileinputstream in a gzipinputstream and use it in the same way you d use any inputstream

315668
fileinputstream	gzipinputstream
note that the gzipinputstream has its own internal buffering so wrapping the fileinputstream in a bufferingedinputstream would probably decrease performance.

315688
perl	ruby
personally i d do it in ruby but a language like perl or python would also make this task pretty straightforward

315688
export	report
depends on what you want to do with the data if you want to produce just a few charts at the end of the exercise and put them into a report then export to csv would probably make most sense whereas if you want to generate a new set of data every day for a year then building a tool to do that automatically is almost certainly the best idea

315688
export	csv
anyway i think pretty much everything i said above still applies but i guess you ll lean towards going with export to csv or what have you rather than an automated display

315695
ironpython	cpython
at resolver systems we re working on a project called ironclad which will eventually hopefully allow you to use cpython extensions like matplotlib and numpy transparently from ironpython

read the introductions to using tools like yacc lex bison or my personal favorite jflex

315728
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it may not be the solution to all your problems and there are lots of projects that may benefit more from a traditional webforms implementation but while trying to figure out asp.net-mvc you will certainly learn a lot and it might bring up lots of ideas that you can apply on your job

315728
asp.net-mvc	webforms
one good thing that i noticed while going through many blog posts and video tutorials while trying to develop a asp.net-mvc pet-project is that most of them follow the current best practices tdd ioc dependency injection and to a lower extent poco plus a lot of jquery to make the experience more interesting for the user and that is stuff that i can apply on my current webforms apps and that i wasn t exposed in such depth before

315728
webforms	asp.net
the asp.net mvc way of doing things is so different from webforms that it will shake up a bit your mind and that for a developer is very good

315728
webforms	asp.net
once the guy gets that he or she will be better equipped to move to the artificial facilities provided by asp.net webforms and server controls

315744
show	next
the prompt show fine when an item is placed into the sent items folder if you dismiss it it will show again fine the next time the event is triggers and so on

315744

but the next time an email is placed into the sent items folder the event doesnt fire and hence the prompt doesnt even show

315754
command-line	cmd
you can do this all in basic linux command-line cmd

315799
error-handling	try-catch
how should i add error-handling to this currently it is placed in one big try-catch but if the second value i read fails then the rest are not read as the program jumps to catch i could add a try-catch for each but i m guessing there is a better way

315818
xsd	xml
okay you can share a model with something like xml xsd but oslo could make it easier as it looks like you can generate classes and your database from them whilst storing the model in a central repository

315828
ruby-on-rails	django
i feel like this is best suited for a general framework ruby on ruby-on-rails django etc but i wonder if it might not be good for a traditional cms platform like drupal

315842
margins	padding
if there is no border padding inline content or clearance to separate the margin-top of a block with the margin-top of its first child block or no border padding inline content height min-height or max-height to separate the margin-bottom of a block with the margin-bottom of its last child then those margins collapse

315842
margins	padding
in this simple example you could easily just change the margins on the child element to a padding on the parent element

315871
hide	next
if so you can use a formula to check the next record and conditional hide the detail section

315873
openoffice.org	spreadsheet

315915
if-statement	arrays
i have a sum arrays formula that has multiple nested if-statement making it very inefficient

315927
constructor	object
that being said you could create a constructor that takes a simple object like this and copies those values into the new instance

315934

you can use an md5 hash to provide a fixed-length virtually unique value computed from the lengthy url data and then use that hash as the primary key

317906
hash	md5
if you log 1 million distinct url s per day for 2 000 years the md5 hash of these url s are still less likely to include a collision than your hard disk is to have an uncorrectable bit error

317922
abstract-class	subclassing
from the description it really appears that it is the creation behavior that is different between the types not the behavior of the subclassing themselves so the case for the refactoring of myclass to an interface or abstract-class gets stronger

keydata on the other hand will contains a logical or of the value in keycode with any modifier keys ctrl shift alt etc. that are held at the time

318202
pure-virtual	base-class
an abstract base-class is a class in which at least one member function methods in java lingo is a pure-virtual function declared using the following syntax

318202
virtual-functions	derived-class
in order to stop being abstract a derived-class must provide implementations for all pure virtual-functions it inherits

318202
member-functions	base-class
note that an abstract base-class can be more than an interface because it can contains data-members and member-functions that are not pure virtual

318202
virtual-functions	base-class
an equivalent of an interface would be an abstract base-class without any data with only pure virtual-functions

318239
any	set
so is there any way to set environment variables in the currently running process

318266
strcmp	atoi
atoi to convert characters to ints will let you test the range of each number and some strcmp s between the . s

318311
subtract	add
i need to start with the first row add the debits subtract the credits and store the value a

318327
message	alert
in an app i m coding i would like to make an alert message to appear that display a large semi-transparent warning message without affecting the users work

318327
always-on-top	transparency
i have started by using an always-on-top windows and setting the windows style to none and setting the background and transparency key to white

318327
message	alert
on this windows there is a label with a large font which contains the alert message later i ll probably override the paint event and paint the message using gdi

318340
tokenize	parsing
you have to make a choice do you create your own tokenize parsing and interpreter compiler chain something which might take a long time and might be done incorrectly

318343
contains	any
for example many of the solutions posted in the previous answers assume that the quads are in base 10 - but a quad starting with a zero must be treated as a base 8 octal number hence for example any quad part starting with zero and contains the digits 8 or 9 is not valid

318343
digits	base
i.e the ip number 192.168.1.010 is not 192.168.1.10 but in reality is 192.168.1.8 and the ip number 192.168.019.14 is not valid since the third quad contains the invalid base 8 digits 9

318343
netbsd	linux
this works just fine cross-platform tested a while back while swearing under linux netbsd and win32.

318363
lisp	sml
try implementing mergesort in oz sml prolog or lisp

318365
haskell	scala
i would create my own interpreter using an existing parser generator like antlr or haskell scala s parser combinators

318388
debugging	trace
i am trying to debugging an intermittent error on the iphone a crash with a trace that looks like

318398
python	c++
it takes significantly longer to compile a c++ file than it would to run a normal size python script

318411
command-line	cmd
there are three major examples i can think of one for instance would be a command-line application which might under some circumstances require keyboard input for example something like cmd c del

318437
forwarding	port
i setup port forwarding on my router to send incoming requests to it

318449
show	next
in addition there is an optional textbox that show up next to one of the selection

318461
pointers	stack
well dwarf2 builds up tables for every function that contains what the callee saved registers are and where in stack they are saved and where the frame pointers return address in the callstack is and some other stuff

318461
contains	set
also every time you start a try block setjmp has to be called to set up the buffer contains the saved registers while when using dwarf2 the compiler already provides all necessary information at compile time

318463
selected	textbox
you can also just make the textbox appear only when unvailable is selected

318467
scripting-language	dsl
unless the dsl is simple enough that the parsing interpreter fits on a single page i would recommend embedding an existing scripting-language

318468
selected	textbox
you could hide the required textbox and only reveal if if the user selected the available option

318480
delphi	c++
i haven t used delphi or kylix but back in the ms-dos days a turbo pascal program would compile almost instantaneously while the equivalent turbo c++ program would just crawl

318483
value	field
this does require having another table that stores the value of the timestamp in a varbinary field at the time you run the report so you can use it compare on the next run

318524
perl	php
i haven t used vba in a long time but those are not arrays they are hashes in perl and associative arrays in php

318525
put	get
why would you want to put every possible way to get required state in the methods itself

318550
typedef	struct
note the typedef struct .

318551
put	get
if i put all my functions in the same file as the main it works fine but when i try to split the functions out in different files i cannot get it to compile

318569
having	union
having a struct class union defined in multiple source-files is perfectly valid as long as each one is same defined

318569
defined	declare
it s saying that b is not defined but merely declare so you can refer to it

318594
telnet	tcp
after telnet establishes the tcp connection the pop server should send something like +ok the microsoft exchange pop3 service is ready. you can type capa and hit return then the pop server should respond with a list of capabilities that it supports in that state of the session that is prior to logging in

318595
installation	environment
is this environment suppose to simulate as many active-directory installation as possible or is it to just test that authentication works against a dc

318600
python	java
also if you re looking to just get out of the c++ game i believe qt has some java bindings now...also i remember some python bindings but never look at those myself

318613
cocoa	uikit
cocoa uikit has a pattern that is called delegation and notifications to accomplish this others use callback functions or objects swing or signals and slots qt

318616
svnadmin	dump
svnadmin dump svn myproj1 home username myproj1bak

318617
sharpziplib	dotnetzip
i used to use sharpziplib until i switched to dotnetzip you may want to check it out as an alternative

318621
synchronous	.when
the sync bytes are less critical in a synchronous protocols than in an asynchronous one but they still help especially .when the embedded system is first powering up and you don t know if the first byte it gets is the middle of a message or not

318621
response	timeout
the pc side also needs a timeout to handle the case when the embedded system is not connected and there is no response at all

318624
cygwin	gnu
it s part of the gnu coreutils v6+ and pretty much default in any cygwin l i n u x gnuwin32 install but not the bsds i tried

318624
png	gif
i would prefer you use one of image png image jpeg or image gif as i can t find the popular image x-icon

318630
firefox	opera
following works with firefox 3 ie7 and opera 9

318630
google-chrome	safari
but in webkit browsers like safari and google-chrome values are 0

318632
base-class	inherited
the textbox i originally posted about was not inherited from a base-class form although it was added to a custom user-controls class

318632
base-class	inherited
i probably should have mentioned that earlier but i recently ran into the same problem on a totally unrelated set of controls that were inherited from a base-class form

318638
lighting	lwjgl
lwjgl lighting weight java gaming library which imo is the better one due to its simplicity and its similarity to using opengl with c++

318639
getter	setter
note setter and getter are treated like properties

318639
getter	setter
even though setter getter are functions methods they are treated like properties

318645
hide	show
i am trying to find a way using jquery without cookies to display a block and click it to hide and not show again

318649
authentication	login
however instead it caused the page to prompt the user for their login credentials windows authentication in the browser

318658
entity-framework	nhibernate
i ve seen nhibernate llblgen genome linq to sql entity-framework subsonic etc

318665
oracle-xe	oracle
i am creating a copy of our testing oracle 10g both and run into a problem in that our testing database has utl_smtp and utl_file system packages installed and my local oracle-xe version does not

318668
silverlight	wpf
regarding your second question - in my opinion the programming model of wpf and silverlight allows for a clearer separation between designer and coder microsoft expression design is for designers .net 3.5 is for coders and microsoft epxression blend is somewhere in the middle

318672
shell	bash
if you can install cygwin you ll get a bash shell by default so this command will work

318672
shell	bash
only problem is now the value of password is only set in the bash shell not as an environment variable a batch file can see don t use pwd as this means something else in cygwin

318672
shell	bash
so you would have to rewrite your script as a bash shell script maybe not too hard given the limitations of the command prompt

318673
show	next
when i fire up thunderbird the next morning the stat command should show 20 messages

318696
selected	textbox
right clicking on the textbox in the designer should pop up a menu that lets you selected any controls that exist underneath it also

318703
32-bit	64bit
my quess is that it probably doesn t have anything to do with 32-bit versus 64bit per se

318703
contains	any
if the inner loop contains any variation of conventional load-store instructions

318704
contains	any
any methods whose name contains copy alloc retain or new returns an object that you own

318714
authentication	login
if the user is not already authenticated at that site authentication fails and you need to redirect to that site s login page

318714
any	set
another possibility for a malicious provider is to set up an openid service that simply always confirms any id passed to it for authentication or allows an administrator to setup a back door for it s users

318715
firefox	safari
the behavior in firefox safari is the desired correct one

318745
protected	public
try setting the textbox s access-modifiers to protected or public

318749
richtextbox	picturebox
the only thing i can suggest would be to first create a user-controls that has a picturebox and maybe a multiline textbox or richtextbox next to it

318750
keyword	lexical
compiling is the sort of job that s best split up into smaller phases if your first phase performs lexical analysis into tokens splitting lines into keyword identifiers constants and so on then it s much simpler to find the references to macros and look them up in a symbol table

318750
bison	yacc
that second step is something that again programs like yacc and bison and their more modern variants can happily generate code to do

318751
rollback	commit
do you mean that you want to write to a table but then have the exclusive lock not persisted until commit rollback

318751
rollback	commit
if so put the value s you need into a table variables which is unaffected by rollback commit and defer the write to after the main transaction

318769
include	ssi
i think you are referring to apache ssi include now

318796
google-chrome	safari
the root problem is that webkit browsers safari and google-chrome load javascript and css information in parallel

318806
json	xml
in my view and based on some years of quite bitter experience java native serialization is fraught with problems and ought to be avoided if possible especially as there is excellent xml json support

318817
any	set
any other mechanism to match a value or set of condition to the needed type

318829
seam	jsf
but if you are asking about using jsf managed beans with a jpa framework have a look at seam

318853
nvidia	ati
nvidia s cuda and ati s cal are roughly equivalent in features

318853
nvidia	ati
cuda only works on nvidia gpus and cal only works on ati gpus

318857
binary-search	quicksort
tree heap merge radix and quicksort o n log n can be thought of as iterated binary-search o log n

318871
display	width
the second issue has to do with modifying the existing layout so that there is a centered vertical area of 760px in width that display in a shade of color different from the surrounding viewport

318871
sticky-footer	liquid-layout
i would opt to use a div layout to the exclusion of a tablelayout if it were not for the apparently currently insoluble problem of getting a working sticky-footer to work with a div liquid-layout

318872
revision	rcs
rcs revision number

318893
instances	private
unfortunately private only applies to instances methods

318906
contains	elements
the arraylist can contains elements of all derived classes but since they are all connected the string representation will always contains the elements i need to fill up the grid

318932
scripting	shebang
i haven t tried your scripting yet but it looks like you could solve this problem by removing the -w from the shebang line which turns on global warnings and adding in use warnings

318987
quirks-mode	doctype
add a doctype - if use use the right one you can get ie to standards mode rather than quirks-mode so behaviour will be more consistent between ie and other browsers

318987
margins	padding
add a css reset to zero default margins and padding a good starting point here

318989
duplicates	contains
add edges to the graph if the two ends contains duplicates in some n-tuple position or violate any positional constraints there s five of those

318998
design-time	designer
at runtime everything works great but at design-time i will get errors in the form designer

318998
attributes	properties
since i don t need to set any of these properties at design time the hidden attributes is probably more appropriate

319000
click	mouse
when they mouse over a step they get a brief description and then full details when they click through to the actual step page

319002
attributes	properties
example i have an interface in a plugin-architecture iplugin and there is an attributes to add meta info to a properties

319002
attributes	properties
then i look for properties with this attributes in the plugins implementation for extra processing storing its value mark as gui read-only...

319002
attributes	properties
now when i create a mock can i add easily an attributes to a properties or the object instance itself

319015
any	set
if you didn t set any such switch then it s a bug -- the c and c++ standards don t allow the compilers to reorder operations without your permission

319018
sql-server	oracle
install oracle odbc drivers on sql-server

319018
sql-server	oracle
create system dsn to oracle on sql-server

319018
sql-server	oracle
unzip the packages to a local directory on the sql-server typically c oracle

319018
selected	button
selected the system dsn tab and then selected the add button

319018
selected	button
oracle in instantclient 10_2 and then selected finish button

319018
selected	button
selected test connection button

319027
json	xml
you have to deal with the same concepts whether you serialize in xml json asn.1 etc

319028
eof	eol
as suggested you can use getchar to read from the console until an eol or an eof is returned building your own buffering

319028
stdin	eof
otherwise there is either more data or an eof up ahead in stdin

319028
getchar	fgets
the examples of dynamically-growing a buffering can be made to work with either getchar or fgets

319051
.when	ready
6. .when ready disconnect and overwrite the phone book with your settings in with the original file if it is there else simply delete the phone book

319057
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox this works using position fixed and centering the div in the intuitive way

319064
build-process	msbuild
the best workaround i ve come up with for c++ builds is to locate the child processes that are created by the vc build-process and terminate them which stops the msbuild build

319094
cassini	iis
apparently iis handles this but cassini doesn t

319096
factors	numeric
what kind of performance gain you will get depends on a lot of factors but the most important is the numeric intensity

319106
attributes	properties
try putting the following attributes line on the properties

319107
initializer	setter
the top-down approach that i would take is command-pattern which is essentially what you have in your original question save the poor class name create a class called potentialequation initializer it via a constructor factory or setter whatever you like and then expose a solve methods maybe like this

319108
children	tree
i m using modified pre-order tree traversal to store iterate through this list and so what i have is a subset of the tree including all children ordered by their left value

319113
handler	service
i have a javascript request going to a asp.net 2.0 http handler which passes the request to a java web service

319131
border-layout	boxlayout
look into boxlayout and border-layout as your staples

319138
any	set
in any case you should always assume the whole file is in the same character set unless otherwise specified

319155
scriptaculous	sortable
i m working on a project where i am using a scriptaculous sortable object

319155
google-chrome	firefox
it works nice and fast in firefox and google-chrome but in ie it is incredibly slow whenever i drop an element

319159
contains	elements
i have an xml definition that contains an elements with child elementss

319161
attributes	properties
if you defined the body tag with you could add the style inline using the attributes properties but this wouldn t be a good idea

319175
sql-server	oracle
i believe both oracle certain and sql-server think so have mechanisms to do a query against a column containing xml in a more xml-friendly way for instance using xpath

319197
mouseover	onclick
is it possible to make virtual earth pushpin infobox display respond from onclick instead of mouseover

319197
onmouseover	onclick
however if i attempt to change the onmouseover to onclick ve picks up onclick and disables the infobox entirely

319223
implements	final
i am going to be implements a sitemap and i need to make a final decision with the url strategy

319241
authentication	login
when getting to the third page the authentication cookie is lost and the page redirects back to the login

319251
sql-server	teradata
looks like my data warehouse project is moving to teradata next year from sql-server 2005

319251
sql-server	teradata
i m looking for resources about best practices on teradata - from limitations of its sql dialect to idioms and conventions for getting queries to perform well - particularly if they highlight things which are significantly different from sql-server 2005

319251
unpivot	pivot
my business processes are currently in t-sql stored-procedures and rely fairly heavily on sql-server 2005 features like pivot unpivot and common table expressions to produce about 27m rows of output a month from a 4tb data warehouse

319264
hide	show
s with some sort of reference to the element and event that should triggers it to show or hide

319277
contains	set
httpcookie contains the domain parameter to set

319283
negative-number	zero
000 is zero obviously and 100 is the lowest negative-number of all which doesn t have a positive counterpart

319290
hide	show
i then had a check list of request types at the top of the form which show hide the id element when you checked the item show hide function not show

319290
input-field	fieldset
because both of the input-field within the fieldset are required when the delete account option is checked i ve added the following to the class attribute of the required input

319290
required	checked
the required value in the class usually works on true or false but in this case we put a reference in there instead of the standard true or false #checkboxid checked

319290
required	checked
if it is checked it returns as true and the field becomes required and if it comes back false the field is not required

319290
selected	checkbox
another thing i found useful was to ensure that someone selected a request type at the beginning of the form by adding the following to the class attribute on each of the checkbox

319290
selected	checkbox
if you need more then one checkbox selected then just add to the minlength

319311
stderr	stdout
if you need to read from both stdout and stderr it gets tricky with a naã ve implementation there is a risk of deadlock due to buffering etc .

319313
rollback	commit
if a second person tries to updates the row their updates statement wait to see if the first commit their change or rollback

319315
python	ruby
they have people working full time on alternate language support so you ll find they have the best ruby support in the industry and i believe python is about to become that good as well

319315
any	set
of course eclipse still has that crazy-cool todo list that remembers which files you worked on for each bug and can take you back to the set of files edits for any bug you ve worked on that s really amazing to use and i don t think it s available on either of the other platforms

319341
temporary	copy
the swap operation is essentially free but you re swapping with a temporary initialized with a copy of the original vector s data which is not free

319356
32-bit	16-bit
it is very nice for 8 and 16-bit processors far easier to handle in software than 32-bit or larger types

319357
wgs84	gps
also data that originates from surveying or gps equipment is usually collected in wgs84 the typical default for satellite surveying which is for all practical purposes the same as nad83 at least at mapping scale resolutions

319358
arrays	loops
you need to change your loops so that you check that the index is strictly less than the length of the arrays

319359
selected	button
it might be that there is no advanced button on the file types dialog when doc is selected and that instead a restore button is present

319360
vbscript	vb6
this started out as a set of vbscript routines which i have since converted to vb6

319364
data-members	private
methods that perform basic internal operations on those data-members where the functionality should never change should always be private

319364
data-members	private
so methods that do basic operations with your data-members such as initialization and allocation should be private

319364
defined	declare
i would use great caution in defining methods as protected virtual because doing so not only declare the possibility of overriding the functionality but in some ways defined an expectations of overridden functionality

319389
versioning	upgrade
we recently upgrade our intranet dev server windows-server 2003 to the latest and greatest patches including 2k3 sp2 and the latest for each versioning of .net

319401
attributes	properties
it would be really handy to be able to somehow say that certain properties in the generated entity classes should for example be decorated by say validation attributes as well as linq to sql column attributes

319415
png	gif
if it has a lot of solid colors and patterns then png or gif are probably your best bet

319423
any	set
i am new to mysqli and trying to confirm that if i so something like the below the errno will be set to the last error if any and not the error of the last query

319433
png	gif
for illustrations that contains large areas of the same color using a lossless compression format like png or gif will be the best approach

319433
png	gif
although not technically correct you can think of png and gif will compress repetitions the same color very well similar to run-length encoding rle

319433
png	gif
paul points out that png compresses static line art better than gif for nearly every situation

319506
any	set
i didn t set any special parameters just -xmx800m or -xmx1000m

319512
databound	gridview
on the page the gridview is databound to a dataset so i do not know at design time what columns will be present in my gridview

319514
driver	kernel
to help you looking at how the linux kernel does it while each driver can do its own thing there is a generic version which is supposed to be used when the chip follows the standard closely enough generic media independent interface device support

319533
space	input
given that this chip has 6 adc channels most likely you are using rs-232 serial comm a guess from your question and of course the limited code space defining a simple command structure will help as adam points out -- you may wish to keep the input processing to a minimum at the chip so binary sounds attractive but the trade off is in ease of development and servicing you may have to trouble shoot a dead input 6 months from now -- hyperterminal is a powerful debugging tool -- so that got me thinking of how to implement a simple command structure with good reliability

319546
order	add
first add an internal constructor to order

319551
32-bit	64bit
you could do something simple as having the random number as a 64bit integer with the upper 32-bit containing the timestamp at row insert and the lower 32-bit the user_id

319570
execute	prepare
you should be using mysql_real_escape_string or a prepare execute pair instead of mysql_escape_string and it should be where your sql is being assembled not where you are retrieving value off the url

319578
click	mouse
it automated a small part of the app by moving the mouse to appropriate button menus and click them so the user can watch

319582
project-management	project
project that are in trouble but are salvageable get the project-management focus early when it can do some good

319600
salt	md5
generate the md5 s of the first 10 millions of numbers expressed as strings +some salt

319608
put	get
this means that the arrays will cease to exist when the current scope ends which to put it simply means when you get to the enclosing close-curly so for example return does it

319612
32-bit	64bit
recall that .net code is jited just in time compiled -- meaning 32-bit and 64bit code out of a c# or vb.net compiler is the same no matter what architecture you plan to run on

319613
docking	toolbar
a qmainwindow is just a qwidget which provides a menu bar toolbar status bar and docking framework

319613
toolbar	tabs
the windows with the tabs would not need to be a qmainwindows unless you want to also want add a toolbar to that windows as well

319618
ubuntu	debian
the line of code was removed because of the warning anyway and that s why debian and ubuntu users had to update their ssl keys last may after the line was added back in hopefully with a more strongly-worded comment

319629
pointers	stack
for completeness i ll point out that the pointers to the object called myobject note there is no does reside on stack the way you declared it

319629
pointers	stack
since stack variabless go out of scope when you leave a function you must delete the object before returning or transfer the pointers to another variables with a longer lifetime

319629
pointers	stack
neglecting to delete a heap object whose pointers is in a stack variables before returning from a function is sort of the canonical memory leak scenario though far from the only one

319640
click	mouse
move the mouse over where the menu is and then click

319668
attributes	properties
other attributes might mark certain properties as non-serializable and these would be automatically omitted from the serialization object

319677
color-picker	hsl
if you want a blend that looks anything like most color-picker gui widget you really want to translation to hsl or hsv

319678
specifications	w3c
the problem is that innerhtml is an unofficial property that is not part of the w3c specifications and thus may or may not work depending upon the browser especially when the page is being rendering as a xhtml file rather than a html file

319693
32-bit	64bit
in c++ a long_ptr is 32-bits on a 32-bit system and 64bits on a 64bit system see here

319696
boolean	int
but i don t understand how boolean algebra works with int in c# at the least

319705
multiple-files	large-files
it s old but effective works with extremely large-files and multiple-files

319707
boolean	int
the key is that the cpu is doing 32 boolean operations in parallel one for each bit position of the input int assuming 32-bit int of course

319712
any	set
upgrading the client side of things should be a low concern anyways just make a backup of your working copy perform the upgrade and if you do have problems checkout the project into a new folder move any changed files in and your all set

319727
javascript-engine	spidermonkey
the framework should be usable within an desktop-application embedding a javascript-engine such as spidermonkey or javascriptcore so no external dependency are allowed

aggregate	grouping
the client messages are aggregate into groupinging to send to an exchange over a smaller number of outbound socket connections and acknowledgment messages are sent back to the clients as each grouping is processed by the exchange. os is windows-server 2003 hardware is 2 x 4-core x5355

319742
attributes	properties
other attributes might mark certain properties as non-serializable and these would be automatically omitted from the serialization object

319755
callgrind	valgrind
valgrind callgrind with kcachegrind as a viewer is a good choice as strager said

319761
javascript	dom
edit if by asking for a framework you also mean helpful libraries that don t use the dom you might be interested in functional javascript

319772
attributes	properties
unfortunately with partial classes you cannot add attributess to a member from another part of the partial class - if sqlmetal defines properties foo you can t add an attributes to foo in your own half of the .cs

319803
ref	out
cases where you would absolutely need to define your delegation types include methodss that accept more than 4 arguments methodss with out ref or params parameters or recursive methods signatures delegation foo foo foo f

319820
groovy	java
gradle and gant are build tools in the groovy space that have a lot to offer even for straight-up java projects

319827
contains	any
a comment starts and ends with -- and does not contains any occurrence of --

319884
implements	extends
if it implements an interface or extends an existing class you can access the members defined in the interface or base-class

319888
autotools	gnu
to throw in a third option you could use gnu autotools

319894
deployment	install
only need to replace a single configuration file inside a compressed msi the target user can be assumed to already have orca install know how to use this to customize the property table to embed license details for gpo deployment and have generated an mst file

319900
perl	ruby
q why should i use perl instead ruby or python

319901
integer	zero
according to work underway toward the revision of iso c the preferred algorithm for integer division follows the rules defined in the iso fortran standard iso iec 1539 1991 in which the quotient is always rounded toward zero

319902
hash	md5
you can always use a hashing function md5 or sha1 for your data and then compare the hash

319903
exception-handling	try-catch
do a try-catch if the exception-handling is that a transaction has already started based on error code or the message of the string whatever carry on

319915
webserver	upload
it works fine locally but when i upload to the remote webserver i get a 404 when trying to reference the above page

319919
put	get
in fact when and if you choose to get your application symbian signed you may or may not be required to put such a confirmation box during installation

319939
rollback	commit
i know some frameworks try to do it and do cockamamie things like count how many times you ve begun a transaction only resolving it when you ve done commit or rollback a matching number of times

319939
rollback	commit
but this is totally bogus because none of your functions can know if commit or rollback will actually do it or if they re in another layer of nesting

319939
decrement	increment
beginning a transaction only increment a counter and commit rollback decrement the counter

319939
rollback	commit
if i call commit or rollback when there is no transaction active it sets the to -1

319939
decrement	increment
subsequent calls to commit will just decrement the transaction to -1 or further and you ll never be able to commit until you do another superfluous begintransaction to increment the level again

319987
communication	messages
of course i can code some kind of messages that communication both apps but my question is if exists that mechanism some kind of ultra-trigger that warns the other app in sql-server or in any api for accessing sql-server native ole db or even odbc

320000
negative-number	digits
hexadecimal is not or should not be any different from decimal to represent a negative-number you need to write a negative sign followed by the digits representing the absolute value

320008
kdevelop	anjuta
if you are looking for a programming environment more like visual-studio there are many good graphical ide s you can use such as netbeans eclipse code blocks kdevelop anjuta etc

320032
32-bit	64bit
my guess is that ecipher.init is throwing an exception-handling because you re providing a 32-bit iv instead of 64bit

320058
filesystems	fat
edit wow the filesystems isn t fat i was wrong

320077
boolean	int
the columns i m using are pretty standard columns mainly text int and boolean type columns

320077
boolean	int
the columns i m using are pretty standard columns mainly text int and boolean type columns

320079
any	set
this button is a built-in overlay that is provided by the uitextfield class but as of the iphone os 2.2 sdk there isn t any way to set it via interface builder

320085
bugzilla	trac
it does this by making tasks a first class part of eclipse and integration rich and offline editing for repositories such as bugzilla trac and jira

320090
selected	button
move into the libraries tab and selected the add variable... button

320099
children	nodes
i m not sure if you can reduce the overhead much on a full in-order traversal of a tree if you use recursion the call stack will grow some otherwise you must manually use a stack to push references of the children while visiting each nodes

320099
linked-list	tree
if you don t care about the order you visit the nodes some implementations of tree is actually stored in a dynamic arrays or linked-list or stack wich you can traverse linearly if you don t care about the order it s traversed

320099
linked-list	tree
if you often need full in-order traversal but few searches and insertions deletions an ordered linked-list might be best if searching is what you do most you use a tree

320115
bugzilla	trac
if you want to tracking a todo-list among a couple of developer you really want to use a issue-trackinging system such as bugzilla trac or jira

320130
perl	php
i wrote my own not open frameworks in perl and in php

320130
perl	php
well php has a builtin deadend and the whole infrastructure is still quite poor but i did not want to go back to perl so i checked python and the python web frameworks like django turbogears pylon and web2py

320130
web2py	django
just look at the comparison on web2py site - i was wondering why python frameworks like django or turbogears had to introduce such redundance and complicated syntax in their code - web2py shows that it is in fact possible to keep your syntax clean and easy

320140
directory	folder
this creates a .git hidden folder in the current directory

320161
dialog	pop-up
a dialog will pop-up confirming the lock release

320181
base-class	subclass
however if you want to change a class which is already being used as a base-class for some other type you risk breaking the subclass when you change the base-class

320182
implements	abstract
for example the factory-pattern and the abstract factory-pattern offer a blueprint for implements designs to overcome common problems with instantiating objects

320182
contains	elements
it will contains the controllers some gui elements and base classes which we can extend to create our model and business logic

320196
overlapping	padding
if in the so example you want to stop it overlapping the padding you d probably have to create another div inside the padding to hold your content

320197
internet-explorer	firefox
unfortunately the tag doesn t work in all browsers only firefox and internet-explorer and opera with a css trick

320204
put	get
you need to place listeners and update messages but i don t have a clue where to put these how to get access from one panel to the other and maybe if necessary to introduce a datamodel class

320211
e-commerce	product
a good and flexible database schema illustrating e-commerce product and their rates management is required

320217
32-bit	64bit
maybe you used a 32-bit 1.5 jvm and a 64bit 1.6 jvm

320217
32-bit	64bit
you can find out whether it is a 32-bit or a 64bit jvm with

320217
32-bit	64bit
a 64bit jvm needs roughly 30 more memory compared with a 32-bit jvm since you need 8 bytes for each reference instead of 4 bytes

320231
google-chrome	firefox
browsers and search engines are smart enough to ignore this character when searching text and google-chrome and firefox haven t tested others ignore it when copying text to clipboard

320231
google-chrome	firefox
fyi there s also css hyphens auto supported by latest ie firefox and safari but currently not google-chrome

320240
arrays	loops
this isn t quite polished - i got into an infinite loops i think when i tried to pass an 18-item arrays in with 10 sublists

320244
assign	add
you could add a little extra slack on the next iteration to fix bugs that haven t been reported yet by assign slightly less work than a full iteration s worth for every developer

320245
environment	building
it seems a little weird that it is warning about different architectures when looking for developer sdks macosx10.4u.sdk while linking - can you give us some more detail about your building environment versioning of xcode gcc python path etc

320250
having	select
i am using the min and max functions to do this within the select but i m having lots of problems

320252
lookup	any
i can t think of any big algorithmic improvements but a simple micro-optimization you can make is to bind frequently called methods such as stack.append stack.pop to locals this saves a dictionary lookup

320252
children	nodes
this gives a small 15 speedup by my tests using 100 traversals of an 8-deep tree with 4 children at each nodes gives me the below timings

320273
lisp	tcl
if it s a choice between tcl and lisp i d go for tcl every time

320309
triggers	insert
in a database you could triggers on update insert and then call your external code to do something

320312
lisp	tcl
i d choose tcl over lisp anyday if a broader target for your application is in question

320316
interpreter	runtime
dsls especially internal dsls basically let it open to be interpreter executed at runtime

320329
for-loop	loops
also when the for-loops terminates the while loops in your original example will also terminate because there s no change to the empty stack after the for-loops

320332
interpreter	runtime
dsls especially internal dsls basically let it open to be interpreter executed at runtime

320363
xsd	xml
you might also be interested in this article about generating an xsd from an xml file

320365
contains	elements
for the elements that contains the text you want to wrap

320366
build-process	ant
we could manage the build-process outside of vs using jam or ant say but this is not the preffered solution

320366
msbuild	nant
a number of solutions spring to mind - auto-generate nant scripting from the solition in a pre-build step probably the least work but still not ideal replace cl.exe and link.exe with stub apps use msbuild but this is geared towards .net development and not native code write a custom vs plugins lots of work - any pointers to an existing one either commercial or open soruce would be good

320395
any	set
for printing i don t set any width and remove any obstacles which keep your print layout from having a dynamic width

320406
firefox	safari
as of december 2011 we now have another option with the emerging support of these tags in firefox and safari

320406
mobile-safari	safari
i ve done some basic testing and it seems to work on a recent version of mobile-safari and safari 5.1.1

320429
lightbox	jquery
another perhaps far more complete than lightbox even if it ok i recommend overall if your not using jquery or any other library

320436
updating	updates
i want to updates this code using a far smaller alias of some kind the problem is however that i want to change the underlying reference and have the alias updates also without explicitly updating the alias

320451
getter	setter
now you can use getter and setter to read and write the long identifier

320454
hide	show
when someone click on athumbnail change the class on the corresponding div to show the correct image and hide all the others

320499
getter	setter
the compiler seems to generate a class called bindableproperty for each class which contains the getter and setter

320499
getter	setter
in question 3 i asked about binding to static functions but i actually meant static getter and setter functions

320503
conditional	operators
i prefer using conditional and or operators when needed instead of nested ifs

320515
put	get
the result is that any arrayslist you try to copy into the arrays would get sliced only the initial part of its representation is put in the arrays

320538
jqmodal	jquery
suppose i have a page with a listview and i want to select filters for it perhaps with multiple selection from a list so i make a different aspx and open it using jquery actually jqmodal via ajax the user selects the filters and accepts

320562
pointers	stack
to allocate on stack you need the alloca allocation function which essentially just increments stack pointers

320576
multiplying	division
if so then one could simplify a division by making the second arguments into its reciprocal and then multiplying

320576
subtraction	addition
apart from that multiplication is addition done more than once and division is subtraction done more than once

320585
autotools	gnu
do not use gnu autotools - that way madness lies

320593
business-process	bpm
i want to know when and how you should use a bpm tool how do you differentiate business-process from application workflow

320596
.when	ready
.when you re ready make the required hacks to fix ie

320610
constructor	private
but instead of using an interface use a final class with a private constructor

320619
firefox	opera
for other browsers opera safari galeon... the design under firefox will work fine

320644
json	xml
towards the second half of create rest api using asp.net-mvc that speaks both json and plain xml to quote

320644
json	xml
now we need to accept json and xml payload delivered via http post

320644
json	xml
so they can upload objects using either json or xml format

320644
json	xml
there s no native support in asp.net-mvc to automatically parse posted json or xml and automatically map to action parameters

320660
windows-xp	windows
ssoption sets it background to the windows button face on windows-xp

320669
conditional	operators
but you need the state of both the conditional to do something then you can go with the operators

320690
any	set
however if you have a component that you are not going to need later you can set any references to that component to null

320692
contains	elements
if a primitive elements is specified inside a primitive-list elements then it should contains the name attributes and the embedded definition elements but not the ref attributes

320692
contains	elements
if a primitive elements is specified in the composite elements then it should contains either the ref attributes or the definition elements

320693
revision	svn
is it possible to checkout only those files from a svn repository that were modified in a revision or range of revision without checking out any files that were not modified

320702
bug-tracking	workitem
it also gives you workitem bug-tracking productivity reports application lifecycle management to a degree etc

320715
minimum	max
if setminthreads is first set to the minimum number so in my case 2 then we are able to set the max number of threads to a value less than 8

320721
any	set
find all paths if any that pass through all of a set of n nodes all items sent via smtp from example.com

320726
switching	screens
nvu is pretty nice and lets you quickly switching between html source and view screens

320761
authentication	login
after login delphi code doublechecks if it is still authentication

320761
denied	temp
filemon shows c windows temp temporary internet files access denied

320774
precompiled-headers	stdafx.h
when using precompiled-headers all the include and #defines are ignored up to the stdafx.h

320812
project-management	project
certain free paid project-management sites are perfect for modern day small project like or and have built-in support for svn

320820
swing	awt
however awt and swing objects allocate some amount of native resources that need to be freed

320834
ironpython	ironruby
there are other .net languages which are amenable to scripting - there are the dynamic languages such as ironruby and ironpython and also boo mostly static but with duck-typing where you want it

320838
common-lisp	scheme
common-lisp and scheme are not purely functional

320845
msbuild	nant
i m running msbuild from a nant scripting

320845
msbuild	nant
what is the problem with using the nant scripting to run msbuild to register the assembly

320850
button	popup
in the javascript function which closes the popup fake a click on that button

320859
rounding	currency
the key is that the scale of the rounding behavior is determined by the maximum fractional digits used by the locale s currency

320864
sql-server	ms-access
if not then is it possible with ms-access and ms sql-server in particular

320878
put	get
i don t like these answers where you google for like 5 seconds and then just suggest a solution the real challenge is to put all the pieces together and not have to waste your time with tons of sample-less msdn pages or other coding forums in order to get your answer

320900
user-controls	ascx
i understand that you can now create asp.net-mvc-specific user-controls but will my existing standard ascx user-controls work in an asp.net-mvc view

320919
contains	set
there are then almost 70 update statements to the temp table over almost 500 lines of code that each contains their own little set of business rules

320928
revision	svn
presumably you could also use the svn etc revision to flag a build error is an instance file is older than a base file but we haven t implemented anything that clever yet

320944
haskell	erlang
its very easy to write multithreaded code in f# haskell erlang ocaml etc because data structures and values in these languages are immutable meaning that you can t modify a variable once it has been assigned

320953
perl	ruby
if your robot can be controlled using a scripting language python ruby perl whatever then i think that would be a much better choice

320960
updating	updates
also if you do lots of writes like updating rows in a loop you should look into putting all those writes into a transaction - while the file is locked once the transaction hits a write query the updates themselves take much less time because they re written to the file at once and not individually

320961
selected	textbox
line of business uis that have logic such as when comboa is selected query for values based on that selection and populate textbox b or when buttonc is pressed disable textbox c and d and on and on .

320963
linux	unix
we also telnet out from finalbuilder to a number of other platforms unix linux openvms and start remote builds by running makefiles there

320965
32-bit	16-bit
then the compiler itself would complain if you used one in place of the other even if in reality each was just a plain old 16-bit eventually 32-bit int value

320975
continuous-integration	nant
in addition we use cruisecontrol.net nant and msbuild for continuous-integration after comitting code to the repository

320981
linux	bsd
extract linux mac bsd

320997
slidedown	slideup
i know jquery has slideup and slidedown

320999
postback	ajax
i wish to execute a javascript function after asp.net postback with out using ajax

321036
cursor	row
or how can reduce the number of locks it takes for one single row update without using cursor

321038
32-bit	64bit
nothing in the command java -version tells me that it is the 64bit version nor the 32-bit is there any more specific way to check if its the 64bit version although i think it s not

321038
environment	building
java tm se runtime environment building 1.6.0_07-b06

321038
environment	building
java tm 2 runtime environment standard edition building 1.5.0_16-b02

321050
revision	svn
assuming you have an existing workingcopy you should just use svn update on the root of the directory containing the files you are looking at as that retrieves exactly what changed between your current revision and the head revision with the least data possible

321054
webforms	asp.net
since you are probably using webforms it would be hard to migrate to asp.net mvc but you could implement mvp pretty easily into existing apps

321057
any	set
dynamic scoping makes scope follow the runtime stack which means that the set of symbols in scope is much larger and far from obvious at the point of any symbol usage

321074
any	set
if i want to set up a windows inside that display then i can add that windows to the variables stack that otherwise specifies the display and any graphic operations performed while in this state will go to the windows rather than the display as a whole

321095
vb.net	vb6
i m trying to write a print layout editor in vb6 or vb.net and am looking for some reference articles to help get me started

321095
alignment	layout
because it s a layout for a printed form i think that cuts down the complexity quite a lot - i only really need to store size and position of each print area along with font alignment and colour information and possibly a filename for a graphic if a logo is required

321096
order	add
if i m using an arraylist in c#.net is the order guaranteed to stay the same as the order i add items to it

321122
include	ssi
i thought i needed to enable ssi because one of the htm files i was looking at was using include

321127
procedure	records
what i d like to do is be able to create a cross reference table or procedure if it is efficient enough so that when i submit a query for a card i can find all the ruling records that directly reference the card through the id and get all of the ruling records where the card name is referenced in the text

321134
children	tree
this recursively depth-first walks the entire tree including children

321139
double	int
however the input object is often a double and the type some variation of int uint long etc.

321143
any	set
are there any set of guidelines or best practices that you would recommend when writing a macros

321147
arguments	default
that default property takes an arguments list

321151
put	get
in the expansion put parenthesis around the arguments so that if they pass in a expression you will get the intended behavior

321158
png	gif
i m reading all the files in a single directory and i want to filtering on jpg jpeg gif and png

321194
triggers	insert
then create an insert and update triggers that maintains this table

321196
cvs	git
i ve read that it s fairly easy to use git locally with a remote cvs server and that git is fast

321200
firefox	opera
else if e.which netscape firefox opera

321203
reflection.emit	dynamicmethod
i am trying to generate some code at runtime using the dynamicmethod class in the reflection.emit namespace but for some reason its throwing a verificationexception

321217
linux	unix
unix and linux are built with this

321217
innodb	myisam
innodb_file_per_table makes innodb tables act like myisam tables

321221
parentheses	macros
use parentheses around the entire macros and around each argument referred to in the expansion list

321245
ebnf	bnf
i m new to bnf so approximately what sort of conversion will i have to do to convert bnf to ebnf

321245
ebnf	bnf
i believe it should be pretty simple since tinypg needs regexp + ebnf in comparison to the gold grammars which are regexp + bnf

321267
csv	xml
my program receives large csv files and transforms them to xml files

321280
object-oriented-database	rdbms
i ve found databases typically come in two flavors your traditional row-oriented rdbms or an object-oriented-database oodbms

321287
teamcity	msbuild
the only additional work on our end is registering the new computers with the teamcity server and installing msbuild and subversion

321293
packets	ping
when validating ping echo s it seems that utilities libraries often only check the checksum of the packets and don t actually confirm that the payload sent out matches the payload that was returned

321296
stax	sax
if it is just record by record processing then event oriented sax or stax parsing will be the way to go

321300
host	dns
you ll have to setup proper dns routing for the sub domain as well as a virtual host

321327
contains	set
if a validation exception-handling is set - the user-interface is showing a red border around the user-interface element with the validation problem and the contains panels is collapsed the red border is still displayed

321338
ebnf	bnf
you write ebnf to describe the language of your choice here are some freely available bnf grammers that describe modern programming languages c java javascript c# vb.net sql-89

321350
wamp	php
it lets you run a wamp stack off of a cd complete with mysql php apache support

321351
contains	elements
question 2 if a constructor must be specified on the base structure how can a union be implemented to contains that elements and ensure a 0 initialized base elements

321354
cobertura	emma
code coverage tools such as emma cobertura and clover will instrumentation your code and record which parts of it gets invoked by running a suite of tests

321373
unit-testing	expectations
my million dollar question is this is it necessary i set expectations for all of my events via setup or is there something that i m missing not understanding about how unit-testing or rhinomocks works

321428
cvs	git
we basically use the master branch in git as a single updated cvs version of the code

321435
double	int
i have only tested it for double floats and int

321437
return-value	arguments
the only compiler optimization that could cause havok would be for the compiler to figure out that you re calling the methods twice with the same arguments and just reuse the first return-value - which is fine as long as the function truly is logically const and returns the same value for a given set of arguments and object state

321441
build-process	teamcity
and if you want to automate the build-process there are some great tools like teamcity and bamboo

321455
arrays	loops
so load the list into an arrays at the top of the procedure loops through this list and use utl_file to output each row on a line by line basis

321474
arrays	loops
all you need to do is loops through your arrays of table names and call tom s procedure for each

321479
exception-handling	try-catch
don t waste your time coding low-level exception-handling management use an higher-level api like spring-jdbc or a custom wrapper around connection statement rs objects to hide the messy try-catch ridden code

321482
python	java
it s primarily for c++ java python those are the languages supported by google but there are ongoing efforts to port it to other languages including c

321484
binaries	install
and using the standalone maven binaries to install the jar into my maven repository

321496
32-bit	64bit
is there any way to configure sql-server 2000 standard edition 32-bit to use more than 2gb of memory on a server running windows 2003 64bit

321502
python	ruby
currently i m torn between using directly my build tool phing with some special deployment test tasks or shell scripts or a scripting language like ruby or python

321520
scriptaculous	jquery
but look at mootools scriptaculous jquery and yui animation

321540
ruby	php
phing can do everything shell python ruby scripts can do and can be extended in php which is its major draw for php developers

321540
ruby	php
why would you want to use ruby python if you are a php developer

321552
mediawiki	trac
trac and mediawiki would be my top two picks depending on whether or not you wanted ticketing integrated

321552
redmine	trac
redmine is another good pick - i don t love it quite as well as trac but it s much easier to set up on the shared host where i keep my project management tools

321561
version-control	git
my company started recently to use git for source version-control and due to the incompetence of the coders - that s me and my boss -p - we have a really nice spaghetti of files being overwritten here and there

321561
updating	updates
is there a way to mark certain files as untouchable so if when updating a branch from another either do es n t overwrite the file s or doesn t do the updates at all

321571
jquery	.post
i d love it if i could get this into jquery - but i m having trouble with the call see my other .post below

webforms	asp.net
i have a site that i am currently working on in asp.net 2.0 using the usual webforms stuff and asp.net ajax 1.0

321585
webforms	asp.net
this is my first asp.net web application and need some help figuring out the best way to make this happen i m well versed in php django and the usual ways to do webforms - things like having multiple forms on one page o_o

321587
hash	md5
the php md5 function returns a hexadecimal string i.e a476c3... which you are chopping down to the key size while evp_bytestokey is a fairly complicated hash routine that return a raw byte string

321587
hash	md5
it might with the parameters supplied simplify down to a raw md5 hash but i can t really tell

321587
hash	md5
if you change the php to md5 thisismykey true that will give you a raw md5 hash

321608
order	add
you have to add the controls before page.load in order to maintain viewstate between postback so use the oninit event handler for that

321614
xcopy	cmd
i m running an xcopy cmd in a batch script which copies a file to a shared drive on another workstation

321626
contains	any
that the browser opening the document supports the document.images portion of the dom that the document contains any images and the browser s useragent string an identifier contains mozilla 2.

321628
innodb	myisam
depending on your usage patterns and schema you can get fragmented pages in innodb and i think in myisam also

321628
innodb	myisam
see the mysql docs on optimize table for some good info on both myisam and innodb

321628
innodb	myisam
i m not as familiar with myisam intricacies but with innodb it is true that statistics can get out of date

321642
json	xml
for example getting xml data and transfer it to json for use on a web-page

321642
json	xml
cpan json xml simple

321650
value	field
how do i compile a lambda expression to set the field on the target parameter to value

321685
debugging	trace
as an example assume that a dump method changes some internal variable -state value- and that during debugging the user of your class decides to dump your object at a given point your class will behave differently with trace than without perfect debugging nightmare

321687
aggregate	grouping
i need to aggregate the data between a defined start and end time into x grouping representing time intervals of equal length where x is supplied as function parameter

321736

321736
any	set
any idea how i can set the dpi

321742
fogbugz	svn
as well if you use a tool like fogbugz you can link an svn checkin to a case number

321744
jquery	.post
ok i have taken this one step farther and modified my jquery file to load the additional parameter into the .post data so i don t have to repeat the __jqueryasync.post true for every call to .post

321774
internet-explorer	firefox
i can access these same sites with no problems in both firefox and internet-explorer

321782
private-members	instances
instances of the same class can access private-members of other instances

321786
contains	any
is there any way to make sure that a table and cells it contains have a border only when the cells are not empty

321805
document	element
what if i had a document that had multiple elements with the same name -- how would i retrieve for instance the second element

321807
getter	setter
the compiler will pick up the bindable metadata tag and will create a getter and setter for each property you marked as bindable

321807
getter	setter
the same as for instances properties basically only now a static getter and setter are created

321811
compatibility	platform
if you are aiming for cross platform compatibility better use boost date_time which has sophisticated functions for this

321824
selected	cells
if you selected all your cells which you can do using a css selectedor and add a change hook to run some function you write called updateborder or some such you should be good

321827
anonymous-class	lambda
as long as the lambda did not force the compiler to generate an anonymous-class everything works fine

321844
telnet	ssh
the beauty is that if you later decide to swap it out to ssh or anything more secure than telnet you can with little pain

321860
contains	elements
by this point in the scripting i already have the list of files contains the elements i wish to remove so the single file can be used as a parameter

321860
document	element
in the same document there are many elements named element i wish for these to remain

321863
perl	ruby
1-3 there is no one obvious choice of packaging build documenting system such as perl s cpan pod or ruby s gem rake rdoc

321863
ironpython	cpython
5 jython ironpython cpython are incompatible

321864
dynamic-binding	overrides
the latter case is obvious enough and with the former case even though t1 has a reference of type object it is instantiated as type test so dynamic-binding should call the overrides form of the methods

321889
constructor	object
a union shall not be used as a base class.an object of a class with a non-trivial constructor 12.1 a non-trivial copy constructor 12.8 a non-trivial destructor 12.4 or a non-trivial copy assignment operator 13.5.3 12.8 cannot be a member of a union nor can an arrays of such objects

321900
administration	account
i am logged in as administration account in my xp with sp2 machine running vs.net 2005

321909
serialization	casting
casting an integer value known at runtime to enum might be helpful if you have serialization data

321923
groovy	java
i have read in a couple of places that this is considered harmful as programmers expect groovy to do the java thing

321939
authentication	impersonation
i have configured iis and asp.net to require windows authentication and impersonation

321966

how do i use gdb to debugging a program which do not have debuggingging symbols on a 32-bit x86 processor

321989
any	set
where the gld is the greatest linear distance of any pair of points in the set

321991
javascript	dom
i d like to embed a browsing engine html javascript css dom in my desktop applications

322021
document	element
selected any element in the document that is named element has an attributes name with value same and this element is the second such child of its parent

322057
icmp	tcp
are you looking at the tcp checksum or the icmp checksum

322057
icmp	tcp
the icmp checksum doesn t include the tcp headers only the icmp type code checksum and data fields

322057
icmp	tcp
a tcp checksum failure doesn t necessarily mean the icmp contents aren t intact it could just mean that the tcp headers were messed with by a broken nat perhaps

322065
python	java
qt is highly optimised cross-platform yet native-looking usable from c++ java and python and includes webkit

322068
selected	button
what is the best way to implement a 2d grid of radio button so that only one option in each column and one option in each row can be selected

322071
getter	setter
we re using nhibernate and traced some issues with lazy-loading to properties that were only half overridable - virtual getter but private setter

322083
arcgis	ogr
the tools i work with most often are arcgis and gdal ogr with some dabbling in qgis and grass

322086
constructor	private
i was wondering if it is possible to declare an arrays size not known at this time as a private member of a class and later set the size in the constructor of the class

322088
required	checked
the only thing checked the xml data is going to find for you is if your serialization is emitting a superset of what the deserialization required and the deserialization silently ignore stuff it doesn t expect

322100
solaris	linux
see setting the class path solaris and linux vs setting the class path windows

322110
execution	exit
once the program has finished execution the user should remain at gdb s prompt until s he explicitly exit it

322120
output	cat
so you can use anything that produces output and pipe that into gdb instead of the cat command here

322133
command-prompt	cmd
if you want to leave it at the command-prompt after running those cmd you can do

322133
stdin	pipe
this results in echoing the commands to gdb and then you type into the cat process which copies its stdin to stdout which is pipe into gdb

322145
arguments	default
you can use the default allocator by stripping the second templates arguments

322153
parentheses	operators
you have to put parentheses around iter since the member-access operators binds thighter otherwise

322153
void	main
on a side-node make your main function return int instead of void

322166
swing	swt
gecko is not written in java nor embedded in awt swing swt at least without using jni

322183
google-chrome	firefox
it was then stated that this advantage only applies to ie because ie interprets javascript which is inefficient when compared to that of other browsers such as google-chrome and firefox which compile javascript to machine code before execution and as such perform as well as silverlight

322183
google-chrome	firefox
do will silverlight and javascript have comparable performance on google-chrome and firefox

322214
any	set
i personally haven t used dielevel but apparently when it s set to a value greater than zero it can force stack unwinding and tends to hopelessly destroy any program that takes its exception-handling seriously. quote from here

322234
dynamic-binding	overrides
java uses static binding for overloaded methods and dynamic-binding for overrides ones

322237
udp	tcp
a server can listen on tcp or udp sockets with some restrictions

322237
telnet	ftp
sending 100 bytes can be done using a lot of available protocols echo telnet ftp http to name a few

322241
udp	tcp
udp doesn t provide the safety that tcp does but doesn t require a response but such responses are part of their protocols not yours

322254
python	perl
is there an easy way to do this in c python perl or bash

322254
keyboard	mouse
update to clarify the question above it s a machine with multiple users but who use it sequentially via the plugged in keyboard mouse

322262
unmanaged	c++-cli
can you sign a c++-cli application that is partially managed and partially unmanaged

322264
dialog	pop-up
this needs to behave exactly the same way modal dialogs behave in the win forms world meaning not just simulating a pop-up but halting code execution and returning to the code when the modal dialog is closed

322265
constructor	object
it should definitely help spread out your load on this object away from a front-loaded constructor

322277
nlb	iis
we have set up a 2 cluster nlb on windows-server 2003 with iis 6

322280
32-bit	64bit
we re running the same versions of everything the only change was moving from a windows-server 2003 32-bit box to a windows-server 2003 64bit box

322280
32-bit	64bit
the reason i suspect the 64bit vs 32-bit issue is that i saw numerous posts on the subject in various forums

322285
icmp	tcp
the icmp checksum doesn t include the tcp headers only the icmp type code checksum and data fields

322286
initializer	getter
just to clarify if you mean initializer the classes on the getter of their accessor then yes this is a fine approach - referred to as lazy-loading

322318
postback	ajax
rather than postback and rebind the entire page each time i would like to do it via jquery ajax selectively for the control in question

322330
execute	prepare
the scenario in which you would get benefit from a prepared query is when you prepare it and execute it many times during the same php request

322350
virtualization	vmware
note there are some specialty virtualization products out there that are made for databases that might be worth looking into instead of a general product like vmware

322350
enterprise	platform
hp polyserve s unique shared data architecture delivers enterprise class availability and virtualization-like flexibility in a utility platform

322354
keyboard	mouse
i just recently wrote a delphi class to calculate the difference rectangles of two images and was quite suprised by how fast it ran - fast enough to run in a short timer and after mouse keyboard messages for recording screen activity

322368
google-chrome	firefox
at that with resent developments in javascript implemented in google-chrome and in the yet to be fully released firefox 3.1 one may want do do some benchmarking of their own

322386
silverlight	wpf
i think that silverlight adoption will eventually drive wpf adoption back on the desktop - or maybe there won t be a desktop as much of what can be accomplished with silverlight will replace many previously desktop applications

322397
directory	folder
support for renaming a file or moving it to a new folder directory is terrible and painful if using the visual-studio p4 plugins integration

322397
continuous-integration	build-process
if you use a continuous-integration build-process and you submit changes at any point prior to the last step you are guaranteed to have a broken build

322445
lookup	any
you are creating a normal b-tree on a hash value so the lookup time will be exactly the same as for any other b-tree index on a similar sized data type

322446
firefox	safari
my company makes its money off of a great user experience using ie6 7 firefox and safari

322471
attributes	properties
the target attributes is an ldap filtering which matches against the service properties

322481
document	editing
when editing an xml file in intellij-idea if the document references a schema idea will fetch the schema and use the information for autocomplete

322496
contains	elements
i have an xml file that i think is properly formed that contains a root entry that is and multiple elements

322497
contains	set
first create a text file that contains the perforce configuration variables you want to set for the project

322516
postgresql	mysql
if you have many reads over writes you may want to try mysql assuming that the problem is with postgresql but your problem is a write problem

322526
contains	set
however i m curious why a set of unrelated functions are all contains within the same module in the first place

322531
pixels	line
for me the single line was caused by a superfluous view that was created but never sized or placed correctly and so was 1 pixels high floating over everything else

322535
installation	environment
if that s not set then it uses the dir from the environment variables which is the directory of the tomcat installation

322553
uinavigationcontroller	uitableview
the layoutsubviews in the content view which contains the navigation bar and your uitableview of the uinavigationcontroller should be sizing the uitableview such that it doesn t overlap the navigation bar

322569
children	nodes
it copies any matched nodes unchanged and recursively applies templates to its attributes or children

322569
children	nodes
all it does is create an element named topics and inside it apply templates to all of the current nodes attributes and children

322610
business-process	bpm
i ve found more useful and rewarding to introduce bpm in companies that already have some formal business-process established already-

322610
integration	bpm
but when it comes to user systems integration bpm comes very handy

322610
business-process	bpm
so going back to your question and depending on the bpm tool capacities if there is already a business-process and that process requires interaction among users of different this is important areas and different systems it is worth to introduce the bpm

322610
integration	bpm
if the integration is more human oriented documents approvals etc app workflow will do or bpm used as workflow if they already have the tool

322610
business-process	integration
if the integration is amog users of the same area or the data is relatively easy to consume and nobody cares about the business-process ie

322630
mousedown	mouseup
i d advise using some methods for cross-browser event attachment - setting the mousedown and mouseup properties explicitly was done to simplify the example

322645
hide	show
there are so many options for chart type and then even more on subtyping i wouldn t want to have to rendering them all and then show or hide the right one

322659
webserver	host
the webserver is on a virtual host with a major isp

322687
order	join
selected articles.name articles.price users.zipcode from articles inner join users on users.id articles.user_id where vectors to_tsquery crime order by articles.price asc

322687
order	join
a article.find all conditions vectors to_tsquery crime join user order price include user

322694
lighttpd	apache
a lighttpd configuration would be likeso though apache nginx etc

322708
ip-address	hostname
be sure to lock down your virtual servers so that the image server and the app server are each only available from one particular hostname and the app server must not be accessible via ip-address

322714
knapsack-problem	np-hard
that is the decision versioning of this problem is the same as the decision versioning of the knapsack-problem although the optimization versioning of the knapsack-problem is usually stated differently. it is np-hard which means no algorithm is known that is polynomial in the size -- number of bits -- in the input

322722
linked-list	arrays
arrays vs arrayslist vs linked-list vs vector -- goes more in depth as does

322723
versioning	downgrade
there is no need to downgrade the entire php versioning just replace the libmysql.dll from the php 5.2.1 release things should be rolling refer this link for more info

322737
linked-list	queue
in addition to the other good arguments above you should notice arraylist implements randomaccess interface while linked-list implements queue

322742
linked-list	arrays
as with standard linked-list and arrays operations the various methods will have different algorithmic runtimes

322773
directory	folder
while you may perceive the filesystems as a hierarchy of folder containing folder it is actually a doubly linked tree 1 with directory being nodes and files being leafs

322797
32-bit	x86
i have an application that was developed for linux x86 32-bit

322797
g++	gcc
according to the article an introduction to gcc - for the gnu compilers gcc and g++ the problem is that gcc in x86_64 assumes fpmath sse while x86 assumes fpmath 387

322797
cos	sin
i can force -mfpmath 387 when compiling my own code and all my operations work correctly but whenever i call some library function sin cos atan2 etc. the results are wrong again

322827
onmousedown	onmouseup
incidentally ie has a feature useful in your case when other browsers send button only for mouse button events onclick onmousedown and onmouseup ie sends it with onmousemove too

322829
contains	any
that stage is the root node of a tree of display objects any of which can contains graphical assets lines text fields etc. or other display objects

322835
cargo	maven
i would like to call another maven plug-in in particular the cargo maven2 plug-in immediately after the custom ant plug-in successfully completes

322838
python	c++
if you re really asking what the best tool for the job is then you are going to have to give a little more detail than first small web project. if what you are asking is more along the lines of you want to learn web application development and what you already know is c++ and python so what would be a good web application stack where you can leverage your current skillset then here are some more suggestions

322839
value	field
simply i need to get how many times a search terms appear in the field value

322853
subtraction	multiplying
or as others have said if your values are like money in the sense that they re all a multiple of 0.01 or 0.001 or something then multiplying everything by a fixed power of 10 and use int or long addition and subtraction are trivial watch out for multiplication

322854
shared-objects	.so
the feature is specifically designed .so that one swf from a given domain can t delete shared-objects that belong to another swf unless you set it up that way

322861
web-applications	webserver
webserver often use the file extension if the file is served directly from disk to determine what content-type to assign but web-applications can also generate pages with any content-type they like in response to a request

322867
output	mode
alternatively you could rename the source from xyz.f77 xyz.f to xyz.c then run the c compiler in pre-processor only mode and capture the output as the new input to the f2c program

322869
triggers	insert
the basic idea i believe will be to introduce a new column with the proper width copy existing data to the new column implement a triggers to synchronize any new insert updates migrate your sp dal to use the new column then remove the old column when you are completely done

322872
xsl-fo	xslt
it contains xml definition files for docbook 4. 234 xsl-fo 1.0 xslt 1.0 relax ng 1.0 xml schemas 1.0 svg 1.1 xhtml 1.1 xinclude 1.0 and openoffice 1.0 xml format

322877
highlight	selected
notepad++ does it regardless of what language you re using if you selected any text it highlight similar text

322886
profiling	trace
have you run a profiling trace

322886
profiling	trace
fire up sql profiling and create a standard trace with these events added

322896
getter	setter
this if you find yourself in a situation that you have added lots of getter and setter you are probably doing something wrong anyway and shouldn t be using an anonymous-class

322907
multi-module	subproject
i have a multi-module maven project with an install subproject

322928
contains	elements
if you know that it is inside a table then you can simply get the row containing the elements clicked and iterate backwards through the rows of the table from that row until you find one that contains the elements desired

322929
firefox	opera
another problem is that zooming in firefox and opera can easily break this

322929
firefox	opera
word-wrap break-word - it s now part of css3 working draft but it s not supported by either firefox opera or safari yet

322953
selected	button
the button is disabled until a valid item is selected on the dropdownlist when i want to enable the button

322971
menuitem	button
i want to cast both menuitem objects and button control objects to an object type of whose tag property i can reference

322991
internet-explorer	firefox
word-wrap browser support isn t terrible all things considered safari internet-explorer and firefox 3.1 alpha build all support it src so we may not be all that far off

322996
menuitem	button
the inheritance path is different for menuitem and button there is no shared inherited tag property

322996
menuitem	button
menuitem inherits from menu which declares a tag property button inherits from control which also implements a tag propery

322996
menuitem	button
you should be able to cast both menuitem and button to component but this won t help you as the tag property is declared in the derived classes i mentioned menu and control

323000
scheme	lisp
learning lisp scheme may not give you any increased application space but it will help you get a better sense of functional programming its rules and its exception-handling

323022
constructor	private
when i create utility classes i typically create a class that has a private constructor and exposes all of it s methods and properties as static

323028
static-classes	inherited
static-classes are automatically sealed so people can t inherited and override their behavior

323028
constructor	private
so if you use a static class you save yourself the trouble of making the constructor private and declaring the class sealed

323030
constructor	private
a non-static class with a private constructor but all static-methods can be abused in various ways - inheritance reflection call the private constructor in a static factory - to instantiate the class

323030
static-class	inherited
you can t initializer a static-class or inherited from it

323031
python	java
if you really have large and complex data structures i d seriously consider another language like c++ java or python w numpy

323054
defined	declare
as we can see an abstract-class declare the structure of how bank account should be defined

323054
abstract-class	subclassing
in this subclassing checkingaccount we implemented the two abstract-class -- nothing too interesting here

323079
show	next
this isn t very useful for us since for one it runs the next day and secondly if it show bad results we don t have any indication why we may have had a problem the day before

323133
ruby-on-rails	rspec
coming from ruby on ruby-on-rails and rspec i need a tool like rspec easier transition

323150
primitive	int
as a base case a primitive to extract a single 8-bit int could look like this assuming an 8-bit char on the host machine you could add a layer of custom types to ensure that too if needed

323155
arguments	default
there is no need to create the arguments arrays or explicitly box the integer and new date uses the current time by default

323156
driver	kernel
in windows you can use a program to do it because someone wrote a program that inserts a device driver into the running kernel to do it

323186
append	input
if it did then the input data is obtained from the control and append to m_input

323191
environment	building
regarding the alternative toolchain saurik s site is useful but for latest firmware development he indicates building on the iphone itself and stays clear of indicating that you may need to copy necessary iphone firmware files to your linux environment

323191
packaging	building
i d suggest to still do the final building and code signing and packaging in xcode which may mean borrowing someone s mac in case you run into problems when submitting the application to apple

323192
value	field
the way it works in case you want to replicate it in another db or maybe if you just want to understand it is that for a table there is a shadow table created too just a normal database-table with the same field specs plus some extra fields like what action was last taken string typical value ins for insert upd for update and del for delete datetime for when the action took place and user id for who did it

323192
triggers	insert
through triggers every action to any row in the table insert a new row in the journal table with the new values what action was taken when and by what user

323202
plugins	add-on
i need some resources that talk about how to design your software to be extensible so that other people can write add-on plugins that adds functionality to it

323206
http	ssl
the entire text of an http session is secured by ssl

323208
vbscript	jscript
clearscript - makes v8 vbscript and jscript available to .net apps

323295
constructor	private
also i m going to go with the private constructor never being called by the static-methods

323311
methods	extend
explanation to encourage code reuse you should be able to extend existing classes and call their methods

323311
styledtext	swt
example i wanted to observe the positioning of the cursor caret in an swt styledtext

323342
order	add
i d like to sort on a column in the result of a stored procedure without having to add the order by clause in the stored procedure

323379
openssl	apr
for apr the command openssl ciphers will give you a list of all available openssl ciphers on your system

323388
udp	tcp
it would probably be another protocol over tcp but i see no reason why you cannot stream over udp

323389
keyboard	mouse
i know how to change the xaml to set the startpoint and endpoint of a lineargradient brush but i don t know how you do it using the ide in expression-blend - does anyone know the keyboard mouse actions that you use to do this

323394
rewrite	rule
try a tag-rewriting filtering implements either as a rewrite rule in a reverse-proxy or as a filtering servlet

323403
carbon	cocoa
is there a way to do this in cocoa carbon or applescript

323411
bugzilla	mantis
so bugzilla or mantis

323426
environment	execution
is it possible to escape or disable the evaluation of this environment variables while parsing execution this command

323429
bugzilla	trac
i have used both and didn t like them at all i prefer trac thou if you really need to choose between those two i d go for bugzilla

323459
having	select
i am having the same problem but am able to debugging if i go via the tools - attach to process menu then select the aspnet_wp process

323472
strong-typing	types
strong-typing means that you can t use one types of variables where another is expected or have restrictions to doing so

323480
hide	show
looking from the point of the user a typical user will do just fine with a standard menu whereas a more advanced user won t mind more advanced features like keyboard navigation or possibility to hide show the menu or dock it to the other side of the windows

323482
sql-server	oracle
sql does not really do recursive structures well although some systems such as oracle or sql-server have a recursive query function

323494
triggers	insert
using triggers we want to store every update insert and delete and attributes each to a particular user

323503
contains	any
the tree should only contains branches that lead to the current node page so using the above example any child items that item 1 or 3 have are not displayed

implements	abstract
in general interfaces describe the public api that your code should use whereas abstract base classes are best kept as an implementation detail where common code or state can be kept to reduce duplication in any implements classes

323532
implements	abstract
so java provides the list interface and the abstractlist abstract base-class to minimize the effort needed to implements the interface.

323538
gam	glm
it s very easy to take a number of say csv or excel files and merge them create new columns based on others and then throw that into a glm gam or some other model

323538
version-control	git
i m one of the only people in my department of 100 people using version-control in my case using git with githuib.com. this is rather worrying but they just don t seem to be keen on trying it out and are content with passing zip files around yuck.

323538
export	csv
my suggestion would be to continue using labview for the acquisition and perhaps trying to get your co-workers to agree on a toolset for acquisition and making is available for all and then move to export the data into a csv or similar and doing the analysis in r

323542
redmine	mantis
i think you ll find that your team will like either trac or redmine more than bugzilla or mantis

323580
put	get
put that same url in firefox 3 and i get the welcome screen of iis7 a big image with iis7 in the middle and welcome in several different languages

323602
vbscript	basic
this is vbscript and though i haven t tried to run it so it may contain errors it should give you the basic idea

323603
arrays	map
faced with this i decided to create an arrays to map the database columns to php variables so we can isolate the code from the madness

323629
arrays	loops
i want to catch it and ignore it and allow the loops to continue processing the next value in the arrays

323642
triggers	insert
from a triggers you can access 2 special tables insert and deleted

323642
triggers	insert
in the triggers sql you can take these modified rows and insert them into the audit table

323654
contains	any
use record headers which indicate the length and composition of the following data whether it s in the form of an arrays a list of identically-typed records references offsets to other records in the file or data blobs string data in a particular encoding but not contains any references

323660
conditional-compilation	compile-time
on the other hand if you specify a particular endianness for your files only applications on platforms with non-matching endiannes will have to do additional work and it can be decided at compile-time using conditional-compilation

323672
ip-address	hostname
another option is to retrieve the hostname ip-address selected host_name and store that instead

323672
triggers	insert
you wouldn t necessarily need a new parameter on each stored procedure as you can modify each stored procedure or the triggers to automatically insert the app_name hostname

323675
javadoc	doxygen
doxygen has a number of features that javadoc does not offer the class diagrams for the hierarchies and the cooperation context more summary pages optional source-code browsing cross-linked with the documentation additional tag support such as todo on a separate page and it can generate output in tex and pdf format.it also allows a lot of visual customization

323675
javadoc	doxygen
since doxygen supports the standard javadoc tags you can run doxygen on any source code with javadoc comments on it

323675
javadoc	doxygen
and since the javadoc tool ignores unknown tags you can even use additional doxygen tags without breaking javadoc generation

323679
prototyping	methodology
i m trying to get everyone on board and move to a model more centric on agile methodology and rapid prototyping

323685
restart	reload
for instances you ll need to restart the application-pool for every gac deploy - which means a pause of maybe 15-60 seconds to reload the application depending on the hardware

323736
vb.net	vb6
it can analyze c++ c c# vb.net java delphi visual basic vb6 or html

323747
put	get
note that i tend not to put the factory methods on the concrete exception-handling because they showup on derived classes which can get

323748
push	pull
push and pull changes

323748
push	pull
in an simplified way just do git push and git pull

323764
shell	bash
this also installs a cygwin bash shell so you can use the git in a nicer shell than cmd.exe and also includes git-gui accessible via git gui command or the menu

323764
ubuntu	debian
for example on debian or ubuntu

323764
linux	bsd
from source mac os x linux bsd etc.

323764
linux	bsd
on linux bsd etc

323764
ubuntu	debian
for example in debian and ubuntu you need to install the build-essential package via apt

323765
32-bit	64bit
32-bit versions of sql-server with advanced windows extensions awe disabled can only access 2 gb of memory or 3 gb if the 3gb switch is used in boot.ini - although i m not sure off the top of my head if this will work on 64bit windows

323765
32-bit	64bit
this is regardless of whether they are running on windows 2003 32-bit or 64bit

323765
32-bit	64bit
your best bet is to see about upgrading to sql-server 2005 standard 32 or 64bit - 32-bit standard can use awe or the much pricier sql-server 2000 enterprise edition

323781
boolean	int
i often use a int rather than boolean so that the same flag can be set multiple times in one processing

323790
any	set
i thought i could use ac_prog_cxx to set the compilation flags globally but can t find much documentation on how to use those macros do you have any pointer to such a documentation

323795
version-control	sync
i assume this is for development for which i would recommend using a proper version-control system like git hg darcs and so on but this should apply to using dropbox or any other file sync tool

323795
phpmyadmin	mamp
just synchronise the code as usual but export your database schema and some testing data into a regular file probably as a .sql dump from mamp s included phpmyadmin tool and keep that synchronised

323809
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari both have a built-in developer console which has an almost identical interface to firebug s console so your code should be portable across those browsers

323823
vxworks	linux
embedded applications based on vxworks or embedded linux or windows ce

323824
vbscript	vba
did you mean from a access macro or from vbscript or from vba

323824
macros	vba
if you have a macros that is invoking an action then my recommendation would be to convert it to a vba statement

323846
highlight	selected
in this case i get by with proper indenting and an ide that highlight the matching braces when i selected one

323851
abstract-class	subclassing
from a highly obscure security perspective you can t get a pre-existing class to implement the methods by creating a subclassing of the pre-existing class and the abstract-class

323855
defined	declare
on a more general style note declare pointers closer to where you ll defined them and keep their scope as small as possible

323857
cos	sin
and theres already an index for cos and sin

323874
hide	show
does anyone know how could i show hide sip keyboard programatically or better what could be done to solve the described problem

323874
switching	screens
once the user minimizes the keyboard it should not appear on the screens on dialog switching

323875
internet-explorer	firefox
however there is a ctp community technology preview release of watin which offers support for both internet-explorer and firefox automation

323882
cos	sin
put a composite index on cos and sin on each of the tables

323885
contains	set
it seems that the query is just combining the separated history tables into a single result set contains all the data

323893
bugzilla	mantis
i ve used bugzilla and mantis but i prefer mantis simplicity

323902
stdin	pipe
in someprocess | python myprogram.py stdin is connected to a pipe

323930
highlight	tooltip
i think more useful than comments would be an ide feature to not only highlight matching pairs of bracess but also display the openining line on a tooltip so that if you hovered over the closing braces in your example it would come up with using mytype mytype new mytype in a tooltip

323933
hide	show
you can show hide the sip programmatically using the enabled property

323939
json	xml
the webservice receives arguments from post or get and retreives xml in a future maybe i ll use json

323946
hide	show
and use javascript to show or hide the contents

323946
hide	show
that will show a hidden div and hide a show div

323970
sql-server	mysql
would work in sql-server but i m not sure about mysql

323977
order	add
but when i wanna add an order distance asc it fails because the order by query is using a article.lat and article.lng fields to calculate the distance but these fields lat and lng are user object s members and not article member

323981
any	set
killing a thread removes any guarantees that try finally blocks set up so you might leave locks locked files open etc

324009
temporary	copy
you should make your edits to a temporary file then use visudo -c -f sudoers.temp to confirm that the changes are valid and then copy it over the top of etc sudoers

324011
32-bit	64bit
i am using gcc 4.2.x on a 32-bit intel platform but am interested in 64bit as well

324019
32-bit	64bit
as a 32-bit process your app would not have access to large swaths of the registry on 64bit systems

324025
children	nodes
about the for each child of n part -- i presume you have an adjacency list maintaining the list of all the children of a given nodes

324025
children	nodes
in any case the adjacency lists can be built in time o number of nodess by simply adding each nodes to the children list of its parent

324025
contains	elements
the total size of the lists is at most the number of nodes since each node other than the root occurs in exactly one of the lists so these lists don t take much memory a single list might contains a lot of elements but the total size is bounded

324030
profiling	debugging
writing a leaky application to test debugging a profiling application with

324035
silverlight	wpf
in wpf i d just use the datacontextchanged event to start listening to the viewmodel but in silverlight that event is internal

324039
lookup	any
is there any web service or database for such a city lookup

324040
dependency-injection	inject
the most common way is to use dependency-injection to inject the repositories into the objects that use them

324040
dependency-injection	inject
if you have to do things this way then make sure you separate out the code that calls the singleton and use manual dependency-injection to inject the singletons into the classes that call them

324047
checkout	payment
in an asp.net 3.5 site we have a relatively standard payment checkout progess that contains a number of pages that need to be visited in sequences shopping basket payment details etc

324070
ubuntu	linux
desktop linux users are also likely to be running the 64-bit versions of their favorite distro most likely ubuntu suse or fedora

324080
superclass	subclass
i m extending the functionality of a class with a subclass and i m doing some dirty stuff that make superclass methods dangerous app will hang in a loop in the context of the subclass

324084
xml-libxml	xml-twig
i still mainly a xml-twig user and barely touch xml schema so i don t know if xml-libxml schema will solve the problem you have but it possibly is the best solution on cpan for your needs

324100
alignment	layout
note that the clr may choose at its discretion to layout types differently than described above maybe to increase cache locality or reduce padding required by alignment

324114
command-line	cmd
you can use a cmd-line utility called pv to display the process name and cpu usage over a specific time period defaults to 500ms using this cmd line

324114
linux	osx
it will require a little more work than uptime on osx linux since you would have to total the numbers from the first column or omit the process name and simply total the value form each line of output to get the total in cpu usage

324115
any	set
all this is not to say don t use structs. my favorite approach is to declare a friendly native-endian struct of all the relevant protocol data without any bitfields and without concern for the issues then write a set of symmetric pack parsing routines that use the struct as a go-between

324119
virtual-functions	base-class
you can just replace it with an abstract base-class having virtual-functions

324125
hyperlink	embed
you can also embed hyperlink back out to your application in the reports

324125
pentaho	birt
if you need to run the webserver supporting the reports on something other than windows you could look at one of the open-source systems such as pentaho birt or jasper reports

324129
firefox	opera
in firefox and opera the solution is very easy they have builtin xpath support

324137
superclass	subclass
just re-implement the unsafe methods in your subclass and have it do nothing or throw an exception-handling or re-implement it as safe just as long as the new implementation doesn t call the unsafe superclass methods

324143
scons	cmake
are neither cmake nor scons an option

324170
communication	messages
how should i communication the exception-handling to the client side and show the error messages in a div messagesbox

324170
rad-controls	telerik
i m using telerik rad-controls for asp.net ajax

324202
triggers	insert
typically a sequence is read in the insert triggers

324210
put	get
get rid of the stackpanel and put a grid with one row and 4 column that will do the trick

324217
nswindow	nspanel
you need to use an nspanel instead of an nswindow to get this choice

324222
value	field
i use javascript to update that value and when posting back the page i want to read the value of that htmlinputhidden field

324222
value	field
the value property of that htmlinputhidden field is on postback the default-value the value it had when the page was created not the value reflected through the javascript

324222
value	field
i also tried to register the htmlinputhidden field with scriptmanager.registerhiddenfield page myhtmlimputhiddenfield initialvalue but it still only lets me read the initialvalue even though i through javascript can inspect that the value has changed

324268
synchronous	.when
the inner function doesn t get executed synchronous ie right away but is deferred and executed later .when the request returns which is long after the alert has been executed

324272
web-services	api
for this type of application what would be better the object model api or sharepoint web-services

324279
build-process	nant
the build-process uses asminfo nant task to generate the assemblyinfo.cs file that contains this information

324287
udp	tcp
rtsp can use udp and tcp

324287
quicktime	vlc
rtsp is supported by vlc quicktime player mplayer realplayer and most 3g compatible mobile-phones mileage may vary though

324287
udp	rtp
the advantage of using multicast and udp as well as library support may make rtsp rtp very worthwhile for internal applications

324303
children	nodes
does anyone know of a function i m sure i m not the first person to require this functionality that can read and write the two nodes and all their children so as to swap their location in the dom

324309
base-class	subclass
the solution was to subclass the main menu an old mfc trick where you replace the wndproc function with your own handle any windows messages wm_exitmenuloop in my case and call the base-class wndproc for everything else

324323
access-control	authentication
the view may also be the only way to access the data if views are also used to enforce authentication access-control on the underlying tables

324325
revision	svn
if anything developers should use svn to catalogue all revision of their code and revert back if needed

324339
sequences	subset
in xpath 2.0 which is a subset of xquery one would use the following expression to get a sequences of all string value of the name attributes of the section elements

324341
base-class	inherited
they both inherited from the same base-class and i have a methods to create a new document from a templates or from another document the methods it is in the base-class

324344
google-chrome	opera
ie opera and google-chrome are all fine with the page

324351
postgresql	mysql
we also store the query results from our database postgresql in memcache and we are using triggers on the tables to invalidate the cache - there are several apis out there pgmemcache i think mysql has something like that too but i don t know for sure

324351
triggers	insert
the benefit is that the database self triggers can handle the invalidation of data on changes update insert delete you don t need to write all that stuff into your application

324355
libxml2	lxml
i recommend you to use lxml it s a python binding for the libxml2 library which is really fast

324355
libxml2	lxml
but i prefer libxml2 and lxml for python because it seems to be more actively developed and tested

324356
constructor	object
if you want to be able to do anything other than create a new object just from the code in the constructor don t use a constructor in the first place

324368
digits	zero
you presumably want to pad your digits with leading zero in a string

324372
32-bit	64bit
can i use the autotools to configure software that needs to run on different machines with different versions of the primary software which my plugins works with plus various 3rd party libraries not to mention 32-bit vs 64bit issues

324372
linux	unix
further they work on unix linux macos x bsd

324372
32-bit	64bit
it detects the version of the client software called ibm informix esql c part of the ibm informix clientsdk or csdk is installed and whether it is 32-bit or 64bit

324372
32-bit	64bit
do you need a separate build of your plugins for the 32-bit and 64bit versions

324372
32-bit	64bit
maybe if you find both 32-bit and 64bit versions then you should build both -- that would require careful construction though

324372
32-bit	64bit
where it would create both the 32-bit and 64bit targets in one makefile for the current platform

324372
32-bit	64bit
the idea here is that the autotool would detect the 32-bit or 64bit installs for the third party package and then make substitution

324372
32-bit	64bit
it is important that all the flags affected by 32-bit vs 64bit builds are set on the recursive invocation of make and that the rules for building objects and libraries are written carefully - for example the rule for compiling source to object must be careful to place the object file in the correct object directory - using gcc for example you would specify in a .c.o rule

324372
32-bit	64bit
the residual issues in the autotools is working out how to determine the 32-bit and 64bit flags

324405
cvs	git
i haven t used git with cvs but if its integration is anything like git-svn then it s going to be no problem

324420
versioning	upgrade
the trouble is that if it ceases to be profitable for example because the code is so stable that people buy it and continue using it without needing upgrade then the users of that software can be stranded with their nice stable product running on increasingly ancient machines until one day the machines crash or must be upgraded to a new versioning of the operating system so that they can run some other system but because the proprietary software is no longer maintained you have to give up on the application

324431
project-management	project
the project had been primarily off-shored to india and imo a project-management failure resulted in a ton of spaghetti code that was too fragmented to ever work properly in its current form

324435
any	set
is there any way for me to set the title for a specific w3wp.exe process to reflect the application-pool it s hosting

324442
linux	bsd
on linux kevents on bsd or osx that

324442
environment	execution
environment variables before execution

324445
web-services	api
the salesforce.com web-services api docs contains the reference docs for soql has lots of samples

324472
stderr	stdout
the redirects stderr to stdout so any error messages will be printed

324481
csv	xml
lee holmes has posted a solution using psexec and xml rather than csv

324482
command-prompt	cmd
the problem occurs when i run a cmd in the cmd-prompt i keep getting this error error cannot find outputs of project output grouping unable to determine name

324482
command-prompt	cmd
the cmd for the cmd-prompt is

324491
binary	octal
i am working on a calculator that allows you to perform calculations past the decimal point in octal hexadecimal binary and of course decimal

324491
binary	octal
i am having trouble though finding a way to convert floating point decimal numbers to floating point hexadecimal octal binary and vice versa

324522
duplicates	contains
you didn t say in your question whether the lists are supposed to represent sets which can t contains duplicates or just plain lists

324542
binary	octal
as a hint convert octal and hex to binary perform the operations convert back to binary

324542
binary	octal
or you can perform decimal operations and perform the conversions to octal hex binary afterward

324557
controller	routes
this way any routes with controller home will match the first route and any routes with controller

324558
value	field
the text rule is only used for descriptive field contents and value that are not intended to be interpreter by the message parsing

324567
children	nodes
however pattern matching forces you to choose what to do based on the immediate nodes s children rather than what the subtrees return after being simplified themselves

324567
multiplication	addition
it also handles multiplication by 0 and 1 and addition of 0

324594
bug-tracking	bugzilla
personally this is where bug-tracking software such as jira or bugzilla come in to place with me

324597
multiplying	division
if you multiplying a unsigned binary number by 2 ti is the same as a bit shift left 1 in c a division by 2 is the same as a bit shit right in c

324597
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction is the same as you would do in elementary school

324603
mime	rfc
it says that text in header value must use the mime encoding as defined rfc 2047 if it contains characters from character sets other than iso-8859-1

324603
arguments	default
since no encoding was specified imho this methods with no arguments should have been deprecated long ago the current system default encoding is used which is usually not utf8 and then the arrays is again converted as being utf8 encoded

324608
hotmail	gmail
the html version of the email works great in gmail hotmail etc

324641
contains	elements
i have a border elements with rounded corners contains a 3x3 grid

324650
contains	elements
so that the border elements completely contains the grid

324658
postback	ajax
the only problems we had were with pages returning files and pages that used a combination of both ajax and regular asp.net postback

324662
expression	brackets
i d recommend using a regular expression to capture all of the variants of how 0 can be specified with double-quotes without any quotes with single quotes with extra whitespace outside the quotes with whitespace inside the quotes how you want the square brackets handled etc

324671
arrays	loops
moving the arrays ... inside the loops as in the question

324674
32-bit	64bit
in all the times i have come across an error in changing from 64bit to 32-bit the change in the number of bits is usually a red herring and the actual cause of the failure is something else

324689
getter	setter
and 2 the getter and setter of the member variables were easy to make thread-safe because changing or accessing their value was always done through 2 methods in the base-class of all objects

324689
arrays	map
for example i could create an arrays object that contained arbitrary items of any type including itself and create new arrayss dynamically by passing a message to all arrays items and collecting the return values similar to map in lisp

324709
systemtap	oprofile
see also observe systemtap and oprofile updates

324732
difference	count
not count braces makes quite a difference

324734
subclassing	superclass
the runtime will actually call +initialize on superclass before it is called on subclassing

324739
base-class	inherited
the trick is that every class that you pass out as a handle has to inherited from a common base-class

324759
mstest	nunit
nunit is probably the best one some people even prefer it to mstest

324769
firefox	opera
that works in firefox 3 and opera 9 at least

324777
cryptography	security
unfortunately i believe that you cannot get cryptography security and guaranteed non-repeatability at the same time

324777
mersenne-twister	generator
for similar reasons the same is true of long-period generator such as the mersenne-twister

324780
push	pull
the former offers nearly everything mercurial offers including rebase push pull graphical history workspace synchronization etc

324803
.when	ready
.when i m ready for another frame i unblock the mutex in my main thread and wait for samplegrabber samplecb to send me a signals that it s done

324806
configuration	logging
a very simple logging option is to use syslog and rely on after correct configuration the syslog daemon to forward it to a remote server

324811
directory	folder
whenever i need something from that folder eg jquery.js a css reset i just symlink that directory into my working folder and hey presto

324825
click	mouse
if they double click it again or move the mouse away from the box it should shrink again

324831
for-loop	loops
if i have a for-loop which is nested within another how can i efficiently come out of both loops inner and outer in the quickest possible way

324867
put	get
so what i think i want to do is have 3 string variables s and 1 int and get all those things put into their respective variablesiables

324904
authentication	login
i added the following to my web.config to redirect the user to the login page if they aren t authentication but going to the url does cause a redirect

324935
innodb	myisam
i ve tried it with the myisam and innodb engine

324943
oracle	mysql
googling doesn t show any special with syntax for oracle except the with check option that mysql also supports

324988
windows	ms-dos
on windows and ms-dos systems the following are invalid filenames

325010
worksheet	excel
so my first question is - is there a way to fill a datatable from an in-memory excel worksheet

325017
contains	any
this will match if the string contains any digit that is non-zero assuming that you re looking at numeric data of course

325029
logout	login
now once a user login the other user is not able to login into the share using his credentials until the 1st user logout

325030
configurationsection	web-config
if you re dead-set on the single app instance you can accomplish what you re after using a custom configurationsection in your single web-config

325031
windows-xp	windows
in earlier versions of the microsoft c c++ compilers i ve used sounds from the pinball game that came with windows-xp and the windows 95 plus

325035
selected	button
i have a canvas can draw on it as well as 2 button that i use to selected the tool

325038
value	field
otherwise there is no built-in django form field which will render a value while rejecting bound input data

325105
json	xml
i use json unless i m required to use xml

325105
json	xml
when amazon first exposed their catalogs as a web service they offered both json and xml

325106
business-objects	crystal-reports
how can i migrate reports from crystal-reports to business-objects enterprise

325157
command-line	cmd
when you iterate over the passed in cmd-line options you simply look them up in the dictionary and invoke on the value which is the matching cmd object to execute or alternatively use if you stored the type instead of a specific object instance

325172
json	xml
chances are the xml + xsl chain will work faster than json + javascript especially for big chunks of data

325172
json	xml
there is an existing xml service and it is a hassle to rewrite it with json for some reasons

325193
integer	numeric
the second way would be to similar to the first except that we cast the numeric string to an integer yielding the integer value you were looking for but printing line without all the quotation marks

325195
mapping	unique
you can give such a file mapping a unique system-wide name and then other applications can open it using openfilemapping and providing the same name

325203
linux	unix
families unix linux etc.

325269
fortran	pascal
i really cut my teeth on cobol coding - learned on fortran pascal and c but spent most of my first 5 years coding professionally on cobol on ibm 390s

325273
margins	padding
update notes excuse me for not describing the question well i tried css margins padding attributes on div to occupy the whole remining height of a web page successfully but the trick didn t work on iframe

325296
having	select
the most reliable way aside from having the user select the correct language of course is to check if the first line is starts with #

325296
perl	ruby
that will work reliably for a lot of scripting languages including python shell scripting perl ruby etc etc.. but not for compiled languages

325300
autoformatting	aptana
but for html and xml i think aptana made great fork - autoformatting in html really helps a lot

325316
environment	execution
make sure to qualify your execution environment

325321
selected	cell
i ve implemeneted customised single selected combo box as a cell element in dojo grid

325333
configuration	environment
probably your configuration app has created the setenv script and thats why tomcat is ignoring the environment variables

325334
contains	elements
to make a long story short - there is such a thing as contains block - which is not necessary the parent elements

325334
contains	elements
so when you say width 100 it checks the width of the contains block and sets the width of your elements to the same size

325334
contains	elements
not sure elements and that stretches just enough to contains its contents

325336
instrumentation	profiling
you may not be able to use a profiling very well for example if it impacts the behaviour too much in which case instrumentation should be used instead

325373
height	frame
what i think you mean is that you would like the iframe to consume what s left like frame and table cells can height

325409
python	ruby
the bad news is that it is coded in ruby but i am sure that you can integrate it one way or the other in python

325412
selected	textbox
if secondary data i would be quite tempted to push this into a single textbox that displays edits the data for the current selected node

325412
treeview	grid
alternatively there are some treeview grid combined controls available from 3rd parties

325422
versioning	upgrade
some versioning bumps between eclipse versionings cause a certain amount of upgrade pain for the plugins writers 3.0 to 3.1 was a big jump

325433
templating	markup
a set of databound asp.net-mvc controls easily bound to viewdata sans obstinate id rewriting with no reliance on nasty viewstate or postback gunk and complete control over templating defaulting to sensible markup would be an excellent addition to the asp.net-mvc framework

325436
configure	libtool
depending on the scope of your project you may want to add configure check for these gnulib recently acquired new macros to tests for warnings flags and libtool can be used to build shared-libraries

325455
webforms	asp.net
the collection of htmlhelpers is quite large but you will not automatically find equivalents to the regular webforms controls because of the different nature of webforms and asp.net mvc

325464
selected	checkbox
i want a way to list files in a directory and putting a checkbox beside each one of them so i can select some of them and perform operations with each selected file what s the best way to do this

325469
function-calls	main
in my opinion the main of a sizable project should contains around 3 function-calls

325469
put	get
for a short project i might put everything in main just to get things up-and-running quickly

325484
function-calls	main
as a direct answer to your question i would put the function-calls to each of the major components in main the setup the process and the finish so that anyone who looks at it gets a quick overview of how the program works

325498
any	set
i do not have any -vm set in eclipse.ini

325511
value	field
also i d have to find a way to map my poco domain-object to this because i doubt nhibernate can instantiate the right object depending on a value in a field

325523
lookup	any
do you have any idea how to calculate lookup proximity between countries

325524
put	get
where do i need to put this external jar file in order not to get a java.lang.noclassdeffounderror when using this class from another project not in eclipse

325538
web-config	app-config
why not store the tax rates in application configuration eg in the web-config or app-config file

325542
constructor	private
edit note that the code here could easily be abbreviated by having a private constructor taking the tax rate and the name

325542
constructor	private
c# makes that fairly tricky but you can do it to some extent using private constructor and nested classes

325549
exception-handling	try-catch
looking up possible causes of this dialog indicate that an unhandled exception-handling has occured but the entire contents of the main methods is contained within a try-catch so that can t be my problem

325559
unique-key	schema
i ve a table with two columns are a unique-key together and i cannot change the schema

325561
methods	extend
i have used extension methods to extend html helpers to make an rss repeater

325573
jar	war
then when you build ant maven manually for distribution ensure the jar file is included with or within your application jar or war or ear or whatever file and that any startup scripts include it on the classpath using the -classpath command-line option for java as vonc has written

325581
pointers	stack
notice that in both case the compiler doesnâ t put the this pointers in stack since the static function doesn t need it

325587
linux	unix
i have found that even though by default a root account is created in mysql this root account has no connection with unix root i can use it even if i am not a superuser in linux and the password is blank

325588
web-hosting	hosting
php is supported more by web-hosting companies if you re looking for cheap low requirements hosting

325588
linux	unix
every propper linux unix distribution does java+tomcat out of the box

325591
hash	md5
it provides methods for generate random numbers hash with md2 md4 md5 and sha and some kind of encryption decryption

325604
python	ruby
other alternatives could be investigating jruby or jpython for development in ruby or python - although i don t know how easy this would be as i haven t done it myself

325614
implements	extends
extends stringbuffer to avoid switching back and forth between string and stringbuffer implements append string offset length parseint int indexof string index replace offset stringbuffer offset length .

325641
value	field
it will be bound to the value field

325641
value	field
the attributes selectedrowid is for the item value of the radio-button and will be bound to the item value field

325646
groovy	java
i dont use a tool as such but often i will rough out an algorithm in a high level scripting langauge such as groovy before implementing it in java

325649
hash	md5
this matters because some hash algorithms such as md5 are suitable for some purposes but not others

325652
web-frameworks	turbogears
turbogears is easier to use grails gives you access to the vast spaces of java web-frameworks hard to beat

325686
checkstyle	ant
try checkstyle there is an eclipse plugins and an ant task that produces reports

325688
command-prompt	cmd
does it work if you run the app from an elevated command-prompt winkey followed by pressing cmd followed by ctrl+shift+return

325699
http	ssl
you need to specify what protocol you re working with -- there are ssl versions of http imap pop etc

325710
json	xml
i d choose xml over json if i need to validate the chunk of incoming data because xml nativly supports this through xsd

325721
business-process	integration
i ve heard from someone that theyâ re using a business-process automation tool like weblogic integration as a programming language what sounds like something kind of stupid to make things declarative

325733
subclassing	nsobject
i never had the notion that i should be calling nszonefree in my own nsobject subclassing or what ns_whateverclass_ subclassing and can t find anything conclusive on the topic anywhere in the docs

325748
order	add
compared with initialization order of course it always loses although you can add access-specifiers and hope for the best

325756
attributes	properties
i need a guid properties in some attributes class like this

325756
contains	any
the foreignidentificator property can contains any string value and during creating guid will be thrown exception-handling at runtime not at compile time

325769
declarative	imperative
however some systemds also implements a petri-net or state change based markup systemd for workflow which might reasonably be describe as declarative but they still have an imperative mode of integration with the underlying systemd

325770
declarative-programming	declarative
it is definitely not what people usually mean when they talk about declarative-programming even if it some sense can be called declarative

325784
gnome	kde
my guess is that the desktop kde or gnome is configure to use a font which doesn t contains umlauts kind of strange today but it happens

325787
malloc	free
so you basically use nszonefree instead of free when cleaing up malloc d and calloc d memory

325810
linked-list	dictionary
ps i am not looking for explanations of when to use linked-list and when to use a dictionary

325826
contains	set
the oracle precompiler reads the which contains the definition of the sys_include variables set to usr include

325860
silverlight	wpf
visifire is an open source graphing control for silverlight and wpf

325876
execute	declare
0 if members have dependencies between them on construction or if members need to be constructed in a specific order declare them in the order of construction you wish to be execute

325904
getdate	dateadd
you could put the dateadd d datediff d 0 getdate 0 and dateadd d datediff d 0 getdate 1 into variables and use those instead but i don t think that this will improve performance

325915
standard-library	boost
you understand now that boost is meant to be useful to most programers that s why it s the test bed for future standard-library

325917
boost-asio	boost
i love boost random and boost-asio and boost filesystem however boost bind boost circular_buffer and boost thread are very practical smart pointers are ok but i prefer raii instead as memory-management

325944
highlight	cell
third rule on a1 is highlight when cell equals yes and the format is bold text only

325945
look-and-feel	substance
i m aware of the substance look-and-feels and that they have a office 2007 look-a-like look-and-feel

325955
contains	any
in other words you ll only reach that code when row doesn t contains any information because you ve finished reading rows

325962
linked-list	dictionary
just because one library has a great linked-list doesn t mean it has an awesome dictionary

325964
order	add
if start and end dates can be out of order if it is possible that or then you also have to check that they are in order so that means you have to add two additional validity rules

325975
gethashcode	equals
of course for contains to work as expected you need to override the equals methods as well as gethashcode

325979
webforms	asp.net
as a bit of technical background we will be incorperating the raw html they provide into an asp.net webforms application utilising the usual master pages external stylesheets jquery

325993
forwarding	port
it does not have any managed clients but it should be rather straight forwarding to do a port of the java client

326009
webserver	host
i recently bought a new webserver 2008 for our company and require a ftp hosting site that allows customers to upload files and host websites from our server the site must have the shopping basket monthly rates built in

326070
any	set
2 set the commandname commandargument property if requried to pass any data to this object

326075
32-bit	x86
x86 is 32-bit

326083
widget	button
say you have 2 views that both have a button for edit this widget both of them would have to have logic to get a widgeteditorpresenter and show the associated view

326084
contains	elements
i have an xml document with several elementss each of which contains the of the person and several elementss inside a grouping elements

326099
arcgis	arcmap
i used to work for an esri business partner we had a couple of arcgis engine-based tablet pc applications and also did a lot of customisation stuff for arcmap and arcsdc all in c# using arcobjects

326126
python	lua
i d advice lua scheme and python

326134
margins	padding
the spans have a class of navigation which basically draws a background-image around the text to make it look like a button as well as setting margins padding etc

326138
hotmail	gmail
you can import contacts from gmail hotmail outlook and you can designate subgroups that won t be matched with one another bill and lisa never want to get each other s names

326154
perl	ruby
my favorite is perl but many people say python ruby and whatnot

326155
enumerator	any
what you can do though is to get all the any methods defined on enumerator and iterate over those to get the one you want

326164
text-align	display
setting the li elements to display inline and giving the ul a text-align justify property will get you part way there in ffx3 and ie7 at least

326167
sharing	share
one drive letter for sharing files between teams a seperate file share for the entire organization a third for personal use etc

326193
any	set
for the fields that do have not yet taken as its text do not have any color set

326196
button	popup
in firefox 3 under windows-xp take a look at this page click on the collect button and note that the popup div appears under the youtube player

326196
contains	elements
i ve tried setting the z-index of the object elements contains the player to a lower value but that didn t work

326197
protected	public
in classes you can set some functions as private protected or public

326200
value	field
when you enter null into the field for nullvalue in the designer you are specifing the string value null

326218
value	field
when you have one user or grouping within the item value the field type is spfielduservalue

326218
value	field
now we ll check the field value for a user grouping and retrieve a list of users independant of which kind it is the field s name is users

326223
value	field
i have an abstract base class and i want to declare a field or a property that will have a different value in each class that inherits from this parent class

326223
value	field
but it feels slightly wrong to return a hard-code value rather than encapsulate a field and it is a few lines of code instead of just

326223
protected	public
i can declare a public field or a protected field and explicitly override it in the inherited class

326223
value	field
i can use a protected field and set the value in the constructor

326230
implements	abstract
i d go with option 3 but have an abstract setmyint methods that subclasses are forced to implements

326230
derived-class	base-class
in your abstract base-class property the derived-class won t have to implement it

326231
protected	public
of course you then still have the option of making the field private and then depending on the need exposing a protected or public property getter

326247
windows-server	windows
xp windows-server 2003 and windows

326259
defined	declare
the pointers is declare before the structure it points to is defined

326275
contains	any
you d need a directory named idol7stats contains a file called __init__.py and any other library modules to package

326284
value	field
because it provides a clear centralized value and can be referenced internally by children without the hassle of defining their own field -- which is the problem with option 1

326294
pointers	stack
unlike c# where you don t need any syntax to denote managed heap objects c++ cli differentiates between stack objects picturebox pb pointers to heap objects and handles to managed heap objects picturebox pb

326302
defined	declare
forwarding reference is when you declare a type but do not defined it

326309
deep-copy	object
i would like that these two would work simultaneously is the only solution to make a deep-copy of object

326323
value	field
getmetatable will return the value of this field

326328
silverlight	wpf
also there is caliburn an application framework for silverlight and wpf

326374
gridview	listview
i added this column to a gridview along with other columns set the gridview to the view property of a listview and then databound the listview to a collection of custom dataobjects

326379
hotmail	gmail
i m trying to locate and or build an api capable of speaking to hotmail yahoo and gmail in order to retrieve contact lists with the user s consent of course

326387
highlight	selected
i found the resharper surround command within the code command but when you selected the using statement it does surround your highlight code block but it does not seem smart enough to put the first line within the using clause

326401
python	ruby
the big 2 that come to mind are python and ruby on rails as everyone talks about them like its the next coming of our savior

326405
derived-class	base-class
i have an abstract base-class and derived-class

326421
contains	lookup
i would create a lookup table that contains your four possible values and then link to them via a foreign key

326429
version-control	cvs
i think central version-control cvs or svn is ruled out because our students don t have the administrative privileges needed to make a repository that they can share with one other student

326429
solaris	linux
our infrastructure is linux solaris and windows with a netapp filer

326437
tuples	any
i ll completely ignore any sane coding guidelines - for example i won t create classes to store my data but i ll just create larger and larger tuples to contain all my info and to represent an object

326468
any	set
the problem is that iis process and so asp.net processes run as the system account wich does not have any printers set up

326471
ruby-on-rails	rspec
this is assuming both that you have the rspec ruby-on-rails plugin installed here and that you have the default spec spec_helper.rb file from the rspec plugin

326480
malloc	free
it is fairly common for heap-based memory managers your basic malloc free to use a single mutex there are fairly good reasons for it a heap memory area is a single coherent data structure

326494
access-control	authentication
for your access restriction needs you could use the integrated subversion authentication look here - which uses a simple configuration file for fine grained access-control

326496
reflection	runtime
the t type parameter is one step closer in the abstraction stack to compile time - unless you re calling via reflection it will be determined at compile time - but the type embedded in the expression passed as propertyexp is determined at runtime

326508
compression	streaming
if you want completely defined terrain then you re going to need to look into some kind of compression streaming technique to only pull terrain you are currently interested in

326509
ubuntu	linux
across most platforms windows mac os linux ubuntu in particular

326513
compression	streaming
most out-of-the-box compression algorithms won t allow you to decompress an arbitrary location in the streaming

326515
display	width
i believe the problem is that span elements display inline by default - meaning they have no height and width

326522
inline-code	code-behind
vs of course will encourage you to fall into the pit of success and drive you towards the webforms and code-behind way of doing things but the language is expressive enough to replicate the patterns of asp classic namely lots of golden nuggets inline-code cross posting pages etc

326526
driver	kernel
all i can say is that in over a decade of working with ce half of which spent doing custom kernel and driver work for custom boards i ve only ever had need for source that didn t ship with ce they ship a vast majority of it once

326528
linux	osx
for linux and osx i don t know besides crontab wich is somehow too technical but i m pretty sure they both have a way to do the same thing easily

326529
qooxdoo	extjs
you might also be interested in the unit-testing framework that is part of qooxdoo an open source ria framework similar to dojo extjs etc

326529
selected	button
it s a play button that runs the selected tests

326546
execution	jobs
if your application is primarily scheduling tasks a headless quartz service execution jobs with a desktop client to interact with the service is reasonable approach

326555
windows-xp	windows
well we use the same suite to run the tests on different linux combinations and windows variations and also combined ones like a windows server with a linux client windows-xp vista then domain controller out of domain and so on

326555
startup	launch
running several combinations at the same time and what i think is more interesting defining multi client scenarios two clients wait for the server to startup then launch operations synch with each other and so on

326555
any	set
so if you have any questions about how to set it up which is not simple yet i m afraid don t hesitate to ask

326564
defined	declare
i think you ll have to clarify your question a bit more but in general you have to declare but not defined every function you use in a given translation unit

326591
any	set
for any set of coordinates for which the terrain is the same elevation or can be described by a simple function you just need to define the range this function covers

326595
worksheet	excel
recent versions of excel have an xml file format and i excel can open an html file containing a table and convert it to a worksheet but ã don t know of any specific excel html format

326595
worksheet	excel
regarding the solution using excel automation once you have a worksheet in memory you can get the values into a 2-dimensional arrays of objects using the value2 property then use that to build a datatable

326596
error-handling	try-catch
one of the features i want to have is to be able to easily wrap a function with a try-catch block so that all calls to that function will automatically have the error-handling code that ll call my global logging methods

326602
mouseleave	mouseover
depending on how much stuff is in there you may get better results using mouseenter and mouseleave to avoid triggers mouseover when you cross element boundaries

326612
for-loop	loops
there is a variation on the same theme that uses a for-loops instead of a while loops to limit the scope of the line variable

326624
double	int
i worry less about how it handles nan +-infinity double int than whether one of colleagues decided to change the argument order and goofed

326631
push	pull
understanding the distinction between push pull vs update commit

326637
value	field
all of the datakey value will always be passed to the delete methods because the fields named by datakeynames are intended to be the field or fields that uniquely identify that item in the gridview

326661
factors	matrix
this proved to be a bottleneck in our application and we then used pinning+p invoke to call into a c++ version of the matrix multiplication routine and got a factors of 2 improvement

326664
windows-live	hotmail
hotmail windows-live contacts api

326668
bazaar	git
some version control systems bazaar hg git make this easier than others but it s possible on most

326671
c++	lua
this means an extra level of indirection---lost in the noise from a performance point of view but easy to get wrong so maintain a single point of truth where you cross the c++ lua boundary

326689
meta-inf	jar
my .class and properties files and the contents of my meta-inf directory are showing up in the . build directory but my web-inf lib directory seems to be referenced in-place and the jar dependency doesn t get copied in to it to show up as part of the web app library

326700
activerecord	datamapper
as for the orm activerecord or datamapper should be the way to go

326701
methods	extend
when i am working with i generally extend it with an addrange methods

326702
superclass	subclass
if you has a person superclass a employee subclass it would make no sense for the employee class to have no breathe methods

326704
derived-class	base-class
in fact generally when overriding you should try to code both the base-class and the derived-class so that the derived-class implementation first calls the base implementation and then executes it s additional functionality.

326791
javascript	dom
the function depends on the dom to be completely loaded but it s called before the relevant elements are created most javascript should be done after the onload event under normal circumstances

326794
python	php
is there a way in python to handle xml files similar to the way php s simplexml extension does them

326807
entity-framework	ado.net
eloquently put by erik here - tdd and ado.net entity-framework

326849
solaris	unix
when i ve written cross-platform product installers coding a unix shell script for linux mac solaris etc

326849
windows-server	windows
the only trouble is that i believe it s still a separate install it isn t available by default i ve read that it ll be on windows-server 2008 and windows 7

326860
silverlight	wpf
i wonder if you can get your wpf or silverlight app to work in the asp.net-mvc framework this way.

326875
any	set
you can even set default order and limit for any model

326925
constructor	private
make the default constructor protected or private

326932
python	java
remember python is not java

326939
selected	button
css selectedors are designed to selected disabled button for you

326953
postgresql	mysql
this is trivial in postgresql and impossible in mysql

326953
rollback	commit
i have a postgresql background so that s an obvious thing to do begin a transaction do some stuff commit or rollback -- postgresql isn t picky about what do some stuff is

326962
python	ruby
i dont like ruby or python syntax so i will put them behind

326969
credentials	account
my primary account is a gmail account so i can use it via smtp.gmail.com and of course my credentials

326975
codeigniter	symfony
i looked at zend and symfony mainly i only skimmed the codeigniter docs and watched the screencast

327004
hotmail	gmail
plaxo has an api widget to import contacts from gmail yahoo aol and hotmail

327016
gnome	kde
i m developing an application to run with either a single-click interface nothing requires a double-click just like the kde interface mode or a double-click interface the default windows interface mode or the regular gnome interface mode

327016
configuration	environment
i want the java application to behave just like the rest of the system to respect the user current configuration and environment

327060
value	field
field value

327081
perl	awk

327101
python	ruby
web2py to is a python framework but shares the convention over configuration design that ruby on rails has

327114
malloc	free
nszonefree balances out a call to nszonemalloc just like -release balances a call to -alloc or -copy and cfrelease balances a call to cfretain or or for that matter free balances a call to malloc or calloc

327118
constructor	object
i m guessing that those libraries are written in c++ and are loading the dlls from the constructor of some object in global scope

327118
directory	folder
another option is to change the current working directory to the folder containing the dlls with setcurrentdirectory

327128

edit added an example of a function to flatten any tree into an enumerator

327132
keyboard	mouse
for example i m currently using an apple keyboard and a logitech mx revolution mouse and i ve been very impressed with both

327134
digits	base
the last d digits in base b of a number n is the same as the remainder when n is divided by b d ie

327134

asyncpostbackerror event should be catpured when we want to customize exceptions occured during ajax postback

327223
data-structures	tree
from what i know of data-structures a balanced binary search tree using something like red-black or avl would probably be ideal but i would really prefer not to implement them myself

327240
32-bit	64bit
it assumes 32-bit integers - for 64bit longs a 20-byte buffer is not big enough

327240
32-bit	64bit
to address #2 i d separate the code into two functions one for 32-bit integers and one for 64bit integers

327248
oracle-xe	oracle
if you are looking for an alternative oracle application express is a fairly powerful web based app that can be run on oracle-xe

327293
key-value	key
store the dictionary key in a temporary collection then loop over the temp collection and use the key-value as your indexer parameter

327295
data-structures	dictionary
storing it in different simple python data-structures took this much space in kb measured as rss from running ps where d is a dictionary keys and freqs are lists and a b c freq are the fields of a trigram record

327295
dictionary	arrays
anyway you can find out more in this vein by looking up dictionary structures used in full-text search. so specifically i d start with the arrays with keys being the first two words with a parallel arrays whose entries list the possible third words and their frequencies

327295
data-structures	tree
e.g. this paper tests a variety of data-structures on a similar problem unigrams instead of trigrams though and finds a hashtable to beat all of the tree structures by that measure

327301
.net	wcf
it is a very mature and stable amf implementation for .net and it does provide wcf integration

327306
base-class	subclass
if you generate a base-class with all of your object properties and then create a subclass for it which is never modified you can still add custom code while regenerating only the parts of your class that change

327331
contains	any
if received data contains any javascript then browser interprets it in its own javascript vm and server is long forgotten by then since http is stateless protocol

327376

327377
linked-list	tree
this includes binary tree maps arrays linked-list etc .

327379
python	c++
at the moment i m looking into comparing stackless python and c++ pthreads so the focus is on these two languages but other languages will probably be tested later

327393
select	union
as other users said union is used to select distinct values from two tables

327393
select	union
where as union all is used to select all values including

327398

327479
dictionary	map
if your chains map 2 words to the probabilities of the third i d use a dictionary mapping k-tuples to the 3rd-word histogram

327484
textmate	vim
then i read a post by jamis buck on how he switched from textmate back to vim and learned some great tricks

327491

327532
any	set
consistency any rules you ve set up about the database will always be enforced

327534
append	input
i think i will have to check the dictionary on each loop through the input to see if the dictionary key already exists i guess by using something like max d.keys if it is there append data if not create the empty list as the dictionary value and then append data on the next loop through

327552
for-loop	loops
using the common for-loop form here will allow the optimizer to unroll these loops if it wants

327555
emacs	vim
there are important features of emacs which are missing in vim such as the comint mode and there are no scripts plugins which can replace them

327555
emacs	vim
there are also benefits of vim over emacs such as modal editing and generally better default shortcuts

327555
emacs	vim
unfortunately no mode can make emacs work as fast as vim

327570
children	nodes
that is to say one nodes can have multiple children and multiple parents

327573
decrement	increment
passing by value would only temporary increment the reference count due to the copying and then decrement it when exiting the function scope

327578
histogram	plot
plot data.dat using 2 xtic 1 with histogram

327586
arrays	loops
yes the compiler may optimize it away but it s generally very conservative with floating-point optimizations and it may treat fp values read from memory differently from ones read from a register which means it can t eliminate your arrays lookups from the loops conditions so it s often best to do even simple optimizations manually

327586
iteration	elements
operator could be coaxed into calculating a different vector index for the center value so it s written to the next vector elements and so gets overwrite again next iteration

327586
benchmarking	profiling
you have to constantly profiling and benchmarking every change you make to ensure you re actually improving performance

327589
windows-mobile	windows-ce
if you want to continue targeting windows-ce windows-mobile i d recommend going to the cf - language is irrelevant use what you re comfortable with

327595
metaphone	soundex
commons codec has an implementation of soundex and metaphone

327606

as a starting point for rolling your own it s probably worth looking at alex feinman s article on msdn entitled creating self-updating applications with the .net compact-framework

327608
postgresql	mysql
any free database mysql postgresql

327620
safari	opera
in opera 9.62 mozilla 3.0.4 safari 3.2 for windows it helps if you put some text or at least a whitespace within the same line as the input-field

windows-xp	windows
test machines i have used windows-xp windows 2003 server

327676
tcsh	bash
under terminal preferences profiles keyboard you can check use option key as meta key. many applications including bash and tcsh treat meta-delete as backward delete word.

327694
fadein	hide
if you hide the content before you append it and chain the fadein methods to that you should get the effect that you re looking for

327697
dictionary	arrays
you ll need to use numbers rather than strings to index into the arrays but that can be solved by using a single dictionary to map words to numbers

327741
command-line	cmd
after you have a basic understanding of how this works if you re considering doing a serious business command-lineâ type application i would look at the cmd framework for command-line applications

327810
glassfish	geronimo
for example by using the apache geronimo server which uses tomcat as its container or by taking the jar files from glassfish

327824
document-ready	.when
document-ready will execute .when the dom is loaded not necessarily .when all gravatar images are loaded

margins	padding
what i want to do is add some extra margins where padding templatebinding padding

327857
comma	words
i have a list of input words separated by comma

327866
decrement	increment
also the increment decrement - since it s thread safe - is a synchronization point

327871
selected	button
if you use a lot of different form widgets see if it is really necessary and fall back on regular dom elements like input button textarea selected

327883
constructor	object
the default constructor using cache and database custom object

327885
abstract-class	base-class
after all if this was an interface instead of that abstract-class there would be no need to extend a base-class in order to create a new actionresult - one would just have to implement iactionresult properly

327934
contains	sorted
and once sorted it s easy to merge any two adjacent sorted lists into a larger sorted list contains all the elements of the two sub lists

327934
selection-sort	radix-sort
those are just two algorithms for sorting a list but there are a lot of other interesting techniques each with its own advantages and disadvantages quick sort radix-sort selection-sort heapsort shell sort and bucket sort

forwarding	port
i d like to forwarding all requests that come into the primary server on port 1008 to be fulfilled by another dedicated server on the same network

327956
virtual-machine	vmware
if you re not trying to debugging hardware issues you might consider using a virtual-machine vmware virtual pc etc. instead of imaging real hard drives

327968
tabcontrol	panels
this has been a real pain to manage in the form designer as the panels don t behave like a full tabcontrol

327972
updating	updates
another thing to look into is your index creation updating because the more indices you have on a table the slower all updates and insert statements get

327972
innodb	myisam
another thing is that i think you use myisam table engine which locks the entire table on update.i suggest you use innodb instead

327987
value	field
note also that when setting .query.group_by the value must be actual db column names category_id not django field names category

327991
filesystems	symlink
for the symlink and rename calls both filenames have to reside on the same filesystems

327995
cakephp	kohana
php has many to choose from zend s solar cakephp symfony kohana

327995
profiling	debugging

327995
profiling	debugging
those two needs are solved by same tool - xdebug which offers improved debugging capabilities and can also generate kcachegrind reports for profiling your application

328001
action-filter	controller
you can also add you own action-filter to different actions in the controller

328041
solaris	aix
the solution needs to run on windows linux solaris aix and hp-ux

328041
perl	ksh
possible choices include but are not limited to bash ksh + curl perl python and ruby

328058
executable	jar
first you ll need to add some information to your pom.xml plugins section to make the resulting jar executable

328062
python	ruby
personally i would use ruby or python for this type of job they both make it very easy to make clear understandable code that others can maintain or you can maintain after not looking at it for 6 months

328062
python	ruby
if you have the control to do so i would also suggest getting the latest version of the interpreter as both ruby and python have made notable improvements around performance recently

328064
dictionary	map
i would expect that the map dictionary hashtable of the non-zero values should be a fast and economical solution

328075
perl	ruby
in my experience python is the most efficient of the three followed by perl and then ruby with the difference between perl and ruby being particularly large in certain areas

328075
perl	ruby
if you don t have a preference start with python as it is easy to learn and use and if it is too slow with python perl and ruby probably won t be able to do any better

328077
perl	lua
lots of languages are compared such as perl python lua and ruby

328088
perl	ruby
you can also do this fairly easily in ruby and in perl albeit with some more difficulty

328096
mousedown	mouseup
you need to handle the mousedown and mouseup and set some flag or something to tracking it later down the road .

328100
windows-vista	windows
don t use the windows key for keyboard shortcuts in your program the windows-vista user experience guidelines says the following under guidelines - interaction - keyboard

328102
selection-sort	quicksort
use quicksort or selection-sort instead..

328125
nsnotification	uiwindow
if a variables is supposed to contains a uiwindow but it has an nsnotification in it instead the same underlying code error could be manifesting itself in a different way when the debugger isn t in operation

328135
put	get
if i put the other control before in the z-order i can not get the mouse message in my control

328190
xsd	xml
spring s xsd allows to contain any xml through

328198
methods	extend
you can extend the fileinfo type with the following extension methods

328201
value	field
the second one is almost the same but you can create a list of your own type for example if you have two field count and non-zero value you can create a class which will have two properties and then you can create a list of your class and store information in it

328202
annotations	mapping
i m considering using annotations to define my hibernate mapping but have run into a problem i want to use a base entity class to define common fields including the id field but i want different tables to have different id generation strategies

328203
json	xml
instead of using eval which is not quite safe you can use your own format alternatively xml or json for which there are plenty of libs and parse it yourself

328206
order	add
the question here is do i branch out my current studentsviewcontroller and add complex logic in order to allow it to display an individual school s students or would you experts recommend a new class to handle that table

328225
superclass	subclass
in the code above it looks like you re mixing annotations on fields superclass and methods subclass

328225
subclassing	base-class
instead move that field into the subclassing and create abstract getid and setid methods in your base-class

328281
account	api
there was an api with an account

328289
perl	awk
on the whole this seems to be a task better suited to a line processing language like awk or perl

328354
put	get
jasper includes an imageservlet class that fetches these from the session where the jrhtmlexporter has put them but you have to get the configuration of both the html exporter and image servlet just right and its hard to tell where you re going wrong

328380
any	set
i say this because i believe they have the site set up so you can double click on any word and get the definition

328384
arrays	loops
the problem is that isprime also loops through the primes arrays

328395
webforms	asp.net
i am wondering what is the best resource for ramping up quickly with asp.net and webforms not mvc

328438
uitabbarcontroller	uitabbaritem
i ve always been baffled about the strange coupling in the iphone api -- in particular with the uiviewcontroller which has hard-coded references to a uitabbaritem uitabbarcontroller etc

328438
uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller
so you end up adding a uiviewcontroller to a uitabbarcontroller which in turn queries the uiviewcontroller as to what should be displayed on the uitabbar through the uiviewcontroller s tabbaritem property

328441
any	set
in this case you re never resetting the font size so once you set that font size on a cell it will be used on any row after it that re-uses the cell

328451
python	c++
i would like to call python script files from my c++ program

328451

embedding python in c c++ part i

328451
python	c++
embedding python in c c++ part ii

328451
python	c++
embedding python in multi-threaded c c++ applications

328461
server-side-includes	ssi
many webserver support some form of ssi server-side-includes this feature lets you add some tags into the html as a very limited form of scripting much simpler and faster and older than php

328461
perl	php
the backends can be an http server usually apache or fastcgi processes php python perl whatever or a farm of either or both

328465
asp.net-mvc	webforms
so i m about to start of a small project for my sporting club for member registrations and i m trying to decide between webforms or asp.net-mvc

328465
asp.net-mvc	webforms
allit will be is a user login and data capture forms or and data retrieval so i was initally thinking webforms with fba but i ve wanted to have a play with asp.net-mvc for a while and i was thinking that it wouldn t be too bad a choice

328465
asp.net-mvc	webforms
so what s a good way to decide if webforms or asp.net-mvc is the right choice

328473
margins	padding
the structure.css file would contains rules that only used properties like height width margins padding float positioning etc

328473
contains	elements
this would effectively contains the building blocks necessary to arrange the elements of the page the way you want

328485
.net	wcf
wcf is microsoft s replacement for .net remoting and web services

328485
.net	wcf
this book is advertised in several places around the .net as coming with juval lowy s servicemodelex library which is supposed to be this awesome wcf framework that extends and simplifies wcf development

328535
perl	ruby
ruby python perl with wxwidgets gtk qt bindings

328539
perl	tcl
you can embed perl python tcl and ruby

328557
lookup	any
in fact i hardly use my mouse ever when coding or any voodoo programming-specific lookup features.

328562
asp.net-mvc	webforms
as for as webforms being the quick and nasty solutions i worry that is asp.net-mvc propaganda

328577
python	java
i m a long time c++ java developer trying to get into python and am looking for the stereotypical python for c++ developers article but coming up blank

328594
perl	awk
languages like php show their script-behind-a-webpage heritage just in the way that awk perl are very much suited to general purpose admin scripts on unix boxes

328594
perl	ruby
obvious examples would be python ruby or perl though i d greatly recommend one of the first two

328602
python	c++
python is sufficiently different from c++ so that specific knowledge can t normally be transferred

328604
teamcity	msbuild
as compared to teamcity s support for msbuild scripts vsts only supports msbuild scripts

328604
msbuild	nant
i ve hacked around this in the past by exec ing nant from msbuild

328604
vsts	tfs
so when you re using the full microsoft stack vsts and tfs i d suggest just sticking with msbuild scripts

328623
order	add
i m trying to leverage regular expressions to add a css a class to the first and last list items within an order list

328639
environment	execution
you can just see the execution plan for both and check for yourself nothing will beat that measurement for your specific query in your specific environment with your data.

328644
any	set
from what i understand you re only guaranteed identical results provided that you re dealing with the same instruction set and compiler and that any processors you run on adhere strictly to the relevant standards ie ieee754

328660
braces	macros
jonathan s suggestion is good but since c99 we have variadic macross so one doesn t need to use double braces for debugging macros

328689
python	c++
python and c++ are very different beasts and although they are both considered general purpose programming languages they are targetted towards different ends of the programming spectrum

328689
python	c++
don t try to write c++ in python

328689
python	c++
in fact try to forget c++ when writing python

328689
python	c++
i found it far better to learn the common python paradigms and techniques and apply them to my c++ programs than the other way around

328763
external	host
the style control can both host inline-styles in-between itâ s opening and closing tags and a reference to a external style sheet file through its cssurl property

328790
lightbox	jquery
jquery lightbox gets my vote

328797
icollection	ienumerable
icollection n a use ienumerable t or anything that extends it

328797
icollection	ienumerable
this makes the interfaces similar in name only while icollection and ienumerable t differ by very little

328799
data-structures	tree
i wonder how many of you have implemented one of computer science s classical algorithms like dijkstra s algorithm or data-structures binary search tree in a real world not academic project

328813
directory	folder
so i would use folder or path to identify the directory that the file is in

328831
linked-list	arrays
taking a trivial example don t you think there s a benefit to knowing what the difference is list or your language s equivalent dynamic arrays implementation and linked-list or your language s equivalent

328841
callgrind	valgrind
if you are using linux i suggest using callgrind part of valgrind to find out what parts of the execution takes the most time

328909
malloc	free
what is the difference between new delete and malloc free

328911
contains	sorted
after this sorted_files contains the sorted list where the 0th element is the newest file and each element itself contains a reference to the results of stat with the filename itself in the last element

328928
any	set
you ll also need to set up permissions on any users that may have been transferred as well as they aren t held within the database

328936
freebsd	linux
if it is possible i want to get the same id from linux or freebsd or solaris etc.

328936
hash	md5
if there is no other option available i can use mac in combination with something else for example the id can be the md5 hash of the combination of the mac address and something else

328942
uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller
instead it sends a message to the uitabbarcontroller to switch to the uiviewcontroller as indicated by the selected tab bar item

328953
client-server	security
as a rule of thumb as you said you should validate as early as possible but in client-server applications it s important to validate data as soon as possible on the server to prevent security problems that might arise

328959
arguments	default
in that case the default sort invocation without a third arguments will work

328973
solaris	linux
both solaris and linux provide the hostid 1 utility

328980
callback	methods
when is the best time to dispatch a callback to the user-interface when using a helper loading methods like the two below

328992
pointers	stack
that reference is evidence that you have a copy of the smart pointers earlier in stack and only one thread owns a call stack so that pre-existing copy isn t going away

329009
linked-list	arrays
this might sound too school-masterish but these classical algorithms were not invented to give college students exam questions they were invented to solve problems or improve on current solutions just like the arrays the linked-list or the stack are building blocks to write a program so are some of these

329009
subtraction	addition
just like in math where you move from addition and subtraction to integration and differentiation these are advanced techniques that will help you solve problems that are out there

329023
mac-address	ethernet
the most common host identifier it uses is the ethernet mac-address for one of your network interfaces smashed together without any separator

329023
mac-address	ethernet
while the mac-address is extremly easy to fake it is a nearly universal identifer nowadays almost all new computers have at least one ethernet port and it is very common for them to be onboard and actually intended to be globally unique in fact the ethernet protocols depend on this uniqueness

329041
localization	translation
this is primarily regarding the user-interface localization translation part of your app

329042
python	c++
if you have a c++ that needs to be a bit more flexible boost.python can give you a good excuse to learn python and get paid for it

329045
ienumerator	ienumerable
i m not saying that ienumerable or ienumerator are bad interfaces

329058
ienumerator	ienumerable
why do you think microsoft wants us to go through ienumerable to get to ienumerator

329073
ienumerator	ienumerable
it is a matter of seperating responsibilities ienumerable is a class that can be iterated over ienumerator is a class that does the iteration

329085
serialization	marshalling
if you need fast serialization use marshalling module

329094
malloc	free
for example if you had used malloc to allocate memory then you should free and if you had used new to allocate then you should use delete

329125
methods	extend
i m struggling to think of a good way to use linq2sql simply i want to use it but i can t figure out whether it s best to wrap up the linq2sql generated classes inside my model classes providing some form of generic abstract base class or interface for the common methods on my model classes like add update delete etc or to extend the partial classes that linq2sql generated

329131
malloc	free
some performance notes about new delete and malloc free

329131
malloc	free
malloc and free do not call the constructor and deconstructor respectively

329131
realloc	malloc
i suggest staying consistent with new malloc usage unless you have a reason realloc

329131
malloc	free
also you won t mess up by free ing something allocated with new or deleting something allocated with malloc

329141
selected	button
go into the debugging run dialog drop down button next to the bug go button and in the arguments tab set the working directory by selected other and then putting in the relevant directory name

multiplication	addition
one of the most popular answers i got was 1 flop an addition and a multiplication operation

329180
imultivalueconverter	ivalueconverter
however you can use an ivalueconverter or imultivalueconverter to help yourself out

329183
multiplying	subtract
as an example if you take exactly one second for an operation such as adding subtract multiplying or dividing two value and returning the result your performance is simply 1 flops

329185
multiplication	addition
some cpu s can perform addition and multiplication as one operation others can t for example

329185
.when	ready
you need to know that i m not getting the fp throughput that should be possible so clearly other parts of my code are preventing fp instructions from being available .when the cpu is ready to issue one

329195
g++	gcc
if you are using them you have to as other answers already noted link with g++ instead of gcc which will add -lstdc++ for you

329209
event-log	logfile
i m not a big fan of the windows event-log personally. then have a background-service on each box which uploads the logfile into a database-table - keeping tracking of which log entry came from which box

329217
emacs	vim
unfortunately no mode can make emacs work as fast as vim

329223
execute	prepare
using a prepare and execute style means that only one place execute needs to know about escaping if escaping is even necessary

329240
georss	kml
no like you have mentioned html in the description is the only way i know that you can control the style of balloons through kml georss feed

329243
multiplication	addition
since most processor can do an addition comparison or multiplication in a single cycle those are all counted as one flop

329243
multiplication	addition
if a processor has a fused multiply-add instruction that does a multiplication and an addition in a single instruction -- generally a + b c -- that counts as 2 operations

329271
value	field
this allows validators to express i have no opinion instead of returning a misleading true value think rangevalidator indicating an empty field is valid so it plays nice with requiredfieldvalidator

329319
json	xml
if you want to consume such as making requests the best way to interact with it is to figure out the type it will comback as usually json or xml

superclass	subclass
any idea how i can make the superclass create an instance of the subclass

329399
pointers	stack
in c++ on stack a simple variables is assigned a memory address so that we can use a pointers to contains this memory to point to it

329409
sql-server	mysql
for what it s worth microsoft sql-server and mysql are the only brands of database that support multi-table updates and the syntax each uses is not similar

329416
implements	abstract
interfaces have no implementation they have to be implements by classes which can be abstract by the way

329423
arrays	map
i understand how map is easily parallelizable - each computer cpu can just operate on a small portion of the arrays

329429
any	set
i was wondering if there was a way of telling subversion that it shouldn t store a local revision copy of a certain set of files my pdf files but just sync with the server whenever a change is made to any of these files

329443
product	invoice
the invoice model probably won t inherited from activerecord base because it doesn t for the sake of the example let s make this assumption have a table it s a composite of customer order product price and orderitem

329481
parallels	vmware
vmware and parallels snapshot features is perfect for this

329481
ubuntu	debian
you would install debian or ubuntu then take a snapshot how-to for vmware and parallels

329487
websphere	ibm
if you plan to develop enterprise-grade java applications the only acceptable choice today is the ibm everyplace websphere micro envinronment previously known as j9 jvm which is not free though the license is pretty inexpensive

329505
arguments	default
we had an odd situation where the default set arguments for the ado connection were causing an sp to take ages to run from the client which we resolved by looking at exactly what the server was receiving from the client complete with default set arguments compared to what was sent when executing from ssms

329510
python	perl
the python package index plays a role similar to that of cpan in the perl world and has a list of many third party modules of one sort or another

i have uinavigationcontroller in each of my tabs and when i restore the uinavigationitem s are still there i can use the back buttons and so on to change them but the view controllers are just gone

329527
boost-regex	pcre
use boost-regex or an external library like pcre

329527
unix	bsd
in a unix environment you almost certainly have access to the bsd regular expression tools regcomp regerror regexec regfree which are c-like rather than c++-like but do work

329537
windows-media-player	embed
i m pretty sure you can embed windows-media-player on a page to play it but that ll limit you to clients running windows and who happen to have media player install

329537

329587
attributes	properties
the attributes on a properties have little or nothing to do with archiving behavior they only describe how getters and setters work

329587
any	set
if you think about all the bits of state that you can t set in interface builder -- any number of these features may not be supported by the class implementation of nscoding

329622
rollback	commit
yes i know in a perfect world i would fix that instead of implementing commit and rollback but i am forced to not do that

329622
rollback	commit
i think that somehow i could use commit rollback at the beginning and end of the while-loop to do this but don t know how

329632
windows-xp	windows
windows 2000 has asp windows-xp professional also can run it

329665
distance	polygons
so you can dynamically create a polygons that is your zip code extended by a certain distance at every point

329715
textbox	button
clicking the button shows the textbox on top of the inkcanvas

329742
emacs	vim
as for an editor if you like cli stuff then emacs or vim is the way to go i prefer emacs

329748
hostname	router
if you do not have static ip you can use a free service like dyndns.org to give you a hostname and you run a small client to keep the dns for that hostname pointed to your router s ip

329758
decimal-point	digits
so this would allow you five digits after the decimal-point and 10 digits before the decimal-point which seems ample for your application

329758
multiplying	addition
no overhead for addition cost of a multiplying or divide double

329808
rhino-mocks	moq
i personally have been working with moq and i like it--there is also rhino-mocks plus others

she demonstrates using adplus to take a dump of an asp.net application that is consuming a great deal of ram then loading that dump into windbg for analysis

329837
constructor	object
i need to create simple reusable javascript object publishing several methods and parameterized constructor

329838
derived-class	base-class
it may even be possible that the derived-class will have no extra fields only function which would work with the arrays on the base-class

329846
constructor	object
when you use it in the constructor it will refer to the new object that s being created

329850
put	get
fwiw i ve frequently put interesting information in error dumps -- i ve found it s easier to get people to report it in bug reports and they re more likely to accurately report something like myrtle as opposed to error #47 or whatever.

329862
filtering	grouping
a bit of a hacky solution is to use in with a grouping by and having filtering

329883
versioning	upgrade
you can then write scripting to check for updated versioning etc to avoid having to mess around with manual upgrade

329885
json	xml
pretty much all you need to do is pass in the uri required with any parameters needed in the form of a query string and you should get back the response in the form of a string be it json or xml

329900
background-image	width
right now the issue i m running into is to have the masthead resize depending on the width of the page something that i understand isn t possible given current browser implementation of css3 s background-image size

329906
relational-model	datamodel
in most cases iâ ve designed my datamodel first in a way that takes the existing data and organizes it into the relational-model

329913
python	perl
i come most recently from a background with perl so with issues like this i find it very helpful to type python at the command line and drop into interactive mode and just a start trying things and b refine the niceties by hitting up-arrow and adjusting my previous attempt until i get what i want

329915
idisposable	ienumerator
one item that may trip you up is that ienumerator t additionally implements idisposable so curvepointenumerator and rtratepointenumerator will need to have a dispose methods added

329925
mac-address	ethernet
a program that i work on assumes that the uuid generated by the windows rpc api call uuidcreatesequential contains the mac-address of the primary ethernet adapter

329926
contains	any
the video model object contains data representing your video and any houskeeping stuff you need which include updateviewcount

329958
shell	bash
because bash and most other unix shell environments regard 0 as success and -x as a system error and x as a user-defined error

329975
background-image	width
if you are trying to expand your background-image to the width of your page it is better to use a fixed-sized layout as there is no cross-browser methods to making a background-image expand to varying sizes that are dependent on the visitors resolution

329981
account	userid
with regard to passwords you can prevent password sharing by having an authentication process that uses a secure connection tsl and https and that on the client side computes a hash of the user-suppled password along with machine and user-account the userid with you and the user account on the client computer associated data

329995
crypt	salt
it says that since the length of the salt may vary depending on the underlying crypt implementation you should provide the entire crypted password as the salt value when checking passwords

330022
push	pull
i believe you can continue to pull remote changes into your local repository but have changes you never push back

330039
crypt	salt
char crypt const char key const char salt

330039
contains	set
note the set aâ zaâ z0â 9. contains 64 characters and 64 #42

330043
arrays	loops
i have generic code that handles this very nicely for most cases but this arrays of structures case is throwing the marshaller for a loops

330045
value	field
but this next code lacking the quotation marks in the value field just as your first example does produces the error you report because value 3 thing resolves to value 3 abcde causing your sql-server to look for a field called abcde and there is no field by that name

330045
value	field
which as mentioned above causes your sql-server to read the item in the value set as another field name

330045
value	field
as given this actually runs on mysql without complaint and will fill the field called process with null because that s what the field called process contains when mysql looked there for a value as it created the new record

330065
latitude-longitude	location
if you re clustering on geographic location and i can t imagine it being anything else - you could store the cluster id in the database along with the latitude-longitude co-ordinates

330074
nsarray	plist
i ve one plist file and i want to parsing it and copy it s content into nsarray and code that i am using for that is

330085

show in the next section.

330092
shell	tcsh
edit i am using shell tcsh

330095
observers	listener
so for example i was actually passing this as an object to notify registered it as a listener observers whatever idiom you like but it had already died once the notification was sent and i d get the exc_bad_access

330105
linux	unix
i m presuming you re on a linux unix system

330109
shell	bash
however in a more common shell like bash references to the variable generates random numbers

330109
shell	bash
so in your shell script a bash shell script here the contents would be

330117
sql-server	oracle
i am running oracle and sql-server 2oo5 on the same server

330120
keydown	keyup
you might want to use sdl_getkeystate instead of keeping tracking of keydown keyup

330133
google-chrome	safari
the color plugin has issues with safari and google-chrome

330169
formatting	printing
how do i use string formatting stuff to printing such things as 0

reflection	runtime
you can use reflection to get the button at runtime and fire the event

330226
state-machines	automata
the automata via macros paper presents a functional-programming pearl on implements finite state-machines via macros in scheme

330232
hash	md5
md5 does not create a unique hash value

330260
rollback	commit
this should be possible to implement using transactions commit rollback or undo

330267
hash	md5
opens source code for crypto hash implementations md5 and sha can be found at mozilla code

330280
execute	prepare
calling a prepare statement is a lot safer no sql-injection possible and doing so in a loop is more efficient as well because only parameter value are sent to the server on execute instead of whole statements

330301
contains	set
it allows you to set up a cache and object which allows you to call code if a key is not contains in a map

330315
any	set
is there any way in which i can test my scenario so that i can set the autocleanup days to 1 and i dont t have to wait an entire day to see if my code works

330331
any	set
the plugins doesn t set any header for encoding charset at all and since i have no control at all of the backend and what headers get set i can t change this

330340
where-clause	sql
i have found from experience that using an or predicate in a where-clause can be detrimental in terms of performance because sql will have to evaluate each clause separately and it might decide to ignore indexes and use a table scan

330352
contains	set
then the style of the contains block needs to have line height set

330358
hash	md5
if hash functions such as md5 were reversible then it would have been a watershed event in the history of data compression algorithms

330371
perl	ruby
one thing that made me a much more productive developer on the oop side of things was the discovery of object-relational mappers like mygeneration d00dads for .net class dbi for perl activerecord for ruby etc

330374
multiplication	addition
addition or multiplication of 2 long long s

330377
32-bit	64bit
64bit numbers on 32-bit machines are implemented as you think

330380
32-bit	64bit
on the ia-32 architecture 64bit integer are implemented in using two 32-bit registers eax and edx

330385
32-bit	64bit
they don t do 64bit addititions directly but use the carry flag and a special add-instruction to build a 64bit add from two 32-bit adds

330389
versioning	migrate
since we support a number of sap versioning it becomes very difficult to track versioning and migrate code across 4.6 4.7 5.0 etc

330400
32-bit	64bit
as everyone has stated a 64bit integer is typically implemented by simply using two 32-bit integers together

330409
packets	ping
to verify this possiblity install wireshark previously aka ethereal on your client machine and observe any dns request packets leaving it when you run the ping command

330411
hosts-file	hosts
do you have an entry for weddinglist in your hosts

330414
value	field
this code can then either do generic things test if the field value can be updated in the beforeupdate event order the recordset ascending descending in the onclick event etc or specific treatments based on the form s and or the control s name making for example some work in a afterupdate event such as calculating the value of a totalamount control out of the unitprice and quantity values

330433
children	nodes
take an xml parsing make it generate a dom document object model and then build a recursive algorithm that traverses all the nodess calls text in each nodes that should give you the text in the current nodes and all children and puts that as a key in the dictionary

330453
selected	checkbox
i am trying to get an asp.net 3.5 listview control to selected and highlight lines through checkbox displayed in the first column

330453
selected	checkbox
if i use an asp linkbutton instead of a checkbox the line selectedion is supported automatically through the linkbutton s property commandname selected

330453
selected	button
and as soon as i managed to do that how do i get the selected items on pressing a submit button on the form

330463
duplicates	elements
here s a parsing that will do what you need although you ll need to tweak it to combine duplicates elements into one dictionary key

330485
selected	button
i want to add to the user-interface so that for example a rightclick on a combobox or click a button at the side of the combobox opens up a dialogbox that handles the showing and selected of the items easier on a touch screen

330485
listbox	textbox
controls i want to enhance or replace are listbox comboboxes and textbox

330487
contains	set
edit2 in fact the ocs code seems to contains code for most platforms to do this so while there may be no one set of code that does this you may be able to re-use their ideas

330487
linux	bsd
other bits cover bsd linux macos.

330491
haskell	erlang
maybe you should be using erlang or haskell if you want to go the pure fp route

330491
python	ruby
i m mostly interested in programming languages and have been playing with lisp clos scheme erlang python and a bit of ruby

330518
driver	kernel
you may want to look at tibbo vspdl for creating a linux virtual serial-port using a kernel driver -- it seems pretty new and is available for download right now beta version

330520
value	field
preferably done in a declarative manner screening off invalid inputs before it even reaches the presenter ensure that the text field value is within a-b range by setting the min and max properties

330526
value	field
depending on a database field value i want to set the navigateurl property

16-bit	8bit
void rbuf16 copy const tdesc8 will take an 8bit descriptor and convert it into a 16-bit descriptor

330711
macros	vba
another option might be to run a vba macros on sending the email which converts the markdown formatting to x html

330720
contains	any
while there is precious little documentation about the appinitialize methods you are correct in your assumption that any class in your app_code folder that contains a methods signature like this

330762
silverlight	wpf
the missing piece in silverlight that affects more to the model-view-viewmodel pattern is that it doesnâ t implements commands like wpf

330762
silverlight	wpf
here is an article by josh smith that reproduces the command pattern of wpf in silverlight

330780
value	field
if you want to get just the value of the first field you can use mysql_result

330848
python	php
what s most appropriate for deploying a python or php web app on my own

330851
silverlight	wpf
the prevailing story today is to use the same mvvm pattern that wpf has had success with searching for silverlight and mvvm will yield a lot of info

330853
compact-framework	.net
i need a api that works on ce x86 + .net compact-framework to play videos similar to coreplayer api.

330883
bazaar	git
in my examples i will be assuming you use subversion for your version control but it works virtually the same with other version control packages such as git or bazaar

330887
web-applications	scalability
even multithreading is being used web-applications are designed to be able to run multi-processing environments for both scalability and easier deployment

i m not sure if c# is implements differently than java but it usually has some default size and if you add more than that it extends the set

331088
calling-convention	extern-c
i m assuming that you can get past the name mangling and calling-convention which isn t difficult if you use a compiler with compatible mangling i think vc6 is broadly compatible with vs2008 or if you use extern-c

331118
smalltalk	lisp
do you know any preferably opensource lisp smalltalk apps

331143
click	mouse
a good way determining which text run is under the mouse click when the user clicks somewhere on a text block

value	field
convert it to string representation of a javascript arrays val1 val2 val3 and shove it into the value field of a hidden input

331159
checkbox	textbox
attributes are set by field controls within your windows textbox checkbox and dropdown lists rather than menu items toolbar controls or ribbon controls

331171
configuration	environment
if you don t like to have a separate build configuration which i think would make most sense you could define an environment variables on your build server which you then can test for in you post-build script

331175
environment	building
you could use environment variables in the post building scripting

331180
windows-mobile	symbian
with the new tool that creates installation packages for the different platforms windows-mobile symbian and other it will be a little bit easier to deploy also

331182
postback	ajax
it s not asp.net-mvc specific but it is cross browser and allows you to get the value back via postback or ajax

331184
order	add
i would add a second model that had a has_one relationship in order to keep the app restful and simple

331228
linux	unix
there s gui and command line versions and it supports windows linux mac and unix for both the server and client

331228
perl	c++
it integrates with eclipse and has apis for writing your own client applications c c++ ruby perl python it only supports two users and five workspaces before you need to buy licenses though but that is within the scope of this question

331244
credentials	security
if security is not a big concern perhaps it makes sense to run your existing web page under an application-pool running under the service account credentials

331248
python	c++
symbian nokia largely is c++ natively but python and others exist pretty niche environments though

331252
windows-xp	windows

331276
constructor	object
it would be a great start if i knew what object didn t have a parameterless constructor

331280
python	java
i m considering using amqp using qpid to enable a mixture of python and java services communicate with each other

331280
json	xml
my instinct then is to use xml de- serialization or something similar json yaml protocol buffers etc. which has good library support in both languages

331283
crypt	md5
for some added strength you can get the crypt module to use md5 by using a salt in the format

331283
hash	md5
md5 and now even sha1 may be broken but they are still relatively good for password hash and md5 is still the standard for linux local passwords

331290
logging	trace
try and trace logically what s happening by logging out the event triggers

331300
solaris	aix
i ve had good success with io interface on linux and solaris and i think it even worked on aix but i can t recall for sure

331303
constructor	object
you can create a metafile object using the following constructor

331314
methods	extend
the most important is that you no longer have to extend testcase nor do your test methods have to begin with test. it s all annotation-based now

331317
httpwebrequest	webrequest
if you have a plain webrequest be sure to cast it to an httpwebrequest first

331317
content-length	content-type
content-length content-type useragent etc all need to be set this way

331324
turkish	french
in us english igloo igloo and resume rã sumã but in turkish a lower case i is ä dotless and in french cote means quote cã tã means side and cã te means coast

331327
webforms	asp.net
like asp.net webforms where you don t have control over ihttphandler creation and cannot setup factories that would use ioc to instantiate those

331349
xml-serialization	ixmlserializable
an alternative to adding xml-serialization attributes to all of your classes is to implement the ixmlserializable interface on the root element container class

331381
reflection	runtime
this is often in conjunction with reflection which is not type safe at compile time but can be at runtime

331397
order	join
the left join is used because you stated you wanted to show all customers - if they haven t got any order then the latestorderid will be null

331407
ubuntu	linux
in linux ubuntu i have my panel set to be somewhat transparent and when i add a gif with a transparent background the background of the icon shows up all grey and ugly see image green diamond

331423
dictionary	map
a simple-ish bandage for the problem though might be to map the text representations that you place into the combobox or listview to the original objects using a dictionary field member on your form class

331423
icollection	ienumerable
the official defense is likely to be that they wanted to support the standard ienumerable and icollection interfaces

331490
any	set
i assume the extra retains are probably set to autorelease by the cocoa enumeration logic and won t really have any effect in the current event loop

331494
selected	button
click the office button selected excel options go to the customize tab

331494
show	next
at this point the forms command will show up on the quick access toolbar next to the save and undo redo icons

331511
getter	setter
one option is to just type the value property as a string write a getter and a setter for it and do the parsing there

331511
getter	setter
the below example is the width property getter and setter from mx.core.uicomponent

331518
perl	php
you could try with apache asp in your linux but i ll use it just for the meantime until can migrate the application to other language with better support php perl python java ruby.

331521
progress-bar	progress
if it s not practical for some reason to get an actual progress report that is if using cursor as dicroce suggested turns out to be untenable too slow whatever you can use a marquee progress-bar to show that your user-interface is still responding and you haven t forgotten about the user

331527
.net	wcf
there is a corollary here to server activated objects in .net remoting one of the technologies that is replaced by wcf which have two modes single call stateless and singleton stateful

331530
constructor	private
you cannot subclass tooltipmanager because of the package private constructor and the showtipwindow and hidetipwindow are also package private so the adapter pattern is out as well

331550
value	field
adding a clean_sku which returns instance.sku ensures the field value will not change on form level

331564
put	get
the question is should be how get a full name of type in design time i want to put it in web.config

331568
contains	elements
i need to create an xmldocument with a root elements contains multiple namespaces

331568
contains	elements
my question how do i create an xmldocument that contains a root elements with multiple namespaces

331574
svnadmin	dump
for a 1.4 repository i d recommend using svnadmin dump and svndumpfilter to perform the movement of the existing trunk elsewhere then moving the branch to the trunk with the same mechanism

331579
gridview	datalist
gridview and datalist are better then the older versions

331579
datalist	listview
listview and datapager is our brand spanking new asp 3.5 control and is even more free form then datalist

331593
rewrite	rule
put the rule for test in before the rule for everything else but give it an flag to stop the rewrite rule processing there if it matches

331607
arrays	loops
i wish to make another foreach loops inside the main one that compares or performs actions on the current variable to the rest of the variables in the arrays of the object

331615
ip-address	hostname
has anyone figured out how to make jmx listen on a single ip-address or hostname

331619
having	select
or is there a fast way to do series of insert with data fetched from a previous select query while having about the same performance as insert...select.

331633
any	set
the headers must be set prior to getting the inputstream to have any affect - an illegalstateexception will be thrown if the connection is already open

331640
enumerator	any
each time you execute foreach even while nesting them the internal enumerator should new up a new iterator for you there should not be any issue with that

331652
subtraction	addition
long ago i wrote 64-bit multiplication and division routines for a computer the z80 that could manage 16-bit addition and subtraction with no hardware multiplication at all

331664
credentials	security
then we have some generic security code that we can use to request a users credentials from inside the session beans based on the users identity from their initial login just as you are doing it via getcallerprincipal

331692
lookup	any
generally windows functions are much faster than any lookup using max on large number of records

331695
cryptography	security
my first thought was to simply use a cryptography hash function like md5 or sha1 but this seems like overkill security isn t important - doesn t need to be one-way and i d prefer to find something that would produce a shorter id

331709
cursor	row
most likely with a cursor you go row by row in one table and then selected values you need from another table

331709
sorted	lookup
if the rows are sorted it will use some type of merge algorithm if one table is small it may turn one table into a hash lookup table and do the join by performing o 1 lookup from one table into the lookup table

331709
cursor	row
depending upon the cursor type fetching each row of a cursor may be the same as doing another selected from the first table

331709
sql-server	oracle
the other thing is i have heard that in oracle s case it is super optimized to do cursor operations so it s nowhere near the same penalty for set based operations versus cursors in oracle as it is in sql-server

331715
displaytag	birt
i d investigate whether displaytag can meet your requirements before committing to a heavyweight reporting solution such as birt jasper

331716
google-chrome	safari
the quicktime player opens and plays the file correctly in firefox3 safari and google-chrome

331765
webforms	asp.net
for more detail i have some functionality already implemented in perl that we want to integrate with a larger portal that we implemented in asp.net webforms

331769
http	ssl
the most demanding can be access to ssl websites but again most client http libraries cover that nowadays as well

331771
dbix-class	dbd
there is no convenient way to use dbix-class with dbd proxy named queries since the purpose of the dbix-class object-relational mapper orm is to present an object-oriented view of sql s data-manipulation language dml statements

331771
dbix-class	dbd
the named query feature of dbd proxy is not a dml statement so dbix-class does not have feature that suit your needs passing a literal string directly to the prepare function of your dbd proxy driver

331787
promise	future
the new java-me sdk comes with promise of real odd in near future

331789
32-bit	64bit
while this might not seem terrible since all new macs have a core 2 duo and support 64bit safari is still a 32-bit app and thus can t run 64bit plugins such as the java applet container

331806
sql-server	oracle
if they are not visible to the user internal primary key then just generate them sequentially using an appropriate technique such as an oracle sequence or sql-server autonumber also easy

331821
stateless	stateful
postback are an abstraction on top of web protocolss which emulate stateful behavior over a stateless protocols

331832
order	add
if you did then you have include add section in your web.config file respecting the order in of the handler modules specified in applicationhosting.config file

331853
required	checked
you can even do it yourself by writing your own action invoker which only required you to implements iactioninvoker an interface and that invoker could checked for your own iactionresult rather than actionresult

331872
keyboard	mouse
the opengl utility toolkit glut provides precisely this - you set up a bunch of event handler for things like keyboard input mouse input redrawing the display and windows resizing call the glutmainloop function and you re good to go

331887
versioning	upgrade
heck many businesses are unwilling to even upgrade to new versioning of their existing database

331893
protected	public
your finalize methods should be protected rather than public

331896
integer	zero
this function will convert your string which could start by a leading zero or not to an integer value

331918
ghostscript	imagemagick
the two options i ve found are using either ghostscript or imagemagick through the shell

331956
multiplication	division
1 multiplication and division come

331956
subtraction	addition
before addition and subtraction

331963
detailsview	formview
for various reasons this isn t using the asp.net formview or detailsview controls

331963
selected	listbox
since there is no way to disable a textbox without turning its contents gray well we could eat all of the keystrokes into it but that isn t very elegant either and disabling a dropdown list or listbox isn t what we want our first try was to duplicate all of the form input controls with a label and use css to selected which ones are visible depending on the mode of the form

331963
listbox	textbox
the problem is that i not only need to copy the contents but also the styles attributes and sizing of the original input controls at this point we re only talking about textbox - we have a different solution for dropdown lists and listbox

331992
for-loop	loops
i want to either test during the for-loops or after the loops completes for where this empty element is and then replace it with the word other

332012
arguments	default
your custom classes in the action arguments must have a parameterless constructor in order to use the default model binder

332025
put	get
another good place to put them is when you click on a picture to get a larger version in an internet store or something

332050
python	php
python or php are not quit new but they have actively developing crowd of funs and specialists

332055
keyboard	mouse
-control mouse and keyboard

332078
persistence	hibernate
database persistence is much easier with frameworks such as hibernate and ibatis than with entity beans even in the new java ee standard

332078
spring	guice
have a look at a dependency injection framework like spring and guice

332078
persistence	hibernate
answers suggested j2ee the big picture and manning publications for books like spring in action and java persistence with hibernate

332079
hash	md5
i m working with some example java code for making md5 hash

332086
base-class	inherited
it is unnecessary when casting upwards towards a base-class but when casting downwards it can be used as long as it doesn t cast through virtual inherited

332086
protected	public
it also can only go through public inherited - it will always fail to travel through protected or private inherited

332093
hash	md5
this what i am using for md5 hash

332101
digits	zero
a simple approach would be to check how many digits are output by integer.tohexstring and add a leading zero to each byte if needed

332103
keyboard	mouse
capturing the screen and controlling the mouse keyboard require hooking into the os in ways that java doesn t do

332109
contains	any
what i need to be able to do is also exclude a certain directory including any files or sub-directories contains within from this rule - what is the best solution

332125
gacutil	regasm
on my machine i have both the sdk and visual-studio running so currently i am utilizing .net sdk tools like gacutil and regasm

332146
versioning	upgrade
try to upgrade to the most current supported versioning of repository and or dotnetnuke

332153
function-calls	main
you ve mentioned you re not using php and there s a few php-isms in there register_shutdown_function makes sure the templates get called before object destructors but after the main scripting and the calls to this- header footer are magic function-calls that just do display header and display footer they re meant to be overridden

332162
getter	setter
i have tried this in a few projects on the theory that getter and setter clutter up the code with semantics meaningless cruft and that other languages seem to do just fine with convention-based data-hiding or partitioning of responsibilities python

332162
getter-setter	conventions
just about any automated tool in the java world relies on the getter-setter conventions

332165
versioning	upgrade
if you plan on trying to upgrade from 2.1.1 go from it to the most current versioning of 2 then go to 3 then go to 3.3.7 then go to 4.4.1 then to 4.6.2 then to 4.9.0

332166
haskell	scheme
such libraries exist for haskell standard ml ocaml f# and scheme

332191
revision	svn
svn will automatically replace this with where # is the revision number

332197
contains	set
you could also set the background-position attributes to set the background relative to the contains div

332211
postgresql	mysql
for large and complicated systems yes there are enough bugs quirks that can rear their ugly heads - i am convinced that the reason that people tend to always go with mysql over postgresql is that the name mysql is much more attractive

332213
postgresql	mysql
i am using postgresql and mysql

332213
postgresql	mysql
i think mysql get that much popular because it s available on many hosting provider and not postgresql

332214
glib	gtk
the fairly common glib library that s used in gtk and qt programming as well as standalone offers a variety of atomic operations

332230
put	get
for beginning i do not want to put excessive effort but rather would love to able to get some basic results

332251
instrumentation	debugging
at terracotta we do a lot of bytecode instrumentation and sometimes it helps to turn off the verifier as we debugging our class adapters so we can see where exactly they fail at runtime

332254
subtract	formula
my initial try was with an extra column with a formula subtract end time from start time but without a repeating number of steps or the same start and end steps i m having difficulty seeing how this formula would work

332254
value	field
i can change the field settings on the time data to return grouping value such as count or max but am struggling to see how this can be setup to show max time - min time for each id hence why i m thinking about heading to sql

332254
selected	cells
solutions to this are to either use the pivot table toolbar to turn off getpivotdata formulae or rather than clicking on the pivot table when selected cells in the formula type the cell references instead h4-g4

332266
oracle	mysql
i ve used mysql and still use oracle and mysql is as bad as they make it out to be

332266
oracle	mysql
we had a number of applications that were tiny one or two tables no more than 50k rows and instead of using oracle which at the time wasn t allowed due to licensing we developed on mysql

332266
sql-server	oracle
but then the apps that it ran under didn t need an oracle or a sql-server to run

332270
postgresql	mysql
you should read this interesting comparison between postgresql and mysql that really expands on the important differences

332284
onmouseover	onclick
is searching for javascript within the href and onclick onmouseover etc

332297
treeview	listview
some controls are listview some are treeview some are custom controls some are controls that do custom paint cycles

332297
treeview	listview
how can i point multiple listview and treeview to the same image list component

332303
url-encoding	url
first of the url could be encoded using html entities or url-encoding or a mixture of both

332306
oracle	mysql
mysql has been growing beyond its little database engine that could origins trying very hard to crash the traditional high-scale rdbms market and take on the dominant trio of oracle ms sql server and ibm db2

332306
postgresql	mysql
postgresql was long considered the primary competitor to mysql since both are open-source

332307
postgresql	rdbms
in the meantime db2 oracle mssql and postgresql are wiser choices for mission critical applications as these were all built as real rdbms from go and allow you to sleep soundly at night knowing your data is completely safe

332311
default-value	arguments
the figure class then uses this as the default-value for one of its arguments

332314
oracle	mysql
i ve worked with one application that could use any major db mssql oracle mysql informix db2 sybase etc

332334
dictionary	arrays
i usually create an arrays of dictionary

332377
constructor	object
for now the work around is to generate the guid on the client ideally in the constructor of your object rather than on the server

332398
textmate	vim
text editors i tried dreamweaver textmate vim

332398
ubuntu	linux
operating systems i tried mac os x linux ubuntu

332398
ubuntu	linux
ftp clients i tried transmit mac filezilla linux ubuntu

332410
postgresql	mysql
i work for a web based company that uses mysql as it s primary db but close to a year ago we started working with gis data and decided to use postgresql for that information

332410
postgresql	mysql
i learned postgresql grudgingly and have since come to like it but at the same time it has helped me appreciate mysql even more

332421
xml-serialization	ixmlserializable
an alternative is to use xml-serialization and implement ixmlserializable which has methods for serializing and deserializing allowing you to control the entire process.

332424
swing	swt
this is related to swt vs swing performance issues though the differences are no so big as on java 1.4 days

332429
constructor	object
now all of your object will have the function getname that will return the name of the constructor as a string

332429
constructor	object
every object has a value for its constructor property but depending on how that object was constructed as well as what you want to do with that value it may or may not be useful

332429
constructor	object
generally speaking you can use the constructor property to test the type of the object like so

332429
constructor	object
objects constructed via new thingy will have a constructor property that points to object not thingy

332429
iframe	popup
using .constructor for type checking will break when you want to check the type of objects coming from different windows objects say that of an iframe or a popup windows

332429
constructor	object
the instanceof operator is a clean way of testing object type as well but has its own potential issues just like the constructor property

332447
constructor	object
edit jason s deleted his post for some reason so just use object s constructor property

332459
postgresql	mysql
i m currently considering which is a better choice for my php application - mysql which i m more familiar with or postgresql which has less php support no object-oriented wrapper but seems tried and tested

332480
subtyping	generics
the relationship between this subtyping table and the generics product table is one-to-one

332480
subtyping	generics
that is the primary key in the subtyping table is also a foreign key to the generics product table

332519
malloc	strdup
you are missing error-handling for the malloc strdup failing case btw

332547
hash	md5
generate an md5 hash of the file after each step in saving and transport to find where it changes

332556
connection-pooling	pool
this may be caused when you have connection-pooling enabled and for whatever reason one connection in the pool loses its connection to the db due to a network hickup or any other reason

332566
g++	gcc
the -l argument to gcc g++ tells the linker what library ies to add in

332566
g++	gcc
gcc g++ command line -lfoo

332571
shared-objects	.so
yes they are called shared-objects or .so files

332580
any	set
is there an easy way in either language to generate a large set of random data quickly so far all the functions i ve tried haven t worked too well when i need to generate a grouping of say 500 000 characters any ideas

332602
subclassing	superclass
a in true object-oriented fashion it s possible that the superclass can exist by itself and need not be modeled in any subclassing

332607
private-members	object
each object has its own private-members

332607
getter	setter
i honestly don t know much about reflection but the getter setter should be straight forwarding

332615
superclass	subclass
i read your followup about making sure a row exists in some subclass table for every row in the superclass table

332618
triggers	insert
the student has to be insert first so that you don t violate a fk constraint in a subtable so a triggers that does a check wouldn t work

332651
apache	vhosts
i enter my alias and target on the hosts file c windows system32 drivers etc hosts and then add a respective entry on my apache vhosts config file

332651
hosts-file	hosts
i ve always entered the whole domain name that is example.com in my hosts and any requests on that name would be directed to localhost

332651
forwarding	port
now i was wondering if there s a way to only forwarding example.com on a certain port for example only example.com 8080 to the local webserver and leave example.com on the default port 80 alone so that it would still go to my live production website

332651
hosts-file	hosts
as far as i understand this might not be possible using only the hosts i tried adding the port 8080 to my domain names - didn t seem work

332652
linux	unix
the linux unix filesystem considers opened files to be another name for them

332663
any	set
many compilers accept more than this character set at this time but there isn t any guarantee

332667
for-loop	loops
while loops instead of a for-loops

332674
postgresql	mysql
another list of reasons why mysql is bad can be found at this excellent comparison versus postgresql

332681
firefox	opera
this works great in firefox safari and opera

332697
internet-explorer	google-chrome
the site has been added to the internet-explorer trusted sites list and tried in firefox and google-chrome all with the same result

332699
webserver	host
the only reason that i can think of and that i have seen for wanting to reference your local webserver with the same host name as your production webserver is due to hard-coding the server host name into your links within your application s web pages

332703
gethashcode	equals
i ve also tried overridding equals and gethashcode to use the id

332703
set	bag
the xml needs to be changed from bag to set for all collections and the entitities themselves were changed to implement icomparable which is a requirement of a set for uniqueness to be established

332705
boolean	double
one option would be a wrapper that has a float and a boolean but that canâ t work as my libraries have containers that store double and not objects that behave as double

332717
selected	cells
my app needs to build a buffer from all the selected cells on a worksheet

332717
selected	cells
i have it working correctly when the selected cells are all one contiguous grouping but if the user selects a grouping of cells then holds down the control key and selects other cells that are not contiguous to the first set of cells the worksheet s selected range only gives me information on that first grouping of cells

332719
textbox	button
for example how to trigger information in a textbox after hitting the return button instead of any input change in the windows

332726
textbox	button
to handle return button in textbox just handle keypressed event and in parameter e you have all necessary information

332731
arrays	map
then i load an ini format file with parse_ini_file and use arrays_merge to map the keys into your class config arrays

332742
bison	yacc
for many years the de facto tool for generating code to parsing a grammar was yacc or its gnu cousin bison

332742
bison	yacc
lately i ve heard there are a couple of new kids on the block but the principle is the same you write a declarative grammar in a format that is more or less in backus-naur form bnf and yacc bison whatever generates some code for you that would be extremely tedious to write by hand

332742
expression	evaluation
i haven t worked with parsing much since taking a course on compiler design in college but understanding runtime stacks lookahead parsing expression evaluation and a lot of other related things has helped me immensely to write and debugging my code effectively

332742
bison	yacc
edit given your followup question about other tools yacc bison of course are best for c++ projects since they generate c code

332749
bison	yacc
not new code - but were they new they d still use yacc or a close relative bison byacc ...

332776
environment	restart
however to avoid restart tomcat if this is a production environment and you don t want to bring the services down unncessarily you can usually just overwrite the file

332793
json	xml
it supports xml and json and conversion from basic html tables

332815
base-class	inherited
there is a difference in behaviour in diamond-shaped inheritance hierarchies where a inherited from both b and c which both inherit from a common base-class d

332823
bison	cup
i don t know about yacc bison specifically but i have used antlr cup jlex and javacc

332840
superclass	subclass
the superclass table has a subclass code column

332840
superclass	subclass
each of the subclass tables has a foreign key constraint as well as one that dictates that the id exist with a subset of the superclass table where code athlete

332840
superclass	subclass
the only missing part here is that it s possible to model a superclass without a subclass

332840
superclass	subclass
that can be fixed by adding a constraint that the superclass s ids exist in a union of the ids in the subclass tables

332842
bazaar	git
subversion and git did not have issues with this neither did bazaar iirc

332845
debugging	trace
motorola phones support a debugging interface called kdwp motodev registration required .their midway tool can also be useful for getting debug trace information from a midlet running on a device

332851
cursor	row
i d like my datagridview cursor to move right to the next column instead of moving to the next row after entering data to a cell

332851
cursor	row
i ve attempted to take control of the cursor by capturing the keys via datagridview1_keydown event but this does not prevent the cursor from moving to the next row after entering data to a cell .

332872
put	get
how do you safely encode a url using javascript such that it can be put into a get string

332893
32-bit	x86
the java jni folk figured this one out. this means that it works between separately-compiled modules of any origin so long as a struct consisting entirely of function-entry pointers a vtable is mapped to memory the same by all of them so they have to be all x86 32-bit or all x64 for example

332905
strcmp	atoi
look in the msdn documentation i m assuming you are on windows there are tchar equivalents for atoi and all the basic string functions strcpy strcmp etc.

332911
lighttpd	apache
also you could consider using lighttpd if possible instead of apache

332913
textbox	button
turns out i couldn t drop onto my textbox for some reason but dropping onto button works fine

332920
subclassing	inherited
protected - open only to the class and its subclassing inherited

332923
svnadmin	dump
if you care about retaining the history of both then you can use svnadmin dump to dump one repository and svnadmin load to load it into the other repository

332932
selected	cell
compile project and then use this extended datagridview-control instead of the normal and you ll have a datagridview that selected the next cell when pressing enter

332933
protected	public
so protected is between default and public access

332934

open only to the classes on the same package the class and its subclassing inherited

332960
sql-server	oracle
when most dbms systems grew up oracle db2 sybase ase sql-server is a cousin to sybase ase operating systems file systems were not as advanced as they were today but were progressing rapidly oracle was written in 1979

332960
postgresql	mysql
this is much less prevalent now mysql postgresql sqlite etc

332966
methods	extend
as shahkalpesh said you extension methods is incomplete you will need to add the type you want to extend see code first parm

332975
instrumentation	profiling
instrumenting profiling often aren t suitable for measuring code time particularly in microbenchmarks like yours because the cost of the instrumentation often outweighs the cost of the thing being measured

332996
hashmap	arrays
also in practice hashmap are backed by arrays with an initial size that is grown to double size when it reaches 70 fullness on average which gives a relatively good addressing space

333000
consistency	acid
databases need to attain all the acid elements atomicity consistency isolation durability and if you re going to ensure that s all done in a flat-file especially with concurrent access you ve basically written a full-blown dbms

333000
postgresql	mysql
you ll save yourself the time and money involved with writing and re-writing many times i ll guarantee if you just go with one of the free options sqlite mysql postgresql and so on

333011
key-value	key
the key will be used to determine an element of the arrays to store the key-value pair

333011
contains	elements
this problem will also crop up when we try to search for the pet key as trying to find the elements contains the pet key by performing hash_function pet will always return 18 initially

333011
contains	elements
when we find this inconsistency we ll need to resolve the collision in order to retrieve the correct elements which contains the actual pet key

333024
selected	button
yes i repro if i use a button to change the selected tab

333042
protected	public
there are actually four levels of access public protected private default also known as package-private or package protected

333046
linux	unix
for unix linux bsd there s pthread library tutorial

333079
windows-xp	windows
update i have since found the natupnp 1.0 type library natupnp.dll com component that is part of windows since windows-xp that allows you to easily setup maintain port forwarding using upnp

333084
directory-structure	filesystems
finding a file using the file name and directory-structure is very fast as most filesystems today index their directory

333089
compact-framework	.net
is .net compact-framework a subset of normal please edit .net

333089
compact-framework	.net
if not does msdn have any information anywhere on classes that are in .net compact-framework but not in normal again please edit framework

333094
any	set
now that does not mean in any way that the limit is small just that it s independent of the size of the input set

333094
tree	trie
in this case it we used a trie data structure as a dictionary a tree of characters where the leaf node contains the value for the string used as key if the key is bounded then its lookup time can be considered o 1 if i define a character field as having at most k characters in length which can be a reasonable assumption for many cases

333105
digits	zero
and make sure everything is 2 or 4 digits with leading zero

333106
element	dynamic
for example the standard dynamic arrays which doubles its capacity when it fills up requires o 1 amortized time to insert an element at the end even though some insertions require o n time - there are always enough o 1 insertions that inserting n items always takes o n time total

333128
innodb	myisam
myisam files are okay to take a copy whilst running but innodb files are not really safe to do that and windows mysql defaults to innodb files

333130
passthru	exec
so i have a client who s current host does not allow me to use tar via exec passthru ect and i need to backup the site periodicly and programmaticly so is there a solution

333144
entity-framework	ado.net
methods and calculated fields anything in the partial classes are not transmitted over ado.net data services - if you are also using ado.net data services anything you expand the entity-framework objects on in partial classes will not be transmitted over ado.net data services

333145
binary-tree	nodes
for example for a binary-tree adt bt we have null nodes and binary nodes

333145
binary-tree	nodes
so nil is a valid form of a bt but bin bin nil 1 nil 2 nil is also valid representing a binary-tree with a root nodes with a value of 2 a left child nodes with a value of 1 and a null child right nodes

333147
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
i tried gridbaglayout gave up then tried boxlayout then gave up then made my own custom layout which worked

that will use the contents of the user environment variables in the definition of the code_sign_identity building setting

333196
linux	unix
but i m a unix linux kind of guy

333198
execute	prepare
in my naive jdbc way i would prepare and execute a statement and then begin to loop through the recordset

333214
look-and-feel	substance
as far as i understand flamingo has no dependency on substance and uses whatever look-and-feel is install so the system look-and-feel should work

333216
getter	setter
with appropriate getter and setter

333217
contains	any
if you really want pass-by-reference semantics the caller will see any changes made to the parameter itself setting it to null or a reference to a different byte arrays then either methods needs to return the new value or you need to pass a reference to some sort of holder which contains a reference to the byte arrays and which can have the possibly changed reference grabbed from it later

333218
boolean	double
one option would be a wrapper that has a float ad a boolean but that canâ t work as my libraries have containers that store double and not objects that behave as double

333225
euclidean-distance	nearest-neighbor
most of my professional experience involved last-minute feature additions like hey we should add a recommendation systemd to this e-commerce site. the solution was usually a quick and dirty nearest-neighbor search - brute force euclidean-distance doomed to fail if the site ever became popular

333229
textbox	button
i would take the geeks suggestion but simplify it by removing the setfocus client script and extend it by adding the keydown event to both the search textbox and the login textbox such that the enter key fires the correct button depending on if your user is using the search box or the log in box or any other textbox you want to add the javascript to

333254
buffering	streaming
we were far from complete by the end of it but it should give a pretty good idea of the kind of thing you need to do and buffering streaming iterator blocks query expression translation etc

333269
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
the alternative is to use a web framework like ruby on ruby-on-rails codeigniter or sproutcore each which require learning a new language

333287
object-reference	instances
when running this i get object-reference not set to an instances of an object. for the last line.

i prefer openmp or pthreads threads also known as pthreads

333321
base-class	inherited
i would inherited from base-class here

333325
contains	sorted
second instead of sorting the names create a third arrays that will contains the indexes into either of the other two arrayss initially 0 through n-1 but then sorted comparing name a and name b instead of sorting the names arrays itself

333327
richfaces	tomahawk
maybe you can have a look to tomahawk or richfaces that provide good calendar component.

333329
firefox	safari
this code works fine in firefox but safari for some reason doesn t submit the form

333329
firefox	safari
same result works in firefox doesn t work in safari

333340
textbox	button
currently i have an asp textbox and an asp button on my page

333356
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you need to understand that asp.net-mvc doesn t directly reference .aspx pages like webforms in its urls

333356
asp.net-mvc	webforms
here you can use neither the postback functionality nor the events of your web controls like in webforms because asp.net-mvc applications are stateless and not event-driven

333364
subtyping	generics
which needs to pass known subtyping of icommand to an apropriate handle specificcommand command method implementation and do some generics handling of unknown types

333381
dialog	pop-up
if this yields true pop-up a directory selection dialog where the user can specify where they want to save their data

333390
contains	any
if you create orchestration services that provide your controllers with the logic they require your architecture is improved because your controllers really should not contains any business logic at all

333397
solaris	linux
for windows it will look slightly strange but almost noone ever looks in that directory and it s filled with obscure directories anyway and on linux solaris .

333419
value	field
lower data consumption in scenario 1 about 95 of items of type other than picture or file would have null value in the image field that s about 16 bytes wasted for the pointers

333439
httpresponse	httprequest
the httpcontext class has properties for both the request httprequest type and the response httpresponse and depending on where which event you are handling application.endrequest maybe

333440
json	xml
xml or json are probably the easiest

333440
rabbitmq	activemq
activemq which is way more popular than qpid or rabbitmq - or indeed any jms provider would work just fine

333442
arguments	default
in the factory you could create a methods for the default type of manager and a methods for any type of manager which you give an arguments representing the type of the manager-class say with an enum

333444
alt	src
in human words there is a table for page element types and an associated table which lists possible parameters for each page element like src and alt for an image

333454
any	set
it seems that i can test that if any of the various calls fail that false is returned and that if all of the various calls succeed that true is returned and i could set expectations that the various methods are called with the expected parameters but is this useful

333473
getter	setter
the problem with this solution is that it violates dry - for each class creator i would have to write setter getter in thecreator

333482
specifications	w3c
i learned it with the specifications scalability vector graphics on w3c

333484
databound	gridview
each row of the databound gridview has a commandfield selected for which i want to send the postback to a new page

333496
contains	elements
the page elements attributes type table will contains the list of attributess associated with an elements

333498
put	get
any ideas how i can either get the form to stay put - or can i put a check on launching my application to check if the app is already running and the form hidden and make the form come back to the top

333499
javascript	dom
i m just talking about javascript here not css or implementation of the dom

333499
getter	setter
i know getter and setter are now available in the latest release of all major browsers except ie

333522
textbox	button
the src attribute points to a little self contained aspx page holding your textbox and submit button which redirects to your search results form

333529
oracle	mysql
i would like to migrate from oracle to mysql and one of the important steps is to replace the actual job built on an oracle environment

333529
oracle	mysql
now i would like to replace my oracle tables in mysql tables continuing to receive the file coming from the oracle environment

333529
oracle	mysql
oracle tables dump from an mysql environment

333532
internet-explorer	google-chrome
although this is works just fine in internet-explorer other browsers such as mozilla and google-chrome impose far stricter security restrictions which prohibit cross-site ajax requests

333542
contains	set
an optimised way to pre-multiply the rgb channels with the alpha channel is to set up a 256 256 arrays contains the calculated multiplication results

333543
json	xml
nb youll have to change your messages to use json instead of xml

333559
getpixel	gdi
however when i call the getpixel gdi function i never get back value with an alpha component

333564
digits	zero
d zero or more digits capture

333572
json	xml
ideally i would like to describe my elements as json or xml and have something magically handle the rest

333577
postback	ajax
create an ajax postback method which writes a csv file to your webserver and returns the url

333598
click	mouse
i have problems simulating right mouse click and selected different option in right click menu

333628
background-image	width
we can set the #page element to an elastic width and apply a background-image to the #masthead element

333631
opera	gecko
gecko opera and webkit also support the canvas element which although being a new html element is used via javascript so i m not sure if that fits your criteria

333653
authentication	login
my guess your authentication function is always returning false even when a user is logged in so it redirects to the login page which if the user is already logged in immediately redirects the user back to your page which redirects.

333664
javascript-framework	dojo
all i can find is cometd which relies on the dojo javascript-framework and a fairly complex server system

333684
oracle	mysql
nothing comes to mind - you may need to write custom export import scripts - for example to write csv files from oracle and to load mysql from these csv files.

333687
children	nodes
this methods would rely on determining whether the current nodes has any children or is a stand-alone nodes

333723
safari	opera
lets starts with javascript ecmascript today you have to make one version for mozilla opera safari and another version for ie

333723
firefox	opera
both opera and firefox support some css3

333761
javascript	dom
although these are not javascript functionality rather dom apis

333770
javascript	dom
so if the iframe s content know they can call some javascript content in parent page or directly access parent s dom

333771
value	field
i m having problems with an sql query used to display custom profiling field and any optional corresponding value

333809
any	set
if you really want to prevent any case-related path clash you can set a pre-commit hook which is also triggers by a svn copy like this one from svn tools contrib

333814
rollback	commit
instead of doing a rollback in teardown tests commit their changes to the database

333823
contains	set
will return a node set with all text nodes contains the value harrypotter

333849
default	reset
general editors file associations and reset the default

333850
abstract-class	subclassing
one of the main issues i have is that there is no ihttpcontext the .net http context is a subclassing of an abstract-class which can t be mocked easily

333869
asp.net-mvc	webforms
ihttpcontext is something that is in asp.net-mvc and aparently one day will be in webforms

333881
kdevelop	cdt
code blocks eclipse cdt netbeans are very powerful as well but from my experience kdevelop has everything the other ides have to offer and more

333881
toolchain	gnu
the second and more time-consuming way is to get to know the gnu development toolchain moranar mentioned

333881
g++	gcc
gcc g++ make gdb ddd valgrind g vim scite .

333881
toolchain	gnu
if you want to get the job done fast you should stick to the ide solutions but if you want to be a more complete more capable developer go for the gnu toolchain

333896
json	xml
it s quite easy to implement it though i m not sure if it can do all the json xml magic

333902
defined	declare
the header declare what a class or whatever is being implements will do-while the cpp file defined how it will perform those features

333904
c-preprocessor	macros
because the people who designed the library format didn t want to waste space for rarely used information like c-preprocessor macros and function declarations

333904
perl	c++
most languages after c c++ store this information in the output java bytecode for example or they don t use a precompiled format at all get always distributed in source form and compile on the fly python perl

333923
entity-framework	ado.net
i started using the new ado.net entity-framework for my persistence layer and i m running into some problems

333923
entity-framework	ado.net
1 that s used for entity persistence with the ado.net entity-framework

333923
entity-framework	ado.net
i m a little nervous about modifying the .cs file that was automatically generated by the ado.net entity-framework as it seems like it might get over-written

333923
attributes	properties
while i like the idea of how quickly i was able to build persistence to my data layer i need to define in a very custom manner how the entity object is transfered across the wire so i d need to modify the attributes associated with it s properties

333984
coalesce	isnull
you could use coalesce or isnull like so

333988
revision	svn
if you use the fsfs backend of svn which you should then it will synchronize only the new revision and do so quickly

333992
any	set
i have complete freedom to restructure refactor and set up any amount of infrastructure i see fit

333995
python	java
i have a small python application that uses java code thanks to jpype

333998
updating	updates
i do number 2 test the updates by updating a record and then reading it back out and verifying that the value are the same as the ones you put in

334052
hash	md5
as the number of possible input files is larger than the number of 128-bit outputs it s impossible to uniquely assign an md5 hash to each possible

334052
hash	md5
how to break md5 and other hash functions

334061
lookup	any
strsplit is a bit more efficient since you don t have to import the string module or lookup any names from it but not enough to make a huge difference if you prefer strsplit

334062
attributes	properties
i use a dynamically added tag attributes for the button to pass the id then i use javascript code to put the value in a hidden-field and then the button simply postsback to the page specified in the postbackurl properties

334079
stderr	stdout
the methods runprocessandreturnoutput runs the process collects the stdout and stderr of the process and returns it to the caller

334081
attributes	properties
not helpful if you want to add attributes to properties though

334087
listitem	selected
selectedvalue is not a listitem it s the value of the selected list item

334095
constructor	object
this is basically a class that takes an object of the type under test in its constructor

334099
pascal	delphi
the newer languages either bypass the linker altogether the interpreted and vm languages or use custom linkers turbo pascal i assume delphi too

334102
any	set
is there any way to verify these memory settings are being set accordingly

334107
entity-framework	data-access
what i m going to do for the time being is to keep my objects separate this way i can keep the clean wsdl and then in a data-access layer i ll convert between objects on the wire and the ado.net entity-framework

334110
downgrade	upgrade
the concept being scripting of create and alter statements to upgrade from one revision of the schema to the next accompanied by scripting of alter and drop statements to downgrade the same changes

334114
logout	login
i m making modifications to a members-based site whose owner wants to be able to track time spent on site login logout for all users in a db backend

334114
any	set
the problem there is that internal links also register as unload events so clicking any link would log the user out you could to check a flag in the unload handler and have all internal links set that flag--not hard to do dynamically but a bit kludgy

334124
duplicates	contains
second class citizens - test code isn t as well refactored as production code contains a lot of duplicates code making it hard to maintain tests

334135
abstract-class	subclassing
this class should be refactored into an abstract-class contains some field common to all of its subclassing

334135
annotations	mapping
i m using annotations for mapping hibernate entities relationships classes

334135
subclassing	superclass
also some suggestions on how to move the data that is stored in the database for the future abstract superclass into one of the concrete subclassing

334136
bmp	png
with bmp and png as well

334138
library-project	libs
each lib is a static library-project all libs are grouping in a solution and the dependencies are given to visual-studio so all libs and the application are linked together and build in correct order

334145
implements	final
you may just want to implements actionlistener in the class where the button and text field resides so you don t need to declare the two objects as final

334146
hide	show
one solution could be to wrap the inner text in a span and hide the span when you want the background-image of the div to show

334157
selected	button
or you could use red gate sql refactor or sql prompt which expands your selected into column lists with a click of the tab button

334201
filtering	grouping
for an extremely simple query like this there s not a big difference in readability but for large queries i find that having my join criteria grouping in with listing out the table makes it much easier to see where i might have issues in my join and let s me keep all my filtering in my where-clause

334204
user-controls	ascx
i wish i could get rid of some of my duplicated code both in ascx files and code-behind with some master user-controls

334219
base-class	inherited
you build the base control as a base-class and then inherited from it

334221
updating	updates
when updating databases you can run a migration scripting written in sql to updates the schema and data of the db

334225
design-time	designer
activex designer design-time library

334237
macros	vba
the best training program for vba is the macros recorder

334254
configuration	environment
but if you are testing your webapp directly from eclipse with a configured debugging environment of tomcat you can simply go to your debugging configuration apache tomcat arguments vm arguments and set the -xmx there

334263
rewrite	rule
what you really need to use as well is the pt flag to indicate that the resultant path from your rewrite rule should be passed through to next handler which in your case is the alias directive

334301
selected	cell
everything is fine until i try to take out the color of the selected line or cell it does the same thing

334301
highlight	selected
how can i display the data inside the datagridview without having the selected line highlight

334325
slideshow	loading
i am buser-interfacelding a slideshow with a few hundred images and would like to buser-interfaceld a nice loading bar so the idea was to preload the images using javascript then initialize the rest of the user-interface afterwords

334329
exception-handling	try-catch
usually these apps have an ignore catch at the top most level since we have try-catch at all the lower levels resulting in a very slow app with lots of missed exception-handling and an error log that too long for anyone to be willing to look through it

334333
native-code	unmanaged
some library code needs to call into unmanaged code for example native-code apis such as win32

334333
environment	execution
code that executes under the cli execution environment

334335
exception-handling	try-catch
if try-catch blocks are catching very generic exception-handling then i would say it is defensive programming in the same way that never driving out of your neighborhood is defensive driving

334335
exception-handling	try-catch
a try-catch imo should be tailored to specific exception-handling

334338
exception-handling	try-catch
putting code into try-catch blocks when you know the types of exception-handling that can be thrown is one thing

334352
winscp	putty
there are plugins that exist that allow you up open winscp or putty from within eclipse

334355
native-code	unmanaged
native-code is often synonymous with unmanaged but is not identical

334357
superclass	subclass
remember these will only have the columns that are unique to the subclass columns that are shared will remain in the superclass

334357
superclass	subclass
then selected the rows from the superclass table that belong in each subclass and move the data

334384
reliability	robustness
since the ultimate goal of an application developed on the symbian is to run on a mobile device where reliability and robustness of applications matter the most you should stick to what symbian prefers and suggests

334395
contains	elements
the following should output input elements that contains your case_id values for each case

334399
itemscontrol	grid
this derived user-controls will encapsulate other controls typically a grid to place a label for the heading labels for the axis names possibly a canvas for the drawing area and a itemscontrol to display the items in the legend

334399
silverlight	wpf
it is wpf and silverlight compatible and it even has a silverlight app for you to enter your data style and have it generate xaml or html to paste into your application

334437
onmouseover	onclick
also the contents of the event attributes onclick onmouseover on.

334439
pointers	stack
we looked into adding a static create methods which returns a pointers to a created object or null if creation failed but that means we cannot store objects on stack anymore and there is still need to pass in a reference to a status value if you want to act on the actual error

334445
observers	listener
what you are doing sounds more like a stubs to me - that is the listener observers doesn t know how often it is supposed to be called but just counts the number of calls and then the tests asserts against that count

334456
execute	declare
page_load execute first in the chain of command you could declare a page level variables to hold the datatable then inside the item databound event you could use it for the binding something like this if it was cs

334484
arguments	default
in both cases the constructor sets everything to default value it can take some arguments provided that what it does with those arguments cannot possibly fail for instance if it just stores them

334484
value	field
you probably need to enforce that every init methods across your whole codebase reports errors in the same way you do not want some returning 0 success or a negative error code some returning 0 success or a positive error code some returning bool some returning an object by value that has field explaining the fault some setting global errno etc

334484
constructor	object
if your object holds a reference either change it to a smart pointer so that it can null to start with or else make the caller pass the value into the constructor as a parameter instead of generating it in the ctor

334484
constructor	object
if your constructor has members of object type then you re fine

334498
bison	yacc
objective-c grammar for lex yacc flex bison

334519
postgresql	mysql
i ll be synchronizing data about users between ad and a database currently mysql but may turn into sql server or postgresql

334528
constructor	object
you can test the constructor of your object in a test method test

334531
persistence	hibernate
for the implementations see hibernate entity manager openjpa eclipse toplink glassfish persistence .

334538
extends	final
nor can you extends string because it s declared as final meaning no sub-classing is allowed

334540
extends	final
things in double-quotes in java are specially recognised by the compiler as strings and unfortunately you can t override this or extends java.lang.string - it s declared final

334569
extends	final
first you can t make a class that extends from string because string is a final class

334583
unpivot	pivot
using pivot and unpivot

334588
select	union
union multiple select statments one for each week that alias the specific week s column with the same column name alias

334592
perl	php
you d be better off with ruby python perl java or even php

334606
safari	opera
safari and opera showed the ugly url

334613
constructor	object
can t work because you re thinking that the quotations are some sort of short-circuit constructor for your object when in fact this only works for plain old java.lang.strings

334623
bison	yacc
iirc bnf grammars are just different enough from what yacc bison want as input to be really annoying if you intend to feed these files into a parsing generator you may want to look for files in the appropriate format

334626
selection	highlight
i can hook into the selectedindexchanged event and clear the selection but the highlight still happens and you see a blip

334626
checkbox	button
in fact if you hold down the mouse click never releasing it after you clicked on the checkbox area the selection remains highlighted until you release the mouse button

334635
show	next
but then word 2007 show the next line with a numbered sequences too

334639
entity-framework	ado.net
edit thanks to the first answer just to give a bit background on what i m looking to do i have a web app i plan to put in the cloud someday the dal is built with ado.net entity-framework

334675
exception-handling	try-catch
only if you expect an exception-handling and now how to deal with it should you use try-catch instead

334675
exception-handling	try-catch
sometimes i see try-catch system.exception-handling where the catch block just logs the exception-handling and re-throws

334689
click	mouse
now you can click in the windows with the mouse and it will block

334701
order	join
but then an sql92 evangilist explained that would actually force a join order

334701
order	join
all those copy pasters i ve seen are now actually forcing a join order - a job that s 95 of the time better left to optimizers especially a copy paster

334706
contains	any
randomly either the winforms app or the com exe crashes without any error message and the event log contains this entry

334723
implements	extends
so...i had this clever idea that i d create my own repeater control that implements paging and sorting by inheriting from repeater and extends it s capabilities

334723
contains	any
before i go back to the drawing board and create a second composite control which contains a repeater and the pager bars so that the repeater isn t responsible for the pager bars viewstate are there any thoughts about how to resolve the issue

334730
constructor	object
well that s an ordinary constructor with an object of same type as argument

334744
jquery	dojo
the tipical javascript libraries ext javascript jquery prototype dojo yui etc work on the browser and don t have any dependence on server tecnology

334744
jquery	dojo
this library is now part of the dojo foundation but i ve used it with jquery and prototype with ease

334777
contains	any
that link contains my new favorite qualifier in any document in a number system with a large base

334783
entity-framework	ado.net
for my app i do plan to put it in the cloud and i also used ado.net entity-framework to build my dal so it sounds like ado.net data services is the one for me to choose

334787
put	get
which will put the variables back into the get arrays

334802
environment	restart
1 try making sure you do not have tty in your cygwin environment variables and see if that helps unset it in my computer- properties- advanced- environment variabless and close restart any cygwin bash prompt

334815
difference	factors
there s a difference in terms of what the driving factors is

334827
python	ruby
i would like to do the equivalent off this ruby code in python for a django project i am working on

334828
python	ruby
i wan to to create a wrapper around any gui toolkit for python that is easy to use and inspired by shoes but needs to be a oop approach against ruby blocks

334829
callgrind	valgrind
extending another answer i use the callgrind option of valgrind

334846
contains	elements
i have a mx canvas elements that contains several mx panels elementss

334855
connection-pooling	pool
to add to the trust in connection-pooling arguments - holding the connection open for longer than needed can actually decrease overall performance as the connection pool can t share that connection to other components needing a db connection

334911
value	field
this will return the field of all records where the value is found in the field and the fields equals 1....everyone that is a friend of 1 will exist in the filtering person table when they re joined together and limited to

334955
any	set
for q2 you have the starting-point your node set and your ending point any sink below the starting point so your solution set is all paths from starting node specified to the sink

334957
variables	boolean
put a loop in your second thread that sleeps most of the time but every interval it wakes up and checks a shared variables that tells it whether to run your method or not and if that shared boolean is set to true then it runs a method that performs whatever task you are trying to perform.

334957
variables	boolean
in main gui thread put the data into the method parameter shared variables then set the boolean run shared variables to true.

334978
build-server	msbuild
summary i m able to compile a rad studio 2009 project using msbuild on a build-server using the rad studio command-prompt but not with a batch file

334979
selected	button
open resharper- windows- unit test explorer and selected everything then hit the run button

334985
value	field
for all you know some of the typographer s quotes were supposed to be there as part of a field s value

334990
sql-server	mysql
last time i tried it it worked fine but if you need to connect to for example mysql and sql-server you ll need to duplicate the code once using sqlconnection and the other using mysqlconnection

335015
python	php
python php and f# are complete programming languages

335025
constructor	object
if you do not know the name of an object s type you can use its constructor property

335025
constructor	object
the constructor property of object is a reference to the function that is used to initialize them

335041
linux	unix
however it s not clear if these packages run on windows as opposed to running on unix linux with a client api consistent with standard odbc

335049
system.web	.net
we have recently switched from the rational stack clearquest clearcase etc.. over to tfs 2008 for our .net group and one of the challenges that we are seeing are some of the limitations of the team system.web access as far as what work items a client can view

335073
arrays	loops
right now i have to loops through the collection and push each value to an arrays

335085
decimal	hex
for decimal -2146233032 hex

335097
data-access	nhibernate
in the vein of object relational mappers you can use nhibernate with mygeneration code generator to generate both the mappings and classes you d need to have a data-access layer

335104
pascal	delphi
it can do a lot of things but it doesn t even try to produce object pascal code as its output and it hasn t been updated since delphi 6

335129
textchanged	textbox
i have a textchanged event assigned to one of my textbox s in my wpf application

335223
sql-server	oracle
just for clarification....i m not talking about sql-server transactions ....i m talking about oracle updates which usually require a commit command when i use either sql navigator or sql plus

335244
firefox	safari
the following code will successfully set a cookie in firefox 3 ie 7 and safari pc

335246
capacity	storage
this column type has the same 2gb storage capacity of blobs but the data is stored in 8k chunks with the table data pages instead of in a separate store

335263
octal	hex
it doesn t recognize ip addresses with octal or hex formatting but that s acceptable for my application

335274
httpmodule	isapi
i know i m definitely not interested in writing an isapi filtering and i m not really running in the asp.net environment so httpmodule is probably useless to me as well

335276
webforms	asp.net
also since sometimes i work with asp.net webforms how is this done with webforms as well

335289
global-variables	call
this means that it can be a function call or a static methods call and it can take any number of arguments as far as they are constants and or global-variables or static class variables but not member attributes

335294
callback	methods
they make use of callback to call the loading methods once the code calls for them

335296
button	popup
a confirmation box to go ahead popup when the button is clicked

335299
python	java
also keep in mind that a lot of basic functionality such as reading files and working with collections is in the core python language whereas in java it lives in packages

335301
bug-tracking	workitem
workitem and bug-tracking all built in

335312
value	field
using the subfieldbase ensures that to_python is called every time a value is assigned to the field

335322
exception-handling	try-catch
in c++ the one reason to write lots of try-catch blocks is to get a stack trace of where the exception-handling was thrown

335322
exception-handling	try-catch
what you do is write a try-catch everywhere and assuming you aren t at the right spot to deal with the exception-handling have the catch log some trace info then re-throw the exception-handling

335338
constructor	object
any creation of the bar object will now call all 4 constructor

335339
static-initializer	static-block
the static-block is a static-initializer

335347
return-type	arguments
a static initializer block looks like a methods with no name no arguments and no return-type

335357
callback	methods
be aware when using this methods that the callback is executed on the background thread so any updates to the gui must be done using invoke

335366
icomparable	tostring
it would need to implement icomparable and have a tostring that display the desired text

335379
administration	integrated
however the column can be managed just like any other blob column in sql-server so administration can use the manageability and security capabilities of sql-server to integrated blob data management with the rest of the data in the relational databaseâ without needing to manage the file system.data separately

335387
duplicates	sorted
the resulting arrays should be sorted and without duplicates

335394
lighttpd	apache
the images on a filesystem are more easily cached by the web server apache mod_mmap or could be served by leaner web server like lighttpd

335410
handler	service
also i m not sure but global.asax event handler are executed even with web service requests so you may be able still to use what you want there

335422
constructor	object
the first thing you need to do is make a list of all static object that have non-trivial constructor

335452
32-bit	16-bit
i would treat reserve the bom as one of your normal tags using either the utf16 bom if using the 16-bit tags or the utf32 bom if using 32-bit tags with a 0 length block chunk

335461
httpd.conf	hosts
you could hosts the .js and css from an apache server set up your httpd.conf so your webapps can call it then use pack tag from your application wars - dry and compression in one step

335465
contains	set
you can create a breakpoint working set that contains only some of your breakpoints or a project working set that contains only part of your project and so on

335477
command-prompt	cmd
also you can usually get back to your cmd-prompt by using the reset cmd typing blindly of course

335478
unsigned	short
in visual-c++ 6.0 wchar_t is normally a typedef for unsigned short whereas in later versions it is a distinct built-in type

335482
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you won t be forced to use asp.net-mvc webforms are not going away

335482
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
once you ve learned mvc on the .net side picking up ruby on ruby-on-rails or spring or cakephp or any one of the other numerous mvc frameworks would be significantly easier

335482
asp.net-mvc	webforms
while webforms may be easy to learn asp.net-mvc is everywhere and for that reason alone it s useful to know

335486
asp.net-mvc	webforms
for what it s worth microsoft has made it clear that .net asp.net-mvc won t replace webforms

335489
scripting	shebang
the easiest way is to change the shebang of your scripting from

335525
lookup	any
i found one called tile coding sutton book 8 node6.html this one is based on several lookup tables does anyone know any other methods

335542
document	element
better you use the w3c dom api which is standardized and provides a clean way to build up a elementtree which can be append to any child element into the document tree

335547
conditional	operators
ternary conditional operators etc

335568
jquery	.post
looking at the code for jquery validation it looks like the .post data can not be customized

335571
binary	hex
it also discusses sending binary as well as hex data to the serial port

335591
oracle	mysql
i use mysql currently and have used oracle and ms sql in the past and although the details are fuzzy now i remember many many times finding bugs features in both oracle and ms sql that made me think people pay money for this

335591
youtube	flickr
the fact is that huge web sites like digg facebook flickr youtube wikipedia and many others run on mysql

335600
detect	move
i am able to move player around with the keyboard but i am at a loss when trying to detect a collision between the two

335606
webforms	asp.net
if you do webforms development and you are perfectly fine doing that you probably won t like asp.net mvc

335609
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i got to use asp.net-mvc for a project at work because it had to be finished quickly and i believed that even though i knew no asp.net-mvc that i could learn it and finish the project quicker than i could do it using webforms and i was right

335609
asp.net-mvc	webforms
when i finished it i had to go back to maintain some webforms projects and extend them i just want to go back to asp.net-mvc now

335623
any	set
if it is set for a bridged mode then you can do it as any other machine - by host machine s ip

335629
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you cant stand the way webforms works like me p go for asp.net-mvc

335648
perl	awk
i have cygwin installed so something using perl or sed awk would be perfect as i m familiar enough with them that i d be confident about altering them in future but i m open to suggestions.

335655
versioning	upgrade
i m not sure how applicable this is to your particular example but i ve personally run into problems where symbols from the stl library i used conflicted with the ones in the third party library when i upgrade to a new versioning

335660
subtract	add
take a corner as an anchor point subtract this corner from each point scale it then add it to the point again and multiply each points x and y by the factors with which the box has gotten bigger

335673
contains	any
any box is contains inside a circle

335676
rollback	commit
prompt for commit rollback when changes detected or detection is not possible due to lack of privileges on dmbs_transaction

335676
rollback	commit
so you could change the setting so you don t need to hit the commit button or type commit but it s generally a bad practice since a commit is something that you should explicitly be doing or explicitly rollback

335677
dbd	dbi
the problem i have found with dbd proxy is that its server dbi proxy-server doesn t just restrict queries coming in over the network which i want but it also restrict queries generated internally by the database driver

335733
ruby	php
i recommend giving it a try especially since the mvc framework is also used with ruby python and php

335736
put	get
however i thought to myself the methods property etc which will cause an exception-handling will be at the top of the stacktrace do property calls get put on the stacktrace

335742
assign	add
now my users would like to be able to add a question to one or more quiz and to assign one or more categories to questionsâ

335743
updating	updates
this prevents you from being able to updates the reporting code without also updating the business code and presumes the reporting code being running as soon as the reported code is put into production

335779
contains	elements
the description is given with a dd elements that contains block-level content

335781
build-process	ant
we are in the process of converting our main build-process from ant to maven

335789
margins	padding
if they re overriding the padding margins on them then your guess is as good as mine

335796
accurev	svn
but from my experience it just can t beat the commercial alternatives especially accurev but also clearcase perforce etc. which will give you much more than what svn is capabale

335807
for-loop	loops
so i decided to make a single for-loop to replace the first two foreach loops and convert the values in one fell swoop the third loop is quasi-necessary although i m sure with some working i could also put it into the single loop

335821
webforms	asp.net
the webdashboard uses nvelocity not asp.net webforms so you have to register a custom httphandler in the web.config for it to work

335855
selected	textbox
the user needs to be able to fill in various textbox and selected options that are sent to the command-line programs

335866
multiplication	addition
and the three new points can be found using scalar multiplication and vector addition

335879
account	userid
userid value comes back as the windows account that reporting services is running under

335885
button	slide
i am looking for a way to slide a uipickerview and uidatepickerview up over a view uitableview in particular when a particular button press takes place

335888
hash	md5
currently i use the md5 algorithm to hash the users password for storage in the database

335897
copy-constructor	constructor
the real issue i have with references lies with other programmers henceforth termed idiots who allocate in the constructor deallocate in the destructor and fail to supply a copy-constructor or operator

335897
g++	gcc
under gcc g++ use setenv malloc_check_ 0 to revisit the old ways. resulting under dec unix in the same memory being allocated to two different objects

335911
hash	md5
it s not necessarily that you shouldn t use md5 as much it s that you shouldn t use just md5 as this leaves you vulnerable to rainbow-table attacks a rainbow table is a table of precomputed hash values - if your password is even remotely common or simple the attacker needs merely to look up the hash and he knows your plaintext password.

335913
hash	md5
it would still take some work to crack a hash made with md5 but it s several times easier than guessing the password by brute-force

335929
select	union
in this case you can create a view like select from primary.dbo.table union all select from secondarydbjune2008.dbo.table union all select from secondarydboctober2008.dbo.table

335942
arrays	loops
slightly faster way you can loops through the arrays yourself and use array.indexof to check for duplicates

335947
execute	declare
execute declare cnt int

335963
any	set
any one know how to set this up

336035
value	field
all rows have a value for both fields - except for a special record where the value field is deliberately set to null

336041
constructor	object
you may find this odd since you re still in the parent s constructor and thus your parent object isn t fully constructed yet

336043
grouping	sorting
all the filtering sorting grouping and custom layout stuff you re probably used to plus card layouts amd more

336062
constructor	object
the separate object can be an instance or static but the object itself must have a parameterless constructor or no constructor at all

336089
alignment	layout
i also think it should make heavy use of layout managers like java does because when you re dropping code no one wants to constantly tweak pixel alignment

336089
textbox	button
here is a rough brainstormed example that will show a column with a label on top then a textbox then a button to click on the bottom which shows a message

336109
arrays	loops
php engine loops through internal arrays of mysql connections

336109
variables	boolean
this means php has to check that the variables a exists b is a boolean and c is true false

336112
command-line	cmd
the .dump cmd is part of the sqlite cmd-line program shell.c not part of the sqlite library

336112
command-line	cmd
however since the source code for the sqlite cmd-line program is in the public domain and uses the same library as the .net wrapper it would be possible to translate the c code for the .dump cmd to c#

336114
any	set
any suite has its own set of gotchas you have to learn but overall i was pleased

336115
factorization	primes
i would attack this by doing the primes factorization of the number for example 300 2 2 3 1 5 2 which is relatively fast especially if you generate this by sieve

336116
factors	primes
that was the simplest case you ve solved the problem for all numbers with only one primes factors

336116
factors	primes
now suppose you have a number n that has two primes factors say n pq

336116
factorization	primes
that should give you the hint both on what the answer is and how to prove it the sum of the divisors of n is simply the product of the answer for each of the primes powers in its factorization so all you need to do is to factorize 64000000 which is very easy to do even in one s head - and multiplying the answer for each both because the only primess are 2 and 5 of its primes powers

336116
factors	primes
the more general fact here is about multiplicative functions -- functions on the natural numbers such that f mn f m f n whenever gcd m n 1 m and n have no primes factors in common

336138
versioning	upgrade
are all the additions to c# for versioning 4 dynamic code contracts etc expected to run on the current .net clr or is there a planned .net upgrade as well

336142
malloc	free
allocating on the heap using new delete or malloc free is very slow

336144
scala	java
i have an application where i would like to have mixed java and scala source actually its migrating a java app to scala - but a bit at a time

336144
scala	java
but i am not sure how to do this with maven - scalac can compile java and scala intertwined but how to i set up maven for the module

336144
scala	java
also does my scala source have to be a different folder to the java

336148
postorder	inorder
if this is the case how does one do an inorder preorder and postorder tree-walk on a treemap

336153
any	set
afaik the treeset treemap classes don t actually expose any of their internals and merely conform to the set map interface

336254
administration	account
provide an interface for administration to view a list of such account and toggle their approval status

336275
oracle	mysql
i have fond feelings for mysql and their being able to compete with oracle and sql server

336275
sql-server	mysql
i credit the original mysql team for the existence sql-server express

336275
sql-server	mysql
i now use sql-server express instead of mysql for just about everything

336275
sql-server	mysql
first i do not like sun and second sql-server express is significantly more robust and enterprise than mysql

336295
sql-server	mysql
personally i prefer sql-server over mysql

336302
arrays	map
once you get the underlying arrays object from the arrayscollection using the source property you can make use of the map method on the arrays

336308
methods	extend
it s not too hard to extend it to track the methods that were patched

336319
export	csv
export to csv encoding binary data with base64 encoding and then compression with gzip sounds like a good way to go

336327
environment	building
i am trying to building a caml query for sharepoint 2007 environment to get items from a calendar list

336337
rollback	commit
commit or rollback the transaction to make the change permanent or to undo it

336361
webforms	asp.net
deployment is very easy with asp.net mvc and with the changes coming to visual studio 2010 for easier deployment of web sites via packages. i currently maintain 2 asp.net mvc sites and find it with bin-deployment to be just the same as a regular asp.net webforms site

336368
postgresql	mysql
i can take my activerecord model and move it from mysql to postgresql to sqlite thank you very much

336396
disposable	dispose
as it s a memorystream you really don t need to close the stream - nothing bad will happen if you don t although obviously it s good practice to dispose anything that s disposable anyway

336404
selected	cell
this forces the selected col to be the first non-fixed column so whenever the row changes the code to scroll the selected cell into view forces the first non-fixed column to be visible

336404
selected	cells
you can use custom drawing of the grid cells to show all cells of the current row with the proper colours for selected cells even though only one cell is really selected

336434
hosts-file	hosts
in the guest open up the hosts c windows system32 drivers etc hosts

336437
forwarding	port
i have set up port forwarding in my router

336443
delphi	c++
languages like delphi c and c++ compile to processor-native machine code and the output executables have little or no metadata in them

336446
postback	ajax
i need to upload images using fileupload without postback using ajax .i tried many examples.but in all postback is coming or they are using php.can anyone help me to do single file upload or multi file upload using ajax in asp.net with c#

336461
forwarding	port
given the fact that you said you set up port forwarding did you assign the proper ports within the upd program

336461
forwarding	port
if you specify the external ip-address and a port number the port forwarding on your router should send it to the appropriate node on the network

336464
persistence	hibernate
almost every new java-web-project is using a modern asp.net-mvc-framework such as struts or spring asp.net-mvc for the web tier spring for the service business-logic-layer and an orm mapper such as hibernate for persistence

336471
decrement	increment
alternatively you can maintain your own counter that you will increment on fork and decrement on sigchld signals assuming ppid stays unchanged for fork ed processed

336478
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework

336482
postback	ajax
as the others say you can t do it completely without a postback but you can add some nice ajax functionality around the process

336494
contains	elements
if a primitive elements is specified inside a primitive-list elements then it should contains the name attributes and the embedded definition elements but not the ref attributes

336494
contains	elements
if a primitive elements is specified in the composite elements then it should contains either the ref attributes or the definition elements

336506
bluetooth	usb
this enumeration will contain ethernet cards usb networking devices etc and i need to retrieve the bluetooth network interface in particular

336528
exception-handling	error-handling
he has a chapter on exception-handling and error-handling which might be useful to you

336535
google-chrome	firefox
my main browsers firefox and google-chrome are both configured for a 12 pixel font

336535
google-chrome	firefox
when i view the site in ie 7 firefox 3 and google-chrome 0.4 the font displays as expected and matches the font pickers except in ie where it s a little larger

336535
specifications	w3c
edit from w3c s css specifications the following table provides user-agent guidelines for the absolute-size mapping to html heading and absolute font-sizes

336562
communication	messages
i get this messages when trying to communicate with software that communication with soap

336569
datagridview	databound
because the datagridview is databound i implemented the columnchanging event for the datatable

336571
publishing	enterprise
if understand you correctly you want to do what is also called publishing subscribe. this can also be done with something called an enterprise service bus. there are other methods like msmq and so forth

336578
constructor	private
when wiring the application together we get the following error when using private constructor in our hibernate entities

336578
constructor	private
how do we can we use private constructor static factory methods with spring hibernate transaction management

336578
constructor	private
it is a pojo that should have a static factory method and a private constructor

336578
constructor	private
or possibly make it call a private constructor if necessary

336578
persistence	hibernate
they are only annotationss with the entity annotations for hibernate persistence

336588
highlight	selected
i get a selectlist with that item selected it is inserted as selectedvalue but not highlight

336633
32-bit	64bit
note that it should also detect 64bit when run as a 32-bit application on windows 64bit

336672
keyboard	mouse
i need a javascript which monitors keyboard and mouse events to track how much time a user spends on the page

336672
click	mouse
specifically actively using the page by typing or moving click with the mouse

336690
boolean	int
it appears that strings int units boolean are passed by value

336691
scala	java
i solved this some time ago by having one maven module written in scala and the other in java

336691
scala	java
but since scala and java can cross depend on one another java - scala - java or the other way around then this is something very desirable without multi module projects

336697
contains	any
you cannot use open to further open any contains files

336729
32-bit	64bit
intptr.size won t return the correct value if running in 32-bit .net 2.0 on 64bit windows it would return 32-bit

336729
32-bit	64bit
as microsoft s raymond chen describes you have to first check if running in a 64bit process i think in .net you can do so by checking intptr.size and if you are running in a 32-bit process you still have to call the win api function iswow64process

336729
32-bit	64bit
if this returns true you are running in a 32-bit process on 64bit windows

336747
put	get
do you mean to put data in a dll and use loadlibrary and getprocaddres to get a pointer to the data

336750
onmouseover	onclick
theoretically all dom elements can react on events like onclick onmouseover onkeypress etc

336776
administration	account
on the browse for a user account dialog i enter administration into the user name textbox while having the name of the server still entered into the name of server textbox and click on ok -- result server not found

336779
hash	md5
as most have already said md5 was designed for variables length data streams to be hash to a fixed length chunk of data so a single hash is shared by many input data streams

336783
sql-server	mysql
having run both i don t think there s much question that sql-server is overall a more full-featured product than mysql although i d be interested to hear arguments to the contrary

336791
pascal	basic
the and or operators in languages like ada visual basic and pascal do not short-circuit

336805
push	pull
basically where requires the interested party to pull data from a source push linq lets you push data through a source and interested parties can subscribe to events corresponding to another element has just gone past and the data has finished

336898
versioning	upgrade
it seems to me that after i have upgrade my acrobat reader from versioning 8 to versioning 9 the loadfile methods returns true when the file is opened correctly where versioning 8 returned false

336902
error-handling	try-catch
however it can arise when previously there was some error-handling logging usually that has been removed and the developer removed the log handling but did not restructure the code to remove the redundant try-catch

336905
selected	button
â on the dialog that is displayed click the locations button this is because by default your domain will be selected and we need a local account

336905
windows-xp	windows
â on the dialog that is displayed enter aspnet as the account name make sure location is set to the name of the computer that iis is on on windows-xp or if you are running on windows 2003 server you must enter the account that the application pool is running as by default network service

336915
silverlight	wpf
you should take a look at caliburn - it s a simple wpf silverlight asp.net-mvc framework with support for full di

336925
firefox	safari
edit it works in safari but not in firefox

336935
forwarding	port
make the decision and redirect or forwarding to the app specified port

336939
display	width
i would suggest giving the div fixed width and height -- either always or when one of the classes that display an image is used

336939
background-image	width
use the width and height of your background-image if you want the whole thing displayed

336973
contains	lookup
my team wants to control behaviour on the service side by passing in a applicationtype parameter to every methods - which is essentially an enum contains the name of the calling client application - which is then used as a key for a database lookup to configure the service with client-specific options

336993
groovy	java
so i m wondering whether anyone has had success using java for a recent web application that has gone live either using the language itself with stripes spring + hibernate or the runtime with a dymamic language such as jruby groovy jython

337024
svnadmin	dump
i ve been able to use svnadmin dump to dump the entire repository and svnadmin load it into another repository but i can t find a way of dumping only one project from the original repository so i can load it into the new one

337028
jquery	.post
i think to use ajax and jquery to download a viewed thread s new .posts from a tomcat server the .posts will be some small xml structure that is compiled into a nice .post on the client side

337080
exception-handling	error-handling
if you need more detail in the error-handling besides true or false you could consider rethrowing your own exception-handling translating the exception-handling from the third party library to something more consistent with your own code

337083
visualworks	squeak
the server is connect to the scm of choice like monticello for squeak smalltalk or store for visualworks

337085
constructor	object
on the other hand i have object that i simply don t want in my system if they can t be constructed from proper data and in that case their constructor throw exceptions

337092
revision	svn
depending on the tools available on the server you could either do a svn diff -r x y where x is the revision you last updated too and y the last revision you want to update to probably the last revision on your repository to generate a patch and then apply the patch with the patch command

337092
.when	ready
if rsync is available on the production platform and you can use it though ssh for instances you could set up a production ready tree rsync it on the production server and .when an updates comes in svn updates your production tree and rsync it again

337093
modifiers	final
maybe you have used private or final modifiers somewhere

337120
value	field
the numerical value of the field is accessible via selected enum_col+0

337122
profiling	trace
use the databaseid filtering instead of databasename in the new trace windows of sql profiling 2000

337137
packets	lan
the maximum packet age is dictated by network properties an example being that satellite lifetimes are higher than lan lifetimes since the packets have much further to go

337139
safari	opera
edit works fine on opera 9.50 and safari 3.1

337143
constructor	private
for instance you can have a build method on the builder which calls a private constructor on the outer class which takes an instance of the builder

337150
sql-server	mysql
there are some significant bugs in mysql right now you may want to consider moving to sql-server express if you can.

337159
runas	cmd
i could use runas profiling ... to load the profiling and execute the cmd but that would ask for a password

337201
ruby	php
it does depend on what type and size of application you re building but i think there are good reasons why many people choose php ruby and python for their personal projects where they get to choose what language they build web apps in and not their superiors

337241
getter	setter
after all there are mainly just generated getter setter

337247
enumerator	any
well x for x in enumerator will run until enumerator doesn t produce data any more the if-part will simply allow you to filtering along the way

337252
getter	setter
which would create a readonly backing variables a property with only a getter and translation all calls to the setter into direct access to the variables

337257
contains	any
can your code contains any bugs

337257
getter	setter
so the conclusion is you should not test getter and setter without code those which just assign or read a field without any additional code

337257
getter	setter
the exception-handling is when you manually write those getter setter because you could have made a typo

337257
getter	setter
but even then some code will use these and there should be a test for that code which in turn tests whether the getter setter behave correctly

337268
32-bit	64bit
i could treat the pointer as a java int if i happen to know that native pointers are 32-bit in size or a java long if i happen to know that native pointers are 64bit in size

337293
.when	ready
but i am not able to know if the svg dom is ready or not so i cant perform default actions on the svg .when the html page is loaded

337293
.when	ready
if i try to access the svg .when the html document is ready in this way

337298
contains	any
i hereby refuse to accept any responsibility for the stability of our production system based on the fact that insert name here refuses to equip me with the tools to make sure that the production system contains all the necessary files and data after an installation.

337309
rhino-mocks	nunit
then we built a extension methods on imockedobject from rhino-mocks to triggers events in the unit tests and un-wrap exception-handling so that they can be expected in the standard nunit way

337309
subclassing	base-class
to eliminate duplication between presenter tests we have refactored this to a basepresentertest base-class which sets up this basic structure for all presenter tests and exposes helper methods to the subclassing

337313
compact-framework	.net
when moving my .net compact-framework application to the sd-card of a windows ce device the program executes slower then running it from the internal memory

337319
document	element
you can assign an onload event handler to an element within your svg document and have it call a javascript function in the html page

337332
32-bit	64bit
by creating your own type for holding pointers the same type can be used as a 32-bit or 64bit depending on the system you re on

337337
oracle-xe	oracle
today oracle have a lot of editions to accomodate any use for instance the little one oracle-xe

337349
triggers	insert
you can place a insert update delete triggers on the table to perform some action when data changes are made to the table

337367
32-bit	64bit
and there is a tool which converts the code between 32-bit and 64bit by moving the comment

337389
contains	set
my problem is simple i m storing a set of objects each contains a string and a number in a list

337405
webserver	upload
i m familiar with coding php for upload but not with running a webserver

337407
32-bit	64bit
javascript stores all its numbers as 64bit initally but as soon as you start using bitwise operators the interpreter converts the number to a 32-bit representation

337408
constructor	object
i don t think you can make hibernate or any external framework call a private constructor on your object unless it s through some javassist or cglib runtime created subclass

337408
constructor	object
hibernate instantiates your object by calling the default no-argument constructor

337410
comparator	sortedmap
apart from the sortedmap you could have a where you supply the comparator to sort the pairs or make your pair class implements comparable and do it there

337411
put	get
well i didn t get a response and figured out how to modify my command so that it put the name in all the fields in the column so i can pull it now via command.personname

337428
wamp	php
instead of wamp i recommend xampp for cross platform x apache mysql php and perl all in one package

337435
display	width
then you ll have to know what font you ll be using to display things and get the caracter sizes the kernings and all that things so that you ll be able to compute the real width of the words which unless you re using a fixed width font is not the number of caracters in the string you ll be displaying

337464
lotus	ibm
ibm lotus notes and .net

337470
oracle	mysql
the oracle query optimiser is very smart probably rather better for complex multi-table queries than say mysql

337470
oracle-xe	oracle
i m developing intranet applications on ruby-on-rails oracle using oracle-xe locally for development deploying to some big iron machine it s someone else s job to care for it i don t even know what os it s running for production

337473
meta-inf	jar
you can externalise the annotations into the ejb-jar.xml that you deploy in the meta-inf of your jar file as follows

337499
postgresql	oracle
i m trying to branch an application framework which is dependent on oracle to use postgresql

337503
integer	short
a short character x or integer or other relatively small numeric type column that can serve as a row identifier column

337514
build-process	msbuild
we are currently using msbuild tfs and good old fashioned people to manage our build-process

337551
spaces	output
i have a three-monitor setup but it seems that the solution explorer properties output errors whatever panels are always getting in the way or hogging screen spaces

337556
exception-handling	try-catch
if you can handle an exception-handling by running different code using try-catch as control flow retrying waiting and retrying retrying with an different but equivalent technique ie fallback methods then by all means do so

337574
contains	any
i need a collection that works just like a dictionary hashtable in a sense that it will only contains 1 instance of a given object at any time

337576
portrait	screens
this gives quite a bit more real estate if you need to present more on the screens than what your portrait mode allows for and is thus very valuable

337598
base-class	inherited
and here are my other 2 objects that inherited the base-class moodyobject

337636
derived-class	base-class
second you have to specify that you are going to override methods from base-class in derived-class

337636
put	get
if you don t specify override keyword you will get methods that hides base type and warning from compiler to put new keyword for the methods to explicitly state so

337649
panels	grid
i m building a winform in c# with various elements in a panels that start out either invisible disabled or set to null labels combo boxes grid etc.

337649
selected	button
once the processing for this directory has completed i d like to be able to have the user selected another directory without exiting and restarting the winform app by pressing a button that becomes visible when the process has completed

337649
contains	elements
is there an easy call to reset the application or the panels that contains the elements similar to when a webforms is refreshed or do i have to write a function that resets all of those elements one at a time

337731
verilog	vhdl
it covers both vhdl and verilog

337744
average	minimum
now my first approach for optimization was to keep the data to a minimum size so i reduced the row size to an average of 60 bytes with the following columns

337749
teamcity	msbuild
this can also happen when upgrading from teamcity 3.1 to 4.0 on an x64 build server with the msbuild run platform set to x86

337749
any	set
this include when the platform target for the test assembly is any cpu although as it happens i have set them to x86 explicitly as some tests dynamically load dlls that are constrained to x86

337750
double	int
in other words how would a function taking int returning a pointer to a function taking bool returning a pointer to a function taking double and returning void would look like

337756
apacheds	opends
so far i ve briefly looked at apacheds and opends which seem to be embeddable

337769
sql-server	postgresql
this version without to_nchar works fine in sql-server and postgresql via odbc and sqlite direct

337769
sql-server	postgresql
if i do use to_nchar it s okay but won t work in sql-server postgresql sqlite etc

337782
antivirus	security
like the above problem sometimes the clients environment may block certain script sources be it the users choosing or other reasons ie browser security satisfactions odd antivirus anti-malware apps

337811
windows-vista	windows
i m looking for a way to programatically change features programs and features - turn windows features on or off in windows-vista and newer redmond os server 2008

337812
relocation	linker
the linker also does relocation patching instructions jump and data load with the respective target addresses once the value of a symbol is known

337812
relocation	linker
in some cases this can t be done at link time so the linker copies adjusts the relocation records from the .o files into the final executable

337820
hide	show
disable this enable that hide this show that

337839
jax-ws	cxf
it mostly boils down to do you want to use spring-remoting which spring rmi and apache-camel are implementations of - or do you want to use jax-ws for web-services which cxf or metro implement

337846
lookup	any
then suppose you have an object model that lets you lookup a recordcompany by name and then lookup a band within that recordcompany a member of the band and any of these might return null so this might throw a nullreferenceexception

337868
binary-tree	tree
in short i d like to learn develop an elegant methods to save a binary-tree to disk a general tree not necessarily a bst

337868
binary-tree	nodes
i ve written a binary-tree whose internal nodes are questions and leaves are answers

337868
binary-search-tree	tree
note this is not a binary-search-tree just a binary tree whose left child is yes and right is no

337874
children	nodes
note once you have a null nodes representation you no longer need to list its children to disk

337878
callback	methods
using instance methods as callbacks for event handler changes the scope of this from my instance to whatever just called the callback

337882
contains	any
unless you can guarantee that any strings in the data will not contains you can t even safely split it without parsing the json at least enough to keep track of whether you are in a string or not

337901
constructor	object
i need the main form to display the sub form and pass into the constructor an object

337906
explicit	typeof
variables is probably not recommended and it is better to test against typeof undefined or explicit test against null

337922
cursor	row
in addition to storing the mysql result the default client-side cursor actually fetches every row regardless

337925
ref	out
3 use an out or ref keyword on multiple variables

337942
assign	add
have a listview add an imagelist add images to the imagelist assign image index to the column you want

337951
primitive	boolean
for a public api a custom class usually makes more sense - but if it s something fairly primitive or the natural result of the function is a boolean like .tryparse i ll stick with an out param

337971
constructor	object
just pass the file name to the constructor and use the object like the usual ruby-on-rails logger

337971
base-class	superclass
remember also that you can inject the my_logger methods directly into the activerecord base-class or into some superclass of your own if you don t like to monkey patch too much to share the code between your app s models

337978
postback	ajax
i am trying to learn how to create servercontrols that use ajax for partial postback where methods within the control are called from clientscript generated by the same control and i think that learning how to convert this page to a server control would be a help me understand what servercontrols use instead of webmethods to expose their methods to clientscript

337990
stderr	stdout
deamon programs close stdin stdout stderr purposedly and use logging instead so that you have to manage this yourself i would suggest to use subprocess.pipe

338006
directory	folder
- should then be added using a virtual directory pointing to their folder

338018
callback	methods
there is actually no fully encapsulated methods for implementing ajax callback against methodss of a server control yet as of v3.5

338035
subtract	add
for instance if you are using the wcf service to perform mathematics on 2 values you might have 4 members on the service side add x y subtract x y multiply x y divide x y

338035
subtract	add
example peformcalculation obj where obj has x y and action add subtract multiply divide properties

338037
ubuntu	linux
i tried this in the terminal of both mac os x 10.5 and linux ubuntu gutsy gibbon and it s the same result

338046
after-effects	maya
but instead of being a limited class it s a community driven animation platform with the goal of providing framework for animation across multiple platforms flash as silverlight .net after-effects 3d maya etc

338073
version-control	git
apparently all the buzz now is using a version-control system like svn or git and somehow using ssh to upload only the files that have changed if i understand correctly

338082
32-bit	64bit
so should i just separate postgresql related stuff to a 32-bit dll can i use 32-bit dlls with 64bit app even

338095
plugins	add-on
plugins are rarely considered part of the base application but add-on to the base functionality

338137
python	java
so when you are tired of c and want to move on to python java c++ some ide s can help you do that

338153
checkbox	button
if you go on to the validation website and download the whole package that included the demo files you can find the one with example of validating checkbox and radio button

338183
postgresql	mysql
if you can use a wee bit of vendor-specific sql features you can use microsoft sybase top n or mysql postgresql limit

338190
vb.net	vb6
this feature exists because vb.net emulates the vb6 method of being able to refer to a default instance of a form through it s name

338194
ref	out
personally i hate out ref params so i d rather not use that approach

338199
httphandler	httpmodule
i don t know for sure - but i d bet that code is buried in one of the sharepoint httpmodule or httphandler that run for every request

338213
postgresql	mysql
but if you re not locked into oracle go with postgresql or mysql

338217
textctrl	wxpython
i have a textctrl in my wxpython program and i d like to set its width to exactly 3 characters

338252
arrays	loops
continuing in this vein will give us the total number of inversions for arrays a once the loops is complete

338258
dockpanel	scrollbar
but i really don t want the dockpanel inside the scrollbar

338260
dictionary	arrays
i m not sure how to store a dictionary directly but you could easily use an arrays of strings to store a dictionary

338260
key-value	key
for every key-value pair you save out the key as the first string and the value as the second

338271
.when	ready
so .when fields are constructed internal field list in recordset are ready to use by filed default-constructor

338275
selected	textbox
unfortunately you may not have any control over which font is selected in the textbox

338289
json	xml
your application needs to be able to make https calls out and be able to parse xml or json responses

338290
stdout	stdio
your problem is that printf and anything else that uses the stdio library to write to stdout standard output is buffering - line buffering if it goes to the console and size buffering if it goes to a file

338290
fflush	stdout
if you do a fflush stdout

338290
stderr	stdout
i m not 100 sure but i think stderr isn t buffering which can cause confusion because you might see output you made to stderr before output you previously made to stdout

338292
contains	any
you could also look for any record contains e or or any other character that could be interpeted as numeric according to the sources already given

338293
sql-server	oracle
i am interested in using some kind of a command-line utility for sql-server similar to oracle s sql plus

338295
buffering	streaming
printf writes to stdout the default output streaming which is usually line buffering

338295
buffering	streaming
the buffering isn t flushed by the time sleep is called so nothing is displayed when the program exits all streaming are automatically flushed which is why it prints right before exiting

338295
buffering	streaming
if you are printing to a streaming that is not line buffering as may be the case if stdout is redirected or you are writing to a file simply printing a newline probably won t work

338297
constructor	object
c++ offers you plenty of chances to shoot yourself in the foot but offering you a reference to an incomplete object in another class s constructor isn t one of them

338362
administration	account
it can be accessed by customers online banking by service personal mostly read and by the account administration department admin tool

338362
wicket	spring
the requirement is the applications are build on top of a wicket spring hibernate stack as wars

338365
switching	screens
i am thinking of writing some code to switching the active display back to the laptop screens when the computer resumes from hibernate

338369
any	set
there s unfortunately not a set of cmdlets yet nor is there anything in wmi or any other easily-accessible area

338375
contains	any
for example we had a table called rejects on a db used by a rating process contains the records rejected from one run of the program and i don t see any reason in not using plural for that table naming it reject would have been just funny or too optimistic

338381
invoke-sqlcmd	cmdlet
nowadays you can also use the invoke-sqlcmd cmdlet in powershell

338382
silverlight	wpf
i keep my .net api and silverlight api bookmarks right next to each other because i develop a lot of controls that are used in both wpf and silverlight and it seems like every time i come up with a good idea for implementing a feature i run into something fundemental not supported in silverlight

338383
vb.net	vb6
this feature exists because vb.net emulates the vb6 method of being able to refer to a default instance of a form through it s name

338397
hide	show
bcb tends to hide a lot of detailed error info when compiling from the ide - using the command-line compiler tends to show the real error

338398
arguments	default
my gut feeling is that it is used to map a default arguments onto another constructor methods

338407
licensing	lgpl
it has an lgpl license so there should be no licensing problems with including in a gpl project

338425
base-class	subclass
this syntax is used to have your subclass constructor to explicitly call an appropriate custom base-class constructor rather than the default

338427
pointers	stack
how can you tell if a pointers comes from an object in stack

338434
administration	account
it seems the network service account doesnâ t have permissions to read load it because when i change the app pools identity to a user with administration rights i can find load and use the cert

338435
unsigned	integer
int or unsigned long int for integer

338442
highlight	selected
i want to use the javascript selected function to highlight a text field on a form but first i want to use a named anchor so the page will scroll to the proper section

338446
pointers	stack
if a pointers points somewhere in stack it will lie between the current stack pointers esp and the top of stack

338446
constructor	object
- in c++ global object constructor are called before main

338446
pointers	stack
one way to get the current stack pointers is using inline-assembly

338448
pointers	stack
one simple way if you have control of the top stack frame would be to set a global variables to be the address of a stack object and then use a function that checks if the target pointers is between this address and the address of a variables it creates on stack

338451
pointers	stack
i think this methods might work if the compiler does reasonable things with pointers comparisons and stack grows down

338476
boolean	int
however objects that belong to the primitive data types which includes boolean number int uint and string have special operators that make them behave as if they were passed by value

338480
value	field
or if the string you want is the value of a form field as it seems it might be

338488
version-control	git
some version-control systems such as git and mercurial and i think svk a weird modified svn allow you to have local repositories that you can get previous local versions from

338488
rollback	commit
afaik none of these will allow you to rollback if you didn t at least commit your change to your local repo

338502
onchange	onclick
what is probably happening in your javascript is that the onclick event is called by the javascript engine before the onchange event is called

338504
32-bit	64bit
a 64bit binary will be larger than a 32-bit binary due to code side difference static data etc

338511
rewrite	rule
can anyone help me rewrite the first rule for zeus

338516
buffering	streaming
but the streaming is a 128kbps mp3 which would mean 128 8 60 60 56mb per hour or 675mb for the whole 12 hour buffering which isn t really so practical

338523
versioning	upgrade
the best things that i like about the upgrade versioning of vs are

338535
any	set
the distinctions among windows user permissions and any set of sql-server grants seem like unrelated concepts

338536
web-config	app-config
in some of projects i have an app-config file and in the website i have my web-config

338561
build-process	nant
what is the best way to generate the .build file i will need to run my build-process with nant

338590
postgresql	oracle
i still don t find oracle as fun to play with as for instance postgresql though.

338604
authentication	login
disregarding the grant table etc side of things the login side of things is very useful because your app can connect to sql-server using windows authentication which means

338620
attributes	properties
the properties had the nonserialized attributes on it

338981
rewrite	rule
through experimenting it would seem the redirect rules in the .htaccess file in the website s root only take effect for requests to pages in that subdirectories if that subdirectories does not contains a .htaccess file or it does and specifies a rewrite rule that does take effect for this particular request

using this you would go in each row column as indicated and if you encounter a 0 at any time set a boolean variables and re-walk that row column setting the entries to 0 as you go

339454
variables	boolean
this will require no extra memory and will only use one boolean variables

339455
inspector	webkit
i noticed this while watching the google appengine local server process so i m fairly certain it wasn t actually cached by the browser as it could have been if i had seen it in firebug or webkit inspector

339496
value	field
after searching around i ve seem to have only found no solutions in .net will suit my needs and the custom libraries that people have written for this seem to have some flaws when it comes to gigantic input 4gb file with some field value having very easily several million characters

339496
value	field
while this seems to be a bit extreme it is actually a standard in the electronic document discovery edd industry for some review software to have field value that contains the full contents of a document

339497

purists say a repository is purely for the source code for the application so anyone can check-out the code without relying on any development environment configuration where as others say it is useful and saves time

339556
continuous-integration	build-server
to address the issue of copying source code straight to production i suggest using a continuous-integration or build-server to perform this task

339580

if your binary-search-tree is a red-black-tree or you intend to any kind of tree rotation operations duplicate nodes will cause problems

339600
forwarding	port
you can use ipfw to set up a forwarding rule for port 3305 to send it to port 3306

339604
file-descriptor	tail
i don t know about hp-ux tail but gnu tail has the option which will follow the file by name by re-opening the file every few seconds instead of reading from the same file-descriptor which will not detect if the file is unlinked and will exit when the filename used to open the file is unlinked

svnadmin	dump
you can do this using svnadmin dump and svnadmin load

339734
vsts	tfs
if that is the case and you are using vsts 2008 and tfs 2008 then using the get latest version on checkout setting of both is probably your answer if you aren t then the checkout and get latest version is what you investigate

339734
vsts	tfs
note if you are using vsts 2008 and tfs 2005 you ll need to do the compile yourself see the notes at the bottom of the home page

339741

32-bit	64bit
i want to add support to xp and vista x64 and my initial idea was to convert the dll to 64bit compiling it with freepascal but keep the application 32-bit for now delphi

339848
32-bit	64bit
is it possible for a 32-bit application to access a 64bit dll

339848
32-bit	64bit
edit2 i m loading the dll via loadlibrary so i guess i m stuck since a 32-bit process won t be able to load a 64bit dll according with what i read on the link pointed by lars truijens on one of the answers below

339850
websphere	ibm
the standard websphere studio application developer 5.1.2 for windows has five disk images located on ibm s xtreme leverage site those being c802xml c802yml c802zml c8030ml and c804uml

339868
python	perl
to pl sql python perl

339868
python	java
the limitations of the query optimiser mean that you will probably never get the level of abstration out of sql that you might get from say python or even c# or java

339877
modulus	digits
or you could convert to an int and pull the digits out with modulus and integer-division

339882
linux	unix
you can t do it when the database runs on linux or unix

339898
void-pointers	dereference
you cannot dereference void-pointers for obvious reasons

339916
haskell	scala
in haskell or scala you can define the monad operations directly on the monadic object

339925
attributes	properties
it s possible to use the internalsvisibleto attributes to make a specific assembly able to reach internal properties but from my point of view that s a poor design

339926
firefox	opera
in opera and firefox i just say in css something like this

339956
keyboard	mouse
user can use keyboard or mouse

339967
getter	setter
agree with moritzstefaner that you don t need the subtraction stage however for your setter i actually think you should use globaltolocal and use localtoglobal for your getter

339988
directory	folder
add the base folder to the project project properties - configuration properties - c++ - additional include directory additional include directory

339993
contains	any
run the unix strings tool and see if the binary contains any of the literal strings from your code

339997
any	set
you can use border-collapse collapse to reliably set cell spacing to 0 as mentioned but for any other value i think the only cross-browser way is to keep using the cellspacing attributes

340002
button	popup
the calendar should not popup if you enter via pressing tab but clicking on a button

340010
32-bit	16-bit
as i understand it all dos cmd windows c# console apps included run as 16-bit not 32-bit

340010
32-bit	16-bit
does this mean all my works console app back office apps are running as 16-bit rather than making the most of the 32-bit available

340013
linq-expressions	lambda
nothing should change per se due to the upgrade though you may need to look at coding standards around new features such as linq-expressions layout lambda versus query syntax

340015
simulink	matlab
hdl coder is a companion product to matlab simulink to automatically generate your hardware description

340021
32-bit	x86
any .net app that is compiled for x86 will be 32-bit

340021
32-bit	64bit
c# console apps aren t running in real dos - they run in a 32-bit or 64bit environment - depending on your os and .net

340024
32-bit	x86
so for x86 it will be 32-bit

340029
order	join
in writing it your way with a sub-query you re forcing it to do the steps in a certain order rather than letting it choose the optimal join order

340033
32-bit	16-bit
16-bit not 32-bit

340033
32-bit	16-bit
there are no 16-bit .net applications and whether an application is console mode or not makes no difference to whether it s 16 or 32-bit

340036
32-bit	16-bit
as i understand it all dos cmd windows c# console apps included run as 16-bit not 32-bit

340037
32-bit	x86
this is just simply not true it wasn t even true before windows as the x86 protected mode is 32-bit so any game or application for dos running in portected mode is 32-bit

340037
32-bit	64bit
by default .net binaries are platform independent and get executed as 32-bit or 64bit application depending the type of .net kernel etc

340042
sendmessage	message
if the spawned application invokes sendmessage with one of the broadcast targets hwnd_broadcast or hwnd_topmost then the sendmessage won t return to the new application until all applications have handled the message - but your app can t handle the message because it isn t pumping messages..

340047
keydown	keyup
you could probably read the keyup event instead of keydown and replace the entire content of the textbox with your entire preferred substituted string on every keypress

340065
32-bit	64bit
as long as the 64bit dll is being loaded by a separate 64bit process and all communication between 32-bit process and 64bit dll is via loose-coupled ipc-like mechanisms that the os can marshall then yes you can do that

340065
32-bit	64bit
on 64bit systems everything about the 32-bit application worked fine except that the print spooler refused to load the add-in dll because the print spooler was of course a 64bit process

i have already written my own logic to read the coordinates from a shapefile containing either points polyline polygon using c-shapelib and plotted over my opengl screen.i found a ogr sample code in doc to read a points shapefile but none for polygon shapefile.and the problem is that this application has to be so dynamic that upon loading the shapefile it should correctly setup the projection of the opengl screen depending upon the projection of the .shp file being read..eg wgs84 lcc everest modified...etc

340200
swing	swt
i like to build the ui html swt or swing with groovy

indeed pretty much only mysql and postgresql are well-supported by the various full-text options

340239
linq-to-objects	ilist
otherwise if you re working with ienumerable ilist instead of datatable datarow it is certainly possible with some linq-to-objects kung-fu

340250

now when i click on modify user for that userid again there will be a selected menu and all the countries will be loaded in the selected menu but those 5 countries should be highlight selecteded

340425
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch exception-handling should always be used when rolling back a transaction

340425
sqltransaction	sql-server
i know that in the sql-server implementation the sqltransaction objects returns null on the connection property if the transaction is a zombie

340433
.when	ready
i prefer to pull the kind of information found in newsletters sans adverts using my rss-reader .when i m ready instead of it being pushed to me .when i m not

even classes that extend derived will have virtual func methods

340450
authentication	login
this assumes you login to the server on which the link was created using windows authentication

should i be using bugzilla web-services and if so is there any good documentation other than the bugzilla api docs which aren t getting me up to speed quickly

340475
perl	php
try to do some string parsing manipulation in c an in perl php and you will know

340475
ruby	php
i might not be an issue for small homepages blogs but large scale web applications still need to be tuned for performance cpu network memory no matter if they are written in java php or ruby

340479
.when	ready
we use a build definition what we run manually .when we are ready to deploy a validated versioning where the last time the build was run was the date we deployed the previous validated versioning

340502
highlight	selected
if you want to use ajax to update the list dynamically then you need to add the selected attributes to the items that need to be highlight

340518
integrated	manual
currently each systemd has its own gui and uses manual process to pass information between them in an effort to automate and integrated the natural thought was to introduce an esb to connect them

340533
getter	setter
the compiler needs to know if you want it to generate a getter and or a setter or perhaps are declaring a field

340577
constructor	object
pass the object reference through the constructor

340577
getter	setter
or by getter and setter

340600
abstract-class	subclassing
one way is to create an abstract-class that does not implement methods that will not behave the same by subclassing

340607
perl	php
also we distribute our product to some of our customers to host themselves so having it compiled protects our source code many interpreted languages are trivially decompilable or in the case of php and perl never compiled at all

340627
contains	any
namespace does not contains any functions

340644
conditional	parentheses
if you mean in conditional if while i only put parentheses when they re necessary

340649
versioning	upgrade
this has the advantage that when you deploy a new versioning of your application it will automatically upgrade old databases and you never have to worry about the database being out of sync with the software

340654
constructor	object
however you re probably going to be better off using either a singleton pattern where you have a static reference to a single resource like the deck for most card games although ccgs tend to have one per player or else passing in the shared resource in the object s constructor

340676
affinity	cpu
changing the cpu affinity of the process should work

340680
python	ruby
it s worth pointing out that most scripting languages python ruby etc. bridge easily -- almost trivially -- to c

selected	textbox
i want to use jquery with a gridview which contains textbox but i m stuck on how to get event listeners registered for every textbox on the selected row

340738

one first idea could you try setting the platform target setting in the c# part of the project to x86 to see if it will run in 32-bit compatibility mode on the vista 64 machine

340751
silverlight	wpf
as far as i m aware the silverlight binding lacks the xpath properties found in wpf so there is no nice way to bind directly to xml

340805
superclass	subclass
the type of a single superclass instance can be derived by the presence or absence of foreign keys in the various subclass tables

340811
double	int
using native types like int double etc

340811
double	int
and void-pointers for a container is nearly always an icky affair because you have either the choice to cast the int for a double this doesn t work to a pointer or you need to allocate extra memory for the data type

340811
double	int
i never needed a hash-table or a map for int or double

340818
any	set
be sure that your rich datatable has the rows property set and also -- if you are doing any column filtering -- make sure that the date table also has the property where paginator is your rich datascroller

340819
32-bit	64bit
in windows x64 a process may be started as 32-bit or 64bit process

340819
32-bit	64bit
a 64bit process can only load 64bit dlls and a 32-bit process only 32-bit dlls

340819
32-bit	64bit
if your platform target specified in the project properties of your .net application is set to any cpu the intermediate code will be compiled to 32-bit or 64bit code depending on the target platform on a x64 system 64bit code will be generated

340820
aes	des
i know with 3-des you can specify a padding type as part of the algorithm and it s handled with no extra work des cbc pkcs5padding but is there a way to specify this with aes

340831
children	nodes
if you just want the children of the root category nodes assuming it is the document root nodes try category subcategorylist category

constructor	object
unless c is a constructor of a builtin object function

340839
toolchain	cmake

340865
substring	ends-with
ends-with s1 s2 substring s1 string-length s1 - string-length s2 +1 s2

341026
keyboard	mouse
if constantly jump between mouse and keyboard you lose this advantage

341027
order	add
to add to the other comments on execution plans under the cpu-based costing model introduced in 9i and used by default in 10g+ oracle will also make an assessment of which predicate evaluation order will result in lower computational cost even if that does not affect the table access order and methods

341036
integrated-security	connection-string
at microsoft.reportingservices.dataextensions.datasourceinfo..ctor string originalname string extension string connection-string boolean originalconnectstringexpressionbased boolean integrated-security string prompt

341049
put	get
believe it or not the validity of a rabbinic divorce document get depends on it being perfectly accurate which means that over the past few hundred years rabbis have standardized which sounds get mapped to which letters but it s often influenced by yiddish and has extra letters put in alephs mostly which modern israelis would find puzzling

341077
python	c++
others compilers generate code in high level languages in domain specific cases pyjamas generates javascript from python code brook generates c++ and gpu shaders code from brook streaming language..

341110
groovy	java
wait for the next major revision change everything to enum and provide a script sed perl java groovy ... to convert existing source code to use the new syntax

341112
selected	button
but this technique can t be used with valeo website since i am not able or at least i don t know yet how to do it to selected click a button when the page is made on javascript since it doesn t have a name value or id for the button

341113
perl	ruby
my advice just use whatever fields you want to use then structure it into a table then find tools that translate text tables into and out of various different formats if one doesn t exist for the format you need write a translator yourself in python perl ruby whatever

341124
required	checked
i believe that the second is more efficient as it required only one selected but to be sure you should explain each query and checked the results

341130
emacs	vim
i work in a unix environment with the typical unix tools emacs vim gvim sunstudio etc

341132

selected	checkbox
on the dialog that appears selected or browse to the version of python you want to use by default and check the always use this program to open this kind of file checkbox

341233
textarea	textbox
in a regular textbox this is of course simple but in a textarea i need to be able to popup the div in the correct location on the screen based on the cursor

341235
contains	any
the bootstrap will contains the defines or an include of the constants file as well as an include of any files that will be required by every page

341235
convention	standards
and finally the last standards convention you may not use but if you start doing object oriented programming the most common methods the pear standards is to name your classes by using an _ to separate namespaces

341246
expression	evaluation
evaluation of an expression

341246
environment	execution
translation or program execution in a documented manner characteristic of the environment with or without

341256
uitableview	uiview
2 set the uiview as tableheaderview of the uitableview

341284
jax-ws	cxf
cxf already lets you use spring to wire up your beans and also has a full implementation of jax-ws as well

341287
bad-request	http-status
the 400 bad-request error is an http-status code that means that the request you sent to the website server was somehow malformed therefore the server was unable to understand or process the request

341291
authentication	login
had it been sql + windows they could ve simply said they wanted administrator to login only from certain boxen or outright use only the windows authentication thereby forcing anyone to go thru the vpn first

341292
integration	payment
i m looking to build a credit card payment integration into an air application and the easy way would be to send the user to a payment service within a browser embedded into the application

341294
realloc	malloc
if you wanted to use realloc on this later you would create the arrays on the heap using malloc like this

341294
realloc	malloc
so that the malloc library and thus realloc etc. knows about your arrays

341313
minimum	max
this would ensure that there is at least one element and max would return it only if it is actually the minimum

341319
linked-list	tree
that s when it s time to start thinking of using other data structures -- a linked-list a binary tree etc

341330
double	int
casting from char to int short to int float to double are all promotions

341330
unsigned	integer
if the integer were negative the value would basically wrap around the maximal value of an unsigned int see 4.7 2

341349
32-bit	64bit
depending on the compiler int may be 32-bit in 64bit land

341364
getter	setter
also wires up a methods for the setter and getter

341364
getter	setter
the setter and getter methods say the same

341373
message	alert
i need to prompt an alert message when a user selecteds a particular option in a selected menu

341387
header-files	makefile
hello i would like to ask you if someone knows how can i add a directory for the header-files in the makefile to avoid the error .h not found i have tried this option but does not work

341388
exception-handling	try-catch
on a conforming compiler adding a non-empty exception-handling specification generates the equivalent of a try-catch block around the function

341394
compression	streaming
it not only defines a cool way to link streaming to each other in a multithreading fashion the example used is compression followed by encryption

341423
iteration	elements
note that the elements s height does change the first iteration the function just never calls itself

341435
methods	extend
both abstractlist and abstractset extend abstractcollection and they have different behaviors for their equals methods specified by the interfaces list and set

341438
configuration	environment
i ve checked iis configuration everywhere i can think of and they re identical so the only difference i can think of is that the production environment is load balanced

341443
arrays	loops
if you put the values in values.php in an arrays you can easily loops through them using a foreach loops

341468
setinterval	settimeout
first of all this right now i have a function that is recursive calls itself through settimeout screams setinterval to me if you re not varying the period

341477
reference-type	generics
error c3225 generics type argument for t cannot be system collections generics keyvaluepair it must be a value type or a handle to a reference-type

341481
any	set
some character encodings like utf-8 and utf-16 can encode any character in the universal character set

341481
unicode	ucs
to support them all it might be best to support the ucs unicode from the start

341486
solaris	linux
this is what it takes for my development makefile to be tunable with minimal fuss to my development platform which can be linux solaris or macos x

341494
double	int
they can just be renamings of a data type with no change in the bits represented most casts between integral types and pointers are like this or conversions that don t even preserve length such as between double and int on most compilers

341496
callback	methods
because of this i d like to not call the postoperationcompleted methods on my asyncoperation since it would require me to write a do-nothing callback

341514
strong-typing	types
it s really the static types checking strong-typing and using coding patterns like strong encapsulation and parameter checking that makes this possible

341541
access-control	authentication
on the directory security tab there s an edit button under authentication and access-control

341553
arrays	loops
the real prescription for this code is an arrays and foreach loops but i thought i d keep my answer simple for now

341553
arrays	loops
arrays and foreach loops are very powerful and relatively quick and easy to learn

341577
page-fault	kernel
this generates a page-fault which can t be handled in the kernel- if it s running a user task but in kernel space it generally makes an oops which uncleanly kills the current task and may leak kernel resources

341581
persistence	hibernate
i like to divide the application up into a persistence layer using spring s orm support for hibernate a service layer business logic and a view layer

341626
groovy	java
if you re willing to use groovy inside your java app you can use the markupbuilder for agile xml creation

341640
callback	methods
instead consider an asynchronous approach such as a methods with a callback

341646
groovy	java
is there a grails mappedsuperclass alternative short of coding domain model objects in java instead of groovy

341648
authentication	login
it s also used to enable an intranet web site to use the end user windows login to authentication onto the sql box where of course the webserver is a separate box

341709
show	next
the only way she can see the next page of results is to turn on javascript or to show more results per page

341716
exception-handling	try-catch
if this is an exception-handlingal case then i would wrap the query in a try-catch block and handle the exception-handling that the standard query generates

341718
contains	set
i d probably have a match object that contains a map of sets map set one two three etc and the methods player int rather than player1 and player2

341723
iteration	elements
when the onchange event is fired for a elements however it seems like the same values are being passed to the onstatuschanged methods for every in the table i ve verified that in each iteration of the loop callid and anotherid are being given new distinct-values

341723
iteration	set
if i understand how this is working correctly this syntax sets a closure for the onchange event to be a function which refers to these two references which end up having a final value of whatever they are set to on the last iteration of the loop

341723
iteration	set
when the event fires the value referenced by callid and anotherid is the value set in the last iteration not the value set at the individual iteration

341738
licensing	platform
right now it s somewhat difficult to leverage the underlying platform in a general setting due to licensing issues go figure but it s certainly there for you to use in your crm system

341758
valgrind	gprof
the two classical answers assuming you are in nix world are valgrind and gprof

341761
order	add
i had a parametrized insert statement that was working well and i needed to add a selected statement and wrap it all in a transaction in order to get data for one of the fields for the insert

341787
authentication	login
windows integrated login with kerberos proper secure authentication

341817
contains	set
i know i can create my very own unistd.h which contains replacements for the things i need - especially in this case since it is a limited set

341834
python	php
i did a conversion between a php site and a turbogears python site for my company

341834
python	php
python isn t as fast as what php can give you but what it lacks in performance it more then makes up for in versatility

341837
.net	wcf
i have a client server application that must use .net remoting not wcf because the project is using framework 2

341838
postgresql	oracle
postgresql folds to lower oracle folds to upper

341852
invoices	product
by default when viewing an account in edit mode you have access to opportunities invoices and quotes which contains the product being shopped by the account and or the sales department

341852
product	invoice
this product subscription does not fit into the opportunity quote or invoice model because they are confirmed recurring sales that were automatically purchased via tools like a public website portal etc

341872
ruby	php
i know there are about a billion php python and ruby html sanitizers out there but does anyone have some pointers to anything good in .net

341880
snmp	mib
i have written something like this in work to read in snmp notification definitions and automatically generate java classes and snmp mib files from this

341883
keyboard	mouse
otoh if you gripe about symbian s little keyboard quirk take a gander at mouse events in android s mini-chrome.

341947
.when	ready
i also have an environment ready so that i can quickly write a new test to reproduce any problem that will be reported and i have a safety .net to detect side-effects and regressions .when i modify or fix the code

341950
checkbox	button
each record in the gv had 2 button and one checkbox

341956
web-services	security
i am developing web-services in c# using wcf and i want to create a custom way of handling security

341957
constructor	private
in c++ this would be easy add a private constructor but c# doesn t allow that

341974
prototype	strict
in strict compliance mode that means in theory you invoke undefined behaviour which is bad when you call a function that takes a variables number of arguments without a prototype declaration of the function in scope

341974
return-type	arguments
then this is a correct c89 fragment with an explicit declaration of pqr as a function that returns an integer with unspecified arguments but the return-type is implicit int

341974
return-type	arguments
as written the function is explicitly declared and has an explicit int return-type - but it still has unspecified arguments

341988
constructor	object
if you create an arrays of object with 1000 elements they all get initialized to null so no constructor are called

342007
telnet	nntp
from codeproject - only links starting with one of the recognized protocols http file mailto ftp http gopher nntp prospero telnet news wais outlook are recognized and reformatted

342016
groovy	java
this was frankly painful in java because closures were so wordy starting with java 8 lambda expressions can be implemented like in many other languages c# lambda expressions or groovy and this special case is handled since java 7 with try-with-resources and autoclosable streams

342056
realloc	malloc
setting a to null works because realloc treats this as if the user called malloc size

342076
registration	login
in the case of a successful registration either the person just registered and you should be in a current session or you should require them to login before they see the customized page

342089
triggers	insert
the only other way to perform this without using triggers is to disallow any insert updates deletes on the table directly via permissions and insist all these actions are performed via stored-procedures that will take care of setting the modified date

342089
put	get
simple well written and well-indexed auditing triggerss are generally not too evil - they only get bad when you try to put too much logic in the triggers

342090
arrays	loops
have an arrays of byte that contain ascii values and have loops that increments the far right digit while doing carry overs

342091
authentication	login
another approach would be to write a custom user authentication module for the second website that will do sql calls to the first websites database to provide the login

342104
base	zero
you re basically implements a base 26 number system with leading zero a

342109
increment	reset
increment the last character and if it reaches z reset it to a and move to the previous characters

342137
cassini	iis
i ve had problems with security thread.currentprincipal etc on cassini that just disappeared when i started debugging against iis

342147
shell	bash
i recently ran up against a wall doing some bash shell programming where an associative arrays would have solved my problems

342163
http	ssl
this certificate must then be imported into the webserver to enable http over ssl

342170
put	get
the natural application for c++ cli is to write skinny little interop pieces and the default behaviour of vs on these projects is to put all the code into the headers which is about as anti-pimpl as you can get

342202
data-access	nhibernate
i hate to be plugging product but check out saasgrid by my the company i work at apprenda .we re a cloud operating system that allows you to write single tenant soa apps feel free to use nhibernate for data-access that automatically injects multi-tenancy into your app

342208
data-access	nhibernate
i hate to be plugging product but check out saasgrid by my the company i work at apprenda .we re a cloud operating system that allows you to write single tenant soa apps feel free to use nhibernate for data-access that automatically injects multi-tenancy into your app

i hate to be plugging product but check out saasgrid by my the company i work at apprenda .we re a cloud operating system that allows you to write single tenant soa apps feel free to use nhibernate for data-access that automatically injects multi-tenancy into your app

342224
environment	building
demanding freedom of personal expression in a team environment is probably not a good way to building the team but i think the team should be open to improving through new ideas

342225
linux	unix
for most unix bsd linux systems most languages provide a programmatic wrapper around the mail command

logging	trace
i m developing a django app and i m trying to use python logging module for error trace logging

342443
unsigned	integer
i work with an application which uses rather big numbers and i need to store data as an unsigned 64-bit integer

342450
stderr	stdout
have a look at processbuilder class it gives you the option to capture the stdout and stderr of the process that it launches

342451
selected	button
this would allow you to make the button not do anything when the wrong control is selected

342451
lost-focus	keypress
if you want to actually disable the button you could do the same check but in the mousedown keypress events for the form or set an event handler for gotfocus lost-focus on every control

342467
integer	numeric
you can store the value in a numeric type with a scale of 0 which will retain the integer semantics required

342467
numeric	digits
the maximum precision for numeric is 38 decimal digits

342467
numeric	digits
is somewhere around 18 or 19 decimal digits so numeric 19 0 would likely work just fine for this data

342473
benchmarking	profiling
for keeping track and know everything about what your code does and how much resources it consumes i recommend you to use a profiling for php i the xdebug profiling there are also other options like apd and benchmarking profiling

342476
methods	extend
extend callable and add methods setstdin setstdout and setstderr if you need it

342483
json	xml
if you learn it you don t have to limit yourself to the database but you can also use it to manipulate xml files or json files or arrays lists and dictionairies

342490
python	c++
as far as experience testing another language in python i ve tested c and c++ systems like this and it was excellent

342492
player	movie
maybe there s a better way to do it but in my experience loading the movie player takes time

342494

it will seem like overkill at first but it isn t terrible especially considering it can handle setting program options in configuration files and environment variables in addition to command line options

342508
radio-button	checkbox
the exceptions that know of are radio-button lists and checkbox lists - you have to be a little trickier with them

342518

children	nodes
what would be the fastest way to merge 2 xml files so i would locate a nodes in first one empty it take all children from the same tag same nodes in second xml and put it in the first one

342562
hosts-file	hosts
i could not find a prohibition in writing but by convention the windows hosts closely follows the unix hosts and you cannot put wildcard hostname references into that file

342562
hosts-file	hosts
basically the code that looks at the etc hosts does not support a wildcard entry

342575
profiling	debugging
2 ways to debugging this either get a real heap profiling that can show you where your runaway class data is referenced or patch the api classes as described here

variables naming conventions spaces between parentheses or keyword or function names.

342705
ubuntu	debian
as used on debian and ubuntu

342722

342722
perl	awk
i basically treat perl like awk on steroids

342723
asp.net-mvc	webforms
as far as the server stack - i haven t used asp.net-mvc yet but we have had success using a home-rolled mvp approach using webforms

342734
tree	trie
a ternary tree trie would be more efficient

342752
webserver	security
personally on web sites i try to use at least root absolute links foo yada.htm most of the time because they are easier to test and i never use parent path links unless putting something on a cd like to have them turned off on the webserver for security reasons

342757
windows-vista	windows
on my home network i have an installation of windows server 2008 and for some reason the windows-vista workstations on the network can connect to the server via remote desktop only via the server s ip address not the hostname

342758
highlight	selected
if the user just touches click a row i want the row to highlight selected and then switch to a detail view presenting data corresponding to the selected row

342758

342775
tree	trie
both of the above are subject to steven a lowe s point that for strings a trie beats a normal tree

342785
hosts-file	hosts
have you added the server to your vista systemd s hosts

342785
put	get
i m assuming that since they are on a private network you re not running your own dns and thus to get at them via protocols that use ip names you need to put entries in hosts manually

342790
silverlight	wpf
this is similar to this question but it was never properly answered and was also specific to silverlight whereas this is wpf

342793
telnet	tcp
your php script could then use a tcp connection or a unix socket to communicate with your telnet client daemon process using the php sockets api

342806
children	nodes
checking if a word exists is a matter of looking at each letter individually and that it exists in the children of the current nodes

342814
selected	cell
i ve read the code there and it looks sensible though it occurs to me that you may also need to handle touchupinside and not call super touchupinside in order to avoid selected a cell on a horizonal swipe

342850
openbsd	freebsd
ifstated can be used as a front-end with pf on openbsd and freebsd to redirect traffic to online servers

342872
select	union
a recordset can only be defined with a single select statement though of course you can union multiple selects if they have the same number of columns

342872
ado	jet
if you re using ado .execute can also be used for selected it returns the rows but jet s native data interface layer dao cannot -- .execute works only for action queries

342978
textile	bbcode
markdown bbcode textile mediawiki markup are all basically the same general concept so i would really just lump this into two categories html and plain text markup

342978
xhtml	tidy
with html formatted user input you re stuck now having to convert all the html to xhtml individually which as html tidy shows is not always a simple task

343002

if the user does not type in anything in the two fields and submits the page how do i make lucene.net return all the books from my index irrespective of bookauthor and bookdescription field value

343025
switching	router
no switching no router

343035
buffering	streaming
the trouble is that after the fork the file streaming seems to flush out sometimes and i get duplicates output after the fork all open files are closed which i guess causes the buffering to be flushed

343066
buffering	streaming
not quite sure i understand your question but if you want to make sure your cgiout buffering are empty before you fork you can use fflush on the streaming just before you fork

343066
buffering	streaming
it maybe suitable to use an unbuffered streaming by changing the buffering settings via setvbuf and friends

343076
double	int
first as mentioned previously you need lf instead of d to display the double otherwise it will just display zero all the time d is for a signed int

343083

it s a fake field like all_records that contains some dummy value like x

343101
spaces	output
to double spaces the output stored in the variables below and individually number each line

343106

343106
windows-xp	windows
all we know about is windows-xp and windows 7

343106
cygwin	gnu
popular choices are microsoft visual-c++ you can get the visual express edition for free from microsoft cygwin or mingw the minimalist gnu for windows

343109
proximity	distance
you can use a proximity search to find terms within a certain distance of each other

343125
user-controls	ascx
but i still find custom events very useful in my ascx usercontrols because its an easy way to hide details about how the user-controls works internally and just expose an event that the page can react on when interesting stuff happens

343156
express-checkout	paypal
includes express-checkout paypal customers can check out at paypal using their stored information such as billing and shipping addresses

343160
scheme	lisp
good sources include lisp in small pieces and marc feeley s scheme in 90 minutes presentation

343161

for a solution if you only need to show or hide a div the best way is to do it from javascript client side by changing the style visibility of that div and not by cloning it

343191
subclassing	superclass
superclass receive this message before their subclassing

343193
uniform	points
first by sampling each iso-line at a uniform intervals you get 2d points and then you raise the points by the appropriate height

343196
bazaar	git
here is a comparison table between git hg and bazaar

343209
javascript	dom
ideally it would be a library that has a range of ready made ui widgets no dependencies on dom javascript extention manipulation frameworks like jquery or prototype minimal additional cruft such as ajax api s and dom selectors etc

343209
jquery	dojo
please do not suggest jquery prototype mootools dojo etc their primary focus is not to provide ui widgets

343218
textbox	onblur
i ve encountered this annoying feature before and my solution at the time was to use the onfocus event to record the current value of the textbox and then use the onblur event to check whether the current value now matches the value saved during onfocus

343221
switching	router
if the router or switching gets congested this will also slow down your transfer speed

343240
aiff	wav
i already know how to record but only to lossless formats such as wav and aiff

343261
any	set
in change tracking you set a retention period to hold the changes typically a period that ensures any processing of the tracked tables is within the retention period

343261
triggers	insert
if you want to achieve this in 2005 or below you can basically create tables for each table you want to be tracked and have a triggers to insert values into the tracking table on insert update delete

343265
jquery	dojo
it has built in dojo and also has options to plugin other libraries like prototype jquery gwt yui etc

343288
put	get
rest requires get post put and delete

343288
json	xml
is this type of type interaction a component of the restful philosophy or is rest simply the exchange of data via xml json

system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
edit i m currently using system.data.oracleclient but willing to accept solutions using another provider odp.net devart etc..

343309
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
do you use odp.net or the devart provider aka as corelab provider or do you use the microsoft provider for oracle system.data.oracleclient

343319
value	field
define serialization field starting value of 1 increment by 1 insert leading zeros

343321
quirks-mode	doctype
i would suggest adding a doctype to the document to avoid quirks-mode

343349
any	set
scrum is often mis-applied as a general purpose fix-all process for every situation when like any process it only has usefulness within a fairly narrow set of circumstances

343356
google-chrome	firefox
i can run firefox or google-chrome and get another session but the app isn t supported in these browsers

343375
virtualization	vmware
you could use a virtualization tool like vmware and run a second or more if you have enough ram instance of windows with its own ie

343379
oracle	mysql
a really fast way to solve this problem is to make a database link from the oracle database to the mysql database

343411
document	editing
if there are dtd references in the xml document try editing them out to prove the cause

343439
push	pull
consider using some ipc that involves only a push or a pull and not both as does the filesystems such as an http-post a jms or msmq queue etc

343441
hash	md5
the client uses the md5 hash algorithm to create a fingerprint of the data and password combined and then sends the fingerprint as a response

343453
moss	wss
i ve no idea how to solve this i am having exactly the same problem i found a hotfix for moss which will not work for wss v3 it proposes to increase the length of the hyperlink field but is not compatable with wssv3

343478
difference	count
the key difference between the icollection family and the ienumerable family is the absence of certainty as to the count of items present quite often the items will be generated loaded hydrated as needed - in some cases an enumerable may not ever finish generating results which is why the count is missing

343514
any	set
rather than create a whole new msi for each set of changes or do this manually i wondered if anyone knew of any alternative tools that can update multiple reports at a time or even able to deploy the contents of a folder into a folder on the reporting server

343537
revision	svn
these could be numbered based on the svn revision or based on our internal compatibility version but they usually have names

343551
virtualbox	vmware
between hyperv vmware and virtualbox there are much better alternatives available

343553
contains	set
the database-table ms accesss contains +100 000 rows and when i set the adotable.active true it starts to load the entire table into ram and that takes a lot of memory and time

343557
response	timeout
i already tackled the issues of different views for each type of invocation and http response timeout just looking for a way of telling the two invocation types apart

343562
firebird	mysql
i would ideally like it to work on both firebird 2 and mysql 5 as the update will need to be ran against both databases and it would be simpler if the same sql ran on both if it worked on more database that would be a plus

343564
delphi	c++
post number 7 has a source example on how to use the relevant winapi functions in c++ that should easily translate into delphi

343571
frame-rate	fps
i just need a uncompressed video with a constant frame-rate 25 fps or 50 fps

343585
margins	padding
a trick i just used to get this to work is to have padding on the left of the containers and we can encourage the left-sibling to sit inside this spaces by giving it an equal but negative margins

343592
spaces	output
the following awk scripting will double spaces the output and number the lines

343633
web-services	api
according to the bugzilla web-services api some of the features needed changing a bug status are not yet available so for the time being direct sql calls seem the most appropriate option

343646
directory	folder
how can i ignore directory or folder in git using msysgit on windows

343683
managed-code	native-code
also may i suggest that if you have your heart set on mixing native-code and managed-code that you create your library using c++ cli

343683
managed-code	c++-cli
note that i am not a c++-cli guy and this code doesn t do anything useful...its just meant to show how easily you can mix native and managed-code

343702
rewrite	rule
i don t know what methods you are using to rewrite the urls but i know that with apache and isapi_rewrite on windows you have to add a flag to each rule in the .htaccess file or equivalent to tell it to log the rewritten url and not the original

343706
boolean	int
i would probably create a type adapter for converting a boolean to an int

343711
command-line	cmd
i m sshing into a remote server on the cmd-line and trying to copy a directory onto my local machine with the scp cmd

343712
triggers	insert
some databases oracle allow you to create instead of triggers on views that convert insert updates and deletes on the view into dml on the underlying tables

343713
rollback	commit
being able to commit locally without access to your server office and this rollback when necessary is brilliant

343728
xsd	xml
apache xmlbeans can be used to generate java classes and interfaces from xml schema definition files xsd

343751
numeric	digits
you might also consider using numeric p s where the precision number of digits and scale number of digits to the right of the decimal can be explicitly specified

343761
factors	digits
it s best to have more digits of precision at least one more in your conversion factors than in your measurements

343764
authentication	login
how can i make my application break at the point of authentication login in the browser navigate to a certain uri and then continue debugging

343784
document	element
for all nodes in the document i suppose there is not more than one per concatenation all relevant data element names attributes value into a string

343797
bazaar	git
basically id does not make any sense with bazaar git and other distributed source code management tools

343858
value	field
if you needed a row contains three field and the three string value were

343858
export	csv
if the remaining problems are line-break related you could do a string replace of n with n and r with r in the code that export each field to csv

343859
expression	evaluation
now what happens is that both unary expression modify the same operand so the code does two times ++i when evaluation the unary expressions before adding the results of both unary expressions

343957
double-quotes	spaces
enclose it in double-quotes in case the path contains spaces

343958
cygwin	gnu
there are windows ports of unix commands like gnuwin32 gnu utilities for win32 i use these or cygwin

343995
crypt	hash
i d like to maintain the same user base but the passwords are hash using the php crypt function

343995
crypt	hash
crypt in this case is using the crypt_md5 implementation - the hash all start with 1

343995
crypt	md5
i ve tried phalanger but it doesn t have an md5 implementation of the crypt function

343995
crypt	md5
the c# example of crypt on codeproject uses des not md5

344003
concatenation	comma
this ends up concatenation the two values separated by a comma

344014
constructor	object
contrary to what many believe a constructor hasn t much to do with the instantiation of an object at all pretty misleading term

344014
constructor	object
a constructor is a special method that can be called after the instantiation of an object to allow that object to properly initialize itself

344014
value	field
in c++ object instantiation allocates memory for the object in .net and java it is both allocated and pre-initialized to default value depending on the type of field 0 null false etc.

344020
margins	padding
you should be able to get any spacing you need figured out with margins padding or minheight

344029
macros	basic
to make this concrete we need a fields_and_methods type macros that is multi-line and uses token-pasting i m not going to deal with stringizing - the same basic mechanisms will apply though

344040
oracle	mysql
a real one like mssql express or mysql or oracle xe all are free

344044
click	mouse
in desktop apps a right mouse button click almost universally results in context menu popping up

344045
linux	osx
both are available for the big three linux osx windows

344060
proj4js	utm
according to this page utm is supported by proj4js

344077
ordinals	digits
it would be feasible to add o as a format item for the ordinals day number with digits 1st 2nd 3rd ... and an alternative logically o but i think that is already in user for the spelled out versioning first second ...

344080
click	mouse
it is easier to make desktop gui respond to particular mouse movements and click etc

344086
contains	any
the reason it s safe is that the string it returns will only contains the digit characters 0 through 9 not any fancy unicode digits so the conversion to ansistring will not lose any information

344103
python	java
i ve used selenium rc from haskell python java and c# so far it works fine

344118
document-ready	.when
jquery and other javascript frameworks can help handle the problem by using a methods such as the document-ready function which fire .when the document is ready and don t need to wait for all the images

344132
vbscript	jscript
but i prefer using cscript vbscript or even jscript

344139
contains	any
depending on how wide this is you could have a huge impact on the size of any other indexes you create because all non-clustered indexes contains the clustered index value in them

344160
boost	tbb
i believe it is designed specifically to utilise multi core processors while boost threads leaves control up to the user tbb will thread differently on a quad core compared to a dual core

344161
children	tree
so if i have one scripting that can start my apps as children of the explorer process my other scripting just has to kill the explorer processes tree

344163
json	xml
depending on what you need it can use soap simple xml or even json for encodings

344168
value	field
using mootools i can pass the value of a form field back to the original form using onclose

344168
append	input
so i want to know the best way to handle all of this data is it possible to load it into one form and then use moo to submit that form to a single form field or can i use moo to just append all the information into a single hidden input-field but if i do that how does user input come into it

344197
attributes	properties
the dom element style properties is a readonly collection of all the style attributes defined on the element

344225
checkbox	textbox
another one we want to think about is what if instead of checkbox we have textbox where users write in a value of how many minutes they spent on an activity

344236
keyvaluepair	key
can anyone tell me how to set the key and value of a keyvaluepair from c++

344257
revision	svn
svn path does not exist for revision 1234

344263
filtering	sorting
i want to pass the params collection from the controller to the model to parse filtering and sorting conditions

344281
directory	folder
the problem is that i ve now accumulated a bunch of backup folder in each project directory which makes it harder to find the specific change i was looking for

344281
directory	folder
it would then move the selected folder to a specific centralized backup directory - where it would also generate a readme.txt file outlining the backup details

344295
version-control	git
i think what you want is a distributed version-control system such as git

344306
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
we run our svn server under apache on windows and find that reads are general case-insensitive but write operations are case-sensitive

344310
bazaar	git
i quite like bazaar but git is very popular too although i don t know how good its windows support is since it is primarily a nix tool developed for the linux kernel

344327
integer	zero
in this case populated is defined as not null having a length greater than zero if a string or not equal to 0 if an integer

344331
constructor	object
keyvaluepair is an immutable type so you have to pass everything to the constructor which looks the same as in c# except you write it like this if the object is on the stack

344335
communication	messages
the two programs should be able to communication things like battery life text messages etc.

344379
value	field
i m looking to make validation for a page in which one or more field have a value in them

344401
value	field
javascript will check if there is a value in the field and maintain a flag

344404
communication	messages
i then have some base message class that handles the communication and a set of derived messages for each specific command i want

344408
value	field
then when the user enters something in one of the field copy the value into the userslocations object

344408
input-field	onblur
so have an onblur event handler on the input-field that updates the data structure something like this

344419
directory	folder
bonus what if i want to place that folder outside the public directory

344425
googletest	cppunit
i ve had success with both cppunit and googletest

344427
any	set
you can set the style attributes of any element.

344474
instances	private
for instances once a user is logged in they can bookmark any private page close the browser open the browser back up and go to the bookmark and is never asked to sign in again which turns out to be bad since we recently started disabling users

344477
assign	add
now i am trying to use netsh http add sslcert to assign the ctl to my site

344480
json	xml
the flash app will need to query your database via a webpage that gives back the info in xml or json or however you want to give the data to your flash app for new donations to show every so often

i have a mouseenter and mouseleave event for a panels control that changes the backcolor when the mouse enters and goes back to white when it leaves

347439
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have label control within this panels as well but when the mouseenter the label control the mouseleave event for the panels fires

347442
value	field
one thing to watch out for are the comp_t field - these are actually a weird exponent mantissa type for holding a large range of value in 16-bit - the algorithm is pretty simple for turning it into a long

347443
python	java
it s implemented in java and has python and ruby bindings as well

347459
getter	setter
it is also questionable if it is worthwhile testing truly trivial functionality such as getter and setter although you never know how long they will be trivial

time-complexity	big-o
i don t understand the brute force and how to count the number of operations and how to count the time-complexity worst best avg i tried to search for it on the .net but each time i end with the big-o notation and the divide and conquer which i don t want

347505
ussd	smpp
ussd works using a connection oriented smpp

347514
sorted	lookup
example if you want to lookup a phone number in the phone book the clever solution would be to observe that all entries are sorted by last name and directly lookup the correct letter etc

what sort of field should i use to load this value into

347593
business-objects	data-access
in our open source project bunian we concluded that the business-objects the whole component is the core of the system and everything should revolve around it including that data-access layer

347639
unpivot	pivot
in sql2005 there are functions called pivot and unpivot which can be used to transform between rows and columns

347644
unsigned-integer	int
to get a better feel for this you could try creating a signed int out of your unsigned-int

347644
subtract	add
now you have two signed numbers that you can add or subtract the way you already know

347673
unpivot	pivot
like others have said you can use the pivot and unpivot operators

347673
unpivot	pivot
unfortunately one of the problems with both pivot and unpivot are that you need to know the values you will be pivoting on in advance or else use dynamic sql

347694
dictionary	arrays
index file can be read into in-memory arrays of structs less overhead and much more predictable memory consumption than dictionary or you can do the search directly on disk

347738
adobe-reader	acrobat
by that you get the versionnumbers of the installation of adobe-reader formerly acrobat reader that exist on this computer

347741

347813
boost	stl
i know there is the stl and boost and all kinds of libraries out there but they are not all of a piece they all feel different

347849
value	field
make sure you are using covering indexes - you can get all your requested field value from the index without going to the data table

347850
keyboard	mouse
further creating a different experience for a mouse user versus a keyboard user also goes against most current wisdom on good user-interface design

347854

functionality seems very limited though since gae uses python + javascript and not java

347867
versioning	upgrade
the .net runtime itself has been upgrade with what amounts to a service pack in the 3.5 versioning

347917
any	set
is there any way to set the src attributes of an iframe without the iframe generating an http request

347940
negative-number	zero
dividing a positive number by zero produces a positive infinity and dividing a negative-number by zero produces a negative infinity

347940
complex-numbers	logarithm
yes this operation makes sense in the context of complex-numbers but a double represents a real number and so there is no double to represent the result. the same is true for logarithm of negative numbers

347953
constructor	object
i m a little suprised that you are having issues with hibernate not instantiating object with a non visible constructor considering that it can be worked around with reflection and i haven t had that issue in my project non of the classes actually have visible constructors

347987
any	set
is there any way to set a cookie and just use it purely as a bucket for storing some data and never send that data to the server

348000
hash	md5
he figured that no one would ever think to create a dictionary where they hash inputs with md5 and sha1

348010
rewrite	rule
i am not familiar with the engine you are using but if you are using a rewrite rule that rewrite based on a very wide rule it will incorrectly point to your stylesheets and images and javascript i believe

348015
base-class	subclass
i would test the application base-class indirectly by creating a subclass and testing that just as you said

348051
simulator	platform
if i add the .a file to my project dependencies it works well with the simulator but it doesn t link when targeting the iphone sdk certainly because the .a file is compiled for an intel platform

348101
passthru	exec
they are exec passthru system and backticks the key to the left of the 1 key

348109
hash	md5
does it make any difference if you mix md5 and sha1 for example instead of repeating the same hash function

348114
hash	md5
i m still sticking with my answer that there are smaller number of md5 md5 text type hash than md5 text hash increasing the chance of collision even if still to an unlikely probability and reducing the search space

348124
hash	md5
however there exist large databases of md5 hash which are more likely to contain the password text than the md5 of it

348129
hash	md5
double hashing doesn t really help protect against this since the same collisions will still result in the same first hash which you can then md5 again to get the second hash

348137
required	checked
a different approach is to have a session variables server side or even in a cookie which gets checked by each and every jsp which required authentication

348140
pbkdf2	hash
a good key derivation algorithm like pbkdf2 injects the password into each round of hashing mitigating concerns about collisions in hash output

348236
filtering	grouping
there are several places where the user should be able to sort grouping and filtering results

348421
any	set
i could really use a second set of eyes so any help is appreciated

348449
double	int
instead of doubling the number of times you calculate the hash double the size of your salt or double the number of bits used int the hash or do both

348533
variables	boolean
if they are connected then some boolean value for that node will be true and another variables will hold the value of the node it is connected to

348548
codeigniter	kohana
apparently i am not the only one who thinks that codeigniter is overly restrictive the kohana project is a fork of codeigniter + optimizations namely pure php5 support all oo codeigniter is still php4 compatible at the expense of not being able to take advantage of php5 oo capabilities

348548
codeigniter	kohana
i prefer kohana over codeigniter ymmv

348555
put	get
but i would say to put as little as is necessary to get a birds eye view of how your program works

348606
constructor	object
as you can see below in the constructor i m instantiating a validation object so i can validate a user s email in a set method

348608
grouping	sorting
storing the all_available_data lets you do sorting filtering grouping etc

348613
constructor	object
break the coupling to the concrete validation object via dependency injection define an abstract pure virtual validation class make a concrete validation class derive from it and pass in inject a reference to the abstract validation class in the user class s constructor

348639
.when	ready
.when you feel that you re ready to take on a real customer pick one that you have a lot of trust with and pick a reasonably small project to start with

348652
any	set
in previous versions i don t recall any way of doing this - if i recall correctly it was automatically set to long-integer but there s no way to control what access does with the autonumber

348655
webserver	upload
setting up the webserver is slightly simpler because i don t need to have an upload folder and tell all my applications where it is

348659
webserver	upload
setting up the webserver is slightly simpler because i don t need to have an upload folder and tell all my applications where it is

348672
wordpress-plugin	wordpress
i use it on my wordpress blog along with ozh s free ip to nation wordpress-plugin

348672
show	next
he even has a nice set of tiny country flags that you can display next to or instead of the country name which is what i do to automatically show flags next my blog s commenter s names

348704
http-post	post
i want to salt a hashed username and password submitted via http-post in javascript on the client-side with a higher-order time value 1 minute resolution to avoid sending the username and password hash as a constant value that could be used for a log-in attempt via post fabrication by an unauthorized user a sniffer

348704
salt	md5
if they inspect the javascript and see that it uses this time salt how much easier will it make the job of breaking the md5 if they know what the salt is

348722
hash	md5
their job will become infeasible since you can t use a rainbow table at all if the hash is salted correctly and you can t break md5 in less than a minute by which time the hash is invalidated anyway

348746
constructor	private
in this case i tend to implement the validation in each of these classes as a private static method valid input that is invoked from the constructor in languages like java or c#

348780
member-functions	base-class
so for example you could derive from a private base-class which provides member-functions with s as a parameter

348794
multi-select	autocomplete
in my case i want to implement a multi-select autocomplete combobox using html javascript and jsp

348818
markup	xhtml
xhtml is not just about a document s markup

348818
markup	xhtml
they we latched onto xhtml css because the w3c said this was the future and the only other choice was a world where a single vendor microsoft controlled the defacto markup spec

348829
hashmap	arrays
the problem with php s associative arrays is that they aren t arrays at all they re hashmap

348829
linked-list	hashmap
you might look at a linked-list as well but a hashmap seems perfectly suited to what you re doing

348830
for-loop	loops
i++ loops are nooby but only because the code becomes much clearer if you use a for-loop

348877
contains	any
would they contains any links to dependent unmanaged dlls too which would be nice

348885
json	xml
how you want to encode things on the wire in xml json whatever

348920
registration	login
i made a member registration on login page and adm too

348951
environment	building
for building a cas in general one place to start might be here building a computer algebra environment by composition of collaborative tools by kajler and safir

348977
ienumerator	ienumerable
the foreach statement usually uses ienumerable and ienumerator or their generic cousins

348996
defined	declare
functions declare static are not visible outside the translation unit they are defined in a translation unit is basically a .c file

349024
linux	unix
the mimetypes module uses mime.types files as they are common on linux unix systems

349039
buffering	capture
you re not using output buffering correctly - see man page for ob_end_clean to see that it doesn t return the capture output you need ob_get_contents for that

349043
native-code	unmanaged
the dlls referred to in the manifest microsoft.vc90.debugcrt are also unmanaged native-code

349087
checkbox	button
on click of a button it should be checked that if any checkbox is checked or not

349087
message	alert
if none checkbox is checked then it should display alert message that check checkbox first

349099
attributes	properties
for local government work in the uk targets have been set to ensure that websites follow double a guidelines one of which states use relative rather than absolute units in markup language attributes values and style sheet properties values

349104
getter	setter
edit project lombok solves exactly the problem of getter and setter generation

349106
constructor	private
the constructor of my class sets the date time in a private field

349119
logging	trace
the trace for some reason is trying to a create the log file and or b write to the log file using the user that is currently browsing the sharepoint site is there any way to configure the logging to use a particular user account instead

349121
alignment	layout
i can do all of this but my real question is does anyone know of a way to inherit from the standard winforms layout editor so that i can choose to use the nice docking alignment hints and control resizing without coding it all again

349128
file-not-found	access-denied
you ll be able to see a file-not-found or access-denied entry for the file if you have it set up right

349129
directory	folder
if you place your build files in a different directory from your source as i do you don t have the folder in the tree to worry about

349132
buffering	streaming
â œbecause some native platforms only provide limited buffering size for standard input and output streaming failure to promptly write the input stream or read the output stream of the subprocess may cause the subprocess to block and even deadlock.â

349133
font-size	height
tab page headings do not grow vertically to accommodate a larger font-size they always remain the same height

349172
queue	fifo
we have written once a thread-safe fifo queue class which is very helpful in a multithreading environment

349194
webforms	asp.net
in our company it is becoming the de facto standard for new projects and we re currently in the middle of porting our main website from coldfusion mach-ii to asp.net mvc as both are mvc environments and i see mvc as a superior architectural pattern to webforms and the code-behind model

349207
multiplication	subtraction
the last one could be even faster once it got compiled both have one if and one subtraction but the first one has a multiplication in some cases the last one has not

349229
json	xml
why not use a standard that both languages can parse like json xml or yaml

349242
asp.net-mvc	webforms
however some projects are more suited for the existing webforms style whilst others will greatly benefit from asp.net-mvc

349248
directory	folder
my csv repo has an empty directory obj in every folder

349254
lookup	any
first they use some fairly general search pattern to pick out everything that could be an address and then they use their map database to lookup that string and see if they get any matches

349257
margins	padding
is there a way to detect the true border padding and margins of elements from javascript code

349289
droppable	draggable
jquery has draggable droppable classes to do what you need haven t used them tho

349293
32-bit	64bit
so i d presume that wanting to use more ram would require vista 64 but perhaps it could still be slower overall there is a large overhead in using the 32-bit vs 2008 on 64bit os

349313
windows	wow64
wow64 is a compatibility environment provided by the operating system that allows a 32-bit application to run on a windows 64-bit operating system

349313
32-bit	64bit
there are a lot of comparisons between running 32-bit applications on 32-bit and 64bit versions of windows on the web

349313
32-bit	64bit
one such test does show an improvement in only certain limited circumstances and even reduced performance for some 32-bit apps running in a 64bit environment

349313
32-bit	64bit
what we saw was that using 64bit memory addressing or especially converting the memory addressing of a 32-bit executable to work with the 64bit version of xp imposed a slight memory bandwidth hit

349313
32-bit	64bit
while not big enough to be an issue it proves what we were already seeing from the previous benchmark results 32-bit code runs slightly slower in a 64bit environment than it does in its native 32-bit habitat

349320
specifications	w3c
here s the w3c specifications for css2 s automatic numbering and increment with an example of 1.1 1.2 1.3 type numbering

349322
duplicates	contains
this design contains navigation elements which are partially or entirely duplicates all over the page - in particular links to the main 3 categories for navigation are present on the page no less than 4 times

349322
duplicates	contains
can i use css so that my html contains a single list of navigation links in a sane format but the standard browser view contains multiple partial duplicates

349326
directory	folder
since they are closely aligned with the jsps is it a good idea to create a new top-level directory resources and mirror the jsp structure under this folder

349328
yaml	ini
but before defining your own you might take a look at existing text-based formats like json yaml even lua was a data description language at the origin or for very simple needs windows ini format or java s properties

349367
value	field
i created a context listener to set the value of a static field in the struts class

349377
versioning	upgrade
do the tests from versioning to versioning for some useful set of upgrade

349421
simpledateformat	java.util.date
allows the formatting of java.util.date instances using the same patterns defined by the simpledateformat class

349423
default	reset
as regards the reset button i think that the default form reset should never be used without a confirmation especially in long forms.

349432
hashtable	set
programmatically session state is nothing more than memory in the shape of a dictionary or hashtable key-value pairs which can be set and read for the duration of a user s session

349440
installation	upgrade
we have one sql scripting that does both a clean installation and an upgrade

349440
installation	upgrade
this way we re guaranteed that the upgrade scripting will bring even the oldest installation up to the latest version

349441
adplus	dump
frequently you can use adplus adplus.vbs as a replacement tool for the microsoft internet information server iis exception-handling monitor 6.1 7.1 and user mode process dump

349472
elementtree	lxml
usually i would suggest using elementtree s iterparse or for extra-speed its counterpart from lxml

349480
wmv	asf
using asf view i can see that the source wmv file appears to have incorrect data in its bitmapinfoheader structure it reports that is has 4 3 dimensions but is actually 16 9 but is there an equivalent tool for mp4 files so i can check whether this problem has been carried through to the transcoded file

349492
motif	x11
for a long time motif was used as a default gui toolkit for x11 apps

349492
motif	x11
wx was designed to do this from the beginning - gtk and motif versions on x11 win32 on windows and iirc an osx version

349501
boolean	int
this can also be extended to weighted edges by using int or another numeric type instead of boolean as the elements of the arrays

349521
hashtable	set
programmatically session state is nothing more than memory in the shape of a dictionary or hashtable key-value pairs which can be set and read for the duration of a user s session

349546
triggers	insert
cdc is an ability to record changes to table data into another table without writing triggers or some other mechanism change data capture records the changes like insert update and delete to a table in sql-server thus making the details of the changes available in relational format

349564
lighttpd	apache
i am using django as web framework and then apache and lighttpd as web server and static media server respectively

349564
lighttpd	apache
lighttpd is running on a different machine from the apache django one

349597
worksheet	excel
is anyone aware of a good resource online for detailed information on the use of ole excel objects embeded workbooks worksheet etc... in vb6

349605
google-docs	spreadsheet
up until now we ve been using a spreadsheet in google-docs to keep track of current and upcoming projects

349605
fogbugz	redmine
the major ones i ve looked at so far are activecollab redmine fogbugz and trac right now redmine feels to be the most fitting

349608
continuous-integration	teamcity
continuous-integration - yes - teamcity

349608
code-coverage	ncover
code-coverage tools - yes - ncover

349608
bug-tracking	mantis
bug-tracking - mantis

349646
boolean	int
the easiest way to do this would be to use a square matrix 2d arrays either of boolean to show the presence or absence of a connection or int to represent the cost of traversal

349686
jquery	.post
i think i was getting confused with the type parameter in jquery s .post command

349701
string.format	stringbuilder
everyone has posted about how readable string.format is which i accept and it has null ref and internationalization benefits yes but nobody has mentioned that it s considerably slower than simple string concatenation small number of elements or using stringbuilder large number of concatenation

349707
ruby	php
it is not an model-view-controller type of framework it is probably closer to php than ruby on rails for example and just as bad from what i have seen of it

349719
arguments	default
now as j-p correctly states jquery has the functions outerwidth and outerheight which include the border and padding by default and also the margin if the first arguments of the function is true

349719
margins	padding
what you need to do is get the padding margins and border width-values of that particular div and add them to the result of the width methods

349719
margins	padding
that way you will always get the correct computed value even if you change the padding or margins value from the css

349735
mouse-listeners	mouselistener
how do i add mouselistener or different colores on over 50 jseparators without spending 24h

349743
author	posts
my homepage or welcome page will consist of data from two models lets call them author and posts

349743
author	posts
should i create a new controllers called welcome which gathers data from the author and posts and then display them in the welcome index view

349755
entity-framework	nhibernate
the entity-framework probably isn t quite ready for serious production work outside of smaller solutions which leaves you with linq to sql or nhibernate

349790
highlight	selected
with it you can view the swing object heirarchy right click on it and rendering any part of it in another windows that highlight each component and lets you see their boundaries as well as selected them

349792
scrollbar	widget
but without a lot of experience they rely on defaults and shortest-path-to-a-solution read don t take time to hide scrollbar when they aren t needed don t use common idioms for toolbar don t properly align widget etc

349805
salt	md5
the time-based salt will not make md5 any easier to break

349805
hash	md5
you re still relying on 1 the user having a good password to defeat brute force calculations and 2 md5 being a decent hash

349805
unique	words
in other words everytime a login form is sent to the client the server would generate a random unique salt string sending it to the client and keep track that this is an acceptable salt

349819
any	set
if not find out if it shadows any point already in your set then rebuild the enveloping set of curves

349840
python	c++
example of qsystemtrayicon in c++ easy to adapt to python

349851
command-line	cmd
the cmd-line or the start cmd

349854
put	get
you can put these things in the classpath if your build tool doesn t get confused

349863
testng	junit
junit can t do that sort of thing -- though testng does have beforesuite and aftersuite annotations

349867
constructor	private
no private constructor so singleton is a hack

349891
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and obviously google-chrome as well

349903
order	join
in your query of the other table do a join to this table on status_precedence.status and then you can order by status_precedence.order

349924
ruby	php
is the lamp linux apache mysql php ruby python stack appropriate for enterprise use

349924
ruby	php
i ve also seen examples where websites like yellowpages.com ruby on rails and facebook php are built on it

349924
solaris	unix
linux is seen as not as well supported as unix solaris or windows servers

349924
postgresql	mysql
mysql is a not ready for prime time db for hobbyists and not a competitor for sql server or oracle although postgresql seems to have a reputation for being more robust

349924
ruby	php
php ruby on rails are optimized for crud create read update and delete operations

349924
ruby	php
furthermore a lot of applications and systems like manufacturing systems have a lot of non-crud functionality that may be harder to build with php or ruby or even python

349930
selected	button
second you only see the ugly url when you selected a date and click the go button

349939
difference	count
the difference in my opinion is due to the fact that the size you see in the properties page is calculated by querying the table .sys.database_files which count the number of 8kb pages allocated by each database file

349955
solaris	unix
linux is seen as not as well supported as unix solaris or windows servers

349955
ruby	php
php ruby on rails are optimized for crud and both are slowly performing

349955
python	java
java and python might be faster

349955
ruby	php
php and ruby aren t the last word in lamp

349982
python	java
dive into python is great but don t forget pje s python is not java

349989
postgresql	mysql
i d prefer to see postgresql or even sqlite take chunks out of the mysql market and i d like to see mono or jsp or cocoon based apps more

350006
highlight	selected
this basically says if the state of the item you re drawing e.state is selected highlight use systemcolors.highlighttext otherwise use systemcolors.windowtext

350038
duplicates	contains
what do to when both hash contains one or more duplicates keys

350050
postgresql	mysql
but many enterprises tend to use databases like oracle or ibm db2 instead of open source offerings - although there are many enterprises that don t really need the kind of power those systems provide and could get away with mysql or postgresql

350050
ruby	php
however if you use apache it is probably easier to use php ruby or python whereas if you use iis or weblogic or domino it will be easier to do it in java c#

350065
web-services	security
i wish to do this because the limit of 20 characters for the pre-windows 2000 username is insufficient for the role-based security i wish to apply for different web-services the application directories coming off this website

350067
any	set
is there any way to set the program to run at a specified time w out user interaction

350094
convention	standards
for our .net projects we use the ibm drivers and we use the standards iseries naming convention

350098
ref	out
check this out from the flex3 language ref

350099
sql-server	mysql
many .net shops stick to sql-server and fewer use mysql at least at scale

350102
primitive	int
primitive collections for java has an arraydeque with a get int idx methods

350130
triggers	insert
this feels like a pretty clear use-case for a triggers insert update

350132
webforms	asp.net
dynamic controls in asp.net are tricky especially if you are new to webforms and the page lifecycle

350141
linux	unix
in unix linux how do you find out what group a given user is in via command line

350143
delphi	c++
so i switched to delphi c++ or c would have also been good choices

350148
set	bag
the benefits you do get from the gridview include command events and arguments that can be easily consumed or created a datakey property bag that allows you to track critical fields in a large result set as well as many other things

350148
any	set
i will add this caveat that i ve used gridview on even very simple result set returns and have not seen any significant performance problems

350182
defined	declare
as the given reg-ex does not declare any grouping and is not a valid name for a variables in php4 defined elsewhere this call seems to replace any occurrences of with

350199
google-chrome	firefox
firefox or google-chrome

350202
selection	cells
the code is required to either unlock or lock certain cells based on a drop-down menu selection

350210
implements	abstract
if you re not using .net3.5 then it s also not complicated to implements an interpreter abstract syntax tree yourself

350227
double	int
the only thing i can think of is that it s some odd casting thing but i get the same behaviour taking if the variables to which i m assigning is an int a double or even a string

350232
ruby	php
sometimes i m under the impression that cakephp is a outdated copy of rails that wants to look like ruby but fails at it and thus leaving the best of php behind

350272
filtering	sorting
perhaps send json from the server but also include the html snippet as an attribute so the javascript can do the filtering sorting etc

350273
command-line	cmd
create a windows cmd script in the bin directory for each application that you want to invoke from the command-line same name as the executable that you would type

350291
postback	ajax
i am using asp.net ajax to dynamically add remove controls from a page without using full postback

350301
constructor	object
you are probably better off defining a copy constructor or a static factory method that explicitly clones the object according to your semantics

350310
checkbox	button
an example of what i might want to do is having a page with records and checkbox next to them the user has the option to check all the records they want to delete and then click on a delete button

350310
selected	button
after the user clicks delete the records are analyzed on the server and the new page lists all the records that were selected with a confirm delete button

350325
keyboard	mouse
how about setting an inactivity timeout which gets reset every time a mouse or keyboard event is received in the dom

350362
triggers	insert
you can keep the records in the current table current through dual insert or through a triggers on the table shudder

350381
nohup	sudo
sudo nohup nice foo.bash

350381
nohup	sudo
nohup nice sudo foo.bash

350395
keyboard	mouse
in that case you have to assume after a period of inactivity no mouse or keyboard events that the users attention has left the page

350403
nohup	sudo
the sudo should go last so that nohup and nice aren t running with root privileges

350404
proxy-pattern	decorator
i was looking at the proxy-pattern and to me it seems an awful lot like the decorator adapter and bridge patterns

350405
nohup	sudo
sudo first will make it owned by root nohup before sudo will make it owned by your user

350421
pixels	line
it draws a line with two boxes to demonstrate support for shapes at a higher level than simply setting pixels

350428
stream	send
an example of how to use a httphandler to create the image and send out in a stream using the image code already posted here

350440
selected	cell
once a new date is selected i d imagine i need to do something in viewwilldisappear for that particular cell s uitextfield value

350448
naming-conventions	conventions
i slowly see these conventions move into production code but it s a battle against mfc naming-conventions that still prevail in many places

350454
worksheet	excel
i ve read many of the other threads here about managing com references while using the .net-excel interop to make sure the excel process exits correctly upon exit and so far the techniques have been working very well but i recently came across a problem when adding new worksheet to an existing workbook file

350455
convention	standards
my suggestion would be to take the library s convention that occurs in your company s code most often probably the c++ library which i believe boost sticks to as well and make that your standards

350462
proxy-pattern	decorator
i suggest you read the proxy-pattern and decorator entries in the c2 wiki

350467
boost	stl
diomidis i share your pain and have spent a lot of time switching between different schemes over the years trying to find something that works with the different libraries frameworks that i use mfc and or stl boost

350468
string.format	stringbuilder
string.format creates a stringbuilder object internally

350469
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
the only difference in the sql-server 2005 environment that i m aware of right now is that my localhost has sql_latin1_general_cp1_cs_as case-sensitive as the collation and the production-environment has sql_latin1_general_cp1_ci_as case-insensitive

350482
value	field
where templates is actually the templates field value for the one record of productionrun returned

350499
base-class	inherited
the class contains a collection of other classes all of which inherited the same base-class call it contentsbase but which have distinct derived classes

350510
gentoo	linux
if you come have a linux background macports gentoo like or fink apt-get like are indispensable

350516
initializer	setter
personally i like a contract that makes the object manage its collections initializer them on creation and ensuring that they can t be set to null via a setter - possibly by providing methods to manage the collection rather than setting the collection itself

350539
compact-framework	.net
now i can install the .net compact-framework just fine and everything works for a while

350539
default	reset
i know it s not just a hard reset jumping back to factory default because

350545
command-line	cmd
if the first parameter on the start cmd-line is enclosed in double-quotes it uses that as the windows title instead of the cmd

350551
median	min
added for the production log analyzer you don t need any configuration it just parsing the production log and gives you a list of most time consuming actions including min max median time

350554
solaris	linux
the java stack where you have solaris or enterprise linux like redhat with weblogic websphere tomcat etc and java enterprise along with hibernate spring etc technologies

350554
ruby	php
none of the above stack with enterprise linux running a whole buffet of open source stuff like mysql now under sun s domain so can be looked at seriously apache there are apache gurus out there ruby not my personal choice php good luck python i like it because its a mature language

350554
python	ruby
i would advocate python or ruby from the managing code point of view

350571
configuration	environment
this has lots of advantages such as making the database aware of what environment it represents dev test production etc. and keeping the configuration and the other data together

350571
configuration	environment
the deployment package can then properly be kept dumb regarding configurations and environment differences--the code just accesses its configuration data and acts accordingly so the same deployment package is good for any environment

350575
any	set
to make the message refresh on any call put it in its own updatepanel with its rendermode set to always

350577
contains	elements
the string will appear properly if you load the xml into an xmldocument find the elements that contains it and write out the elements s innertext property

350582
xsd	xml
plenty of tooling available to work with xml xsd xslt

350584
rewrite	rule
i have this rewrite rule

350585
initializer	getter
you can also use the lazy-evaluation initailizer pattern where the collection is not initializer until and unless someone accesses the property getter for it.

one-to-many	entity
the identifier can be reused and thus there is a one-to-many relation with the entity

350619
methodology	waterfall
one benefit of agile is that any failures happen earlier and at far less cost than they would in a project following the waterfall methodology

350619
methodology	waterfall
being able to learn from those failures and get a good product at the end isn t an outcome that the waterfall methodology can deliver

350619

here is my scenario i have an xml file that needs to be transformed in to a different look and feel of xml file i have several sections where if particular node set don t contain any value the whole section shouldn t be processed

350648
webserver	security
edit if you are getting the authentication error see pipthegeek s post you will have to trust your webserver for delegation however be careful with trusting for delegation since it opens another can of worms for security types

350648
credentials	account
and in the services to which this account can present delegated credentials add the relevant service information

350668
revision	svn
and essentially svn just creates a copy of the last revision into another directory tags

350675
credentials	account
this will involve making the application-pool run as a domain account granting that domain account permission to delegate credentials the delegation tab of the account properties in the ad users and computers mmc

350686
hide	show
i built a similar app in winforms that would simply show hide pictures of dip switches

350693
httpwebrequest	webclient
i suspect that webclient or httpwebrequest will do the job fine

350703
data-access	nhibernate
to give you an idea before i knew about dal data-access layers i used nhibernate and hand crafted the xml needed to communicate with the database

350720
json	xml
this could be perceived as advantage or disadvantage especially with the growing popularity fat-free alternatives to xml like json

350726
postgresql	rdbms
i don t recommend the bindings to rdbms components such as postgresql or mysql at least in the 1.x series performance was not acceptable even for prototype applications

350749

350780
logout	login
action can be either login or logout

350780
logout	login
only around 20 of the login have an accompanying logout row

350781
children	nodes
basically you need to catch the event in the children dom nodes and there stop their propagation up the dom tree

350799
order	add
also how do i override this order for example when i want to add a field from the classe s init methods

350802
webserver	upload
the simplest answer is that the user upload to a shared directory that both webserver can access

350815
logout	login
given the data you have there probably isn t anything much faster you can do because you have to look at a login and a logout record and ensure there is no other login or logout

350815
logout	login
if you can get the data into a format where the login and corresponding logout times are both in the same record then you can simplify the query immensely

350821
simpletest	phpunit
both simpletest and phpunit can easily be integrated with it although phpunits support is there out-of-the-box

350836
asp.net-mvc	webforms
then it grew into separate projects asp.net-mvc admin side and webforms front end

350836
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i later had to bring it to where it is today a single web app with a mix of asp.net-mvc admin and webforms public due to deployment issues

350836
controller	routes
in this case you could configure specific routes for each but i don t see how simply putting a controller in a different folder would protect them unless using the authentication attributes on actions

if the user has css but not javascript the element will hide and will not be able to be show

350899
constructor	object
phpunit is designed to call the constructor on mocked object

350902
contains	set
the reportviewer control contains a smaller version of the report processing engine so that at runtime it couples the rdlc you provide with a data set or bindable collection and it does the rest

350916
httpd.conf	.htaccess
you can set the php include_path from an .htaccess file assuming you have the correct allowoverride settings in your httpd.conf file

a defaultâ s value must be a property list that is an instance of or for collections a combination of instances of nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary

350956
click	mouse
in the other it solves the immediate bug title menu flicker but between disabling the redraw and enabling it again the windows is transparent to mouse clicks - there s a small windows 1 sec in which i can click and it will say highlight an icon on my desktop as if the app wasn t there at all

350999
system.out	system.in
i d be tempted to redirect the system.in system.out to a jtextpane on the gui that way it would be much easier to change the focus etc

351000
margins	padding
none have borders padding nor margins

351006
order	join
indexes may be useful for columns you use in join conditions or in row restrictions or in grouping by or order by clauses

351022
xsd	xml
the same user-entered xsd is also used to validate xml documents sent to the application by other systems

351022
contains	any
for example let s say i wanted to be able to allow users to upload any xsd at all unless it contains xs union tags

351027
lexical-closures	nested-function
nested-function are similar to inner-classes in java and anonymous functions implements lexical-closures like blocks in ruby

351035
spaces	output
if the output file looks like one long word no spaces then you know that the only thing being inserted after the text is that n

351035
spaces	output
i assume that the editor you are using to read the out.txt file just makes it look like there is an extra spaces after the output

351049

351087
windows-xp	windows
on windows-xp with cpus that support it hardware dep is enabled by default only for certain windows system binaries and also for programs that choose to opt-in

351088
xsd	xml
i think you ll find this problem much easier if you ignore that the user-supplied files are xsd files and just consider them as xml

351088
xsd	xml
after all xsd files are just xml so you can enforce schema rules on them just like any other

351102
scrollbar	widget
in eg carbon emacs the scrollbar widget come from the carbon native set

351106
key-pair	gnupg
create a key-pair with a public and private-key using java s keytool gnu gnupg or a similiar tool

351112
updating	updates
this is useful when updating tree tab controls or lists as can turning off sorting during the updates in that last example

351117
constructor	object
of course this won t work because integer object don t have a property named amount the only way their value can be set is via a constructor parameter integer object are immutable

351117
any	set
is there any way to instantiate such an object and set it s value without using scriptlet code

351153
relocation	linker
the methods will depend on the operating system s binary format elf a.out .exe etc and also on any relocation done by the linker

351158
equals	getter

351185
keyboard	mouse
is there a simple way to detect mouse or keyboard activity in linux or xorg or qt4 or kde4 environment

351214
contains	any
so i decided to make a table containsg the key and value columns filename file or some_value 5 which contains any possible property of the object not include in the superclass table

351235
key-value	key
the available table would need to encode the availability of a specific key type pair to point to the correctly typed key-value table

351244
attributes	properties
the date properties has the following attributes set

351244
object-reference	instances
system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

351250
base-class	inherited
slightly longer answer yes if you inherited multiple interfaces and a single base-class

351254
base-class	inherited
since an interface works out to essentially a pure-abstract base-class you can inherited from as many of those as you need and from one real class

351258
firefox	safari
however in firefox and safari it does not upload

351274
snmp	mib
if my customer didn t install the updates mib with the updates objects in the trap and i send the new parameter what will happen on snmp manager client side

351349
solaris	unix
linux is seen as not as well supported as unix solaris or windows servers

351349
oracle	mysql
mysql is a not ready for prime time db for hobbyists and not a competitor for sql server or oracle

351349
ruby	php
php ruby on rails are optimized for crud and both perform slower than java java ee or c# which are both common enterprise standards

351349
python	php
rails and some of the python php frameworks are optimized for crud apps

351349
ruby	php
if you re not building a crud app there are plenty of non-crud-optimized frameworks in ruby python php java c#

351349
oracle	mysql
for a low-traffic site the performance difference isn t going to amount to anything and for a high-traffic site your bottleneck will be the database whether it be mysql oracle or whatever

351349
python	java
once you ve used all this advice to convince your boss that you won t lose out on anything by using lamp if you crunch the numbers and show your them that it is going to take 6 man-months to build the site in java and only 3 to build it in ruby python then that s really what it comes down to

351355
gethashcode	equals
in general you might want to look at providing a custom equals gethashcode or or an

351373
contains	set
how would i go about building a custom eclipse distribution contains a specific set of plugins

351380
firefox	safari
starting recently some of my new web pages xhtml 1.1 are setup to do a regex of the request header accept and send the right http response headers if the user agent accepts xml firefox and safari do

351390
delphi	vb.net
i would like to hear of the experiences of classic vb developers who migrated their applications to delphi rather than vb.net

351414
while-loop	infinite
edit i just realized there was a degenerate case where if the use passes today 14 or greater than the highest bit set the while-loop becomes infinite

351490
nested	order
but different tokens in c# have different meanings depending on the context which requires you still to have that nested level in your mind as you read the code in order to get for example what kind of code block you are reading if you lose your place even though the end of the code block could be in view you might have to look up to see the beginning of the code block

351494
derived-class	base-class
if you need the functionality of activatecontrols in the derived-class you can make it protected in the base-class

351494
derived-class	base-class
alternately you could have the check_checkedchanged event handler call a virtual methods in the base-class which can be overridden in the derived-class

351495
put	get
that is i split the string and get the first element and i want to put that in a dictionary

351498
dlopen	dlsym
in the end it ll boil down to a dlopen dlsym or loadlibrary getprocaddress whatever is appropriate for the os

351499
iframe	popup
additional details my popup will come from javascript code from within an iframe in any domain

351499
iframe	popup
if it makes any difference the iframe domain and the popup domain are the same

351501
functional-programming	imperative
one thing i would like to add is that it is probably not such a good idea to see these predicates as functions you might be used to from imperative or functional-programming

351517
user-interface	drawing
layer backed views allow you to animate your user-interface and help to reduce the overhead of drawing by caching the views contents on a core animation layer

351548
iostream	boost
actually i recommend boost serialization and boost iostream which includes a compression stream that transparently can compress your data too

351579
selected	listbox
i am assuming you are looking for a selected box visually like the listbox meaning with multiple rows displayed but functionally like the dropdownlist allowing for only one selectedion

351579
selected	listbox
the size attribute will give the selected box the look of a listbox

351594
contains	elements
this templete for a date elements will not be matched if the date contains even one child elements that has no content or only white space

351597
attributes	properties
some usual application i have found the folks make the model dumb just having attributes properties and nothing else

351597
getter	setter
the typical example in java would be pojo with getter setter

351601
buffering	streaming
this object represents the internal buffering for the streaming

351627
uniqueidentifier	identifier
however i would like users of the iphone application to have an account created automatically by the phone s unique identifier uidevice device uniqueidentifier stored in a new column

351627
.when	ready
later .when users are ready to create a username password the account will be updates to contains the username and password leaving the iphone unique identifier intact

351633
google-chrome	safari
i currently have issues in webkit safari and google-chrome were i try to load dynamically innerhtml some html into a div the html contains css rules ... after the html gets rendered the style definitions are not loaded so visually i can tell the styles are not there and also if i search with javascript for them no styles are found

351669
contains	any
it can contains any number of arbitrary objects

351679
paraview	vtk
1 paraview paraview.org is a user-interface built on top of vtk that makes scientific visualization product much easier

351720
selected	textbox
i can therefore use different controllers which then use the same view to display the data in a drop down list allow the user to selected one to edit or add a new one via a textbox

351723
dictionary	arrays
they use new arrays which is an overkill and an overhead for a simple associative arrays aka dictionary

351752
cursor	row
if you are sure that there s going to be only 1 row use implicit cursor

351752
cursor	row
if you want to selected more than 1 row you can use either an explicit cursor

351775
perl	php
i know php really well perl enough to get by at least reading it and editing it

351780
registration	login
even with our in-house registration of email addresses and passwords we had to use an amazon.com style login form because users kept filling out the new customer form even when they already had an account

351780
selected	button
for the second question users can selected one of two radio button no i am a new customer or yes i have a password. many other sites present the new- and established-user sections side-by-side and thereby divert new users to the established-user section through the magnetic attraction of type-in fields

351795
constructor	object
moreover you can easily configure your parsing to accept custom delimiters as part of the object constructor

351802
python	c++
the only way that i can see to do this would be to embed the python interpreter into a c c++ program and do some kind of hacking with it which can be difficult

351805
put	get
the only thing that i can see is making sure you get out the handle that you put in via your constructor

351808
variables	boolean
if you don t know whether or not variables names are case-sensitive or how numbers are converted to boolean then you probably can t even write a simple if clause reliably

351811
integer	zero
edit i took positive integers to mean every positive non-zero number in the range of the integer type hence the use of maxint a system constant and +1 to ensure it s not zero

351824
glut	sdl
sdl is a bit more up to date than glut but you are on the right track with rolling your own graph structure to manage scenery

351824
quadtree	octree
you may want to look into related topics like binary space partitioning quadtree octree and kd-trees

351837
assign	add
then we assign permissions like view add update .. to role grouping

351847
web-services	api
i recommend that you use username password combos for website accounts and api keys for any web-services

351847
account	api
by linking api keys to an account you could have many api keys for the same user

351847
account	api
attaching api keys to an account also lets you keep the user s username and password uncompromised since an api key will not contain them

351847
account	api
you could limit access to portions of functionality for each api key but give their username access to everything their account should have access to

351847
account	api
api flickr google api etc use account with a username and password to login to the web account and api keys for integration points

351860
32-bit	64bit
on a 32-bit server smaller ints aren t going to save you anything in cpu performance even less on a 64bit server

351873
salt	md5
the passwords in joomla are md5 d and each has its own secret salt

351873
authentication	login
i ve been considering changing the authentication module in moodle so that if the submitted password matches certain criteria eg it s 32 hex characters then don t md5 it before comparing to the joomla version - the problem with that is that anyone could upon discovering the encrypted password then use that to login

351874
selected	textbox
so they would selected view all then between and then maybe pop a textbox or a calendar for the last two

351876
iprincipal	iidentity
the abstracted view of identity is often the iprincipal iidentity

351911
constructor	private
when trying to instantiate this c# class intellisense shows both the private and the public constructor for new keyword even though one of the constructor is private

351915
reference-type	generics
error 1 the type t must be a reference-type in order to use it as parameter tentity in the generics type or method system.data.linq.table

351920
constructor	private
when there was more than one parameter the private constructor showed up in intellisense but not when there was only one

351924
constructor	object
but you should have an abstract base class for you domain object with a public constructor so you don t have to pepper your object with the private ones

351927
authentication	login
if authentication is unsupported how does one login

351928
constructor	private
namely because there are numerous scenarios where accessing a private constructor is legal

351928
constructor	private
all private constructor access is legal

351930
authentication	login
although gmail doesn t support authentication it does support the login capability like so

351960
any	set
calls a scripting checking if there is any in-house updates i have set up since the last launch like a new enhanced eclipse.ini new plugins new configuration files ...

351974
for-loop	arrays
and you would need to do this for every value via a for-loop if you had all your values in an arrays

351994
contains	lookup
my only concern is that pdt doesn t have any more the f3 functionality in which it will open up the file contains the declaration you want to lookup

352021
delphi	basic
delphi for visual basic developers

352027
icmp	mtu
path mtu discovery is used to find this size by simply setting the df bit and sending successively larger packets until the network reports over icmp a failure

352028
asterisk	ivr
asterisk is open source and it include the capability of defining and running ivr integration

352028
asterisk	ivr
see the asterisk gateway interface wiki page - this describes the primitive you would use in the ivr scripting

352068
arguments	default
the default is but that s also what shell functions use to represent their arguments

352076
haskell	python
i learnt haskell before i learnt python so i ve always been fond of thinking of many computations as a mapping onto a list

352088
constructor	object
you d look for a class constructor if it was object that leaked memory

352100
variables	boolean
do i understand correctly that a boolean variables takes up much more than a bit of memory

352124
variables	boolean
bear in mind that the clr isn t going to try to pack multiple variables into a byte so having one on its own would be no more useful than boolean

352128
boolean	double
however if you don t find one in the flea market or happen to have on in the attic i d recommend bit-arrays because with the incredible advent of 64-bit your boolean will become as big as double the horror

352133
json	xml
xml and json as you ve shown various xml flavours of course

352171
selected	listbox
don t put a listbox inside a listbox it will create a very confusing user-interface because you ll have several levels of selected items

352197
put	get
if somewhere in your application you get data from unsafe source and put it in session object then you must check it as well

352204
business-objects	data-access
for example you will likely have multiple layers within the model itself - a data-access layer which performs any orm and database access and a more abstract layer which represents the business-objects without any knowledge of how to access their data

352210
double	int
from sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong char float double or decimal to any enum-type

352210
double	int
from any enum-type to sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong char float double or decimal

352215
pointers	stack
i m talking about heap vs stack pointers etc

352247
widget	popup
most widget like menu monitor when they ve been blurred and then close their child popup

352253
put	get
you can put it in a special place that members of the project can see but get it out of the project

352260
spacing	layout
even if you were to use table layout css you would need some sort of surrounding element for each row in order to get the spacing on the left and right correct

352281
environment	building
since you are building .net services i understand that this may mean too much work for setting up the testing environment

352310
python	java
they are normal languages processing is java nodebox is python with very specialised easy to use but absurdly powerful frameworks ingrained into them

352350
order	add
in order to make this work i need to programmatically add the managed path to the new site collection

352350
elevated-privileges	privileges
research suggested that this may be due to insufficient privileges i tried running the code within an elevated-privileges block using spsecurity.runwithelevatedprivileges addressof addmanagedpath where addmanagedpath is a sub procedure containing the above code sample

352350
webserver	security
update whilst developing the web service i am running it using the built-in visual-studio 2005 webserver - what security context will this be running under

352363
any	set
this doesn t add any bounds but it does allow to treat them as different types with only one set of boilerplate templates code

352385
tuples	any
in your case you probably want to return a tuples containing the open file handle the file name and any other meta data you are interested in

352441
python	java
for java c++ and python there s the google code

352469
json	xml
your app just needs to be able to make https and parse json or xml resposnes

352472
directory	folder
there s also a common directory for shared stuff under the .net version folder

352484
abstract-class	subclassing
it s an abstract-class - defining the interface will mean that all subclassing will need to implement those methods

352484
base-class	superclass
no again - because your superclass abstract base-class implements that interface your concrete subclasses will be guaranteed to implement that interface

352486
implements	abstract
the abstract dox in b adds nothing as it s already specified by implements a

352543
delphi	c++
we ve looked at the original c header files and it all looks good is there some different way that c++ uses the delphi runtime

352543
delphi	c++
what i am getting at here i suppose is that using a tthread or a ttimer works but using a thread created outside the vcl doesn t that s why i asked if there was a difference in the way c++ builder uses the vcl delphi rtl

352552
having	select
i have a command to copy some data - think of it as cloning a product - but as the columns may change in the future i would like to only select everything from the table and only change the value of one column without having to refer to the rest

352555
any	set
any change in the set of servers one goes down or you add a new one suddenly invalidates almost the whole cache

352567
document	element
defined and its document element will

352577
having	union
assuming that in addition to having the same column names columns of the same contain the same data you want to create a view that is the union of all those tables

352579
onmousedown	onmouseover
if the user does a onmousedown inside a iframe drags outside the iframe and hovers over elements that have a onmouseover attached to them - safari does not fire this event

352587
google-chrome	firefox
have you tried this in firefox ie opera google-chrome

352591
checkbox	button
if you look at the bottom of the dialog you ll see a button or checkbox don t have 2008 in front of me to allow adding an asmx service reference

352594
.when	ready
you cannot be certain for example that once you have spotted a file that it has been completely written without extra work from the file-writer such as renaming it .when ready or creating a ready file

352605
stored-procedures	ado.net
now using print statements that can then be read from ado.net by implementing a handler for the infomessage event i can simulate a trace for stored-procedures

352605
profiling	trace
edit i have tried to use the sql profiling this was a first time one for me but i can t figure out what to trace for although i can get the trace to output the queries sent to the database they are opaque in the sense that i can t drill down to the expression-udfs called i can trace the actual stored procedure invoked but the udfs called by this procedure are not listed

352608
google-chrome	firefox
i have not tested it in firefox google-chrome safari operat though

dialog	pop-up
so on startup i load a starter.dll in the myappexecs folder which should pop-up a dialog which it does

352643
python	php
interestingly python lists contain the pop method which unlike php s array_pop can pop arbitrary elements and keep everything in order

352673
value	field
if i was peforming an insert i could use getgeneratedkeys to get the id field value but i don t think there is an equivalent for an update

352745
getter	setter
you might wanna have the setter and getter as static since they access a static variables

352765
constructor	object
beyond that you can either do what marcin said and use auto-connections or manually write connect statements in the constructor of the object that uses the user-interface

352767
webforms	asp.net
however most of my experience with custom initiation forms used asp.net webforms where we serialized a class and stuffed it into activationdata

352794
methods	extend
if you use abstract classes then you can easily extend the contract over time by adding new methods and flagging them as virtual

352804
safari	opera
for iphone safari opera mobile and webkit on android development are similar but not identical and development for those is quite simple

352804

i d suggest you write a scripting that takes the output of file -i filename and returns an extension split on spaces find the look up that term in a table file in your language of choice - a few lines at most

352934
seam	jsf
i think it s soley down to gavin king picking jsf as his view technology for seam and him pushing through the jsr as spec lead

352944
sql-server	oracle
300 million records should pose no problems to a top-end rdbms like oracle sql-server db2

352963
schema	rdbms
as others said modern rdbms can handle such tables depending on the queries and schema some optimizations would have to be made

352968
web-development-server	webserver
i am using my local iis as the development webserver not the visual-studio web-development-server

352979
sql-server	oracle
ms sql-server sybase oracle and db2 will all handle these volumes with ease if your company prefers to spend money

352982

353007
installation	environment
the installation procedure creates a bat file that sets up the environment variables correctly for command-line execution

353036
temporary	copy
this may be ok if you are just viewing a snapshot of the data taken at a certain point but would be dangerous if you were also updating the real table based on changes made to the temporary copy

353039
allegro	sdl
i ve google code searched scoured source trees of anything i thought would shed some light sdl allegro wxwidgets cximage gd imagemagick etc. but usually their code is either convoluted and scattered all over the place or riddled with assembler and little or no comments

353049
subtract	time
when adding or subtract values from datetimes you can treat the value as a fraction as though it was exactly equal to the fractional portion of a day as though the complete datetime value was a floating point number consisting of an integer portion representing the date and the fractional portion representing the time

353071
updatepanel	gridview
i have a gridview control that for other functionality has to be inside an updatepanel

353087
publishing	release
you then publishing on each new release

353094

353098
attr	src
selectorforyourimage attr src newimagelocation

353100

353168
keyboard	mouse
you could create an enumeration with the different devices have a global property that you set every time the mouse keyboard etc

353187
required	checked
i know i could append the form contents to the url as query string parameters themselves and just redirect to the new url and avoid the submit postback but that will required a lot more type checked on the codebehind to avoid bad data and casual spoofing

353200
scripting	shebang
in case these are cgi whatever scripting that you only run on your shared host you can alter the shebang line at the top of your scripting that tell the system what interpreter to run the script with

353222
disposable	dispose
remember that images are disposable so you need to assign the result of your resize to a using-declaration or you could use a try finally and make sure you call dispose in your finally

353224
division	modulo
how do you do modulo get the remainder of a division

353224
division	modulo
but i m revisiting this because now i need to use negative numbers and rem gives you the remainder of a division which is not the same as modulo for negative numbers

353232
key-value	key
appsettingmodification.name add key key-value value

353278
myisam	sphinx
for text search you have two options besides using a like clause - fulltext index which means using myisam or using specific indexing engines such as lucene or sphinx

353296
iteration	set
i have a set of objects which i iterate through however i may decide during the iteration that one or more of those objects now need to be deleted

353298
directory	folder
my answer is to move to point to a folder that is underneath the .sln file and adjacent to the class library directory then it can all go in the repo

353305
sql-server	oracle
but don t expect to see anything as big as sql-server or oracle in that area anytime soon

353309
contains	any
lets say i want an arrays returned contains any text within and tags

353335

353338
callback	methods
the run methods invokes the callback with the result when it s been computed

353371
hprof	jvm
it seems that i should be able to get an hprof profiling by using the -xx +heapdumponoutofmemoryerror option but i have read that this is jvm specific

353380
convention	standards
i know some people use loc as a productivity measure and i m wondering if there is a standards convention here

353380
convention	standards
also i think there s a way to get various compilers to count lines of code - is there a standards convention there

353395
value	field
not directly as far as i know but you can have a classic asp error page that loads the err object value you need into different field

353406
convention	standards
no there is no standards convention and every tool that counts them will be slightly different

353415
code-documentation	xml-documentation
is there some way to include the assembly information in the cref within loserclass code-documentation so that a.someclass can be resolved by the xml-documentation generator

rather it requires entity-framework providers which extend existing data providers to provide additional services required by the entity-framework such as complex sql generation which are not part of the existing ado.net data model

353442
entity-framework	ado.net
i don t think that there s anything stopping anyone from writing an entity-framework provider for odbc based on the existing ado.net 2.0 odbc bridge

353442
entity-framework	ado.net
you can download the source code for a sample sql-server provider for more information about exactly what services are required when extending an existing ado.net provider for the entity-framework

353449
order-of-evaluation	parentheses
when doing this the parentheses to control the order-of-evaluation is very important

353475
input-field	selected
this seems to me like an onfocus issue i selected a file to upload click on another input-field and it clears the value - this only happens on the file input-fields aswell any other types of input in the form keep their values fine

353485
sharepoint-designer	sharepoint-list
i am trying to create a data source in sharepoint-designer that connects to a sharepoint-list via xml web-services

353522
google-chrome	firefox
the following renders properly on ie7 firefox 3 and google-chrome now that i ve fixed the boneheaded error in the css

353542
triggers	insert
i can t think of any unless there was a triggers then insert a row or somesuch and i really really wanted the id of that triggers-insert row rather than the row i physically changed

353547
triggers	insert
they are usually the same but assume a triggers is called which insert something somewhere just before the current statement

353547
triggers	insert
identity will return the identity value by the insert statement of the triggers not the insert statement of the block

353548
scheme	lisp
if i were doing it in scheme or lisp i d count expressions

353550
constructor	private
would it be enough to create a private default no variables constructor

353550
constructor	private
or do i have to also create private copy constructor and private assignment operator to prevent using the default constructors

353555
constructor	private
creating a private default constructor should be sufficient

353556
constructor	object
in order to use a copy constructor you have to have an object to copy so if you ve locked down the default constructor you should be safe

353564
webserver	host
handle the host header processing at a hardware load balancer more likely 37signals do this than rely on the webserver and create a custom http header to pass to the web application

353570
getter	setter
furthermore some things that are very difficult end up being solved with very little code and some things that are very easy boilerplate code like getter and setter for example can add a lot of lines in very little time

353573
versioning	upgrade
i think the web developers of the world should start a class action lawsuit to force microsoft ether to offer the equivilant of firebug for ie6 and ie7 make sure all ie6 and ie7 instances are upgrade to standards or remove all versioning of ie6 and ie7 from all computers on the internet or bail-out all web developers with a payment of 1m each for their pain and suffering

353582
windows-server	windows
our application is a distributed system with windows desktop applications windows-server services and databases

353620
.when	ready
.when you first used the cpan module you were asked something along the lines of are you ready to proceed with interactive configuration

when designing a asp.net webforms application what are some important steps to take or hacks if you like to use the term to ensure the best possible performance in terms of speed stability and scalability

353626
bots	api
i was able to do this with bzflags because they ad an api provided so that i could send commands to my bots and find out information about the world around them

353632
parentheses	operators
where i work people mostly think that objects are best initialised using c++-style construction with parentheses whereas primitive-types should be initialised with the operators

353632
parentheses	operators
i can see that would be inefficient because it would involve an extra copy but what s wrong with just banishing the operators altogether and using parentheses everywhere

353634
executable	upx
i ve used upx before to reduce the size of my windows executable but i must admit that i am naive to any negative side effects this could have

353634
delphi	c++
i write most of my code in delphi but i ve used upx to compress c c++ executables as well

353634
executable	upx
on a side note i m not running upx in some attempt to protect my exe from disassemblers only to reduce the size of the executable and prevent cursory tampering

353638
multithreading	wait
in addition to these i also have a couple of dsl graphical designers for the particularly difficult scenarios - for example i have a dsl for complex multithreading operations that are implemented using pulse wait

353640
constructor	private
if you want to stay with your class create a class that has a private constructor and derive from it to make your intention obvious

353655
schema	rdbms
the support for schema changes and querying is far superior to that in rdbms

353669
command-line	cmd
the existence of the svn cmd-line cmd is insufficient for git-svn

353682
executable	upx
some people may be more suspicious of your executable just because it is compressed with upx

353714
boolean	int
i ve not managed to reduce it to 2 boolean and 2 int but i wouldn t be surprised if it was possible

353721
web-deployment	web
i have a webapplication project a business logic project and a web-deployment project for the web app

353726
directory	folder
my assumption was that the content or scripting folder would always be at the root of the site as i have no intention to run this site in a virtual directory setting

353748
google-chrome	safari
thanks vatos you gave me a good lead basically i did what you suggested but used jquery to set the html and append the new style to the head since safari google-chrome would stall when doing innerhtml and document.head was undefined

353751
single-sign-on	security
i would say use open id for single-sign-on where the security isn t vital blog forums etc and something more like microsoft cardspace for things where security is more important ecommerce

353753
configuration	environment
some other are like having different configuration files for different environment

353760
version-control	cvs
i do have experience with a couple of version-control systems that use a merge commit model cvs and subversion

353767
jar	war
the web app libraries section displays list of jar files that the war contained in web-inf lib

imported classes which i also see for a first time seem to contains classes found in the imported .war web-inf classes for which eclipse was not able to find any corresponding source files

353777
google-chrome	firefox
as for the history file i ve got some information on firefox so any information link on reading parsing history file of ie safari opera google-chrome will be appreciated

353804
any	set
again these are foreign keys the first is set to cascade so if i delete a file entry this record is deleted but the second is set to restrict so i am not allowed to delete a file entry if any other files depend on it

353804
any	set
is there any way to set up my database schema so a single sql delete from the projects table will correctly cascade the other deletes

353814
xsd	xml
by far the best guide you can have is the xml schema the xsd file which defines all the structures and what they do

353817
derived-class	base-class
on the other hand if someone later derives from this class and deletes a derived-class via a pointers to the base-class the program will be ill-defined due to the absence of a virtual destructor and frankly optimizing for a pointers per object is ridiculous

353819
cos	sin
if you are averaging angles and have to deal with them crossing the 0 360 then it is safer to sum the sin and cos of each value and then average atan2 sum of sines sum of cosines

353822
compact-framework	.net
it s a motorola q and i can write programs for it using the .net compact-framework

353831
filtering	sorting
edit one other caveat is that if necessary you can easily drop a dataview on top of this is you need to do some quick sorting filtering of the user list

353832
8051	8bit
as is sdcc small device c compiler created originally for the 8051 and other 8bit micros

353832
bison	yacc
for the most part folks use bison yacc which is a tool that you create a description for your high level language and the tool can parsing the user-input based on your description and turn it into this middle language if you will

353837
scriptaculous	jquery
you might take a look at some of the javascript frameworks like yahoo yui scriptaculous jquery etc

353843
value	field
i need to check if in the field the username and userpassword value are both what i am comparing with my dataset value is there a way where i can check multiple attributes and conditional without writing my own logic of using flags and breaking out of loops

353844
derived-class	base-class
virtual destructors are used only when a object of a derived-class is deleted through a base-class pointers

353849
mbunit	nunit
it s an extension to nunit or mbunit

353855
hide	show
clarrification where i ve got id 1 you should swap in the id of the div you want to show and make a generic class name on the other div s to hide them

353879
compact-framework	.net
i reinstalled v3.5 of the .net and compact-framework but that did not restore the file

353882
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i was thinking about implementing a custom validator and using a client javascript function to reference the radiobutton id i m using webforms not asp.net-mvc

353892
http	ssl
openid takes advantage of already existing internet technology uri http ssl diffie-hellman and realizes that people are already creating identities for themselves whether it be at their blog photostream profile page etc

353892
authentication	login
conventional website authentication performs a comparison with data held in a private database so your username and password can be used to login to this website only

353909
virtualbox	vmware
i completely agree with the others on get it in source control asap and use vmware virtualbox etc for a test environment

353918
cakephp	symfony
look into cakephp or symfony - their rails-ish manner of separating concerns makes the question where should this piece of code go

353918
virtualization	virtualbox
there are turnkey wamp packages out there or you could install to a linux box vm i recommend virtualbox for virtualization

353918
profiling	debugging
as far as debugging profiling tools i know that symfony comes with a pretty slick set of tools including a little javascript toolbar that comes up on your pages only in debugging mode with logging profiling information

353933
postgresql	mysql
actually it s using mysql but it could switch to postgresql at a moments notice as web2py is so diverse

353937
webforms	asp.net
since i m not ready to go with asp.net mvc for my projects yet oxite might be a good way for me to figure out how to transition from a webforms app to an asp.net mvc app

353942
callback	methods
another approach would be a callback have your constructor take an argument that implements an interface with a callback methods that will be called when the result is computed

353944
value	field
of couse the xpath expression is just a string - you can build it dynamically with value that were entered into a form field for example

353945
triggers	insert
some sort of insert update triggers to force the parentid to null if it matches itself

353947
double	int
the default interpretation of 40.00 will be a double with the value 40.00 just like the default interpretation of 40 is an int

353953
msdeploy	msbuild
i am trying to create a new website on a remote server via msbuild i like to call it msdeploy

353960
http	ssl
openid takes advantage of already existing internet technology uri http ssl diffie-hellman and realizes that people are already creating identities for themselves whether it be at their blog photostream profile page etc

353960
authentication	login
the website will know that the identification is ok or not and let you login.conventional authentication form do a comparison to their private database and let you login or not

353971
unpivot	pivot
there are ways to code generate this also a technique using pivot and unpivot in sql-server which is not ansi based on your table and the distinct id values also

353992
hash	md5
in particular i want to match a 32 character string md5 hash named directory

354019
subclassing	base-class
it seems to me that the having a book base-class and then two subclassing for publisher and publisher name is the correct choice

354060
svg	vml
for vector drawing libraries like raphael provide a consistent api over svg and vml

354060
svg	vml
for html-only solutions no svg vml canvas you use css and custom border-widths

354068
authentication	login
i am not using any form of registration or login page and letting the windows integrated authentication in iis handle the authentication aspects while my enhanced sqlroleprovider manages the user roles

354089
put	get
however you will get different results in an outer join depending on if you put the join condition in the where vs the on clause

354092
sql-server	postgresql
solution is to use postgresql sql-server if you can afford it

354098
subclassing	base-class
it seems to me that the having a book base-class and then two subclassing for publisher and publisher name is the correct choice

354098
superclass	subclass
in each case the subclass represents a specific category within the superclass

354130
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch doesn t introduce much overhead because the most common exception-handling is caught without an extensive search of stack frames

354142
reference-type	generics
notice that the latter only works if you specify the structure constraint for the generics type for reference-type new t in vb does something else than default t in c#

354143
hide	show
it ll also let you set up global ajax responders to determine whether to hide or show the busy icon

354146
expression	evaluation
algebraic expression to rpn for easy evaluation

354146
parentheses	operators
operators or parentheses was represented by a railroad car on a

354146

yacc or bison or taccle tcl analog of

354225
select	union
perform the union all in a view without the order by clause then select from the view using order by

354264
contains	any
i want the string from clark to kent that doesn t contains any occurrences of kent

354270
value	field
having worked with the list title field it does not return value for me unless i used contains

354277
value	field
i m trying to display the difference in a measure from one day to the next in excel 2007 by setting the value field setting to difference from with base field day and base item previous

354285
text-rendering	gdi
the gdi text-rendering api which uses

354305
integer	digits
does that mean the sql database will reserve two bytes for each integer or that each integer can not have more than two digits

354312
push	pull
edit i was under the impression that dedicated remote repos like github where no one will ssh in and work on that code but only pull or push etc didn t and shouldn t have a head because there was basically no working copy

354324
assign	add
if you don t assign the id and add a control with id say button1 then there is a change that this will collide with the already added button with no id

354352
sql-server	oracle
oracle sybase iq or even sql-server would also handle the data volumes involved but will be slower - they are shared disk architectures but can still manage this sort of data volume

354352
sql-server	oracle
see this posting for a rundown on vldb related features in oracle and sql-server and bear in mind that oracle has just introduced the exadata storage platform also

354352
sql-server	oracle
my back-of-a-fag-packet capacity plan suggests maybe 3-5 tb or so per month including indexes for oracle or sql-server

354352
sql-server	oracle
this would probably be better than oracle or sql-server as it is specialized for this type of work

354352
pentaho	birt
the open-source world has also generated birt jasper reports and pentaho

354362
shortest-path	np-complete
the problem of finding the shortest-path isn t np-complete

354397
entity-framework	ado.net
the ado.net entity-framework team didn t want to execute queries without the user knowing so they designed the api to be explicitly-loaded for the first release

354397
entity-framework	ado.net
linq to sql has been handed over to ado.net team and so you may see a consolidation of apis in the future or linq to sql get folded into the entity-framework or you may see linq to sql atrophy from neglect and eventually become deprecated

354405
implements	abstract
i agree with jeebee consider implements your helper methods somewhere other than an abstract base-class

354405
methods	extend
if your helper methods commony only exists in abstract base class b all classes which implement interface a will have to also extend base class b in order to take advantage of that implementation of commony

354406
svg	vml
beside the libraries mentioned in the other thread relying on canvas svg vml i saw games made with sprites ie

354408
textbox	button
drop a combobox a button and a textbox set multiline true onto the form

354408
selected	button
use the following code to load the combobox with 3 identical items and to print some status messages when the selectedindexchanged event fires and to see what the currently selected index is via a button

354420
gridview	listview
personally i prefer listview over gridview and detailsview if possible it gives you more control over your html

354432
compact-framework	.net
however this is not in the .net compact-framework and requires a p invoke

354442
constructor	object
the reason i hadn t thought of doing it this way myself is that i have always overlooked the allocator object parameter to the stl collection constructor

354443
enterprise	platform
there are a lot of enterprise integration platform which are supposed to do such kind of things but they typically are quite costly and also quite often you get stuck on some problem and then you depend on vendor if he will solve the issue or not

354461
xsd	xml
however microsoft has an xsd code generator that generates an xsd based on an xml file that you pass in as an argument

354470
attributes	properties
the properties that will be used by the serialization must have data-members attributes

354471
alloca	malloc
if you have an implementation of alloca you could buld a class allocator using that instead of malloc but your idea of using a statically allocated arrays is even better it s just as fast on most architectures and you don t risk stack corruption of you mess up

354490
any	set
i want this to be global across all buffers so that any time i m doing something involving the current working directory i know what it s set to regardless of where my cursor is at the moment

354491
order	add
add 100 or 1000 items and see if they are still in the same order

354504
constructor	object
if you want to deep copy an object you will have to traverse the object graph and copy each child object explicitly via the object s copy constructor or a static factory method that in turn deep copies the child object

354515
nswindow	nscell
view layer nsview nswindow nscell their subclasses and calayer

354528
any	set
since the data context is probably null didn t see it being set you aren t getting any value in your text block

354535
constructor	object
you are probably better off defining a copy constructor or a static factory method that explicitly clones the object according to your semantics

354550
value	field
the only thing i could think of is to rename the field names to one character value a b c etc

354555
downgrade	upgrade
in our projects we create upgrade and downgrade scripting for each changeset that requires a database change

354555
versioning	downgrade
we haven t automated that process but the practice allows developers to get to a current versioning by running the incremental change scriptinging and get back to a previous versioning by running the downgrade scripting

354556
variables	boolean
i seem to recall reading that global variables are bad and global boolean variables are even worse

354556
variables	boolean
update well based on what i learned from your answers instead of checking a global boolean variables i now first check whether the xml node exists i am storing the images within an xml structure before any writing to disk occurs and if it doesn t then i append a new node with the base64 encoded image data

354558
ip-address	hostname
however you can compare the uri s host property to either the local hostname or ip-address

354564
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
nsurlconnection can be used synchronously via its asynchronous delegate methods in a background thread nsthread or nsoperation

354581
variables	boolean
in c you ve got static local variables to get that boolean out of the global scope

354615
document	element
in the schema define col1 and col2 as attributes of the experienceprofile element and the dataset will know to format the output document to meet the requirements specified in the schema

354619
32-bit	64bit
if you re running 32-bit windows you ll need to switch to 64bit to make use of anything over 3 gb or so

354635
subclass	ivar
create an nsview subclass that holds an nscolor as an ivar

354641
deployment	install
when i manipulate the configuration file and add additional output from another process to the publish folder and then use mageui to regenerate the application and deployment manifests i create a filebased install that actually install from the updateurl

354678
any	set
this means you only get bang for your buck with an nc index of any kind if the index is covering or selected a small-enough data set that the cost of a bookmark lookup is mitigated - indeed you may find that the query optimizer won t even look at your indexes if the cost is prohibitive compared to a clustered index scan where all the columns are already available

354681
symfony	drupal
surprisingly no one even mentioned this as far as i can see but there is another alternative give up on the code and just use the functionality of the site itself as a new feature set specification the first one ever for this project and then re-build the site based on those features with an established framework such as symfony laravel or drupal

354703
directory	folder
the problem i have is just listing the directory in a folder

354733
gentoo	linux
see speeding up emerge with tmpfs gentoo linux wiki

354733
binaries	install
the gist is that all source and build intermediate file are redirected to a ram disk for compile while final binaries are directed to the hard drive for install

354752
centering	fixed
you can give it a fixed width and you can centering it with margin-left auto

354763
unsigned	bigint
for instance i have determined that an unformatted us phone number is too big to be stored as an unsigned int it must be at least a bigint

354767
shell	bash
if you need a bash style shell but don t want to use cygwin i would recommend msys

354794
sqldatasource	detailsview
when you have parent-child tables and you wish to use a detailsview to edit the data how do you do it using a sqldatasource

354800
numeric	digits
as the others have said phone numbers and zip postal codes are not actually numeric value they re strings contains the digits 0-9 and sometimes more

354800
put	get
therefore the perfectly valid phone number 0731602412 would get put into your database as the decimal number 124192010

354805
svg	vml
it uses native graphics svg vml silverlight or canvas mdash

354805
firefox	opera
whatever is available on the client covering all major browsers ie firefox safari webkit opera

354833
data-access	nhibernate
if you don t want to worry about writing your dal data-access layer then i suggest looking at nhibernate

354854
swing	swt
i was hoping to use of of the native toolkits not just swing swt

354875
linked-list	nodes
it is an implementation of a linked-list here called addresslist containing simple nodes called listnode

354883
tuples	any
i personally tend to carry over the conventions from functional-programming use lists for any number of elements of the same type and tuples for a fixed number of elements of predetermined types

354888
firefox	safari
this image displays perfectly well in safari but not at all in firefox

354900
ruby	php
so i m teaching myself ruby on rails with a php background

354926
decimal	hex
decimal and hex character references are all accepted

354929
tuples	any
returning a dictionary with keys y0 y1 y2 etc doesn t offer any advantage over tuples

354929
tuples	any
returning a returnvalue instance with properties .y0 .y1 .y2 etc doesn t offer any advantage over tuples either

354942
selected	listbox
is it possible to bind a listbox to an instance of both objects so that the chosenitem property gets set by the selected item of the listbox

354947
methods	extend
i would say that while extension methods like these are useful when you don t have the ability to modify a class that you need to extend with functionality they are a poor way to design your own code

354949
ostream	std
rather than simply using std cout to print output have the libraries function take an ostream reference that defaults to std cout

354954
csv	xml
change this to save to a file in whatever format you prefer csv tab delimited xml etc.

354969
output	cat
you can pipe through hexdump as well to view the characters and make sure you re getting the right output the terminal knows how to interpret utf-16 and displays it properly so you can t tell just but doing cat on the file

354980
environment	execution
in fact some execution environment generate parallels code or even introduce some memoizing to avoid calling for repeated value or lazyness to avoid calling some at all

354987
compareto	equals
however java does not offer parameter variance so there are situations where you will be overriding pre-generics functions such as equals compareto etc

354994
svnadmin	dump
this is all i keep seeing svnadmin dump path to repos repos.dump

354998
contains	set
i can set visible false to the user-controls and to the contains div and this works fine

355003
svnadmin	dump
svnadmin dump is the recommended way to migrating your repositories but you ll need shell access to do it otherwise you will have to contact your hosting provider and ask them to do the full repository dump for you

355019
disposable	dispose
i know that the fish object should be disposable and i should clean up the thread on dispose but i have no control over my callers and can not ensure dispose is called

355026
solaris	unix
as unix solaris or windows servers

355030
put	get
i d like to use posix semaphores to manage atomic get and put from a file representing a queue

355030
put	get
just in case anybody wants the larger context i am building get and put operations for an atomic queue that can be called from shell scripting

355040
lookup	any
the call is in tail positioning you can lookup proper tail call and so it doesn t use any additional resources and in fact when the compiler generates assembly code it generates a loop and it will keep the pointers to the ever-changing portfolio in a register

355051
relational-database	schema
what is the recommended schema for representing this structure in a relational-database

355088
postback	ajax
if you want to avoid the visibility of a postback use ajax and an updatepanel

355111
duplicates	contains
the standard way to handle a many-to-many relationship between two tables is via a third table that contains two primary key values one for the first table one for the second table with a unique constraint read index on the combination of all those columns and possibly with one or two duplicates non-unique indexes on the separate primary keys

355124
contains	any
your regex will essentially match any part of the string that ends in and does not contains another for instance in it matches and in it matches

355125
32-bit	64bit
my psychic debugger says that you re using 64bit and your test adapter is set to use 64bit .net and devenv is set to 32-bit

355135
binary	hex
if i compare the bytes of each file with a hex editor or kdiff3 they are binary identically the same

355136
temporary	copy
i suspect that perforce report does a copy from a temporary file so it s not actually writing to the file but copying in a new file and blowing away the previous one

355141
data-structures	dictionary
i am creating a mock database for import export tests of the algorithm reading and writing complex data-structures to our database not just to test io operations and am trying to decide whether to use a dataset to store the mock tables by table name in the faux-database or dictionary

355164
triggers	insert
with an insert this large you ll want to drop all triggers and indexes on that table

355172
constructor	object
so the questions is are there any other ways of making my immutable object better.. any magic that can be done in c# to overcome a long parameter list in the constructor

355177
anonymous-inner-class	anonymous-class
by an anonymous-class i take it you mean anonymous-inner-class

355189
for-loop	loops
the parameter for-loops needed to be set to false as the swf itself had a loops built into it

355220
defined	declare
how should i declare and defined this value

355220
double	int
in what way does it matter if the value is not a primitive datatype int double etc but a or a struct

355220
defined	declare
one should declare things in the file but defined them in the file

355235
any	set
i always make sure to set my x-mailer headers correctly identifying that the message was sent from within php to ensure that any overzealous anti-spam services recognize it as an automatated notification as opposed to bulk junk email

355244
webforms	asp.net
when would i use asp.net mvc framework over asp.net webforms

355244
webforms	asp.net
a asp.net webforms tries to abstract away the stateless nature of http from the developer

355244
webforms	asp.net
c you can do a good job implementing the mvc mvp pattern in asp.net webforms

355244
javascript	dom
you will be manipulating the dom with javascript

355244
webforms	asp.net
although you could build this in asp.net webforms it seems pointless since you not taking advantage of the postback model and server controls

355244
webforms	asp.net
2 if i were asked to build a new basic web application i would stick with asp.net webforms since i m already familiar with it and know the whole page lifecylce

355247
rewrite	rule
the important thing is to pick one and add an ihttpmodule rewrite rule or equivalent for your platform to permanently redirect requests from one to the other

355253
arrays	loops
you could load them as an arrays and change them with a loops

355274
difference	count
to work around difference when classes don t share the same inheritance tree using helpers makes it possible to have have generic count and items properties for example

355277
defined	declare
the rule i follow is to only declare things in h files and defined them in c files

355277
defined	declare
you can declare and defined in a single c file assuming it will only be used in that file

355277
put	get
i ve seen too many junior programmers get confused when they put in a header file and then wonder why they get a link error for x being defined more than once

355292
constructor	object
remember that the member initialization list used to initialize base and member data object is in the definition not declaration of the constructor

355302
constructor	object
in c++ an object is considered fully initialised when execution enters the body of the constructor

355306
arrays	loops
add each textbox to an arrays and then loops through the arrays changing the attributes

355342
hide	show
in it show hide the elements that you want to be printed on paper

355351
defined	declare
that said the defined in .c declare in .h rule is definitely a fairly universally accepted convention and i wouldn t break it just because you might save a memory lookup

355374
contains	set
it means it might return false and will not set the new value even if it currently contains the expected value

355379
defined	declare
if you do defined static-variables in a header each file that uses the header gets its own private copy of whatever is declare static which is the antithesis of dry principle don t repeat yourself

355405
contains	set
generally when i configure iis i set the properties for the default web site to a folder that doesn t contains anything then create individual entries within iis for each web site

355405
contains	set
for example you would create a new entry for myapplication.com and set its home-directory to the proper folder on the server that contains your root files usually c inetpub wwwroot myapplication.com but it could be anywhere you like

355434
constructor	object
whenever i see heaps of parameters i feel like the object method constructor ought to be simpler

355447
command-line	cmd
is there a way to create a pdf file from openoffice with a cmd-line cmd

355469
gridview	listview
i found this when searching for the same question regarding the wpf listview s gridview

355475
rewrite	rule
in a php application i use the following rewrite rule

355477
silverlight	wpf
in silverlight and i guess wpf why are the properties x name x fieldmodifier x uid the only ones with the prefix x

355491
arrays	loops
you can load the entire result set into an arrays or you can loops using foreach

355503
silverlight	wpf
in silverlight and wpf the .net namespaces are associated to xml namespaces

355508
contains	set
i imagine i could do this if i set up a table contains all the dates in a year and then using a left right join but that s really messy way of doing it

355519
contains	set
i imagine i could do this if i set up a table contains all the dates in a year and then using a left right join but that s really messy way of doing it

355530
icmp	mtu
too many broken firewalls and middleboxes filtering out icmp packet too big messages here is a good way to test a candidate network administrator during an interview ask him her to stop ping and he she will probably block completely icmp. see rfc 2923 tcp problems with path mtu discovery

355531
version-control	git
how can git make my version-control better

355542
contains	any
after you add the web reference you must create an instance of the class that contains the webmethods then you pass parameters the exact same way as any other methods

355552
scheme	let
this is perfectly good ml or scheme let but haskel has scheme letrec semantics without the restriction to lambda values

355576
web-config	app-config
i would like to get binding object from web-config or app-config

355581
executable	upx
i m surprised this hasn t been mentioned yet but using upx-packed executable also increases the risk of producing false-positives from heuristic antivirus software because statistically a lot of malware also uses upx

355603
overlapping	scale
it requires one thread per connection blocking i o which doesn t scale at all hence the benefit of iocp and overlapping io it s pretty much the only scalability way on windows

355614
order	add
in few words the user should have an inputtext when he inputs his data and an add button which add a new input text in order to input another data

355628
put	get
i ve put indexes including covering indexes where applicable on all key tables run it through the query analyzer index tuning wizard etc but still cannot get it to perform fast enough

355650
ruby	php
ruby s erb haml php s smarty etc

355675
instances	private
the initialize methods is made private and an instances methods added which ensures that there is only ever one instances of that class in your application

355677
textbox	button
you can use it to fill in textbox click button etc

355717
credentials	security
getting access to external web pages are not permitted due to security credentials

355721
document	element
after all it cannot infer everything if an element is present in the xml document how to know if it is mandatory or not

355729
put	get
you could put the id information in the viewstate if you can t get it repeat without a long search process

355732
constructor	object
i need to preprocess constructor parameters to resolve possible .lnk files because the filesystem object that does normalizing canonicalision resolving on the abstract paths is not accessible

355732
methods	extend
so i extend file and use a delegate overriding all of file s constructor and methods calling super in all constructor

355744
expression	brackets
brackets expression go inside their own bracketss

355744
expression	brackets
but the brackets expression are still wrong

355755
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
do you reference system.data.oracleclient or do you use odp.net oracle s data provider for connecting .net apps with oracle or do you use devart s formerly known as corelab provider

355768
superclass	inherited
no you have spotted a problem with using inherited - that subclasses get tightly coupled to superclass and their internals so it can be fragile

355772
python	ruby
i often use projects like these to learn things like ruby or python

355790
setinterval	settimeout
well the first thing to say is that if you re calling settimeout but not changing the interval you should be using setinterval

355790
clearinterval	setinterval
edit update from comment you can keep a reference from the closure if used as a class and setinterval clearinterval don t require re-referencing

355805
child-process	spawn
note that any child-process that your service spawn will also be in the service s session

355806
put	get
this means you still get the validation and you can easily put breakpoints on the property access

355806
contains	any
we already have this for automatically implemented properties but they can t contains any logic

355807
triggers	insert
the reason is that i might have some validation or triggers or lazy initialization or... or might later decide to insert some validation when assigning name and i want to be sure to triggers that code

355820
compression	streaming
btw once you have a serialization streaming of bytes you can apply some more functions on it compression or encryption

355888
instances	self
if found it calls it with the instances bound to self or this

355908
progress-bar	progress
for tasks that will take more than a few seconds a good user-interface in my opinion should provide a progress-bar along with appropriate information on the progress of the operation

355966
.when	ready
this should preload the presentation framework if that s actually the problem - its sometimes hard to tell with these cases. so that .when you call the needed windows its ready to open

355983
protected	public
guideline #4 a base-class destructor should be either public and virtual or protected and nonvirtual

355992
required	checked
if the web-crawler goes down for any reason lets say after crawling 60k posts when 40k more were left the next time web-crawler fills in the queue though the queue may be huge but the web-crawler can checked if the it has already visited the uri or not and what was the state of the page when it was crawled - optimization - does the page required a new pick up coz it has changed or not

356005
protected	public
personally we make sure that every public and protected methods has xml comments

356008
protected	public
generally i try hard to add meaningful comments to all public protected members which is handy since if you turn on the xml comments during build you get automatic warnings for missing comments

356026
stax	sax
stax is a pull parsing which means that it works more or less like an event based parsing like sax but that you have more control over when to stop reading which elements to pull .

356041
protected	public
i document public classes and the public protected members of those classes

356081
web-services	webserver
in my simple dev environment i m working with a handful of wcf web-services imported into my fb3 project and targeting a local instance of the asp.net development webserver

356116
authentication	login
i want users to be able to browse to the site and if authentication then fine if not then prompt them to login

356128
methods	extend
edit i know how to extend classes one at a time but i m looking for a methods to instantly extend a class using multiple base classes - afaik you can t do this in php but there should be ways around it without resorting to class c extends b class b extends a

356129
json	xml
so in the meantime a workable solution is to use externalinterface for the little things but to leave the heavier lifting to urlloader and the xml or json parsers

356144
gridview	listview
i want to use the gridview mode of a listview to display a set of data that my program will be receiving from an external source

356154
arrays	loops
modify the loops to store the pid of each spawned sub-process into an arrays and then loops again waiting on each pid

356186
callback	methods
in which case you re looking at pushing the result out into listeners callback possibly command-pattern or if you do want to have the result available at a later in the same methods using something like a java.util.concurrent.future

356193
value	field
or you can use not tinyint but enum with value yes and no then simple output field

356212
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i don t know about the asp.net-mvc side but if i was doing this in webforms this sounds like it would be a candidate for output cache substitution aka donut caching

356217
variables	boolean
do people just not understand boolean variables

356239
png	gif
i can either draw a bitmap and save as gif jpg png put it up somewhere on the internet and link to it with an element

356245
put	get
when you render the page the html for the form and all of the ajax stuff will get put in

356257
contains	set
create a uiview that contains your 3 labels and set it as the titleview

356271
compact-framework	.net
hi i am using the .net compact-framework remote performance monitor from the .net 3.5 compact-framework powertoys

356274
versioning	migrate
write a versioning for current technology that could be migrate to each new generation

356294
udp	tcp
i want to abstract this class to provide two versions one that connects through udp and the other through tcp

356294
udp	tcp
so the end benefit is that the genericness of t is still available but the very different code required to setup a udp or tcp connection has been specialized

356298
extjs	gxt
i am using gwt google web toolkit 1.5.3 et gxt extjs 1.2

356308
webforms	asp.net
i don t know what happens in asp.net mvc but in asp.net webforms impersonation is turned on by

356336
sql-server	oracle
as you can possibly tell this is an oracle system but i m usually working in sql-server - so perhaps database-agnostic solutions are preferable

356349
required	checked
the checked for - and . characters isn t really required

356352
progress-bar	progress
the second is since you are calling this a progress panels i assume you are planning on implementing some kind of progress-bar

356353
svnadmin	dump
after you svnsync ed your repository to a system you manage you can use svnadmin to dump the local copy if you need a dumpfile or just use the synced to repository

356358
stderr	stdout
ideally i think that to avoid deadlock in java you need to spawn separate threads to read the stderr and the stdout

356371
row	col
reduce calls to worksheet.cells.item row col and worksheet.range -- i had to poll hundreds of cells to find the cell i needed

356376
order	add
of course you need to add the necessary s in order to take into account element with spaces as in

356382
order	add
what s the url add an orderline to an order

356385
udp	tcp
if you want to have a udp or a tcp connection based for example on a connection string provided the user then polimorphism best fits your needs

356390
display	width
i have a div with two nested divs inside the float left one is the menu bar and the right float right should display whatever content the page has it works fine when the windows is at a maximum but when i resize it the content is collapsed until it can no longer has any spaces at which it is forced to be display below the left menu bar how can i make the width fixed so that the user may scroll when resized

356394
ubuntu	debian
in my experience redhat centos is very good and apparently debian original not ubuntu

356394
perl	php
php perl ruby python i have worked with perl and to a lesser extent with python

356396
vbscript	jscript
you can do something similar with vbscript but i m more comfortable in jscript

356403
boolean	int
the only time i can think where the more vebose code made sense was in pre-.net visual basic where true and false were actually int true -1 false 0 and boolean expressions were considered false if they evaluated to zero and true for any other nonzero values

356403
integer	zero
so an expression that evaluates to +1 would be true if evaluated as integer because it is not zero but it would not be equivalent to true

356403
variables	boolean
i don t know why vb was designed that way but i see a lot of boolean expressions comparing variables to true and false in old vb code

356415
abstract-class	subclassing
you can have an abstract-class with two subclassing and

356415
return-value	arguments
this is a bit like a type-safe alternative to null and a good way to implement partial functions functions whose return-value isn t defined for some arguments

356416
display	width
if the two divs are taking up 100 of the available width could try to use percentage width and display inline with a further div with a fixed min-width width boo ie inside where required

356421
margins	padding
so if your two inner div s are 300px each and assuming you have no margins padding on them then you should set the outer div to be 600px

356432
worksheet	excel
i m wondering if there is a simple property in the excel interop that returns the count of used columns--ones containing data--from a given worksheet

356438
any	set
then any breakpoints set in your source code would give you access to the code in debugging

356464
attributes	properties
the properties s name may be overriden using the displaynameattributes attributes

356474
contains	set
you may want to set a width on the contains div and set your overflow property

356545
postgresql	mysql
you can check out the following link -- bob ippolito from mochimedia tells us why they ditched mysql for postgresql

356571
configuration	environment
generally speaking the client program should set the configuration environment not the library

356572
contains	any
the way it works at the moment is you get to the root that contains all the projects at any depth and just type depends with a few switches and it emits all the project paths that need building in the right order

356584
webforms	asp.net
if you re starting a new project now i d recommend sticking with asp.net webforms and make use of a the built in asp.net ajax the toolkit and jquery as needed

356586
constructor	private
to alleviate that when i need the form only to be instantiated with parameters i create a private parameterless constructor that the designer can use but which the form s consumers won t see

356599
webforms	asp.net
i ve inherited an asp.net application built on top of webforms and the application suffers from having all of its business logic embedded in the codebehind

356599
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i know i m overthinking this and there is an easier way to get the results i want but how do i implement an asp.net-mvc style properly using webforms

356602
innodb	myisam
if your application generates a lot of updates you ll prefer innodb storage engine which allows to lock only one row when updating vs all the table on myisam

356619
contains	any
if it contains any other letters then this methods rapidly becomes unusable

356620
rewrite	rule
this has the added benefit of not breaking the site as you roll out new versionings and lets you do real side-by-side testing unlike a rewrite rule that just stripes the versioning and sends back the newest file

356629
selected	listbox
if i select alaska for example and then scroll down to select wyoming the listbox jumps back up to the top of the list instead of staying on wyoming and it deselects alaska but wyoming remains selected

356640
contains	set
at the moment when a query needs a dynamically set parameter for the where-clause i have to 1 define a variables to hold the value 2 add a new querystringparameter to the sqldatasource s selectparameters collection 3 set the temporary value of the parameter when the methods contains the query is called 4 and set the value of the parameter on the selected event of the sqldatasource

356666
32-bit	64bit
is there any other way to identify between 32-bit and 64bit environments

356667
hide	show
however you can get around this by creating an alert object setting the width manually or even dynamically and then using the popupmanager to show it place it where you want and hide it

356668
variables	boolean
if you write correctly your boolean variables name it should read naturally

356676
delphi	c++
this example is in delphi but can very easily be converted to c c++ it s all win32

356702
click	mouse
mouse click getmessages returns a

356709
variables	boolean
the technique of testing specifically against true or false is definitely bad practice if the variables in question is really supposed to be used as a boolean value even if its type is not boolean - especially in c c++

356709
variables	boolean
if you feel the need to test variables that is used as a boolean flag against true false which shouldn t be done in my opinion you should use the idiom of always testing against false because false can have only one value 0 while a true can have multiple possible values anything other than 0

356718
constructor	object
it would be nice if i could call the constructor with different objects a list an other color object or three integers... and the constructor handles them accordingly

356718
constructor	object
the constructor aside if i would like to implement an _ _ add _ _ method too how can i get this method to accept all of this a plain integer which is added to all values three integers where the first is added to the red value and so forth or another color object where both red values are added together etc.

356720
arrays	loops
i am using a stored proc compiled on the database to loops through a list of table names held in an arrays inside the stored procedure

356759
margins	padding
i can never remember the order of the shorthand property for setting the margins or padding in one declaration

356774
attributes	properties
so you have to define a custom wrapper properties around items and use that in your attributes - like so

356795
processor	affinity
to specify processor affinity for a thread use the setthreadaffinitymask function

356796
hide	show
i have been using the asp.net-ajax updatepanel control a lot lately for some intranet apps i ve been working on and for the most part i have been using it to dynamically refresh data or hide and show controls on a form based on the user s actions

356796
hide	show
now my problem is that there are times when i would like to wrap an updatepanel around a set of rows so that i can hide and show them dynamically but the updatepanel doesn t really let you do that

356799
zero	nan
it s much faster to presize the arrays start with zero or nan fill it from there

356802
perl	ruby
using shell tools may not be the best answer to that as there are many libraries in many languages to deal with mbox be it in ruby perl or whatever

356810
right-to-left	hebrew
think that you re reading arabii or hebrew read from the top of the page right-to-left to the bottom

356819
library-project	libs
when using my class libs in another project is it possible to not have to add references to my dll and the ones my class libs-project references internally

356820
constructor	object
as for the from object constructor i would prefer something like

356833
value	field
create a fdf file which is essentially a list of value for the field on the form

356833
value	field
a fdf is a simple text document which references the original document so that when you open up the pdf the document loads with the field value supplied by the fdf

356833
itextsharp	itext
alternatively load the templates with with a library like itext itextsharp fill the form fields manually and save it as a seperate pdf

356838
arrays	map
i can t give you exact example i don t even know what parser and lexer generators are you going to use if any... but something like storing data on first line tokens it could be non comfortable if you can t easily get such token from parser or saving custom data map that links tokens to indent arrays where every line in source code as index and indent value as element value seems to be enough

356847
variables	boolean
boolean variables should be written as a positive

356852
arbitrary-precision	fixed-point
is there a specific reason you re using floating-point for currency or would things be better off with an arbitrary-precision fixed-point number format

356876
contains	any
if your application project uses type a from your class library and that class does not expose any public types from other libraries 3rd party or not you don t need to add any references to more than your class library contains type a

356881
integer	digits
could be considered the two or whatever least significant digits of an integer

356917
triggers	insert
the keys to an auditing triggers are the virtual tables insert and deleted

356926
differential-equations	derivative
i started to use derivative to minimize endtime but i realized i can t remember my differential-equations very well

356930
udp	tcp
both the udp and tcp objects must still support the same interface

356930
base-class	inherited
if you do it via inherited they must both implement a common interface virtual base-class it it is done via templates this is not necessary but the compiler will check that they support the same methods calls that the service object requires

356937
google-chrome	safari
jimmy has a very good point there google-chrome and safari are both based off webkit

356937
google-chrome	safari
if it fails on google-chrome chances are good it s likely breaking on safari nokia s60 browser and the rest as well

356939
value	field
1 new value created_date field

356941
floating	margins
this is relying on default behavior for everything except the border and by floating it you are telling the box to pin itself to the left margins of it s parent which is assumed to be the body here regardless of what else belongs there

356947
constructor	object
it is an extra little something in the constructor for this object

356948
javascript-engine	spidermonkey
also i m open to other suggestions for spidermonkey or another javascript-engine

356957
click	mouse
only after they click with the mouse in the field does the text they have typed appear

356960
firefox	opera
opera ie firefox

356974
derived-class	base-class
if i have a project which include two classes a base-class soup and a derived-class tomatosoup which i compile as a static library .lib i get unresolved tokens on the virtual methods in soup

356980
selected	textbox
this parameter is selected via a textbox text100 that has a pop up calendar

356982
authentication	login
however when using the authentication attribute i want to redirect to a login page which also uses the same mapping scheme

356993
function-call	inline
that means it can inline that function-call

356999
factors	primes
performance was a primes factors in the development of this class library

357032
radio-button	selected
this can be seen by going to a document library where the workflow has been attached selected settings - document library settings - workflow settings - remove a workflow and noting the radio-button setting for the workflow

357038
any	set
so i don t think you ll see any difference if you set enablecompression enablecaching true because it s already happening if you re using ie7

357044
observers	listener
use asp.net-mvc for the user-interface - use other patterns message bus or observers listener etc... or other oo techniques for the ai bill the lizard s suggestion of strategy still applies

357070
delphi	basic
abbyy finereader ocr api conforms to com and can be used in c c++ visual basic .net delphi etc

357080
oracle	mysql
from your description i m assuming that your database does not support auto-increment identifier fields ms sql does oracle has sequences which are just as good if not better i don t remember mysql has

357081
temporary	copy
what you can do is use sprintf to write to a temporary string and then something like strncpy to copy only the bytes that you want

357107
wait	hang
calling wait or read -1 or expect pexpect.eof hang

357111
numerical	matrix
factor matrix m into xy where x and y are appropriate factorizations lu would be ok but for numerical stability i would think you would want to use qr or maybe svd

357137
progress-bar	progress
i think it s important that your main progress-bar fill up exactly once and there is always indication of progress

357137
progress-bar	progress
setprogress sets the progress of the most-recently-pushed progress-bar and ripples up the changes to parent bars

357138
contains	any
i don t get any build errors but when i try to browse to the page it gives me the error the controls collection cannot be modified because the control contains code blocks .

357141
click	mouse
however the same flush function is also attached to mouse click that happen inside of text fields

357141
click	mouse
so you guessed it it didn t flush with the opening of the windows but did when the mouse was click

357155
postgresql	mysql
however if and when a project gets to the point where you ll be deploying it i would suggest mysql or postgresql for better performance

357188
default	reset
i think it default to 1.1 or 2.0 if you don t reset it

357203
cursor	row
i could probably use a cursor and loop through and update a row at a time

357264
arrays	loops
if you want to iterate through with nested loops you ll need to pull this data into an arrays - hopefully you re not pulling back so much that it ll eat up too much memory

357284
callback	methods
so far i have only simple scripts running as i have not implemented callback custom methods objects and such

357284
put	get
i do have to put a disclaimer on this the project is very early and i am an amateur at c++ at best so don t get your hopes up to much

357289
selected	button
chart expert - data then selected your on change of field then click the topn button

357309
.net	wcf
if you have .net 3.0 or 3.5 installed you can add references to the wcf assemblies system.servicemodel.dll etc which are in the directory windir microsoft.net framework v3.0 windows communication foundation

357319
image-gallery	slimbox
on the desktop app i use slimbox in combinations with mootools for an image-gallery

357319
google-chrome	safari
this doesn t work on iphone because it won t show the image fullscreen safari google-chrome gets in the way

357346
.when	ready
check to see .when the dom is ready before calling all your ajax stuff

357363
selected	cells
i m looking for a macros which can be run to selected a consistent range of cells so that i can easily copy them to another spreadsheet

357367
order	add
keep in mind though that the user needs to add a web bookmark to their home screen in order for it to work and any links they click on are sent to regular mobile-safari which opens as a new application

357380
derived-class	base-class
i ll take the risk of stating the obvious you call the function if it s defined in the base-class it s automatically available in the derived-class unless it s private

357380
derived-class	base-class
if there is a function with the same signature in the derived-class you can disambiguate it by adding the base-class s name followed by two colons base_class foo ...

357384
subclassing	superclass
call super requiring subclassing to call a superclass s overridden methods

357398
swing	swt
about 50 of the problems people have with jsf are because they try to treat it like a another taglib library rather than a ui framework like swing or swt

357398
value	field
this code uses a slider to update a text field with a numeric value

357441
ironpython	ironruby
microsoft are building a real javascript - not jscript - runtime along with ironpython ironruby and vb10 on the clr using the dlr but i can t find any downloads or content for it

357451
getter	setter
you are better off spending a few minutes exposing the property through getter setter than hours later tracking down a bug in some other code that modified the protected variables

357501
macros	let
scheme macros let you add features that the original language authors did not include themselves

357510
g++	gcc
outside of calling the wrong compiler using gcc instead of g++ see answer by dan it is possible but unusual to have gcc correctly built but g++ incorrectly built

357510
g++	gcc
it is also possible that your system came with just gcc and somebody installed g++ later into a different directory

357510
g++	gcc
if gcc is in say usr bin but g++ is in usr local bin then you may have this problem

357551
getline	istream
the second parameter to std istream getline is the maximum number of char s to read and store in the arrays minus one

357552
checkbox	textbox
currently in the interactive sort dialog i have a checkbox to add an int sort action to this textbox

357552
radio-button	selected
next i have the second radio-button selected choose data region or grouping and i selected my dataset for this report

357574
font-size	height
you can increase the padding at the same time you decrease the font-size - this will cause the calculated height of the button to remain the same

357577
linux	unix
it s pretty simple to set up an alias that is delivered to a file instead of through any delivery mechanism in any of the major unix linux mail servers like postfix or sendmail

357584
contains	set
your models must contains relationship fields foreigkey and manytomanyfield with related_name keyword argument set

357595
attributes	properties
either referencing a properties of another object use expression attributes instead of value

357616
bazaar	cvs
i am relatively new to bazaar primarily used cvs then subversion and at my current job we re using sourceunsafe

357628
versioning	upgrade
important #2 - when extending remember that telligent releases two major versioning every year usually including features you d want for your project remember to review your changes and develop outside of the product core for easier upgrade to future versioning

357648
haskell	c++
more frameworks supported and more languages supported other than perhaps haskell and c++ and more refactorings don t interest me at this time

357650
textbox	button
i currently have a button called edit and a textbox call blah on a ajax updatepanel

357656
linux	bsd
it needs to be portable to os x linux and bsd but windows portability etc is not necessary

357659
struct	unions
tolua doesn t seem to be very much in development where as tolua++ seems to work fine plus half the tolua tutorials out there are in fact tolua++ tutorials trust me on that tolua does generate the right stuff the source can be modified and it seems to deal with complicated cases like templates unions nameless struct etc etc

357682
attributes	properties
if not you re going to need to mark properties and methods with the marshalas attributes

357690
testdriven.net	gallio
when i run the following test in gallio s icarus it passes but when i step into it using testdriven.net test with- debugger it fails because the parameters are not set according to the row attributes

357720
performance-monitor	perfmon
but microsoft s build into windows performance-monitor perfmon will also give you those figures

357724
subtract	time
on the client subtract the date time in the hidden-field from the current date on the client new date and you have your offset from gmt

357724
subtract	time
reverse for doing it on the server new date in hidden-field subtract server time from hidden-field value

357726
value	field
object s property or field value

357742
show	next
so that as the next occurence approched it would show up in the list

357764
export	report
you can get a report definition text file if you export the crystal report as...you guessed it report definition txt it has the crystal version and lots of info for each section such as datafields formatting etc.

357766
versioning	upgrade
any ideas on how to normalize teh download so we are not downloading 5x the data and same the disk size without having to go to manually updating project references where i have to change reference in vs for every versioning upgrade

357772
duplicates	contains
of course the original post begs the question how did you get that arrays that might contains duplicates entries in the first place

357778
hash	md5
key md5 hash

357778
memcached	apc
tempfile.php then either queries a db memcached with additional prepended key or apc for the content

357781
any	set
any windows can have one or more tags and you can choose to see any windowss that have one or more of a certain set of tags at a time

357817
radio-button	checkbox
for example if you have a panel that is 100 pixels wide by 30 pixels tall with a radio-button at 10 10 and a checkbox at 80 10

357828
dump	temp
wer will create dump in the temp directory but unfortunately they are deleted as soon as the dialog for sending the info to microsoft or not is closed

357863
expression	evaluation
for example consider a tiny expression language for evaluation parenthetized arithmetic expressions

357863
operators	keyword
compared to a huuuuge full-featured language like c# with dozens of keyword primitive-types and operators and a standard-library with thousands of classes regular expression are absolutely dirt simple

357863
parser-generator	antlr
ps as a bonus if you ever do want to learn about writing your own parsing with lex yacc antlr javacc or other similar tools learning regular expression is a great preparation because parser-generator tools use many of the same principles

357873
selected	button
when you click the expansion button the viewport would expand allowing you to scroll and selected a node in the jtree

357873
selected	button
when you selected the node the view port would collapse back to only show the selected node and the expansion button

357896
double	int
some of the members contain strings some others are double and some are int

357909
contains	any
this viewdata would have to contains column information as well as the data as well as some information about any links

357911
configuration	upgrade
with rpm on nix you could use the config function to define a file as a configuration file and rpm would then rename the existing file if it existed and install the new one on an upgrade maybe not ideal but i could live with something like this for wix

357939
perl	php
also the applications are written in different languages php python and perl so authenticating users through an apache module is ideal

357939
google-chrome	firefox
to baffle things even further this works when using ie6 but not firefox or google-chrome

357947
put	get
in fact that s when i realized the original programmer on here used the put instead of get methods

357949
document	element
when i try to access the event object as described in this thread i get a hang when accessing the dom element s document property

357960
constructor	private
if you simply set a private field in your constructor what is there to test

357990
getter	setter
so if you end up writing really good integration acceptance-testing all of your constructor and simple methods such as setter and getter should be called

358006
instances	private
if all of the scenarios end up being dependent on the state or behavior of the private instances of imapinfowrapper then i d suggest writing unit tests on that class instead

358012
python	java
i just described the most common python solution to the problem most commonly by anonymous inner classes in java

358063
filtering	grouping
you can have parameterized queries so the user is prompted to input the relevant filtering customer id product grouping date range whatever

358099
bug-tracking	workitem
workitem bug-tracking

358120
order	add
in order to deal with bugs arising from this problem like this one i need to add some validation code on the server-side which is only possible if the request actually goes to the server of which i am not sure at this point or on the client-side which cannot be very straightforward as you cannot access the actual file from the javascript sandbox

358130
abstract-class	subclassing
to build on what jimmy said it is also an abstract-class which means it acts as a base class - you can t use it directly you must subclassing it to use

358153
google-chrome	firefox
i just created a composite image of screenshots of the google image in ie firefox google-chrome and they re all in perfect register top 2 images at 30 opacity

358155
knapsack-problem	subset-sum
some cryptosystems based on np-hard problems have been proposed such as the merkle-hellman cryptosystem based on the subset-sum problem and the naccache-stern knapsack cryptosystem based on the knapsack-problem but they have all been broken

358155
cryptography	security
ideally we would like to construct a cryptography pseudorandom generator or cryptosystem whose security was based on an np-complete problem

358168
selected	button
user selected an item from dropdown and clicks button

358171
quicksort	shellsort
if you sort the arrays you will still need another pass to remove duplicates so the complexity is o n n in the worst case assuming quicksort or o n sqrt n using shellsort

358171
duplicates	elements
you can achieve o n n by simply scanning the arrays for each elements removing duplicates as you go

358200
dialog	pop-up
i m new to the sliverlight framework and am just starting to figure it out but i have a similar need for a pop-up modal dialog box

358200
keyboard	mouse
now when the shield is visible it will also in effect block all input to the controls below at least from the mouse haven t tried keyboard yet

358203
children	nodes
you could then use xpath expressions to pull out the child nodess of each page nodes evaluate them and append a new nodes at the end of the page children save the xmldocument when you are done

358254
tree	trie
you still have to maintain the tree structure itself with trie

358281
tree	trie
this seems to be sort of a trie but without the pointers which would surely get space-expensive if every character in the tree had a 4-byte pointer associated with it

358286
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to latest versioning of ado mdac sql-server service packs etc

358287
version-control	cvs
if nobody there knows about version-control buy a pragmatic programmer s book on cvs or svn and set it up yourself

358287
versioning	staging
you should also setup dev staging and production versioning of the database with different logins passwords so you don t accidentally confuse them

358287
ftp	scp
an alternate solution would be to give each developer their own virtual host on the linux server and they can work via ftp scp or network share using samba

358289
openmpi	mpich
i believe it was both openmpi and mpich packages

358307
duplicates	contains
i am wondering if there is a best way to shuffle a list of elements that contains duplicates such that the case where arrays i arrays i+1 is avoided as much as possible

358324
entity-relationship	diagram
has special objects to help draw entity-relationship diagram uml

358330
cursor	row
alternatively create a cursor and sp_execute each row

358334
postdata	request
p acts like l in that it stops processing rules but it also tells the module that the request should be passed off to the proxy module intact meaning postdata is preserved

358335
http-redirect	postdata
as long as you are only using an internal rewrite not an http-redirect you should not lose postdata

358335
rewrite	rule
your rewrite rule that you posted should not cause that to happen

358335
rewrite	rule
if you are being redirected there is probably either an error in your php code or another rewrite rule that is being applied

358338
duplicates	contains
a better approach might be to create subsets contains the side by side duplicates and redo the randomization

358339
put	get
suppose you put a hyperlink on your page with a get request like and then some search engine innocently follows the link as it s indexing your site

358369
variables	boolean
if you can pass the filereader object in to the call then you can provide a custom filereader that has an overridden close method -- in that you have a boolean variables that checks on closed or not

358381
shell	bash
actually think good old-fashioned bourne shell since bash and relatives have command-line editing

358381
output	mode
it used to be that if you typed all upper-case letters to the login prompt then the login program would automatically convert to the mode where all caps were output with a backslash in front of each actual capital

358381
output	mode
likewise flow control control-s control-q to stop and start output is provided by canonical mode

358387
click	mouse
i need to have an image that when click i call scripting.php for instance and in that php scripting file i get the image coordinates where the mouse was click

358391
out-of-memory	memory-leaks
i ve seen it happen quite often with memory-leaks that will eventually cause you to run out-of-memory forcing your app pool to restart

358393
click	mouse
if you use an input type image which works like a button it will send you x and y coordinates of the mouse click submits form too

358396
rollback	commit
the operations on these wrapper classes are not necessarily sequential and i want these wrapper classes to be able to commit or rollback changes on its database-table independent of each other using the single database connection

358398
instances	destroy
in a normal interactive environment i know when the instances is created and destroy but i don t get that when i m only using the class through calls to its methods

358414
abstract-class	base-class
this could easily be extended to inherit a common implementation of runtablecommand int in an abstract-class that inherits ifoo and is the base-class for foowithnum and foowithname

358421
google-chrome	firefox
works in ie and firefox but not google-chrome or opera

358430
shipping	tax
i just want to display a confirmation screens contains the credit card info apple info and money amounts total tax shipping

exception-handling	try-catch
this is quite different from c++ exception-handling and try-catch blocks

358443
put	get
i m trying to get some wpf concepts down so i ve put together a simple example of what i m trying to do

358449
protected	public
when using asp.net protected configurationuration how can i encrypt the configuration with just the public key

358466
.when	ready
i hate .when devs give me an app and just say here you go ready for testing

358468
testdriven.net	gallio
did you install testdriven.net before installing gallio

358468
testdriven.net	gallio
if not then the gallio extensions for testdriven.net will not be install

testdriven.net	gallio
if the gallio extensions for testdriven.net are install then you ll see a gallio banner message in the output windows during test execution

358468
testdriven.net	gallio
alternately you can use the add remove features part of the gallio install then ensure that the testdriven.net components are selected for installation under test runners

358483
delphi	c++
i don t know too much about biometrics image recognition but you would have better luck looking for c or c++ code and port it over to delphi

358489
buffering	streaming
the streaming have a very good buffering strategy already implemented

358489
buffering	streaming

class-variables	subclassing
a subclassing can hide a parent class-variables it has access to by defining a variables with the same name

358610
abstract-class	superclass
as for the generics problem you could try defining the cardbox getter in the superclass or top-level interface abstract-class as

358615
push	pull
it also might be easier to use vba from within excel and pull the data from access and format it rather than push from access

358624

358732
sql-server	oracle
what s wrong with the free versions of sql-server oracle or db2

358749

build-system	toolchain
what would be the best choice of build-system for a more than one million line multi platform project which produces drivers libraries command-line tools guis and os install packages for all the mainstream oses using both the gnu and microsoft toolchain

358849
python	c++
our source code is mainly c with python c# and gnu makefile and a little c++ and bash

358849
build-system	toolchain
the main problems are that we are maintaining a complex set of scripting on top of make and would prefer to use third party preferably open source tools and that cygwin is not proving to be robust on windows fork isn t always possible and that our current build-system does not build or install the toolchain so is vulnerable to toolchain version changes

358867
arrays	loops
i usually loops over the arrays and attach a comma after every entry in the string

358875
directdraw	direct3d
and if that doesn t give you enough you can also use directdraw or direct3d

arrays	loops
to process an arrays i could of course just extract substrings from the json arrays and create every object from it s own substring in a loops or so

358880
firefox	opera
firefox and opera do not

358888
triggers	insert
there is a table called inserted which is available in insert triggers

358893
jedit	vim
edit after trying each and every option suggested below i am still using textpad on windows and vim on linux jedit was a good contender as a macro-capable texteditor on linux but the excessive startup time due to java is a no-go for me

358900
hide	show
you could then add the tooltip javascript code to hide those paragraphs and show them as tooltip on hover

358909
debian	linux
on linux i use debian lenny on kde i use vim or gvim which have an excellent macro-recording functionality in command mode simply type qx x being any letter record anything then in command mode type q to stop recording and later type x to replay the macro

seam	jsf
seam collects many of the jsf best practices but i haven t used it yet so i can t really recommend it just recommend you to take a look at it

358939
filtering	sorting
it s a problem of manipulating the table rows move rows for sorting hide rows for filtering there is no need for re-rendering

358939
order	add
in order to add the new item to the results table i would clone a row and alter the values

358958
dependency-injection	factory-pattern
using the factory-pattern and or dependency-injection pattern will greatly simplify the way you unit test methods that instantiate their own resources

358962
triggers	insert
i agree with user learning it looks like there s a for update triggers on approvaltasks that is insert an approvaltaskid into approvalview

358967
freebsd	linux

asp.net routing with webforms

358991
ns-3	ns2
in the response the namespace prefixes are ns2 ns-3 ns4 and so on

358992
updating	updates
it looks like a view has been created which is either of or include the table you are updating and that the error occurs when the view is being updates with the changes

358992
contains	set
perhaps the view contains data from different tables which is incompatible or has stricter constraints set

359005

i m using crystal-reports 11 and vb6 to open a report file load the data from an access database and either print the report to a printer or export the report to another .rpt file for later printing without the database

359131
put	get
see the tidhttp component and specificly the get and put methods

359142
contains	any
you need to pre allocate a chunk of memory big enough to contains the whole thing + any additional records you want.

359144
bugzilla	mantis
i have extensively used bugzilla default for projects at work but mantis gets my vote for easy setup and use

359186
credentials	security
for security reasons i can not pass username and password because it is not safe to leave the credentials in a .bat file

359204
credentials	security
given that you are using default credentials and if the current security context is an impersonation token that can not delegate then the credentials you supply will not hop to

359204
authentication	impersonation
since windows integrated authentication creates an impersonation token this is very likely to be the case

359209
appdata	temp
why are you creating a temp file in user appdata

359232
windows-xp	windows
i m using windows-xp service pack 3 and have command extensions enabled by default in the windows registry

windows-vista	windows
somehow the following command does not work on this version of windows but if i run it in windows server 2003 or windows-vista business it works just fine

359249
reflection	runtime
in some c++ implementations however there is something called runtime type information rtti which can be considered a stripped down version of reflection

359261
python	c++
i see in the sidebar of your question a similar question converting pdf to html with python which points to a library poppler which is apparently written in c++ perhaps can be accessed with jni jna and to a related question which offers even more answers

359293
stderr	stdout
redirecting stderr into stdout works

359308
vb.net	vba
if so i cannot help with vb.net but here is some vba that may help

359316

instead use the tag properties under the view attributes to differentiate different controls from an action methods if you don t otherwise keep a reference to them as an ivar

359389
32-bit	x86
run your .net component as 32-bit x86 instead of x64

359391
hotmail	gmail
but apart from that make sure you keep your html and css simple - email programs are worse renderers than browsers - and test it in several email programs and on hotmail and gmail

359392
32-bit	64bit
if your component is an in-process com component then you ll have to rethink things as a 64bit process can t use 32-bit in process com components

359392
32-bit	x86
you could force your server to run under x86 so that you can access the components they ll both be 32-bit processes

359398
ip-address	proxy
i manage to do what i need setting the proxy to the ip-address of the remote server

359399
hotmail	gmail
this should keep your email looking decent in most mail clients including the web-based ones hotmail yahoo gmail

credentials	security
the only way to provide some sort of security with licensing is to force an online login against credentials hold by yourself really abstract spoken

359433
virtualization	vmware
there are many different options for this from virtualization vmware xen or to dedicate a single server as a back-end database server

359455
contains	set
then from your markup all you need to do is just set the validationgroup property on the control and that ll roll to the validators contains in the user-controls

359462
having	select
but like i said there is a proposal for changes to the compilation model adding self-contained modules storing metadata for select types allowing other modules to reference them without having to mess with #include s

359464
for-loop	loops
in vb.net you could just have one while loops and one for-loops and then exit the desired scope level

359471
triggers	insert
store the count in a separate table which you d update with triggers on insert delete

359472
authentication	access-token
how can i verify a google authentication access-token

359472
authentication	access-token
it s clear how an access-token supplied through the google authentication api oauth authentication for web-applications can be used to then request data from a range of google services

359472
authentication	access-token
furthermore i ll never be using the google authentication access-token to access any google services merely as a means of verifying a supposed google user actually is who they say they are

359481
triggers	insert
i d use an insert triggers on the schedule table

359499
attributes	properties
unity then sees the properties marked with the dependency attributes and will check it s container to see if inside it exists an employeepresenter object

359509
constructor	object
for example consider the comparison of a string literal with a string object created by the string constructor

359509
constructor	object
my advice is to bypass the question entirely and just don t use the string constructor to create string object

359529
deep-copy	object
you ll need a method to make a deep-copy of a person object to do this

359550
s#arp-architecture	nhibernate
for me s#arp-architecture has some advantages over oxite as is far less complex and it uses nhibernate for the data access layer

359554
environment	restart
in the environment in which you restart emacsclient not within emacs.

359556
persistence	hibernate
but you have to keep in mind that hibernate makes heavy use of reflection and your persistable classes have to be accessible for your persistence manager

359559
unmanaged	c++-cli
maybe you should write your wrapper in c++-cli because the interop between managed code and unmanaged code is very seamless

359594
order	add
add tabindex x to each control that can receive focus where x is an integer indicating the desired order of the controls

359599
aquamacs	emacs
aquamacs emacs for macos macos

359659
exception-handling	try-catch
this is a case that could result in an exception-handling being thrown so yes it should be wrapped on a try-catch block

359671
cassini	iis
despite the fact that i am in fact deploying to an iis 7 server i have been debugging using the vs 2008 built in webserver cassini

359671

getter	setter
i have a class with a string property having both a getter and a setter that is often so long that the propertygrid truncates the string value

359690
attributes	properties
i know i probably have to set some kind of attributes on the properties but what attributes and how

359707
g++	gcc
i ve done most of my work on visual-studio and don t have much experience with gcc or g++

359713
linux	unix
on unix linux executables don t have an extension just an executable bit

359716
arguments	undefined
it is similar to putting a default next to an arguments the default being in javascript as null or undefined

359720
distance	polygons
to prevent overlapping you can test each new polygons against each existing polygons and reject the new one if the distance between the centers is less than the sum of the radii

359737
shell	tcsh
if running under a nix shell bash ash sh ksh csh tcsh zsh etc

359757
g++	gcc
execute permissions will be automatically set by gcc g++

you want to clone your repository and then use git-filter-branch to mark everything but the subdirectories you want in your new repo to be garbage-collected

359778
duplicates	elements
what s left between the properly hash elements and the duplicates elements will be the elements that couldn t be placed in the index corresponding to their hash because of a collision

359778
duplicates	elements
even if there are no duplicates approximately 2 3 of the elements will be eliminated at each recursion

359778
any	set
however this assumption will in all likelihood be true for any reasonably sized data set

359784
curly-braces	conditional
that way the developer who needs to add bar to the conditional would be more apt to recognize the lack of curly-braces and add them

359807
32-bit	64bit
i use jacob java com bridge on a 64bit machine and want to load com objects from a 32-bit dll

359811
selection	highlight
to prevent selection highlight from interfering with vonc s solution i added the following line to the texthighlight constructor essentially making the selection highlight invisible

359832
put	get
if you can afford enough ram to put your whole data set in memory not ram disk but having the database cache it get that much ram

359846
font-size	display
i think the button s size is determined by a combination of the system font-size and the system scrollbar dimensions both of which are controlled by the display properties

359875
web-config	app-config
instead of using web-config or app-config which i am accustomed to the source uses a static class object implemented using a singleton pattern to achieve the application settings

359895
google-chrome	firefox
i m seeing a lot of javascript errors in ie8 on pages which worked fine in ie7 and firefox google-chrome and safari

359901
notification-area	tray
essentially it sits in your tray notification-area and pops up an alert like msn letting you know about new commits to the repository and giving you a full list of updates files - doubleclick each entry to see the diff of each individual file

359905
configuration	logging
i put in logging and found out that my usercontrol reads a configuration file

359907
uinavigationcontroller	uiview
i have a uinavigationcontroller containing an uiviewcontroller initialized with a uiview

359907
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
the uinavigationcontroller also has a uinavigationbar as usual

359922
click	mouse
you simply need to be some delta away from the original snap point the left mouse click before you snap to the new point

359950
solaris	linux
it s been a long while since i last did this and even then it was on linux solaris

359985
linux	bsd
but macos and bsd and maybe linux appear to always null-terminate

359993
ruby-on-rails	django
something like django via modelforms or ruby on ruby-on-rails features but in a java desktop environment

360004
strtotime	mktime
your best bet would be to use the strtotime as i previously stated or to follow ant p s advice using mktime

360012
braces	macros
i have made a lua macros for scite to add these braces around any block of code or current line with one keystroke and correct indentation it really costs nothing for me

360024
any	set
i d like to set a connection string programmatically with absolutely no change to any configuration files registry keys

360040
hashmap	arrays
when given a static set of objects static in the sense that once loaded it seldom if ever changes into which repeated concurrent lookups are needed with optimal performance which is better a hashmap or an arrays with a binary search using some custom comparator

360059
dictionary	arrays
ialiashkevich wrote some c# code using an arrays and a dictionary to compare the two methods but it used long values for keys

360060
reflection	runtime
if you want to automate some task like filling an object at runtime then it is worth to do the reflection call and write the methods

360065
duplicates	lookup
if you do want to allow hash key duplicates no hash function is perfect it remains o 1 for primary key lookup but search behind for the right value may be costly

360066
hash	md5
and for a slow hash function ever heard of md5

360090
versioning	upgrade
a process that is separate from the normal upgrade flow of new versioning

360091
updating	updates
this also allows for frequent updating as long as the updates are done in a transparency manner without disrupting the end user

360097
compact-framework	.net
unfortunately all these classes in one way or another uses classes namespaces of the .net which are not included in the .net compact-framework which is used by windows mobile

360106
freebsd	aix
you could use the sigar framework which gives you native support for linux freebsd windows solaris aix hp-ux and mac osx

360107
any	set
i m not sure if this has any advantages over the turning it into a set solution though

360112
stream	send
for example here is a simple put that send and receives a stream

360154
oracle	mysql
i need it to be able to use mysql oracle and microsoft sql server and provide abstraction

360216
value	field
i would like to display certain meta data field in the edit form based on the value of a field

360223
visual-studio	release-mode
the dll you have to compile with debug informations and not in release-mode otherwise the debuger in visual-studio will not stop at the breakpoint

360241
library-project	libs
i d like the libs-project s code documentation xml to output to the web application s bin folder along with the libs s dll

360251
attributes	properties
1. keep the state of the object inside the object using private member variables aka attributes properties instances variables etc

360276
sftp	ftps
libcurl is a free and easy-to-use client-side url transfer library supporting ftp ftps http http scp sftp tftp telnet dictionary ldap ldaps and file

360276
http	ssl
libcurl supports ssl certificates http post http put ftp uploading http form based upload proxies cookies user+password authentication basic digest ntlm negotiate kerberos4 file transfer resume http proxy tunneling and more

360276
freebsd	aix
libcurl is highly portable it builds and works identically on numerous platforms including solaris netbsd freebsd openbsd darwin hpux irix aix tru64 linux unixware hurd windows amiga os 2 beos mac os x ultrix qnx openvms risc os novell netware dos and more.

360282
tostring	equals
i also use the commonclipse plugins to easily make use of the apache commons classes that build hashcode tostring equals methods

360286
profiling	trace
only if you use ddl triggers or use profiling to trace text drop proc procname

360326
processor	affinity
you can make sure both threads get scheduled for the same execution units by giving them a processor affinity

360366
solaris	unix
and another requirement is for it to be fast and it has to run on solaris unix

360369
background-color	display
what i would like to do is bind the background of the listview s row to the background-color property of the object that is display in the row

360384
swing	gwt
however...as someone who s been working with java for 9 years and much of that time spent with swing i ve found gwt very easy to learn

360399
buffering	streaming
do remember that flushing manually only have a proper effect when buffering the page from the start otherwise iis will flush automatically streaming the page to the client

360408
versioning	upgrade
the next major versioning is very probably not going to be a complete rewrite just an upgrade

360409
variables	boolean
so how can i read their values to assign them to the boolean variables and if i wanted to change one of their values with false how would i be able to do that

360440
swing	gwt
if you re coming from java background or are used to something like swing i think it makes sense to use gwt as it keeps you coding in a familiar environment with familiar concepts

360440
groovy	java
javascript is a powerful language more suited for web in some ways than java groovy could amend that but i m not sure how easy it is to integrate with gwt there are plenty of mature javascript frameworks that keep you away from most browser quirks and offer just the right level of abstraction there are unit testing frameworks for javascript and there are some good programming practices to make your code more managable

360461
configuration	environment
right now we are looking for the best way to keep multiple environment in sync qa development environment production when it comes to settings that are adjusted in the admin interface adding products system configuration values enabled shipping payment modules magento connect module installs

360473
perl	php
what s the standard way to do this in modern languages php perl ruby python etc

360476
background-image	transparency
how can i write a semi transparency text on an image jpg bmp or a transparency text color as same background-image but with a shadow something i want to do to watermark the images

360485
any	set
a set supports containing any hashable object so if you have a custom class you need to store in a set and the default hashable behaviour is not appropriate you can implement __hash__ to implement the behaviour you want

360494
processor	cpu
passive loadbalancing if a physical cpu is running more than one task the scheduler will attempt to run any new tasks on a second physical processor

360494
processor	cpu
active loadbalancing if there are 3 tasks 2 on one physical cpu and 1 on the other when the second physical processor goes idle the scheduler will attempt to migrate one of the tasks to it

360494
processor	affinity
it does this while attempting to keep thread affinity because when a thread migrates to another physical processor it will have to refill all levels of cache from main memory causing a stall in the task

360504
duplicates	elements
either search the arrays before you add a new elements or use arrays_unique to remove duplicates after inserting all elementss

360505
project-management	project
in this presentation filmed during agile 2007 stacia broderick introduces agile to traditionally trained project managers by making a comparison between project-management institute s pmi best practices and their equivalent agile techniques

360514
processor	affinity
people use processor affinity to control for this but on linux the semantics of sched_affinity can vary a lot between distros kernel vendors etc

360514
processor	affinity
if you re on linux you can portably control processor affinity with the portable linux processor affinity library plpa

360515
environment	building
that depends on your building dev environment

360517
unique	words
unique words are pulled out of the file stored in a database

360526
value	field
my first thought is if you have the two value in other fields what is the compelling need for redundantly storing them in a third field

360526
value	field
if you simply want to store the concatenation value then you can simply create a view or imsnho even better a stored procedure that concatenation the values into a pseudo actor field and perform your reads from the view sproc instead of the table directly

360526
value	field
this way you can receive the values and construct a value for the field you wish to populate then build the insert statement including a concatenation value for the actors field

360526
triggers	insert
you can though use the create triggers to update the actors field after a record is insert or updated

360529
web-config	app-config
best practice would be to actually use the web-config or the app-config file

360562
sql-server	oracle
the difference is that oracle implicitly begins a transaction for you whereas in sql-server you must do it explicitly

360563
firefox	safari
i ve noticed that firefox and safari both fire load events on new images no matter what but ie 6 7 only fire load if they actually have to get the image from the server -- they don t if the image is already in local cache

360563
firefox	safari
instead of just appending the image then building a handler i use this code which is tested good in safari firefox and ie6 7

360568
contains	set
by definition the set contains only unique elements

360569
organization	naming
though this naming convention may help one to quickly determine what s scripted within a given file it doesn t help with file organization i can t sort by object type. therefore i would like to change the file naming convention

360573
versioning	upgrade
that s tricky if the user is going to just upgrade to the next versioning

360588
function-call	inline
i suggest forcing that to be inlined or rewriting it inline to avoid the function-call over head

360589
value	field
cover indexes prevent the database from having to read the entire record into memory in order to access the value for the few field you care about

360597
delphi	c++
i know how to do it in c++ - you need explicit call of a base class constructor only if you want to pass some parameters to it - but i haven t much experience in delphi programming

360616
windows-xp	windows
we re phasing out windows 95 windows 98 windows 2000 windows-xp nt and we need matching technology in our apps

360629
erlang	python
of course i d also like to learn more python 3.0 erlang and f#

360630
registration	login
james bennet s django-registration is an excellent helper application used for a common registration login pattern

360639
attributes	properties
you can use properties element syntax instead of attributes syntax for this

360664
any	set
i have the root set up to deny access to anonymous and allow access to any authentication user

360673
firefox	opera
ms ie 5+ firefox opera safari

360681
click	mouse
perhaps one way you can capture mouse input to enable the user to selected the location of the annotation is to render an image of the pdf document page and show it on the page and then capture the mouse location on a click event

360682
background-color	height
one example that comes to mind would be to have n-block level elements such as divs and then give them each a small height a couple of pixels for example and then gradually change the background-color of each subsequent element

360689
web-services	security
if it s true that there will be no business logic or validation on the web-services then there is only a limited security benefit to adding the additional layer of abstraction

360697
python	java
a python package is a directory just like a java package

360704
web-services	security
there are legitimate reasons for moving db operations to web-services and soa in general but security isn t one of them

360719
common-lisp	lisp
i guess that you would have to negotiate with the respective authors but including on lisp practical common-lisp and successful lisp would be a great asset for the cd

360720
lookup	any
this lets you access the object directly at runtime from your controllers without going through any lookup step

360766
double	int
one of the numeric primitive wrapper classes long int float double

360785
security	owasp
understanding the principles behind security is highly recommended before studying the owasp development guide 3.0 is in draft

360793
perl	ruby
cygwin gcc vim curl wget perl ruby python svn git ssh netcat etc

360809
selected	textbox
and to get the data selected from the ddl you can attach an onchange event to the ddl to collect the value in a hidden input or in a textbox with style display none

360835
32-bit	64bit
another possible explanation is that you re using a 32-bit version of the provider in a 64bit application

360856
nspopupbuttoncell	nspopupbutton
i m creating a custom subclass of nspopupbutton and nspopupbuttoncell to display a lone icon on top of the button instead of the usual text

360877
checkbox	button
in this line of code what do the numbers represent and how do you use them to arrange the checkbox and button in the windows

360889
network-interface	packets
capture udp packets from a specific network-interface to a file

360889
network-interface	packets
play a stream of packets from a file through a network-interface

360912
pointers	stack
the call stack is empty assuming the cpu has a stack pointers

360930
arrays	loops
my test was fairly simple create a stringbuilder with about a million characters convert it to a string and traverse each of them with charat after converting to a char arrays with a characteriterator a thousand times of course making sure to do something on the string so the compiler can t optimize away the whole loops -

360942
highlight	selected
but when you return from the dialog the highlight node was the node previously selected highlight before you did the right-click

360945
constructor	object
one approach i ve used is to have a progress form class which takes a backgroundworker object as a constructor parameter and contains handlers for the progress and completion events of the backgroundworker which gets passed to it

360946
integer	zero
the reason is that integer 10 divided by integer 100 is integer 0 which zero s the whole z2

360947
command-line	cmd
if you are using this it s important to note that the default cmd shell in windows cmd.exe treats the caret as an escape character so you have to use -w instead if you are executing the compiler directly from the cmd-line a batch file or even the from the pre-build or post-build events in the ide

360949
revision	svn
i find that it is extremely helpful to have a svn server setup because i find myself going back through revision and other throw away projects because i remembered some function or way of doing something that i could use now

361026
defined	declare
also methods defined in a category are added to the class definition at runtime so the accompanying header file need not declare that it is using a category -- it gets used automatically

361037
ubuntu	debian
i changed the grep pattern from vg_preload to valgrind as testing on debian ubuntu revealed that the library name was different while a directory match of valgrind is most likely to succeed.

361042
boolean	int
is there a reason for not creating a data structure that stores the fields of the file a string a boolean for m f an integer and 3 int which you could make into a list that stores the values and then loop over it to compute various sums averages whatever other aggregate-functions you d like

361049
endpoint	uri
meaningful global uri to a given endpoint

361049
endpoint	uri
endpoint that cannot have a stable resolvable uri

361058
json	xml
xml could also work but even when javascript isn t on the other side i rather like json as a serialization technique due to its compactness and readability

361067
subclassing	nsobject
for example in cocoa i can create a category for nsobject that will allow me to add methods to the nsobject class and of course all subclassing even though i don t really have access to nsobject

361085
conditional	operators
the next maintainer of the code or even yourself after a few weeks wo sees this code will think â œhmm this code can be cleared up to use conditional operators â thus inadvertedly breaking the code

361091
forms-authentication	credentials
this page manually created a forms-authentication ticket based on the credentials from iis

361091
forms-authentication	security
in the main forms-authentication login page i looked at the incoming address on the request to see if it was from the lan and if so redirected to the integrated security login page so the user did not get prompted for user id and password it just logged them in with integrated security

361091
credentials	integrated
this enabled users who had ad account to log using their ad credentials even when not on the lan and thus not using integrated security

361099
ip-address	hostname
this will allow you to reference the hostname rather than the static ip-addresses and if you ever need to change the ip-address of the load balancer or the webserver it is a one time change

361109
subclass	accessor
you re likely to need only a type-specific accessor on the subclass to get the value

361130
javascript	dom
when selecting a block of text possibly spanning across many dom nodes is it possible to extract the selected text and nodes using javascript

361130
mousedown	mouseup
if the user initiated a mousedown event starting at world... and then a mouseup even right after there

361138
httphandler	httpmodule
the system.web httphandler and httpmodule are afaik ignored by iis7

361139
stderr	stdout
in your program you might want to open the stdout and stderr pipe and read from them during execution in case you are getting any error messages or anything

361140
defined	declare
this is the same as above except that the extra methods are declare and defined in the implementation file .m usually a way of having private methods - because they are not in the .h file which is the one #imported by other classes they are simply not visible

361155
value	field
then on insert you either always insert into one specific tdataset or have rules based on the value of a certain field that determines which tdataset to insert into

361157
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
its parent will be either a uiwindow or the view controlled by something like a uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller

361158
value	field
the reason it stays blank in your example is because there is no php code to put the value into the field

361162
attributes	properties
your projects wrapper will have a set of properties each with a column attributes

361162
attributes	properties
so just use reflection to enumerate the properties with that attributes

361174
background-image	width
would setting your anchor to display block and giving it a height width equal to your div background-image help you

361176
boost	stl
i am quite confused by looking at the boost library and stl and then looking at people s examples

361179
msbuild	nant
if you are running these tests from the command-line nant or msbuild you can specify the application base directory and working directory arguments

361184
contains	set
for example if you want to use a set to contains an object you have created you need to override equals and hashcode within your object

361184
duplicates	contains
the reason this can be especially insidious is the compiler will not complain and you can end up with multiple objects that contains the same data but have different references in a collection that does not allow duplicates

361207
value	field
finally you could store the value as a separate field

361236
hyperion	olap
cube can and arguably should mean something quite specific - olap artifacts presented through an olap server such as ms analysis services or oracle nee hyperion essbase

361236
rolap	olap
typically olap servers maintain their own optimised data-structures known as molap although they can be implemented as a front-end to a relational data source known as rolap or in various hybrid modes known as holap

361236
ssas	olap
i try to be specific and use cube specifically to refer to cubes on olap servers such as ssas

361236
business-objects	olap
business-objects works by querying data through one or more sources which could be relational databases olap cubes or flat files and creating an in-memory data structure called a microcube which it uses to support interactive slice-and-dice activities

361236
business-objects	olap
to be pedantic i think business-objects sits in a semi-structured reporting space somewhere between a true olap system such as proclarity and ad-hoc reporting tool such as report builder oracle discoverer or brio

361236
business-objects	olap
however it is quite reasonable to think of it as the user facing reporting layer particularly if there are ad-hoc reporting tools such as business-objects or olap systems that allow end-users to get at the data directly

361237
specifications	w3c
although the w3c xslt specifications supports embedding an xslt stylesheet into an xml document it seems that ie and firefox do not support this

361247
value	field
i have some data that i want to store somewhere in my ruby-on-rails app because i use it for generating form field checking a submitted form to ensure its value are valid etc

361254
arrays	map
when doing tiled based board games you ll find it nice to have routines to map between the board arrays and row col and back along other features

361254
row	col
i remember my first board game long long ago when i struggeled with how to get row col from boardarray 5

361298
put	get
i just wanted to put you at the devguru vbscript docs i find they tend to be the good place to get quick vbscript answers

361305
communication	messages
the node communication is also small and it already sent as xml messages which are not huge in size and not overwhelming in quantity

361308
subclassing	base-class
your base-class would define the following templates methods and 1.5 s covariant return types would keep the compiler happy with the concrete subclassing

361308
visitor-pattern	visitor
this might be better implements using a visitor-pattern with the visitor implements dosomething methods for each of the subclassing of xmlmessage

361312
wxwidgets	mfc
recently stumbled unto the wonders of the win32 api and have chosen to practice using it i d rather not use mfc wxwidgets etc at this point just for educational purposes

361313
contains	elements
when i invoke my request i would like the header to contains an elements i.e i want to see something like the following

361316
detect	move
one work around is to detect 1 slice and add another element to the dataprovider with a zero value but the display label is still not where i d like it and there doesn t seem to be a way to move it

361316
pie-chart	charts
another solution would be to wrap the pie-charts with a canvas and just render text on top in the same format as i use for labels but i would really prefer to not have to go this route including rendering text on the charts s canvas which might be slightly less of a hack but still a hack

361318
any	set
so if you do have any user-defined casts set up which are typically a bad idea on reference-type for this reason and others then you should be aware of this difference

361324
webserver	upload
i need to come up with a solution for users to be able to paste an image on to a website then upload that image on to the webserver

361335
sqlcompare	redgate
redgate who makes sqlcompare has a tool called sql prompt that provides

361344
web-config	app-config
channelfactory doesn t read information from your web-config app-config

361350
value	field
but these value appear to not increase the input width of the filename field in the dialog

361359
z-index	overlap
i can fix this by setting the z-index of div#content to be higher than the header but then of course div#content will also be displayed above div#header when they overlap which i don t want

361362
double	int
afterthought - if myarrays in not an elementary type int double but instead represents an arrays of objects with virtual members or pointers you ll need a means of serializing

361365
base-class	inherited
you won t have a animal instance inside of unless of course employee is a base-class that animal inherited from

361367
notepad++	jedit
in terms of software a nice gui editor along the lines of notepad++ or jedit would be good

361369
installation	environment
or since you only said you want to package it as two programs simply configure your installer to write two copies during installation using different names rather than producing both copies in your build environment and then distributing two copies of the file

361372
typemock	moq
so far i found that we can buy typemock to mock the sharepoint objects and then use any free mocking framework moq

361391
callback	methods
is it appropriate for the server to somehow callback to the client to a methods called confirm records while still continuing the original call from the client to the server

361403
value	field
indexes on field that have very few value are usually ignore by the sql engine

361403
value	field
you might want to remove that index and see if it is faster if your source field only has a handful of value

361411
base-class	inherited
inherited can be rather useful in situations where your base-class has a number of methods with the same implementation for each derived class to save every single derived class from having to implement boiler-plate code

361411
base-class	inherited
because inherited is available the base-class can implement the readbyte methods for all implementations without them having to worry about it

361430
directory	folder
is there a way to hide my src directory from launch services so that finder won t register applications in that folder

361440
postback	ajax
updatepanels or ajax postback in general should not be used to just hide or show elements

361443
decimal-point	digits
if there is a decimal-point it will be followed by as many as 0 but as many as uncounted occurences of digits

361446
base-class	inherited
note that inherited means it is no longer possible to supply the base-class functionality by dependency-injection in order to unit test a derived class in isolation of its parent

361455
subtract	time
so i guess the question has morphed into how to subtract two time including minutes such that

361461
click	mouse
try to replace the positioning relative by positioninging the popup on mouse click positioning

361467
authentication	login
so when an authentication ticket expires a call to the page method will obviously cause a redirect to the login page

361476
checkbox	textbox
modeling after the webforms type world you could use a set of errorprovider control and attach them to your critical textbox checkbox etc

361489
inherited	subclass
i often see questions asking how the developer can inherited from a class but hide a methods because that methods should not exist on the subclass

361495
csla	xaf
there are a number of framework out there that provide the skeleton for building applications such as csla xaf scsf .

361511
dump	temp
i d like to submit the query from a web request but i d like the web process to terminate while the sql-server continues processing the query and dump the results into a temp table that i can retrieve later

361512
digits	zero
single zero digits for numbers like 0.5 or simply 0

361512
digits	zero
the first digits must not be zero

361512
digits	zero
the first digits must not be zero

361512
decimal-point	digits
optional single decimal-point which must be followed by one or more digits

361559
contains	set
you can set this process to repeat at certain intervals so that the pages contains the scripting are dynamically updated showing a relatively up to date count of the number of users online

361563
javascript	dom
you can wrap a native javascript array in a jquery and use map to transform it into a jquery list of dom nodes

361564
any	set
basically what you do is you set the x-microsoftajax header to the value delta true case is important here the scriptmodule will interpret this as a normal redirect and turn the response into a 200 but will set the pageredirect data string for any scriptmanager ms-ajax pagerequestmanager on the page to consume

361603
children	nodes
if i have a hierarchy or tree each nodes has a list of children

361620
webforms	asp.net
we have a pretty big asp.net webforms web application project with a lot of references to other libraries other projects etc and most of the time after a compilation the first time we load a page it takes a long time before rendering anything.

361620
webforms	asp.net
is first page load time after a compilation as long in asp.net mvc as it is in asp.net webforms for big projects

361635
google-chrome	firefox
does ie7 have a â œdeveloper modeâ or plugin like firefox google-chrome safari

361642
background-color	border-color
best guess would be css s background-color and border-color

361643
specifications	w3c
bgcolor was deprecated in the w3c html 4.0 specifications

361648
gnome	xfce
i understand gnome and xfce and kde and such are all desktop environment for linux and the base install typically is x xorg

361662
xlib	gtk
i guess you could write c code directly against xlib but you d end up recreating all the functionality that gtk or qt provide that x doesn t alone

361670
serialization	casting
i think the problem is that you are casting the return value from xstream.fromxml fin into a string when it should be cast to the type of object you originally serialization randomtree i assume

361673
keyboard	mouse
if you don t use an existing toolkit you ll need to write things at a very low level - directly handling mouse and keyboard events

361673
textbox	button
if you want a button or a textbox you ll have to write it yourself using the low level xlib primitives

361689
webforms	asp.net
mvc still uses the same asp.net framework as webforms so you are probably going to see similar behavior regardless

361693
xsd	xml
the web service was written in asp.net c# and utilizes ssl encryption xml xsd validation and a load balanced web farm

361701
.when	ready
.when i return the data is already pulled from the database and ready to go

361716
xlib	x11
back in an early version of x11 like r1 or r2 i coded a complete hello world program in xlib alone

361721
children	nodes
then add them to the tree root nodes and then for each nodes you add you need to get its children

361742
any	set
then all my set methodss in commandbuilder can just create the right command type add it to a list then the main tostring in commandbuilder methods can loop through all the ones that have been set and call tocommandstring and no have to worry about doing any if statments or null checks

361750
value	field
one of the field in vendorxxentry is called vendorxxattitude which appears as one of the following enumerated possible value

361750
output	mode
customer x would like to accomplish this without breaking the ability to sort individual columns as can be currently done with views2 in table output mode

361781
constructor	object
at the end of this file you should see lines that register your data contract types as client types - this just makes them available in the client type system and lets you call a well-known constructor but it doesn t actually code their properties because you can set any arbitrary properties on any object in javascript

361815
selected	button
execute command compare from menu file in ultraedit with option compare selected text automatically being enabled and click on button compare

361840
revision	svn
apparently just this afternoon 1 of the developers did an svn copy of a directory from an older revision to the same directory

361840
revision	svn
what i am considering doing is finding the revision where the bad svn copy was done say rev 1234 subtracting 1 1233 and doing

361851
ubuntu	debian
under ubuntu or debian you can view crontab by var spool cron crontabs and then a file for each user is in there

361855
restart	reload
since the code is loaded into memory i can t reload new code without killing and restart the django fcgi processes thus interrupt the live website

361866
default	reset
you can also look at something like a css reset style sheet which will let you set up default which should be reasonably consistent across browsers

361889
canvas	pixel
specifically i need the ability to create arbitrary polygons and place them on the canvas the polygons need to have the ability to be transparent have an alpha channel i need to be able to edit polygons that are currently on the canvas and i need to be able to get the actual color of a given pixel the aggregate of all the transparent piece that are there

361894
xlib	x11
the native interface for linux most other unix-like oss is xlib the lowest-level c api for x11

361894
xlib	gtk
gtk qt others are all so far as i know implemented in terms of xlib at their core

361899
value	field
normally i use lowercamelcase for variables names and class properties but if it contains the value from a field i use the uppercamelcase field name or if it is an arrays of data from a table i ll use the table_name

361908
http	ssl
if you want to optimize your site there are plenty of ways if ssl is the only way left buy a hardware accelerator....hmmm if you load an image using http will it be cached if you load it with https

361943
udp	rtp
i wanted to know why udp is used in rtp rather than tcp

361947
form-submit	onsubmit
it is possible to detect the problem on the client by not using the normal form submit but by having an onsubmit handler that stops the submit returns false and instead submits the form itself using form-submit

361994
recording	playing
he d done amazing work with thread scheduling to be sure that no matter what you wouldn t lose those real-time packets on an old pentium he could recording four streams simultaneously while also playing doom and never lose a package

362023
insertion-sort	quicksort
theoretically quicksort should work faster than insertion-sort for random data of medium to large size

362024
insertion-sort	quicksort
unless you ve hit one of quicksort s pathological cases often a list that is already sorted quicksort should be o n log n â substantially faster than insertion-sort s o n 2 as n increases

362024
insertion-sort	quicksort
when i did these long ago in c++ quicksort was faster than insertion-sort with fairly small n s

362044
integer	numeric
i figured i can just make it an integer column and represent the states using a numeric value

362046
methods	extend
then you could extend the parameter argument object for your child methods

362058
order	add
changing the set of values in an enum requires an alter table which might cause a table restructure -- an incredibly expensive operation the table restructure doesn t happen if you simply add one new value to the end of the enum definition but if you delete one or change the order it does a table restructure

362059
time-complexity	big-o
what is the big-o time-complexity of the following nested-loops

362061
insertion-sort	quicksort
everything that is available to be known about quicksort vs insertion-sort can be found in bob sedgewick s doctoral dissertation

362077
insertion-sort	mergesort
so for resursive algorithms like quicksort and mergesort we would actually do insertion-sort for segments that were very smal say 10 records or so

362088
ruby-on-rails	django
i guess it s far from django haven t tried it but as far as i understand it is kind of ruby-on-rails symfony-like but it does reverse engineer the database and give you a basic application including a master detail view

362094
value	field
note that you shouldn t fieldname.text because asp.net does a bad job of returning the right value for field that have been ajaxed

362118
processor	cpu
furthermore with multiple processor other instructions can be executing on a different cpu core at the very same time

362127
directory	folder
vs looks in the project folder as well as the installation directory that wheelie mentioned

362133
arrays	loops
however it s trivial to loops through hashed data in a particular order by converting it to an arrays first and in fact calling the sort methods on a hash will convert it into an arrays for you

362136
linux	unix
unix and by extension linux doesn t actually define anything to do with guis

362143
order	add
to make sure it always picks the same item even if they have the same datesold add some more items such as rowid recieptnumber into the order by clause of the row_number

362144
web-applications	webserver
yes the very first web-applications required writing your own webserver

362166
insertion-sort	quicksort
first insertion-sort is much faster o n vs o n log n than quicksort if the data set is already sorted or nearly so

362199
web-config	app-config
when you do this all the configuration needed is added to the app-config or web-config

362227
google-chrome	firefox
i have a problem only in google-chrome firefox ie netscape safari and opera are okay where a padding property which should be applied to text in a cell is being applied to all empty cells aswell

362229
contains	elements
the problem is that maven requires that remote repositories contains md5 checksums of all elements

362256
32-bit	x86
assignment of native datatypes 32-bit is atomic on most platforms including x86

362266
python	c++
i am not aware of any python implementation but i haven t looked deeply in the subject but there are c c++ implementations that you can reuse like the tre packaged that supports regexp with fuzzy parameters

362284
put	get
you can instead put a timestamp into the sql and use the time to the nearest minute hour day the largest period you can get away with to allow mysql to get some caching benefit

362284
configuration	logging
overview including configuration for if its not logging this already is here - i ve also found that setting long_query_time to 0 for a day or so so that all queries are logged here with time taken is a useful way to get an idea of exactly where the performance is going

362289
put	get
you can put the complete string in and get the dec value of the hex string back

362291
lookup	any
similarly if a user gets deleted from the system you can t lookup the name any more

362300
memcached	ehcache
so i m going to try to abstract out the common functions between apache ehcache and memcached

362308
constructor	private
you could use factory methods for all supported types and make the constructor private protected

362323
account	userid
if i understand you correctly you want to change the domain that your users are authenticating as but you want to keep all the same userid s pointing to the same account in tfs

362327
value	field
you ll either need 2 more field in your database-table for the model of this form or logic in your controllers that adds value posted in these other field to your brands and categories tables then add the inserted ids to this- data brand_id and category_id before saving this model

362338
binary-data	chunks
keep it as binary-data and convert appropriate chunks into text when you need to

362371

362419
administration	credentials
the windows service is started using administration credentials

362419
execution	restart
restart the windows service will allow the process to run successfully once again for the first execution

362433
children	tree
finding the matches is simply walking the tree and showing all children of your current location

362433
children	nodes
when you get a c you start at the c nodes an a will then take you to the c a nodes children

362434
selected	button
i can connect to sql-server management studio by using the options button in the connection dialog and selected master as the database to connect to

362457
abstract-class	subclassing
they cannot be instantiated so if you have an abstract-class with concrete methods then it can be subclassing and the subclass can then be instantiated

362480
postgresql	mysql
don t know about mysql but in case of postgresql you can specify whether the sequence is a cycle no cycle

362483
where-clause	sql
is is possible to put a constant where-clause to a linq to sql mapping

362484
json	xml
xml json

362490

362499
convex-hull	convex
generate n random points on a plane and extraction the convex-hull of the object that is if all polygons should be convex

362513
.when	ready
instead it is execute .when your query is ready all the filtering applied thus you can split the data-access from the filtering of the data

362513
oracle	mysql
supports ms sql but will support oracle mysql etc

362525
configuration	logging
certain other types of code should be obvious for reuse logging configuration etc.

362541
rhino-mocks	nunit
i m using nunit and rhino-mocks

362557
string.format	stringbuilder
i d use either string.format if the number of fields is fixed and relatively small or a stringbuilder otherwise

362564
communication	messages
framed.html can send messages to helper.html iframed but not home.html child can t communication cross-domain with parent

362564
communication	messages
the key here is that helper.html can receive messages from framed.html and can also communication with home.html

362575
stripes	wicket
in practice with a jboss portal v2.4.2 server there appears to be some class-loading issues so things such as the downloadable stripes example or a standard wicket quickstart app don t run but i m not sure if the problem there is a server-specific one or a generic one - anyone

362605
stored-procedures	ado.net
we use ado.net and stored-procedures for data access though we do have some helpers that make it very fast to write such as sp class wrapper generators an idatarecord to object translator and some higher order procedures encapsulating common patterns and error handling

362607
windows-vista	windows
windows messages can still be used in windows-vista

362616
any	set
when set to false the control appears dimmed preventing any input from being entered in the control

362676
.when	ready
now i am making my code highly customizable so .when that day comes to do some adjustments it would be ready in no time and i can continue with my work

362719
subclassing	base-class
is it recommended to set member variables of a base-class to protected so that subclassing can access these variables

362719
getter	setter
or is it more recommended to set the member variables to private and let the subclasses get or set the variables by getter and setter

362719
getter	setter
and if it is recommended to use the getter and setter methods when are protected variables used

362728
user-interface	look-and-feel
if there is a user-interface change look-and-feel we do a quser-interfaceck mock up of the user-interface change and send it over to the product owner for approval

362732
value	field
personally i don t like any field to be non-private with the occasional exception-handling of static readonly field with immutable value whether const or not

362741
getter	setter
setter and getter are somewhat slower than accessing fields directly so if you are doing heavy maths and read write these fields a lot in your subclasses you should go for accessing the fields directly

362741
getter	setter
normally you should mark them as private and go for getter setter

362741
getter	setter
so my answer is direct access for heavily used fields getter setter otherwise

362749
oxygene	delphi
i have found many posts and examples of using linq-syntax in delphi prism oxygene but i have never found anything on linq to sql or entity-framework

362765
keydown	keyup
on the project i worked on with that requirement a teller system for bank tellers we had a lot of javascript monitoring key keypress keydown keyup etc. events and such

362770
implements	extends
my question is if an interface that is implements implicitly by extends a class that already implements it should be explicitly implements by the class if the class wants to advertise the fact that it fulfills the contract of that interface

362770
implements	extends
you implements this extends the class java.util.abstractlist that already implementss the interface list

362786
implements	extends
if you are extends abstractlist which already implementss list you do not need to explicitly implements list

362795
implements	extends
when you extends abstractlist mylist is of type list already so there is no need to explicityly stat or implements the interface

362837
firefox	opera
it s not a full debugger but my dp_debug extensions provides some i think usful functionality and they work in ie firefox and opera 9+

362869
python	lua
maybe that s where scite with its lua scripting ability or programmer s notepad which seems to be scriptable with python has an edge.

362888
value	field
if you insert a row with a value which does not exit in the enum definition you ll get a nice or null value in the db depending on null-ability of the enum field declaration

362891
installation	environment
try that process from a clean eclipse install and repeat the installation steps making sure that before clicking on finish you unselect the checkbox at the lower left ignore features not applicable to this environment

362931
base-class	inherited
you get the context from your applet which inherited getappletcontext from the base-class

362935
common-lisp	lisp
the lisp environment i found easiest to slip into was macintosh common-lisp with the fred editor fred resembles emacs deliberately

362935
common-lisp	lisp
his other excellent lisp book ansi common-lisp is apparently still selling so it s unlikely he ll give you permission there.

362939
constructor	object
maybe one way to handle this situation is to use a domain value object across the application and set its value to the appropriate logger when the request is initiated by the user in user-interface level and use that value as constructor parameter when you define your logger in each class

362945
conditional	parentheses
in fact the not function works correctly it s just that i had other conditional and parentheses weren t set correctly

362948
openssl	gnupg
program something that is free open source like openssl or gnupg

362956
oracle	mysql
is it oracle or mysql or something they have built themselves

362970
selected	cells
the time stamp allows for operations such as selected n versions of this web page or delete cells that are older than a specific date time.

362970
lookup	any
the lookup of any particular tablet is handled by a three-tiered system

362970
required	checked
lots of actions within bigtable required acquisition of locks including opening tablet for writing ensuring that there is no more than one active master at a time and access-control checked

362980
administration	account
it should however be possible to run a standalone application from an administration account that accesses the exchange information store directly via extended mapi

363061
order	join
i know how to debugging them individually but i d like to join these debugging sessions in order to gain some time

363067
dbix-class	dbi
there are three commonly used orms in perl class dbi dbix-class and rose db object

363071
python	ruby
take for example python and ruby - both started in the early 90 s and really only gaining momentum now

363074
enterprise	platform
platform standard and enterprise

363075
value	field
setting sourceid to the same value as the builtin field dows the trick

363076
perl-module	dbix-class
rose db object and dbix-class can generate classes for you from an existing database-schema and can also write them out to a set of perl-module files

363080
contains	elements
the working form is what is displayed to the user - it s just a containser and can contains elements from various forms

363081
websphere	ibm
we use websphere integrated with several other ibm products to provide secure access to our application which has been working well for us so far

363086
hide	show
then i manage myself the wm_mousehover and wm_mouseleave events to show hide the tooltip

363093
wxpython	pyglet
you can draw simple shapes to a canvas in all of pyglet pygame qt tkinter wxpython and cairo

363112
implements	abstract
if abstractfrotzer is truly abstract then it might not even implements all of frobner s methods itself

363138
value	field
note there is a auto-generated field in the table for assigning ids to new value and i want to make sure that i don t override that id since it is the primary key on the table as well as other compound keys

363155
account	api
it may look like oauth is only for user authentication but if you autogenerate the access tokens and give them to developers instead of having an interactive user process with request tokens and account authorization then you basically have a quite secure api key system

363155
put	get
other than that some nice use of ruby-on-rails routes with conditions to call a different action on get post put etc and a prefix of api v1 and format format.xml format.js etc provides a pretty nice way to build restful apis withought really needing a plugins

363158
compact-framework	.net
we work extensively in the .net compact-framework and windows mobile

363185
reflection	runtime
one may workaround some of the issues by loading the assembly on runtime and using reflection to invoke methods

363197
user-interface	drawing
if you re after a aesthetic user-interface be prepared to do a lot of custom or manual drawing

363207
dictionary	hashmap
it leaves your properties strongly typed unlike the hashmap dictionary solutions unless your class has only one type for all its properties... and gives you one fairly-obvious place to fix or add mappings

363209
directory	folder
what i want to do is for each file in the directory username.com move it to the folder of the same name in mail

363212
required	checked
otherwise if your use case required you to take the future into account then you will probably want to checked for axis modifiers and path separators such as and

363222
entity-framework	nhibernate
microsoft linq to sql entity-framework ef and nhibernate etc are all proposing orms as the next generation of data mapping technologies and are claiming to be lightweight fast and easy

363223
stderr	stdout
i want both stdout and stderr redirected to the terminal so that the user can see that the scripting is working as well as see if there was a problem

363223
stderr	stdout
edit redirecting stderr to stdout and piping the result to tee works but it depends on the users remembering to redirect and pipe the output

363224
put	get
i ve checked out django-rest-interface but it is not obvious on how to do anything other than read get create post update put delete delete and couldn t find any related examples

363237
convention	standards
zend frameworks naming convention which is based on pear is probably the closest you come to a standards in the php world

363239
stderr	stdout
depending on the shell you use you first have to redirect stderr to stdout using

363243
stderr	stdout
use the tee program and dup stderr to stdout

363248
contains	any
except those contains any of the

363257
stderr	stdout
the to redirect stderr to stdout append this at your command

363261
profiling	trace
you can setup a profiling trace to capture the audit schema object management event and filtering based on the database name you care about

363265
profiling	trace
note that in sql-server 2008 they also now have audit to replace profiling trace for auding activities

363271
command-line	cmd
not sure whether you can do this with squirrel you would need access to the mysql cmd-line to run the load cmd

363277
project-management	project
i generally use this for brainstorming and scope management then export to project when we like the scope of what we are working with for more formal project-management

363320
data-access	ado.net
how do i programmatically bind a .net reporting services report .rdlc to a methods in my data-access layer instead of an ado.net dataset

363325
contains	elements
i would like to parsing the doc and doc entries elements using the sax contenthandler but when i hit i want to create a new document contains just the and its children

363341
haskell	erlang
are you using openmp erlang haskell cuda tbb upc or something else

363374
getter	setter
i generally don t make interfaces for data holding beans that is i don t make interfaces for classes with primitive type value and getter setter for them

363386
idisposable	ienumerator
but this isn t particularly efficient if it s actually a generic collection because ienumerator implements idisposable so the compiler has to put in a try finally with a dispose call in the finally block

363390
double-quotes	single-quotes
try using single-quotes for everything in javascript and use double-quotes for everyting in php

363395
double-quotes	single-quotes
note that i changed the double-quotes surrounding article_desc to single-quotes as well

363434
icollection	ienumerable
without generics and because icollection implements ienumerable you can do like in example 1

363435
stax	sax
if you do then use dom alternatively if you re just going to stream the new document then stax would probably fit better with the event-driven nature of sax

363459
command-line	cmd
the basic requirement is pass to some cmd type and execution time possibly other data as well but that s the basic data we re concerned with at the moment from c# code either managed code or something that can take data periodically from the cmd-line

363499
double-quotes	single-quotes
use single-quotes for html and double-quotes for javascript

363508
change-data-capture	data-warehouse
change-data-capture cdc is designed for creating a delta table that you can use as a source for loading data into a data-warehouse or a history table

363517
pure-virtual	base-class
instead of getinterfaceid in the brokeredobject base-class you could define that pure-virtual methods

363519
scp	ssh
i just tested this to confirm running a pexpect scp ssh script from cron and i was able to successfully scp a file from a python script running in cron

363526
image-processing	imaging
i work in medical imaging and image-processing

363526
lazy-evaluation	maybe
maybe i m lazy-evaluation but really i don t want to have to spend too much time figuring a lot of this stuff out when it comes to parallelizing things like matrix inversions and the like

363563
hosts-file	hosts
try to add both the client s and the server s ip-address to the server s hosts

363563
hosts-file	hosts
if you run django on nix it s the etc hosts

363563
hosts-file	hosts
if run it on ms windows it s the windir system32 drivers etc hosts

363566
lightbox	jquery
i will be really happy to know that there is a way to configure jquery s gallery lightbox mootools mooflow to make them display divs as well apart from regular images

363571
thickbox	jquery
jquery thickbox let s you do html contents see inline content example

363594
subclassing	inherited
say the control class contains basic drawing functions ie paint - well control would become a basiccontroldelegate or similar and the subclassing would be created with a reference to a basiccontroldelegate which would be used for all inherited functionality

363598
put	get
anyway if you are using asp.net then the names get mangled to something like ctl100_table and you need to put this into the jquery instead of table

363609
selected	checkbox
first off you can put checkbox next to each item that the user can selected individually

363609
subtract	add
then put a filtering search box with the option to selected deselected all matching add to subtract from selectedion

363609
checkbox	listbox
still with the checkbox but you can arrange listbox next to each other populating children in the next box to the right as users select a parent node to view

363611
implements	abstract
you can inherited a concrete class web form windows form declare your class abstract and still implements an interface

363613
constructor	object
because c++ object declared as part of objective c++ classes don t have constructor or destructors called you can t really hold them there in smart pointers

363654
base-class	inherited
if you need to redefine aspects of the base-class of these two classes then yes you will need to change your inherited structure

363679
webforms	asp.net
use an good pattern if you choose to work with webforms then my advise is to use model view presenter-pattern or if you know a lot of javascript and html and you don t like the webforms model use the new asp.net mvc

363683
environment	building
you ll need to document the requirements plan design building and test every functional component convert data from the old system to the new system and possibly set up new environment for all of these scenarios to take place

363704
any	set
i have not seen any problem setting breakpoints in intellij on the partial mock objects generated by easymock but my co-worker reports that he cannot set breakpoints in eclipse on the partial mock objects generated by easymock because it reports the line number information is absent for the generated classes

363707
constructor	object
if you reserve space for a large number of objects you want to allocate the memory with some method that does not invoke the constructor of the object like new char sizeof object reservesize

363732
order	add
in order to get the max value include you need to add 1 to your range parameter max - min and then truncate the decimal part by casting to an int

363733
webforms	asp.net
the same is not true for webforms as http is stateless and asp.net weaves lots of magic viewstate server session cookies hidden fields etc. to glue together pages of a web application

363740
code-coverage	partcover
i want to try partcover for code-coverage

363740
directory	folder
in the partcover.browser i ve selected the mstest executable i ve pointed the working arguments to my tests.dll and i ve tried pointing my working directory to the testresults folder but i get an error

363747
triggers	insert
if the triggers updates the history table which is slow to insert update delete due to the indexes the procedure call will block until the triggers finishes

363757
triggers	insert
triggers to log insert

363776
default-value	arguments
is there any way that i can reference a variables or const as the default-value for a function arguments in actionscript 3

363830
python	perl
it is a basic application for any scripting language - perl or python or .

363833
implements	extends
i have implements a session timeout warning using javascript that simply asks the user if they want to extends their session or logout

363848
error-handling	try-catch
sql-server error-handling especially 7.0 is poor or maybe i don t understand it well enough to make it do a kind of try-catch

363899
contains	any
there is a dropdownlist in one of them and when user selected any item from dropdownlist it can pass the selected value to the other user-controls which include gridview to show related data of selected item value from the user-controls which contains the dropdownlist

363907
selected	listbox
i d like to create a listbox in wxpython with the same semantics as a multiple selected box in html

363907
listctrl	wxpython
i assume that there s a way to do this with the wxpython toolkit but i can t figure out how to get a listbox or listctrl or any other class to do this short of doing an enormous amount of event-driven programming myself

363915
assign	add
if you don t want to manually code the assignment of the textbox into the arrays then in your form initialisation code iterate through all controls on the form and check for the control type or a specfici tag you assign to each textbox then add each textbox to the arrays that way

363931
groovy	java
i ve been looking into groovy as a transition language from php to java

363931
groovy	java
they the groovy developers claim that it compiles to java byte code the same as java code would

363936
g++	gcc
how can you get a recent release 4.2+ of g++ gcc for windows

363942
arrays	loops
you could store the grades in an arrays and then loops through the arrays

363952
deployment	install
in term of deployment now you force your users to have both the jre and the .net install just to be able to run your application

364022
getter	setter
this is because you re fooling the dependencyproperty system by doing this - remember getter setter of dp properties work differently than regular properties

364037
environment	building
it s difficult to suggest anything more specific without knowing the building environment you re using

364043
revision	svn
so somewhere in your source you insert the token and pass the input and output filenames to subwcrev.exe and it will replace the token with various svn info revision number

364047
32-bit	64bit
for example there is no 64bit flash plugins for windows so i always have to use 32-bit ie for that

364089
contains	set
in eclipse in the menu i can go to windows - preferences - keys and set the scheme to emacs. i can also click export at the bottom-right hand side of the dialog to export a .csv file contains a listing of my keyboard mappings

364089
configuration	installation
how do i re-import this configuration into a different installation of eclipse

364096
required	checked
however i need to be able to take an arbitrary sid and checked it s access against a file and since accesschecked required an impersonation token i don t know how i could greate a token out of an arbitrary sid.

364099
postback	ajax
but if your code references a javascript cookie you can check your pseudo-session state via a postback synchronous or asynchronous ajax

364119
sql-server	oracle
i think your only option other than installing the oracle provider on every machine is to create a sql-server front database that includes pass-through tables to each oracle table you need and then get your data from sql-server instead of oracle

364172
memory-management	memory-leaks
i decided to use the gc for memory-management for my latest cocoa project and i discovered something interesting--if i create a brand new cocoa app project in xcode turn gc to supported or required i tried both build and run it it leaks it shows memory-leaks

364178
binary-serialization	deserialization
i know how serialization and deserialization works but the example i followed when using binary-serialization with java.io.serializable did not work in the same fashion as when i did it with say a simple object

364188
jar	war
note system dependencies are not copied into resulted jar war

364195
revision	svn
you can make a script or small program that runs svn info and then parsing the output to grab the revision number you re after

364215
children	nodes
the trick is to work out the most efficient way of labelling n children of a nodes

364215
children	nodes
since the nodes between a b and c d is a+c b+d an ill-conditioned insert for instance inserting the children left to right runs the risk of creating the same exponential growth in the index values as for instance using a full materialized path

364245
any	set
if you set a pointer to nil you shouldn t be able to use it any more

364282
apache-fop	itext
here is a blog entry comparing apache-fop with itext

364282
apache-fop	itext
edit this forum post about apache-fop vs itext include the following

364282
apache-fop	itext
itext is more feature rich than apache-fop as far as pdf is concerned you can add annotations create acroforms digitally sign a pdf document

364287
put	get
as long as the code wasn t obfuscated then you should be able to use reflector to get viable code if you then put it into vs you should immidiately find errors in the reflected code

364301
punctuation	words
i am trying to get fragments that start on a words character and end on punctuation but for some reason the fragments being returned to me seem to be very inflexible despite that i ve provided a large slop

364326
any	set
your code will be able to pick up any problems with is_good being set incorrectly because with out the true or false check anything will go for a true

364327
swing	swt
i want to get myself into programming some serious gui based applications but when i look at things like swing swt from java i can t help but hate programming a gui interface by creating widget objects and populating them and calling methods on them

364341
any	set
if the methods you call is a static not virtual methods and it does not call any virtual methodss itself nor does it access any fields of the object you will not get an access violation even if the object reference has been set to nil

364343
value	field
depending on what the enum value represents an identity-column i might add a staticidentifier column to my table and make that field the enum value for the lookup modifying my stored procs appropriately to take the static identifier field instead of the identity-column

364353
put	get
put them together and you get this

364355
revision	svn
using a tool to extract the revision number from the output of svn info is indeed the correct thing to do

364355
revision	svn
it will update the sources from the repository get the svn revision number from the svn info call and compare it with the constant svn_revision from the file src svnrev.inc

364355
revision	svn
if svn is not available it will write the revision number 0 to the file

364361
innodb	myisam
you can use the mysql replication functionality or simply copy and paste the data files if your using myisam tables it s just a straight copy innodb tables are a little more tricky

364389
dialog	pop-up
the dialog are no longer pop-up windows so they work in more browsers

364395
arguments	default
you can make an arguments that if you design your system with it in mind that you could use read_uncommitted as the default and only increase the isolation level when you need it

364410
xsd	xml
how about you just save the xml to a file and use xsd

364428
revision	svn
i want to be able to have a svn revision # that corresponds to a complete build of the system

364428
environment	building
must be able to automate deployment to different environment without doing a rebuilding other than the original building on the building-server

364428
required	checked
developer checked in a code change that required a database change

364433
entity-relationship	diagram
1. get an entity-relationship diagram that closely matches your target

364433
entity-relationship	diagram
2. create an sql scripting from the entity-relationship diagram and create the database

364433
postgresql	mysql
i suggest postgresql as some mysql

364434
relational-database	schema
mostly a meta-table schema defeats the purpose of using a relational-database in the first place

364446
python	java
orm tools have been around for a long time on other platforms such as java python etc

364446
data-access	ado.net
use the basic concepts of modularity abstraction and encapsulation--so wrap your platform s basic data-access api ado.net with your own layer that raises the abstraction level closer to your problem space

364470
python	perl
on a related note python is not perl no pun intended

364475
command-line	cmd
but bcp should happen from the cmd-line so not sure why you wouldn t just add your shell script after every bcp cmd

364481
oracle	mysql
oracle has a free program called sql developer which will work with microsoft sql server as well as oracle mysql

364481
sql-server	oracle
when accessing sql-server however oracle sql developer is only intended to enable an easy migration to oracle so your sql-server database is essentially read-only

364486
perl	php
i mainly program in python doing web development but i also need to maintain php and perl apps

364488
double	int
it is possible for two objects of different types to be equal -- for example int and double if first class objects can validily be cast as each other and are comparable mathematically

364493
duplicates	elements
i ve had cases where it was impossible to duplicates the exact alignment used in one compiler to a compiler on a different platform without adding padding elements

364498
abstract-class	subclassing
you could have a factory that returns instances of hidden subclassing of the abstract-class

364499
compiler-options	pragma
gcc and most compilers have similar compiler-options or pragma

364508
contains	elements
every form elements in the has a form property that is pointed to the form that contains this elements

364515
python	java
i develop python applications at work and find eclipse classic and eclipse for java devs a good fit because i don t do any plugin or java ee stuff

364515
python	java
we use eclipse for java python and nsis nullsoft installer scripting

364515
perl	php
i can t offer any advice regarding perl or php but basically like you said download an eclipse version and find some good plugins for your development environment

364516
python	java
this is the same problem i face with the android albeit java instead of python

364517
gedit	gnome
i build sites using django and for that i use eclipse pure and pydev to do the python and gedit gnome s souped up notepad for writing the html for templates css javascript etc

364539
sublimetext	vim
my ideal editor would be netbeans feature set and easy of use sublimetext s performance and slick looks and a toggle to full vim mode

364545
sql-server	mysql
one issue i notice is that at any given time it runs regardless of what step it is on it almost always fails to bring in the total records from mysql into sql-server

364550
any	set
if you re not tied to any particular software open your data set in paraview paraview.org or paraviewgeo paraviewgeo.mirarco.org

364584
required	checked
2 throwing classcastexception-handling required a checked for that exception-handling every time you do a comparison and i think that contributes to the code being less understandable or at least longer.

364584
double	int
4 as user cbo mentioned above double int being equal despite their types being different 4.0 4 and this applies to other types as well

364584
python	java
disclaimer i may be letting my python ways colour a java debate

364598
web-applications	gwt
we often use this approach even for new web-applications where we just want a few widgets on the page rather than coding the whole application in gwt

364623
actionscript	haxe
the haxe compiler can produce swf files javascript and other with a language that resembles actionscript or javascript more or less depending on what language details you care about

364627
tuples	sorted
of course you will be getting back tuples now because sorted turned your dictionary into a list of tuples

364649
instance-variables	accessor
your accessor -setpath in this case -init and -dealloc methods should be the only methods where you d be calling -retain and -release on your instance-variables

364684
contains	any
now you can create an associations between any employee and any instructor by creating a record which contains the two ids

364687
put	get
i could change this to put on a background thread but then every component that needs access to this data would continuously have to get notified when this data was ready

364725
credentials	account
if your trying to tie into your existing ad then you should work closely with your it department they will probally want to create the account their own way especially if your using your existing credentials

364726
common-lisp	lisp
there is a lisp ide available with clozure common-lisp nã e openmcl

364732
any	set
any links inside your right frame that need to target that frame should have target _self and any that need to escape the frame and set the location of the parent page should have target _top

364738
extended-ascii	codepages
if you type chcp in the console you ll see what is the active codepages which might something like cp437 also known as extended-ascii

364766
any	set
linq-to-entities is clunky if you try to use any of the advanced features that is supposed to set it aside from l2s then you will have to start editing your edmx model file using an xml editor you ll soon run into limitations in the designer where the only workaround solution recommended by microsoft is to use an xml editor to hand-crank the edmx

364775
artifactory	nexus
we are considering nexus and artifactory

364807
contains	elements
this selected the current elements and all of the elementss it contains then filtering out the ones that do not have class foo and applies the style to the remainder the ones that do have class foo

364861
filehandle	pipe
this will start the process date and pipe the output of the command to the output filehandle which you can process a line at a time

364870
itextsharp	itext
itext# itextsharp is a port of the itext open source java library for pdf-generation written entirely in c# for the .net platform

364882
order	join
it was a neat experience being able to not have to do all those join in order to display data on some associated object

364931
haskell	ocaml
bruce s basic idea is to use an explicit knot-tying operator called wrap instead of the implicit knot-tying that is done automatically in haskell ocaml and some other languages

364937
object-reference	instances
system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

364946
adobe-reader	acrobat
if the user have installed adobe acrobat then it opens the file in the same browser windows in adobe-reader

364960
file-descriptor	pipe
unnamed pipes do not need any such prior setup. however once you have a file-descriptor open there is precious little difference between a named pipe and an unnamed pipe

364960
solaris	aix
i used the test program that follows on solaris aix hp-ux macos x linux and cygwin windows xp results below

364965
ruby	php
if you re working with interpreted languages like php python or ruby for example you can do a clean svn export directly from your repository to the production server instead of uploading by ftp the source files from your machine

364968
msbuild	nant
better way is to build nant or msbuild scripting that will do all dirty work automated

364969
constructor	object
one common mi idiom in c++ is for complex wrapper constructor where base contructor needs to be constructed with non-trivial member object and since base object need to be constructed before member object the trick is to use mi the base from member idiom. otherwise you have to use a factory and more steps to do the construction like java does java doesn t have mi for non-interface classes

364971
ruby	php
in a ruby on rails application especially with something like the prawn gem and the prawnto rails plugin you can accomplish this a little more simply than a full on script like the previous php example

365000
stderr	stdout
that s why you re not able to just redirect its output to see what your app is sending to stdout or stderr

365000
stderr	stdout
you can use console.app to see the output of applications launched in the normal manner because the launch infrastructure specifically sends their stdout and stderr there

365007
any	set
if your number is more than 32-bit then you would do a scan from your most-significant-dword to find the first dword with any bits set

365041
entity-framework	ado.net
for use with ado.net data services which you mention entity-framework is the one that works out of the box

365046
matplotlib	wxpython
here s a sample of an interactive chart with wxpython and matplotlib

365048
abstract-class	pure-virtual
when u create abstract-class in c++ ex class a which has a pure-virtual function

365048
constructor	object
first thing is we can not access a constructor of any class without an object then how it is initialize the constructor of abstract class if we can not create an object of abstract class

365054
member-functions	pure-virtual
in order to construct class b it must implement all the pure-virtual member-functions of class a

365055
constructor	object
when the constructor of a is still running then the object being constructed is not yet truly of type a

365055
constructor	object
if the function is defined in a and b s constructor calls it there will be a runtime error instead of running b s override because the object is not of type b yet

365056
bazaar	git
as source control why not a distributed system like git if you are not using windows mercurial or bazaar

365056
bug-tracking	trac
for bug-tracking i would go on trac - it has also an integrated wiki that is always useful for project documentation

365057
bug-tracking	fogbugz
consider fogbugz for bug-tracking

365059
put	get
of course you need to put in the where-clause what categories you want to get

365079
put	get
if you re using master pages put it in the your child page and not the master page because the code in the child pages will execute before the master page and if this is in the codebehind of master page you will still get the error if you re using ajax on the child pages

365110
keyboard	mouse
i m looking for ways to watch mouse and keyboard events on windows linux and mac from python

365111
pointers	stack
if you have a pointers on stack exiting the function will free the memory used by the pointers but not that memory pointed to by the pointers

365141
submitchanges	datacontext
in general a datacontext should be kept alive for a unit of work in other words you use it to retrieve whatever object you want to change then change its properties and then just do submitchanges on the datacontext

365149
hash	md5
calculate a hash value using an algorithm with a low probability of a birthday attach md5 sha-1

365160
pointers	stack
all resource control must be performed in destructors that is how smart pointerss work when stack allocated smart pointers goes out of scope the destructor is called and it checks whether the heap new allocated memory must be released and if so delete is called

365180
punctuation	words
this regex will match between 402 and 602 characters where the first is a words character and the last is one of three punctuation characters

365183
contentplaceholder	updatepanel
do i just put an updatepanel around the contentplaceholder in the master page

365200
tokenize	parsing
if you really want to do it use a regex to tokenize the input and leave the parsing logic to procedural code

365207
required	checked
for instances at a child care business at a mall you can required parents to checked children in and the same parents to checked them out

365217
space	input
i decided to check input for following symbols . space

365277
firefox	gecko
there are plenty of implementations of javascript including spidermonkey the version used in gecko browsers like firefox

365280
javascript-engine	spidermonkey
mozilla have a separate distribution of just the javascript-engine called spidermonkey

365299
enterprise	licensing
with the full sql-server 2008 products enterprise standard workgroup and webserver licensing you get a bunch of choices

365305
irrlicht	panda3d
as a follow-up to this question i started looking at some opengl based 3d engines written in c++ crystalspace irrlicht panda3d and they all look rather solid

365305
python	c++
an interesting note about panda3d is that it is written in c++ but the main way you use it is through python

365305
python	c++
it seems to me that method would give the best of both worlds as far as a fast engine written in c++ combined with the ease of programming in python

365319
specifications	w3c
if you are looking for how to manipulate objects in webpages you might want to look at ecma scripting bindings in the w3c dom level 2 html specifications

365339
export	report
use ssrs to allow users to export pdf report could eventually have ssrs push reports

365354
callback	methods
if you design a methods differently for an event callback that means the methods at least implicitly has some information about its invocation - thats a major no-no

365370
variables	boolean
the listen variables is a boolean that is a field on the class

365424
backtrace	dlopen
gdb gives me a backtrace into the dlopen systemd call that appears meaningless

365424
dlopen	dlsym
i had taken a look at apache s guide and am fairly familiar with dlopen and dlsym and dlclose

365443
contains	any
list1 and list2 can be any ienumerable your where-clause can contains more detailed logic and in your selected clause you can yank out what you need

365457
constructor	object
when you create an object of class b the constructor of b is called

365460
having	select
now i am having the option text in templatename using this i want to update an another select tag which is having the same text

365486
constructor	object
but note that the memory isn t formally considered an object of type a until after the a constructor has finished running. the a constructor runs and then the b constructor runs

365489
compact-framework	.net
we work on a variety of .net platforms asp.net compact-framework windowsforms web services

365517
debian	linux
assuming you are on linux debian based systems have separate configurations for mod_php php cgi and php-cli

365535
user-input	output
as far as scripting injection is concerned the safest way to prevent attacker-injected scriptinging from being executed is to ensure that user-input when it is used as output is to be displayed using an encoded format - for web apps this would be html encoding

365538
constructor	object
i can test the class simply by providing different object to it in the constructor whereas if it relies on global data those globals have to exist in my test which is messy

365540
ienumerator	ienumerable
if they can explain deferred execution streaming the ienumerable ienumerator interfaces foreach iterator blocks expression tree for bonus points anyway then they can probably cope with the rest

365543
any	set
i set my shortcut to j k l i b c those are close to where my left hand is but with this setup any shortcut up to 4 letters will work

365556
ref	out
explain what happens when you pass a ref or out parameter into a methods

365571
bugzilla	trac
bug tracking trac not bugzilla mantis fogbuz

365571
project-management	scrum
project-management you ll need a way to setup your releases sprints if using scrum and your backlog

365586
udp	arp
everything from arp dns udp icmg bgp and on and on

365607
iostream	boost
iostream does not have a nice way to replicate scanf and even boost does not have the required extension for input

365613
private-members	private
all that information goes into a private c struct or the private-members of a c++ class

365615
for-loop	arrays
ever since i read that a for-loop works faster than a foreach loop a long time ago i assumed it stood true for all collections generic collections all arrays etc

365617
javacc	cup
there exist also more modern tools for generating lexer and parsing for java there are antlr i also remember javacc and cup but i used myself only antlr

365630
for-loop	loops
i did test it a while ago with the result that a for-loops is much faster than a foreach loops

365637
bison	yacc
and bison a hairy yacc yet another compiler compiler

365663
debugging	trace
one answer i can only back up look again at the stack trace this is the most relevant help by debugging esp there at the borders where the execution crosses different modules esp yours and the lib os borders and look at the argument of the function and check if they are sane

365674
revision	svn
you can in theory always recover to these old revision either with judicious use of svn commands or by the administrator removing later revision

365688
compact-framework	.net
one of the cool things about the .net compact-framework is that you can run .netcf executables on the desktop version of windows

365692
arrays	loops
another key advantage with the foreach loops is that if your collection implementation changes from an int arrays to a for example then your foreach loops won t require any code changes

365692
for-loop	arrays
the above is the same no matter what type your collection is whereas in your for-loop the following will not build if you changed mycollection from an arrays to a list

365694
notepad++	scite
finally concerning ides a good text editor such as notepad++ or scite will suffice

365718
any	set
as far as i can tell my relationships are the same as a working dimension and measure and i don t get any errors from ssas or the event logs just silence and a set of empty cells in the cube browser

365719
arrays	loops
i created an enumerator so that a while loops can get the content of the arrays one by one

365743
click	mouse
then i also have some mouse handler that creates and sets mouseball to a new ball when the user click the mouse

365776
arrays	loops
then loops through category objects and arrays rather than an xdocument

365776
business-objects	data-access
let s say i have a data-access layer a business-objects layer and the web application

365779
pointers	stack
all a stack is is really just an area of memory with a pointers to the top and bottom

365779
decrement	increment
every time you push you increment the top pointers every time you pop you decrement the top pointers

365782
boost	stl
there is a number of choices with c++ if you really like boost or stl then the answers below might be preferable but the simplest and probably fastest choice is to use a single dimensional arrays as in c

365783
filtering	grouping
rather than create folders in sharepoint we create views to filtering and grouping documents

365801
derived-class	base-class
to call the base-class methods you can just put base.methodsname inside the derived-class methods

365802
put	get
or as an old professor of mine put it as you get older you learn to ask who knows something not what book it s in

365804
dlopen	dlsym
given that i know little about apache modules i would try to remove apache from the equation try writing a simple c program that does little more than a dlopen and possibly the subsequent dlsym then exits

365813
document	element
also the dom api explicitly allows many comments directly under the document node not the root html element the logical document root so any conforming browser should allow it

365815
pointers	stack
virtual-machine stack pointers can reduce the memory access significantly and speed up you code

365834
innodb	myisam
innodb has more overhead but uses row-level locking so that reads and writes can happen concurrently without the problems that myisam s table locking incurs

365834
innodb	myisam
having only one column that column being a primary key has an important consideration in the different ways that myisam and innodb handle primary key indexes

365834
double	int
this being the case i would expect that innodb might have an advantage in that myisam would essentially have to do double work -- write the int once in the data pages and then write it again in the index pages

365843
row	col
faster is using a normal vector and then doing index calculation like to get at a certain row and col

365866
json	xml
your own opinions on the use of xml in your example would also be wonderful we implemented xml-structured responses because of requirement x person y even though i thought json would have been better because ..

365873
scheme	rebol
i currently have installed on my device pythonce etcl dsforth pocketlogo the documents which comes with it is in german though rebol and pocket scheme

365887
malloc	free
see what is the difference between new delete and malloc free

365889
constructor	object
new initialises object calls constructor etc

365891
malloc	free
i m just going to direct you to this answer what is the difference between new delete and malloc free

365891
constructor	object
if the allocation function returns storage and the the constructor of the object created by the runtime throws then the operator delete is called automatically

365891
constructor	object
that operator delete version is only called if the deletion is done because the constructor of the object did throw

365902
json	xml
i suggest you also study json which is an alternative to xml and is widely used for its compactness

365909
pointers	stack
edit also for manipulating the 2 stack you will need to store their stack pointers somewhere

365909
pointers	stack
every time you will use one stack or the other you will have to update esp with the appropriate ebx or ecx or wherever you may keep your 2 stack pointers because push and pop will modify esp and you will want them to modify the version of esp that is needed and not another one.also when you finished pop push you must update ebx ecx with the values of esp

365914
malloc	free
although malloc free and new delete have different behaviors they both do the same thing at a low level manage dynamically allocated memory

365914
malloc	free
the actual implementation of malloc and free can vary a lot since there are many ways to implement memory allocation

365916
buffering	streaming
in reality the client is consuming records on demand via so there needs to be a small buffering to handle the incoming tds streaming - but it isn t the same as a database cursor

365916
push	pull
for this type of scenario and others jon skeet and myself wrote an alternative linq implementation that works as a push rather than a pull allowing you to feed data through multiple parallel processes at once

365928
authentication	login
you can also use a property on the class to set up authentication or have the class discover and record that itself after you login

365937
javascript	dom
the dom and javascript let you calculate an element offset from its parent

365937
response	timeout
my guess is that the scripting in google reader simply runs on a timeout probably a few times a second or perhaps in response to a scroll event

365938
for-loop	loops
use a for-loops or a while loops with a temporary result and a counter

365945
firefox	safari
but i haven t yet figured out whether it s me writing sloppy code with firefox perhaps being more forgiving than safari or if it s safari or if it s jquery

365948
instances	private
what about private instances of their dev data

365950
json	xml
my advice is to skip xml and look at something simpler like json

365966
json	xml
the emergence of json is testimony to the fact that the xml bandwagon had a few too many layers

365971
json	xml
and can configure the backend to spit out json instead of xml i highly recommend using a library such as json-framework

365975
dictionary	arrays
on a non-arrays object it behaves like a dictionary associative arrays

365985
delphi	c++
if plugins will be developed in delphi or c++ builder use packages + interfaces

365997
push	pull
the exchanges are performed by both push and pull methods

366003
firefox	safari
make sure that you have the latest version there have been great progress for the javascript engines in the safari and firefox releases in recent time

366003
jquery	dojo
also i think dojo and mootools have faster animations than jquery at least in my experience

366029
constructor	object
arrays object inherits caller constructor length and name properties from function.prototype

366039
quirks-mode	doctype
i don t think a comment after the html will cause any problems but i believe that a comment that precedes the doctype declaration and therefore before the html tag will kick ie6 into quirks-mode

366043
boost	stl
a lot of stl and boost

366086
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox opera 9.5+ and safari 3+ google-chrome and ie tested with v11 you can define getter and setter properties

366088
actionscript	mxml
the built-in flex builder will refuse to build the mxml file containing the testrunnerbase component as it is a pure actionscript project no flex allowed

366088
actionscript	mxml
it is impossible to add the mxml file to the actionscript applications list in the project settings

366107
contains	set
for example if i have a jtable named books which contains information about all books by a certain author and then the user changes the author i would have to update that table with a completely new set of information note because of the volume of data in question it is not practical to use a filtering on the table and update the filtering

366122
environment	building
this will provide many of the tools you will need to building a compiler targeting native or managed environment

366133
getter	setter
here s a link to douglas crockford s page on private-members in javascript ....it would seem to me these would be read only if only getter methods are supplied and no setter

366134
g++	gcc
gcc g++ complains expected initializer before â â token

366160
order	join
the way i was doing in was querying with a join and assigning all of the column values to a variables in my one large order class

366165
canvas	pixel
then you can get the pixel values from the canvas

366174
webforms	asp.net
asp.net s server-side controls work with webforms not mvc

366174
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the asp.net-mvc model is quite different from the webforms model

366177
constructor	object
for example your constructor for the order object would look like this

366195
order	join
if you need to display data from multiple tables -- say a list of orders with some data from the customer associated with the order -- then you can either use views join or stored-procedures to construct an object of a view class that represents the selected data in the view join sp

366202
double-quotes	spaces
i m trying to put together an expression that will split the example string using all spaces that are not surrounded by single or double-quotes

366208
treeview	grid
it will be a custom control made up of a treeview for the top part and a datagrid for the bottom part - or maybe just an ordinary grid depending on the desired effect

366209
contains	elements
rather it appears to be a tree contains a pair of elements in each node and unsigned

366209
tree	trie
you can by discipline use a tree of tuples as a trie but it s only by convention not enforcement

366209
contains	elements
what you need to do is have each trie contains a left-right disjoint adt rather than just the raw elements

366214
contains	any
is there any existing code in apache httpclient or in the servlet api to parsing cookie header and obtain from a string that contains name1 value1

366215
python	java
the other advantage for using u++ over something like mfc wpf java swing java swt python etc is that your executable do not have any baggage or dependencies

366215
python	ruby
django because i know and like python and i don t know ruby very well

366215
ruby	php
java might says struts jsf stripes but i don t think java has anything that can compete against frameworks from python ruby c# or even php these days

366240
double	int
that s because 1 and 3 are treated as int when you don t specify otherwise so 1 3 evaluates to the integer 0 which is then cast to the double 0

366253
double	int
if you have int s that you want to divide using floating-point division you ll have to cast the int to a double

366257
udp	tcp
so i am doing a lot of high performance network programming using boost-asio or just asio if you will and have a pretty solid grasp of the essentials of both tcp and udp protocols

366263
arrays	map
if you need to frequently look up cookies by name then it may be easier to put them in to a map so it s easy to look them up rather than iterate over the arrays each time

366266
lighttpd	apache
apache iis lighttpd firefox opera webkit etc.

366271
arrays	loops
is an iterative loops that will search the first object in each arrays element but it won t search nested elements such as in my demo arrays

366296
communication	messages
dll bpl loaded from a sandbox which could be another copy of the program or a specialized server application and which communication with the main program via messages sockets msmq named pipe mailslots memory mapped files

366299
perl	php
initially php was mere a scripting language with no object oriented support php 3 so the function names used in php upto version 3 and 4 are mostly inspired from perl syntax

366319
arbitrary-precision	rational-numbers
gmp is a free library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic operating on signed integers rational-numbers and floating point numbers

366353
32-bit	64bit
each 32-bit process running on a 64bit kernel has 4gb private address space limit which is by the way not shared with the kernel as in a 32-bit system

366357
reflection	runtime
just an alternative perspective in many scenarios it is desirable to use system.componentmodel rather than direct reflection as this allows for runtime property scenarios - how a datatable s dataview exposes the columns as properties

366364
litespeed	apache
in my current project i use php and litespeed web server though the same technique applies to php + apache and i thought.

366377
global-assembly-cache	gac
what is the global-assembly-cache gac

366377
early-binding	late-binding
conceptually what is the difference between early-binding and late-binding

366378
required	checked
if you need you might easily implements permission checked login required for downloading

366392
order	add
also you might want to add the site to another security zone local or whatever that was called in order to get completely different settings and try again then

366397
revision	ignore
typically the code is also different at least once changes are made and so if you are using a revision control system i think it might be a better idea to have a templates configuration file database.cfg.templates that you copy and tell your revision control system to ignore and modify to database.cfg

366407
push	pull
i allready finished allmost all git commands i ever use push pull fetch stash branch commit merge format-patch am apply etc so it should be usable pretty soon

366408
jquery	.post
you can use jquery framework its javascript library you can use default image or span or div or anything else even anchor tags to do submit button its easy to use and can .post form data by .post method or get method through ajax just visit jquery website jquery

366421
turbogears	cherrypy
i am wondering how do i redirect my browser to the external website say www.yahoo.com from my cherrypy turbogears app

366434
debugging	trace
if you implement any custom debugging logging as a trace listener you can capture your trace messages application wide very easily

366452
coverity	klocwork
there are more expensive commercial tools such as klocwork and coverity

366461
environment	execution
again more details on the execution environment and the level of detail would be required to give a useful answer

366477
linqdatasource	sqldatasource
daniel i needed something similar so i derived from a label and bound it directly to the events raised by the various datasourcecontrol derivatives linqdatasource objectdatasource sqldatasource

366486
constructor	object
now in the window1 constructor create our object just so we have some data to bind to

366514
python	ruby
however if you already know python or ruby you can easily make great looking applications using their cocoabindings

366536
user-interface	look-and-feel
getting a understanding on how to make a user-interface that make sense the java look-and-feel design guidelines will be helpful

366544
perl	awk
that could be done using tail or awk or perl depending on the commands you have available

366561
contains	any
should any function contains loads of code

366588
vb.net	vba
i am a hobbyist programmer started with vba to make excel quicker and have been working with vb.net c#.net and am trying to learn ado.net

366626
pascal	basic
some of these libraries support only pascal as the scripting language others will let you use basic perhaps better for beginner users or other languages

366627
svg	vml
vml is vector markup language a kind of proprietary ancestor of svg

366627
svg	vml
i searched svg vml library in google and was surprised there are lot of libraries apparently

366639
administration	account
as far as i understand there is no way to configure a multi-server sharepoint farm without using a domain account to initially connect sharepoint central administration to sql

366654
convention	standards
if a naming convention is leading you down the road of naming your classes ielephantprovidersupportabstractmanagersupport rather than zookeeper change the standards before you make it harder for the next person

366698
.when	ready
it s .when you stumble upon problems you have no ready solutions for that you start building your own

366699
salesforce	sugarcrm
for example highrise salesforce zoho crm sugarcrm

366706
subtraction	addition
they both work for addition and the c program works for subtraction as well

366712
salesforce	sugarcrm
maybe look at sugarcrm 24sevenoffice or salesforce

366718
exception-handling	try-catch
or does it make sense to put try-catch loops throughout pieces of the code to catch more specific exception-handling types

366727
json	xml
if either of these is possible or feasible you may want to try json or writing your own xml format

366729
python	java
whether the code is in java python c++ or haskell well-written code is understandable by people who don t even program in that particular language

366731
exception-handling	try-catch
on a minor point using the threadexception-handling event also allow your main message loop to continue running in case the exception-handling isn t fatal fault-tolerance scenarios whilst the try-catch approach may requires that you restart the main message loop which could cause side effects

366740
actionscript	mxml
i ended up putting the unit test mxml file in the original project creating a new flex project deleting the src directory and replacing it with an eclipse linked folder to the src directory of the actionscript project

366741
subclassing	inherited
some languages like java have a fairly limited set of language-features available meaning that subclassing is fairly often used because it s a convenient methods for re-use technical inherited

366759
attributes	properties
too bad there isn t a way to set properties attributes this is one thing i really wish i could do

366766
constructor	object
if a person has 10000 notes i don t want the person object constructor to load all the notes he has

366775
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

366785
windows-xp	windows
the used library gdi+ is included in windows up from windows-xp and works in windows up from windows98

366791
base-class	subclass
it can be used as a base-class to prevent the subclass from being copied or assign this is the common behavior

366798
project-management	project
as many open source project found trac is a good fit - lightweight project-management with integrated subversion interface

366815
ruby	php
my own experience is that the object model in javascript is a bit trickier to understand than others such as php or ruby and hence applying design patterns isn t always that easy

366835
document	element
and this xpath expression correctly selected just the wanted first detrs element in the provided xml document

366846
ironpython	ironruby
if you re not beholden to javascript for now i d check out ironpython - the hosting api is identical to what microsoft will release for javascript and about as easy as it could possibly be and switching between the 3 dlr languages ipy ironruby and managed javascript is trivial

366852
32-bit	64bit
additionally the app is running in 64bit mode which gives it a mensurable performance advantage over 32-bit

366854
dialog	pop-up
the problem is that when i close the dialog box and then i click on the link that triggers it it does not pop-up again unless i refresh the page

366858
windows-server	windows
also mapuserphysicalpages is part of windows awe address windows extensions which is for handling more than 4 gb of ram on 32-bit versions of windows-server

366863
json	csv
if you dont know how to write a parser you could look at one of the open source json libraries or start with something less complicated like a good csv parser here is a paper that looks pretty good

366868
contains	any
your first regular expression will not selected any links that contains other tags such as img or b

366875
python	perl
that s pretty easy to do in any scripting language such as perl python etc

366903
buffering	streaming
these would perform the necessary operations on the underlying phsycial streaming and buffering can be both on the underlying streaming and the logical streaming depending on which suits best

366905
zipinputstream	inputstream
it sounds like what you really want is a sort of partial inputstream - one a bit like the zipinputstream where you ve got a stream within a stream

366910
void	main
static void main string arguments

366920
web-config	app-config
if not maybe you d be better off using a separate xml file for this data instead of using app-config web-config

366927
exception-handling	try-catch
i wouldn t recommend putting a try-catch around the entire app unless you want your app to never crash in front of the user - it ll always be handled and probably ignored as there s nothing you can do with the exception-handling at that point

366928
shell	bash
but it s quite tricky to invoke cl.exe that is the visual c++ compiler toolchain in the cygwin bash shell

366928
shell	bash
running in the bash shell doesn t work obviously

366928
shell	bash
how do i run the vc++ compiler in cygwin s bash shell

366943
associations	model
as frankodwyer said you really want to be using the ruby-on-rails associations to state the fact that one model is related to another

366955
ostream	std
how do i bind a std ostream to either std cout or to an std ofstream object depending on a certain program conditional

366965
webforms	asp.net
however the mvc pattern has been used in asp.net long before this framework existed so if your looking at enhancing an existing webforms app make sure you don t end up looking at the more recent buzz which is about asp.net mvc as a programing model in asp.net

366983
gnome	kde
it s simply a lot of little user-interface difference making life hard for the newcomer similar to moving from windows to gnome or from gnome to kde

366983
shell	bash
the default shell is bash so that should be very familiar

367002
python	perl
perl and python are fully fledged general purpose programming languages

367002
python	perl
there are many differences between perl and python your best bet is probably to read the summaries of both languages on something like wikipedia to get a good grasp on what they are

367014
perl	awk
in order of appearance the languages are sed awk perl python

367014
perl	awk
two of the programs provided with it are a2p and s2p for converting awk scripts and sed scripts into perl

367014
perl	tcl
perl is one of the earliest of the next generation of scripting languages tcl tk can probably claim primacy

367014
perl	awk
neither awk nor sed is extensible. one of perl s mottos is tmtowtdi - there s more than one way to do it pronounced tim-toady

367014
python	perl
python was written last and probably in part as a reaction to perl

367014
python	perl
python - for the same tasks that you could use perl for

367014
python	perl
i m not aware of anything that perl can do that python can t nor vice versa

367014
python	perl
i learned perl before there was a python so i tend to use it

367014
python	perl
note that the overviews of perl and python in particular are woefully incomplete

367022
contains	any
but most of the time it doesn t contains any useful information because obviously authoring tools don t let you simply view it.

367032
mocking	stubs
actually as mentioned mocking and using stubs to test system interaction without a database interaction is great but intergration testing can be just a valid

367049
i2c	spi
as for sensors all of these support i2c and spi interfaces so the number of peripherals available is well into the thousands

367053
child-process	spawn
i am wondering if there is a simple way to send the child-process s print output to the first process or have it spawn a shell standard output so that i may debugging it

367082
perl	awk
first there are two unrelated things in the list perl python awk and sed

367082
python	perl
perl or python do the same things more clearly

367082
perl	awk
everything sed and awk do can be done in python or perl often more simply and sometimes faster too

367082
python	perl
by doing things in python or perl your implementation depends on fewer languages with a resulting increase in clarity

367091
verilog	vhdl
if you decide you want to explore hardware design the nexys 2 board from digilent is an excellent way to learn about hardware design using vhdl or verilog

367096
crossover	mutation
breed new generation through crossover and or mutation genetic

367096
crossover	mutation
the key is the reproduction part which could happen sexually or asexually using genetic operators crossover and mutation

367099
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
my users can then open csv with a tool spreadsheet openoffice.org org has a good one and then adjust the columns and print with it

367108
external	host
mef provides a standard way for the host application to expose itself and consume external extensions

367111
order	join
if you can rely on the unique id column having the same sort order as pubdate then you can simplify the join because there will be no ties over a unique column

367115
python	perl
i actually feel that that which makes perl perl free form tim toady-ness is what makes perl -pi -e work so well while with python you d have to do something along the lines of importing the re module creating an re instance and then capture stdin but maybe there s a python shortcut that does all that and i missed it sorely missed it .

367116
any	set
with rss feeds how do you set up google analytics or any other statistical tracker to track people who are subscribed to the feed

367118
pointers	stack
when you re chasing bad data such as a null pointers it depends on where it comes from if it s passed as an argument look at the call stack to find where it comes from

367118
put	get
if you have a breakpoint in a hot spot that gets hit too often before you get to the problem deactivate it and put another one in a place you know will be hit shortly before the problem manifests then activte the one in the hot spot

367134
locale	french
our default system locale is french because we re running on a french server and we didn t set it explicitly

367155
punctuation	words
i m trying to split a string up into words and punctuation adding the punctuation to the list produced by the split

367155
punctuation	words
so i want the strsplit at whitespace with the punctuation split from the words

367159
implements	super
to me the best approach was to first implements this super simple example and play with it

367161
python	ruby
i ve heard that python or ruby have good capabilities for native lib integration

367166
contains	elements
there s just no definition of st_anything for the elements of os.stat that contains the time

367167
if-statement	loops
it can therefore be used in if-statement and while or until loops too â in posix-compliant shells

367181
python	perl
perl tends to make extensive use of your examples make implicit use of it and i don t think python supports any similar concept thereby making python equivalents of the perl one-liners much harder

367189
instances	self
calling returns an instances of the class class for self s superclass

367195
value	field
you need a private backing field to hold the value

367260
perl	awk
if you want quick on the fly one-off scripting capability i recommend sticking to perl awk sed and standard unix command-line tools

367294
rollback	commit
since you didn t tell the transactionscope to commit it will rollback automatically

367299
submitchanges	datacontext
override submitchanges in the datacontext and find all of the inserts and updates that are recipes

367302
bazaar	git
i believe the commands are exactly the same for mercurial with hg instead of git and very similar for bazaar darcs monotone codeville arch and most other dvcss

367303
inlining	inline
the compiler inlining is sophisticated enough to only inline if this will help in the optimization stratergy being used

367304
document	element
for example if you were trying to match the whole body element in a large html document you might be tempted to use this regex

367308
configuration	logging
to support disconnected scenarios logging concerns developer usability configuration etc.

367335
versioning	upgrade
versioning number is also needed for the users to know if they can upgrade

367365
configuration	upgrade
i was packaging an application for use on a wide variety of configuration and i determined that the most reliable way to perform custom logic within my msi would be to write my own custom action dll that would be able to read write from the property table kill a process determine if an application needed to be upgrade and then record the answer in the property table and write to the standard msi log

367371
c++	lua
with lua you can interface the sensors of whichever device you will be working with in c or c++ and have the functions called from inside lua high level code

367372
any	set
i would explicitly define all of the settings required - never assume that any setting is still set to the default value

367387
versioning	upgrade
this code is more for an example and in this example below it is checking to see if the versioning of notepad.exe needs to be upgrade that means the versioning stored in the property table value notepad_verson is greater than the versioning of notepad.exe on the system

367396
any	set
in parametric polymorphism you can reuse the set with values of any type or maybe any type satisfying some constraint

367396
contains	set
then t is the type of objects contains in the set the notation indicates a so-called type parameter which is what makes it parametric polymorphism

367396
subclassing	inherited
in a language like java or c++ which conflate subtyping with inherited your use of polymorphism may be restrict to subclassing of a particular class

367400
perl	ruby
as python ruby perl java c#

367409
directory	folder
that way you only have one folder on the main directory and it stays unclutered

367427
contains	elements
this should automatically show you the html for that portion of the page and show you the elements which is contains the silverlight control.example doing this for flash below - or directly linked here since the embed doesn t seem to be working

367443
early-binding	late-binding
traditionally the big advantage of early-binding is for performance a late-binding language has to carry type information about all its data at runtime and loses the opportunity to do some optimizations at compile-time

367451
mocking	stubs
good mocking libraries are blurring the lines between mocks stubs and fakes

367461
superclass	subclass
the problem would still exist if i had answer_b be the superclass - and have answer_a subclass or compose it

367491
webforms	asp.net
asp.net work the same way is it you were using webforms

367503
excel-vba	vba
any book on excel-vba should help as you can copy and paste code from vba to vb6

367503
vba	vb6
also trying to do what you want to do in excel with vba then putting it into your vb6 project will also help

367507
contains	elements
the real trick is to keep track of where the scrollbar is in the elements contains your items

367507
click	mouse
it works scrolling in both direction and also by click right on the scrollbar which simple mouse tracking won t give you though in this case since the example elements are all the same size with the same text it s hard to tell that it has indeed scrolled

367527
decrement	increment
in particular except in sizeof expression functions class objects pointers or references shall not be used and assignment increment decrement function-call or comma operators shall not be used

367538
double	int
by the way in this example the amount is an abstraction of a real life concept that could also be represented as a double or an int but maybe we have interestion methods inside that would be better if set in its own class

367562
python	ruby
does anyone know a good solution for implementing a function similar to ruby s timeout in python

367571
scripting-language	brainfuck
i have written a simple brainfuck interpreter in matlab scripting-language

367571
nested-loops	loops
implementing this is easy for the case of a single loops but with nested-loopss it becomes very complicated

367607
implements	extends
hey i m extends some wpf-controls and need to implements some custom events

367617
concat	where
in another posting does linq-to-sql support composable queries there was discussion on how to compose concat where clauses dynamically

367644
debugging	trace
better debugging debug views instead of just stack trace

367647
linux	osx
if all your code is qt it would not be a big job to make it compile and run on osx or linux but if you use other windows specific things it might take some time

367647
linux	osx
trolltech has released a beta of there own ide qt creator that you can download i downloaded and tested it on linux and osx last week it workes but i have just tested it

367662
pointers	stack
using pointers to objects whose lifetime has ended for instance stack allocated objects or deleted objects

367662
expression	evaluation
evaluation an expression that is not mathematically defined

367662
constructor	object
making virtual function calls to pure virtual functions of an object from its constructor or destructor

367690
expression	evaluation
the compiler is free to re-order the evaluation parts of an expression assuming the meaning is unchanged

367712
webserver	host
embed a light weight webserver with in the host application and handle requests to perform such operations

367740
linux	unix
linux or unix operating systems and

367755
silverlight	wpf
as you probably know silverlight uses a subset of wpf so you may be able to change your application relatively easy

367755
webserver	upload
you could have a seperate part of your app to upload files to the webserver then read these in your silverlight app from a service

367782
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
you might also want to look at the viewdidload viewwillappear and viewdidappear methods that are triggers well it s fairly obvious when

367790
text-align	width
the second suggestion is to remove the float and width from the div and instead rely on the text-align right

367817
increment	reset
now at a certain point i want to extract the grouping which can be dynamic it depends on what i got during the day and get the number i increment and reset it

367825
constructor	object
if you called a method as a constructor this will be a new instance of the class if you call the method as a method this will be the methods context object

367825
constructor	object
similarly the constructor of an object will be the method itself if called as new and the system object constructor otherwise

367875
triggers	insert
then i would have an insert triggers against newmember that inserted the identity-column

367881
ruby-on-rails	django
while you might not like it or other frameworks - eg ruby on ruby-on-rails i plead that you do check out what s happening in the open-source world before you plonk for anything windows related since you already have the infrastructure available for hosting django ruby-on-rails et al

367896
cfengine	puppet
have you looked at things like puppet or cfengine

367899
cassini	iis
incidentally this is one of the reasons i habitually run my vs webapp projects through iis not cassini anymore

367908
hosts-file	hosts
i could alter the hosts to achieve the same result but since the hosts doesn t support wildcard chars i will have a whole lot of entries so a dns server that supports wildcards would be a little bit easier

367918
visual-studio	release-mode
another observable difference is that in release-mode the binary would simply crash on a fatal error while in debug mode if you start debugging the application in visual-studio you can check the call stack which tells you the exact location of the erroneous statement

367922
instrumentation	debugging
a _debugging preprocessor definition that allows you to write code that acts differently in debugging mode compared to release for example to instrumentation asserts that should only be used while debuggingging

367940
button	popup
then a submit button can be pressed and based on the integer that was inputted create that many textfields in a popup windows or whatever

367960
wamp	php
i like wamp the best real simple interface and i can easily switch between different versions of php 5.26 4.44 4.3.9 mysql 5 4 and apache 2 1.3

367966
debugging	trace
given that we re at a point in the testing process where changing the application code is out of the question the ideal from my point of view would be to listen to the debugging trace from the application a little like debugview does and respond to that

367974
json	xml
you pretty much get all the freedom of using json as in you don t have to roll your own xml scheme to format your data and serialization is as easy as a to_plist call plus the sdk comes with native code for handling plists

367974
json	xml
but if you all ready have a web-service that outputs in json xml you might want to keep that and just parse the stuff on the iphone using the stuff already mentioned touchxml json-framework

367975
itextsharp	itext
with itext java or itextsharp .net you can put them all together in the order you want

368003
python	perl
i would like to know the best way to place order the files from first to last using bash perl or python

368090
temporary	copy
i don t think you can do it directly but it s possible to extract it at runtime to some temporary location and make call to that copy

368160
value	field
if that specific value is not in my dataset the vba scripting fails saying that it can t define the item in the specified field

368190
event-log	logfile
in my code i typically write a custom error handler that takes in a number of parameters and spits back a nice formatted message that can either be emailed to the helpdesk stashed in an event-log written to a logfile etc

368201
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch in the main function hides the exception-handling from debugger

368224
alpha	rgba
i guess including the alpha channel should be pretty straight forwarding probably just replacing rgb with rgba but i have not tried that

368224
pyopengl	pyglet
edit i wasn t aware that the pyglet opengl api is different from the pyopengl one

368241
value	field
further more we want to display some predefined value if optional field is null or empty

368248
configuration	installation
it allows you to customize xml configuration files during installation using xmlconfig

368281
subclipse	aptana
i use aptana eclipse subclipse to do the svn

368284
instances	destroy
but for instances you might prefer to disconnect cleanly from remote services where possible and there might be resources external to the process such as named pipe mutexes that you d prefer to destroy rather than leaking

368284
debugging	exit
if you want the debuggingger to trap unexpected conditions in debugging mode which in release mode throw an exception that eventually results in an exit then there are other ways to do that than leaving the exception uncaught so that the debuggingger sees it

368287
visitor-pattern	visitor
in the visitor-pattern it is almost always the case that a base visitor class implements default behaviour for each type of visited node is required ime

368291
fadeout	fadein
because google-chrome can t display well png24 with opacity change i tried to do a fadein fadeout with jquery on a png image and i get an annoying white flash before image animation

368308
value	field
getmaxdescent and getmaxascent should tell you the absolute maximum value of those field for any glyph in the font

368325
datagridview	listview
i would suggest to use the datagridview instead of the listview

368351
row	col
what is the best way to write the query that yields the following result one that yields the final column - a column contains the minium values out of col1 col2 and col 3 for each row

368367
vb.net	vb6
if you maintaining a vb6 or vb.net application over the long term i strongly recommend that you minimize the use of 3rd party controls

368394
triggers	insert
however if for some reason you can t change those columns i d suggest using insert and update triggers and add another column which these triggers set to the minimum on col1 2 3

368415
directx	gdi
wpf uses directx for rendering which is much faster instead of the native windows gdi

368432
any	set
is there any way to set the style for the lineends for the tcanvas.lineto methods

368446
any	set
abcxyz any character not in the set a b c x y z

368457
gethashcode	equals
if you have a different but similar-for-the-purposes-of-equality object to compare to then you ll need to implement your own gethashcode equals and ideally

368466
directx	gdi
to say directx is faster than gdi is also something of a simplification - wpf and gdi-based rendering technologies just have different performance characteristics

368470
sortedlist	sorted
if you need the other list of customers to be sorted you could use a sortedlist

368504
firefox	gecko
firefox gecko

368504
value	field
some function on field or a whole object can return a unique value mdash

silverlight	wpf
have two project files one wpf one silverlight that point to the same set of files

368521
vb.net	vba
clients of the api could be c# vba vb.net c++ java

368551
concatenation	comma
given a list of strings what is the best methods for concatenation these strings into a comma separated list with no comma at the end

368591
hexdump	hex
use vi or a hex editor or simply hexdump to do that

368624
revision	svn
my ideal system would allow me to checkin revision to a repository on my laptop that would then sync with our main svn repository when i connect to the company network

368636
.when	ready
.when they re ready i ll build an sdist bdist and bdist_egg and upload them to pypi

368636
debian	linux
i m mainly concerned with debian linux but deb packages are not an option for the reasons ian bicking outlines here

368653
firefox	opera
copy this code in a jsp page testpage.jsp deploy this file in an existing context of a web application on the server i use apache tomcat then open a browser firefox ie7 or opera using the correct url localhost context1 testpage.jsp type your name in the input and submit the form

368653
browser-cache	caching
be careful with the browser-caching sometimes seems that it doesn t happen but it s in the caching refresh the second tab

368668
document	element
i m interested in assign the tag name of the root element in an xml document to an xslt variables

368669
sharing	share
edit sorry all i have just realised i have confused things by mentioning that there are several main products sharing components - although they share the components they don t run on the same pcs

368693
hide	next
you can hide prev next navigation via css

368700
profiling	debugging
i found that it was much easier for me to develop code in eclipse compile it with ant using etaras rapc ant tasks but they seem to be gone -- blackberry ant tools seem to be a suitable replacement and use the jde for debugging profiling etc

368713
triggers	insert
the reason it is bad to ever use identity is that if a triggers is ever added to the table that insert to another table with an identity that is the identity that is returned not the one you just inserted

368713
identity-column	cursors
even if you kept the cursor which i do not recommend cursors are a very bad way to do inserts as they are very slow compared to the set-based solution that pete gave your code could not do the insert to the first table if column d is the identity-column which i would guess it is since you later try to assign d to the identity value

368720
callback	methods
you have a callback methods onmethodsreturn specified in the webmethods call but not an error handler methods

368720
callback	methods
you need to create one and pass it into as you do the callback methods

368729
versioning	upgrade
if your shared components are tagged often enough then your colleagues are probably right and it s easier to manage the incremental changes from the most recent tag to the trunk than it is to manage the change from arbitrary versioning x determined at the last build to arbitrary versioning y determined when you choose to upgrade

368730
treeview	listview
for example a filedialog will have several button class a text input class a listview treeview class and so on

368744
shell	bash
suppose a shell script bin sh or bin bash contained several commands

368759
constructor	object
if the method is a constructor then it would depend on a couple of different factors is there also a public setter for the property and how likely is it that the object will actually be used

368768
apache-poi	jxls
if you code for java 1.5 you try jxls what extends apache-poi and use xml xslt technologies

368826
contains	any
the interface aspect means that although an instance won t have any actual fields it still contains valuable information - its type

368842
google-chrome	firefox
tested and working in ie 6 7 8b2 firefox 2 3 opera 9.62 safari 3.2.1 for windows and google-chrome

368847
javascript	dom
added if the dropdown is not read-only all the time and javascript is used to enable disable it then this is still a solution - just modify the dom on-the-fly

368858
sql-server	mysql
i ve been working with microsoft sql-server with many years now but have only just recently started to use mysql with my web applications and i m hungry for knowledge

368865
command-line	cmd
you can do that via the wmi cmd-line interface or the tasklist cmd of which i have limited knowledge

368877
nested	order
if i know that i am going to use nested synchronized block or when i am going to fix a deadlock i use thread.holdlock object to ensure i won t get the locks in reverse order

368882
stderr	stdout
the nul 2 1 redirects stdout and stderr to nul so nothing from pslist will be display

368888
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
the other potential exception-handling that come to mind are argumentexception or argumentnullexception but these have a connotation of being related to parameters that are passed into the methods and are not therefore appropriate to my mind

368888
communication	messages
in any case a good descriptive error messages is probably the most effective way of communication what the problem is

368906
contains	elements
however using svcutil to generate a proxy class does not give us a .net nullable datetime property so how best can we make the proxy class serialization the message to a soap message that does not contains the datetime elements

368929
entity-framework	ado.net
to be complete i m using ado.net entity-framework to implement my dal

368940
repository	entity
however if your product entity is in a separate repository to the user entity then surely this would cause a conflict between repositories

368944
signals	sigint
short answer look into the signals function specifically catching sigint

368976
abstract-class	pure-virtual
i have an abstract-class defining a pure-virtual methods in c++

368976
malloc	free
i am under the impression that it s not good practice to mix new and delete with malloc and free

368997
contains	sorted
i have a column that contains dates when i click the column header the column is sorted numerically and not by date

369003
dialog	pop-up
from the pop-up dialog you can decide what to clear

369009
superclass	inherited
one of my favorite approaches is to take one of the built-in methods inherited from the object superclass replace it with a custom function passthrough and attach properties to that function object

369013
hosts-file	hosts
network connect and hosts rules

369013
hosts-file	hosts
since it afirefoxects both ie and firefox i d also look at the connect angle the hosts and permissions

369021
any	set
while it doesn t self determine it doesn t require you to pass in any boolean value from outside and doesn t require you to set the ismodal from outside it sets it inside itself it s accessible from outside if you so chose to use it that way

369026
mousemove	keydown
the context is the main windows is a light-box-like system except instead of pictures it show iframes and each iframe is an interactive page with keydown mousemove handler

369036
put	get
in order to get something useful accomplished we need to put a real statement in so we get a slice of each pair which removes the single quotes and closing square bracket then further split on that conveniently-placed opening square bracket

369037
swing	swt
i use swt jface instead of swing for the native look and feel primarily.

369037
jface	swt
swt jface in action has been the best resource i ve found

369045
selected	textbox
this works fine but what i want ideally is to have the textbox automatically selected when a user clicks the item ideally in a nice generic way i can use throughout my project and without too much messing around in my codebehind

369050
postdata	request
basically in situation like this one would create a httpwebrequest set methods to post and write the postdata to the request stream

369055
attributes	properties
using something like this you could then use a number of methods to display the correct controls for each of your business object properties with the correct attributes read write hidden displayed etc

369076
push	pull
git differentiates between commit and push pull so working offline works great

369092
url-rewriting	rewrite
in my url-rewriting module the code to rewrite the request path was in the init methods when it should have been inside an application.beginrequest handler

369097
.net	wcf
however if you don t have anything in place and running on windows platform .net is pretty cool in that area wcf asmx wse ...

369098
.net	wcf
possible consideration - .net pre 3.5 only provided support for soap based services but i believe the 3.5 wcf offers rest and soap now

369101
bazaar	git
you re looking for a distributed revision control system such as git bazaar or mercurial

369102
lookup	any
basically i want to do some sort of reverse lookup in my routes but i can t find any doco on how i might go about doing that

369115
attributes	properties
the root of the domain has a properties called minpwdlength there are several other attributes related to password policy minpwdage maxpwdage lockoutduration etc

369132
communication	messages
however where the inter-service communication has proved reliable at the lower end of the message size scale at the higher end this is not so - messages do not seem to be delivered at all

369133
versioning	upgrade
keep in mind you need to use mysql 5.1.6 or newer to do this if not time to upgrade there s been some noteworthy speed improvements in the new versioning anyway

369145
shell	bash
i ve been reading through the bash reference manual v 3.2 and can t see any reason for filename globbing to not take place i m not passing -f to the shell or anything that i can set to ensure that globbing happens

369153
python	java
data crunching solve everyday problems using java python and more

369215
value	field
one area that will have to be handled in code unless you want to get really fancy is the cases where a user s permission is determined in part by the value of field in the object itself

369221
python	ruby
platforms like ruby python which

369221
ironpython	ironruby
ironpython ironruby

369254
fflush	gets
you should probably test that it gets fflush on exit to be sure

369258
constructor	object
however jslint also takes issue with the object and arrays constructor which do not make this distinction so it may simply be the author s coding-style preference

369266
entity-relationship	diagram
i tried using toad to create an entity-relationship diagram but aftentity-relationship leaving it running for 48 hours straight it still hadn t produced anything visible and i needed my computentity-relationship back

369267
arrays	loops
it s far more efficient to retrieve the attributes as they are stored and then write application code to loops through the result set building an object or associative arrays with an entry for each attribute

369273
lookup	any
but with this i still have issues dealing with effective privileges -- in most cases i also have to lookup the user s membership in any of the grouping listed in the ace that do have permissions on the object

369289
bad-request	http-error
why would ie 7 display http-error bad-request 400 on the same page that firefox loads without complaining

369350
postgresql	mysql
ea supports oracle mysql sql server multiple versions postgresql interbase db2 and access in one fell swoop

369354
any	set
a single erd or set of erd s are not sufficient to document a system of this complexity any more than a class diagram would be adequate to document an oo system

369362
order	add
i do not have problem to add order by but since i am using jpa to get this values anyone knows what the problem is or if there is a way to fix this

369379
entity-relationship	diagram
in my expentity-relationshipience entity-relationship or uml diagram aren t the most useful artifact - with a large numbentity-relationship of tables diagram especially reventity-relationshipse engineentity-relationshiped ones are often a big convoluted mess that nobody learns anything from

369387
click	mouse
while not as straight forward as the typical mouse listener or click listener it still provides a reasonable interface

369391
bison	yacc
if you don t know any i ve done my google search... yacc bison is the only way

369413
arrays	loops
if you really need to exclude null from the result and you can t prevent it from being in your arrays then maybe you should just iterate through the arrays with a simple loops and keep track of the min and max in separate variables

369417
sequences	unique
the size of the set in bounded only by the number of unique sequences possible

369420
.net	wcf
imo if you want to do soap then its a heck of a lot easier to use .net and wcf

369420
.net	wcf
if you are going to serve this from windows hardware you can drop .net wcf web services into iis

369420
solaris	linux
if you are going to run a linux solaris server then it isn t even a question.

369435
code-coverage	eclemma
eclemma for code-coverage is my favorite apart from my own plugins of course -

369443
bison	yacc
none of them are in python but i should think that starting from xblite might be more helpful than starting from yacc bison ply

369450
constructor	object
in addition to breaking and typeof returning object using the number constructor also changes the way the value is used in boolean contexts

369465
document	element
floating an element takes it out of the flow of the document therefore it will not take up spaces in the general flow when rendering on the screen

369469
directory	folder
unfortunately in my application we do not have a finite or known set of upload target directory -- any share or folder in the network may be accessible

369483
contains	set
the more traditional way other than clearing is to set the overflow property of the contains div to hidden

369510
macros	vba
i have an excel file that has a bunch of vba and macros code in it

369510
value	field
when i open the file in excel i can choose not to enable them - so the value in the field all stay as they were during the last save

369525
order-of-operations	operators
the latter because the meaning of the former isn t clear unless you have a perfect understanding of the order-of-operations as it applies to the not and operators a subtlety which is easy to miss

369591
iteration	set
varb is set at the beginning of every iteration to the next connection string in the list

369632
sql-server	oracle
in some other organization data about employees could also be in an oracle or sql-server database

369632
contains	any
back to the employee example ultimately if one does it right at any given time all systems and applications in an enterprise can contains the same information about the employees without any discrepancy

369636
cryptography	security
i do not need cryptography security

369664
python	java
i m looking for a definitive answer in python or other languages 2nd choice being java if nothing else is available

369689
directory	folder
when i look at the directory in set working folder it seems to be ok

369697
having	select
the script available at this article is not quite what i want since i m working with a large number of files and want to delete them all without having to select each one

369727
linux	unix
the reworked data dictionary and system tables are similar to those used by db2 v8 on linux unix windows

369727
linux	unix
db2 v9 is much more consistent across platforms linux unix windows and mainframe

369741
protected	public
things like making sure that public and protected methods are documented prior to check-in to making sure that no work can be checked in without a corresponding workitem

369759
cryptography	security
whether or not you need cryptography security why not just use system.security.cryptography.rngcryptoserviceprovider to generate your random numbers

369766
put	get
can you at least get the users to put the company names into multiple textbox

369779
entity-relationship	diagram
well a picture tells a thousand words so i would recommend creating entity-relationship diagram whentity-relationshipe you can view the relationship between tables at a glance something that is hard to do with a text-only description

369792
contains	elements
where the salesperson property on the cars object would contains a stream with the raw xml that is within the salesperson xml elements after being run through an xmlserializer

369803
order	add
i just found that in order to add dynamic per-instance aux classes the forest functional level of the domain must be 2003

369810
credentials	account
many people create a specific domain account for reporting services and use these credentials for the data sources making sure you have given the domain account necessary permissions to the underlying databases involved

369817
difference	zero
if any two consecutive buckets have more than zero elements each maximum difference between them is

369834
sql-server	mysql
sql-server has difference function to tell you how much two soundex values are apart but i think mysql has nothing of that kind built in

369834
filtering	grouping
with soundex you can store a pre-calculated soundex in your table and compare sort grouping filtering on that

369836
sql-server	oracle
everybody seems to use the stuff that comes with sql-server and compared to the stuff that comes with oracle it is pretty good

369837
tunnel	vpn
the problem arises only when i connect to the server through a vpn tunnel

369843
document	element
if you don t do a full deserialization you run the risk that the xml is malformed within the salesperson element and so the document is invalid

369860
visitor-pattern	visitor
how does it supply the complementary part of the visitor-pattern - the accept visitor methods on nodes

369878
firefox	opera
a quick test shows that ie 6 reveals 27 items from a 27 item list safari for windows 3.2.1 reveals 22 firefox 2 reveals 20 and opera 9.6.2 reveals 16

369916
arrays	map
do i just put the map in the object arrays

369933
asp.net-mvc	wcf
if you want those apis separated from your web site s asp.net-mvc code for deployment purposes etc. or if you need a rest api for others to use to call your app - wcf

369952
double-quotes	spaces
note the double-quotes around i in order to display remove properly files with spaces in their name

369952
rmdir	cmd
in order to also get rid of private directories first run the cmd with rmdir s q i and then with del f i

369955
unsigned	integer
but a deliberate implementation choice of most vanilla graphics libraries is that they treat colours as unsigned 32-bit integers internally with the three or four as alpha is typically included components packed into the integer

369955
processor	cpu
remember that bitmaps are usually accessed by more parts of the hardware than your processor and the endian that is specified by say conventional display adapters is not necessarily the same as the endian of your cpu

369957
continuous-integration	teamcity
i would recommend investing in setting up a continuous-integration process cruisecontrol.net or teamcity etc... as you are probably not only going to deploy it to your customer only once

369987
key-value	key
you need a table with key-value columns and if you re storing multiple maps an identity-column or a foreign key to another table holding data that the hashmap is a member of

369987
insert-into	prepare
then in jdbc create a prepare statement insert-into myhashmap id foreign_id key val value

369993
entity-framework	nhibernate
a good database and an appropriate or mapper like .nettiers nhibernate or more recently linq to sql entity-framework would probably get you back up and running with minimal changes to the rest of your codebase

369994
unpivot	pivot
updated 12 23 08 i also wanted a clean way to compare what changed and this looked like the reverse of a pivot which i found out in sql is called unpivot

369994
triggers	insert
i am now leaning towards a triggers using unpivot on the insert and deleted tables

369998
linux	osx
it currently runs on linux and osx

369998
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
on windows you can use visual-studio or sharpdevelop and copy your binaries over to linux or osx to run them

370010
fiddler	charles
sure there are many tools such as charles fiddler 2 and firebug that allow you to do this via an interface but i d like to be able to automatically generate reports and the like based on this tool

370045
malware	website
and the purpose of the include .js file is distributing malware by using your website and it include several exploits mostly targets ie users

370046
aes	rsa
i m looking at using rsa and aes exactly the same way gpg and pgp work

370049
value	field
as a side note this is an extremely easy way of capturing the value of an identity field

370059
google-chrome	firefox
firefox safari google-chrome opera all play the first match wins game but ie plays the last match wins game

370059
checkbox	button
in general i would name the button differently unless they are part of a radio checkbox set

370087
triggers	insert
i currently have an insert triggers which in oracle 10g runs a custom defined function that generates a funky alpha-numeric code that is used as part of the insert

370119
value	field
i have a table that has 8 million records with many field including latitude-longitude value and it has an index over the latitude-longitude field

370120
csv	xml
by wrap i mean that i want to support other transport content representations such as xml soap possibly java properties or windows ini formats comma-separated values csv and that ilk google protocol buffers custom binary formats proprietary binary formats like microsoft excel workbooks and whatever else may come along

370131
fogbugz	svn
the fogbugz part - getting fogbugz to insert the svn info and corresponding links

370143
uinavigationcontroller	uiview
how about pushing a generic uiview into the uinavigationcontroller

370163
g++	gcc
if by understanding memory management in mingw g++ you mean understand how the mingw g++ compiler handles memory internally while it is compiling files such as when it allocates and frees abstract syntax tree nodes etc. then your answer is that as a multi-pass compiler gcc may not know the optimal lifetime for any particular piece of data but it does know that large grouping of objects won t be needed from one pass to the other so it uses memory pools when possible and garbage collection elsewhere

370166
any	set
is there any windows api call i can write a hook for that will notify my program whenever any other program just set its taskbar button to orange flashing mode

370169
environment	building
a common problem with software building is that it breaks on some machines ultimately due to how someone has configured their default shell path and other environment variables

370169
environment	building
the elegant solution is to make your building scripting immune by fully specifying the shell environment

370169
environment	building
code your building scripting to set the path and other environment variables based on assembling pieces that you control such as the location of the compiler libraries tools components etc

370170
execution	jobs
hadoop cascading uses it to visualize execution plan of map-reduce jobs

370172
communication	messages
as for communication between tasks you may consider looking at plan 9 s libtask or rob pike s newsqueak for inspiration the unix implementation of newsqueak download include a paper the implementation of newsqueak that discusses messages passing in an interesting virtual-machine

370183
margins	padding
it sounds fairly simple and i ve fiddled about setting margins and padding to my containers div and the body tag etc but i m having no luck what so ever

370188
32-bit	64bit
you may be running into issues with the 64bit debugger not being able to deal with the 32-bit debugger client

370188
32-bit	64bit
there was a question a while ago talking about problems connecting a 32-bit debugger to a 64bit target which i think is the opposite from your situation

370195
malloc	free
do malloc new and free delete work in the same way with regard to this

370195
vxworks	linux
will it occur on other operating systems such as linux or vxworks

370198
shell	bash
the split functionality in bash and other bourne shell derivatives is most neatly achieved with the inter-field separator

370198
contains	elements
making it work for path elements contains spaces is a non-trivial exercise - left for the interested reader

370224
margins	padding
hard to tell without seeing the markup but it could be that your containers div is not clearing its child elements which might explain why margins or padding on the bottom is not working.

370250
environment	building
i m able to building it in debugging mode add breakpoints and attach it to the dllhost.exe process but the visual-studio environment will only show me the disassembly from dllhost.exe and not my source code it also doesn t stop on the breakpoints

370252
32-bit	64bit
i m running vs2k8 which is the 32-bit version is there a 64bit version

370255
contains	elements
the above example will remove any elements in path that contains usr

370269
any	set
i haven t found any shortcut problems i temporary set b to do cut by fiddling with the key assignments in the eclipse preferences and that worked ok

370283
double	int
however it will happily allow a variation where the double is changed to an int unsigned or any integral type

370283
double	int
why would the c++ designer s allow me to static const an int or unsigned but not a double

370293
double	int
i don t know why it would treat a double different from an int

370311
double	int
using g++ with no optimization -o0 it automatically inlines constant int variables but not constant double values

370311
defined	declare
for maximal portability you should declare your constants in header-files and defined them once in some source file

370314
freebsd	aix
btw i ve spent a considerable amount of time on aix solaris freebsd and linux.

370317
value	field
assuming a t1 with a single id field one row contains the value 1 and a t2 with an id and value field one row id 1 value 6 then we get

370325
managed-code	c++-cli
the dll is written in c++-cli and it s mixed partially managed-code and partially native

370326
communication	messages
messages passing communication

370326
ia-32	mips
it was apparently ported to ia-32 mips r3000 r4000 strongarm sa110 intel ixp1200 intel ixp2400 and motorola 68k

370330
sql-server	oracle
the recap is that oracle has a built in function for this with sql-server you are stuck either defining a user-defined-function or using case statements

370346
switching	screens
- dynamic pages one silverlight screens can switching between screenss like a normal app

370346
rad-controls	telerik
i see that telerik sells rad-controls for wpf...but this is only useful to me if silverlight can be a rich client platform through the web

370363
contains	any
if a function contains any assignments to a variables it is treated by default as a local variables

370377
scala	java
using the maven scala plugin a config like the one below will work for a project that mixes java and scala source scala source of course goes in the scala directory as mentioned by someone else

370377
scala	java
for a great ide intellij 8 works nicely add in the scala plug in then add a scala facet and then adjust the compile setting for scala to run scalac first critical if you have circular dependencies with scala and java source

370378
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox i get exception setting a property that only has a getter ie gives error google-chrome gives error but in opera it works if i assign it on the element not the prototype

370378
google-chrome	firefox
you can however add a new function will work in firefox google-chrome and opera but not in ie since ie don t have the constructor property

370405
delphi	c++
the c++ builder delphi option used to be pretty attractive but i don t know what their platform looks like these days

370409
comparable	icomparer
this example does not use the icomparer versioning of the orderby extension but relies on the fact the double are comparable already and returns the calcvalue assumed as double as the key

370415
delphi	c++
2. visual component library vcl with either delphi or c++ builder added advantage of being a native app and no additional library requirements

370421
environment	execution
if this approach is not feasible it may help if you clarify here exactly what you can and can t control in terms of data flow and execution environment though i know that s sometimes easier said than determined

370434
contains	elements
try floating the contains elements to the left too

370442
contains	elements
this causes the contains elements to clear all floating elementss before closing the contains box

370443
credentials	account
you are sending credentials for authentication but the account is banned disabled

370445
sequences	unique
one solution is to use an oracle sequences to feed to your custom code that generates the unique string

370445
sequences	unique
oracle provides sequences for just this reason - so methods generating unique id s are thread-safe

370515
directory	folder
i saw the biggest performance improvements when i copied the templates folder from the jar to the root web directory for the webapp

370520
copy-constructor	constructor
thus what you want to do is to wrap the raw pointer into a user defined class which overloads constructor copy-constructor copy assignment operator and destructor an do the proper reference counting

370572
keyboard	mouse
i expect it works like you described with a message loop that handles mouse and keyboard messages for the popup menu

370580
affinity	cpu
when you say taking cpu affinity into account - are you saying that all processes have cpu affinity in this hypothetical system

370598
cappuccino	sproutcore
i m about to build a web app and i would like to use either sproutcore or cappuccino

370619
sql-server	ms-access
now i want to move or copy the ms-access database data into sql-server

370653
dbd	dbi
so multithreading is not supported because everything inside dbi is single-threaded but it is safe to use dbi and hence dbd oracle in a multithreading application

370658
hosts-file	hosts
entries in the local hosts for

370661
updatepanel	gridview
further the custom gridview is contained in a user control that puts the gridview in an updatepanel and combines it with an object data source to making the control easy to use

370661
debugging	trace
i tried downloading the debugging symbols for asp.net but visual-studio still won t let me step into the code and the trace is not giving too much information here

370706
scheme	let
with a little background in scheme you would know that let is just syntax sugar for defining a lambda and invoking it

370719
build-server	teamcity
i am trying to setup a teamcity 4.0 build-server to run vs2008 non-tfs unit tests

370734

370754
keydown	keyup
it only supplies the keyup and keydown events contains the keyeventargs structure

370758
lightbox	jquery
it sounds like you might want to take a look at the jquery lightbox plugin

370766
perl	c++
there is this discussion on detecting code duplication on c++ using tools do we have anything like this for perl codes in unix platform

370768
c-strings	c++
must be able to use c-strings as well as c++ strings

370778
emacs	vim
emacs with the psgml module can do it along with vim but both probably more low-lovel

370779
order	add
in order to be able to easily add warnings in the same way that you would errors i created some extension methods for the modelstatedictionary

370784
http	ssl
i have to switch from http to ssl socket connection

370784
compression	streaming
does ssl protocol support compression of streaming data

370785
web-config	app-config
you can instantiate a binding giving a binding configuration name from app-config web-config

370794
methods	extend
if loggedin was stored in the session you could extend the context to give you an isloggedin in methods

370799
attributes	properties
pfattributes means properties will be stored as attributes of xml elements

370813
sql-server	oracle
i currently have a sql-server express 2005 database to hold some transaction metadata that i now want to migrate to oracle 10g express instance

370822
bad-request	http-status
the request failed with http-status 400 bad-request

specifications	w3c
according to the w3c specifications

370827
document	element
every html document must have a title element in the head section

370832
32-bit	64bit
the latest crystal reports runtimes don t run in a 64bit environment so if deploying to a 64bit server you will either have to configure iis to run an 32-bit mode or use a previous version of the runtime

370845
webserver	upload
for a project i m working on i would like the user to be able to drag a file from the desktop or windows explorer and drop it on a web page in ie and have it upload to the webserver

370863
multicast	packets
packets on your multicast port

370863
multicast	packets
multicast packets on that port

370863
multicast	packets
inaddr_any to receive only multicast packets sent to

370900
version-control	git
i trust you have some form of version-control software svn mercurial git whatever but not vss

370915
perl	php
typical languages used for this are php perl ruby or asp

370933
hide	show
for the web you should make something more sophisticated not just hide show the button.

370948
bazaar	git
using a simple version control software like svn git or bazaar is not exactly what i want

370948
versioning	packaging
each package has dependencies with versioning a description and sourcecode and given a good packaging system you can go like magic search set equation fixpoint and the magic packaging system is going to find a module that solves the problem

370967
implements	abstract
because abstract means implements no functionality and static means there is functionality even if you don t have an object instances

371032
stream	send
i am developing a program that continually send a stream of data in the background and i want to allow the user to set a cap for both upload and download limit

371032
abstract	extends
a natural approach is to extends the abstract stream class to make it simple to extends existing traffic but would this not require the involvement of extra threads to send the data while simultaneously receiving leaky bucket

371047
any	set
alternatively see if you can find the property that might be causing the error whether any property relies on a non-null value being set

371069
google-chrome	firefox
i have seen the same issue with ie 8 the issues does not occur in firefox google-chrome or ie 6

371069
authentication	login
in my case i can see that the session is actually working bu the authentication terminates redirecting the user to the login page again for him to login.

371079
textbox	button
when i click on the ok button the form posts back but the textbox doesn t have a value

371083
repository	entity
from a user-interface point of view you can make it look like you go user- order- product but when you hit the product edit screen you grab the entity from the product repository

371106
webserver	host
given that you are using access i imagine one of the microsoft family of languages would be best and that your institution will have a webserver already presumably iis to host your website

371106
postgresql	mysql
you might want to migrate the data from access to a database backend - mssql if your institution already has a license or mysql or postgresql if you have a budget of zero

371111
delphi	c++
delphi is compiled and very fast similar to c++

371129
factors	primes
and then the dictionary is fed into divisors who uses it to generate first a list of lists where each list is the list of the factors of the form p n with p primes

371157
binary-tree	tree
the others are o n linked lists of size n - you have to iterate through the list one at a time an average of n 2 times and o log n binary-tree - you halve the search space with each iteration - only if the tree is balanced so this depends on your implementation an unbalanced tree can have significantly worse performance

371160
linked-list	tree
if you re persisting the contents the serialised form will likely be sorted and when it s re-loaded the resulting tree will be wholly un-balanced as a consequence and it ll behave the same as the linked-list - because that s basically what it has become

371185
instances	private
the class would have a private instances member of type that all implemented calls would delegate to as well as raising the events

371189
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
if you are writing custom collections anyway you can implements the inotifycollectionchanged or the inotifypropertychanged interfaces

371193
installation	building
the sliksvn binaries are similar to the plain building but packaged as as msi for easy installation on clients

371221
dictionary	arrays
the problem is that linq through extension methods on knows how to build arrays lists and dictionary it doesn t know how to build your custom collection

371238
.when	ready
but you should allow for expanding demand and be ready for it .when it happens

371241
aes	rsa
i have used openssl in past and found it a great library for crypto apis including aes rsa 3des

371243
csc	vbc
not without rewriting csc or vbc

371248
any	set
i have a short program that is used exclusively with a remote desktop connection that s been set to only run that program and not allow any other access into the remote machine

371248
debugging	exit
or is there some way to programmatically detect whether the program is running in debugging mode and just disable the exit procedure in that case

371256
event-listener	listener
for instance netbeans beaninfo editor does not recognise the event if extends event-listener is missing from the listener

371257
background-color	width
i am not sure if this is what you mean but an often seen blur-like effect is created by creating a full height full width div-element with a background-color and opacity property set

371264
directory	folder
for example this should set up a virtual directory called testdir that points to the folder c inetpub wwwroot test

371281
where-clause	sql
you are using a commandtype of storedprocedure but your query is not a stored procedure name its a sql query without a where-clause

371300
inherited	subclass
i m using nhibernate 2.0.1 and a table per subclass inherited mapping strategy.

371311
triggers	insert
did you check the table are doing an insert on and see if there are any triggers on it that may be deleting data elsewhere

371319
constructor	object
a constructor always returns an object reference and as you have pointed out if an exception was thrown in the constructor the execution point would leave the property entirely

371319
constructor	object
the constructor could of course have left the constructed object in an inconsistent state and that is presumably what should have been tested for

371321
any	set
i was hoping there might be some rules i could set up on the topic or server level that define permissions to the topic based on ip rules but i cant find any reference to this

371336
environment	building
this will tell the compiler to only call this methods when the release environment variables is declared somewhere - this can declared in during compilation conditional-compilation symbols on the building property panels or as part of the operating system shell see conditionalattribute for more inforamation on this

371338
shell	tcsh
i am looking for websites or documentation that will teach the basics of tcsh shell programming

371344
space	input
what you should do is for every input check that it is what it s supposed to be that is xx.xx.xx or yy yy yy or that it does not start with a space and abort if it does

371348
gethashcode	equals
the gethashcode methods should reflect the equals logic

371348
gethashcode	equals
if two things are equals then they must return the same value for gethashcode

371348
gethashcode	equals
if the gethashcode is equals it is not necessary for them to be the same

371348
gethashcode	equals
oh - for convenience you might also consider providing and operators when overriding equals and gethashcode

371350
value	field
as you can see it just tries to guess a good hash code based on all the field in the class but since you know your object s domain or value ranges you could still provide a better one

371356
python	php
i got decent experience in .net and some experience in python and zero experience in php

371400
arrays	map
as far as i know there isn t the notion of a sorted hash map in ruby so you re limited to good old arrays for this one

371406
attributes	properties
look for the delay signing attributes as well as the checkbox in project properties

371411
environment	building
things like other developers machines and test environment building servers etc

371411
continuous-integration	build-server
if you have a build-server really you should be using something like nant with some sort of continuous-integration server

371418
buffering	capture
so is it possible to use protocol buffering to capture a random number of randomly named columns of data like a csv file

371420
dom4j	jdom
it s a java xpath implementation used for both jdom and dom4j

371427
highlight	selected
when the user click on a row it highlights the row in blue which is fine but when i programatically turn off the selection by setting the row s selected field to false the blue highlight does go away but it leaves a dotted outline around the row

371460
delphi	c++
i would like to know if its vb or c++ or delphi or .net etc from the program exe file

371462
pdfsharp	migradoc
we used a set of third party dlls from pdfsharp who in turn use dlls from migradoc

371465
quadtree	octree
how would i write a basic but complete quadtree class or octree in c++

371468
droppable	draggable
i m using jquery user-interface s draggable and droppable libraries in a simple asp.net proof of concept application

371468
droppable	draggable
when the page posts back partially updating the updatepanel s content i rebind the draggable and droppable

371470
bash	zsh
i d spend more effort learning posix sh as a start and then head towards bash or zsh

371471
display	width
i am trying to get some javascript to programatically adjust a html img tag s width to display various sized images correctly

371471
display	width
i have a fixed width img tag at 800px to display an image this is the max width

371490
put	get
get the first character after that comma and put it in front of the string

371491
linked-list	tree
this would perform worse than the others during inserts as a sorted list is o n on insert versus o 1 for a linked-list or hash table and o log 2 n for a balanced binary tree

371491
sorted	lookup
but lookup in a sorted list may be faster than any of these others structures i ll explain this shortly so you may come out on top

371491
hashtable	sorted
if you have one or a few large lists then a hashtable is likely to out-perform a sorted list

371491
sorted	lookup
why might lookup be faster with a sorted list

371491
binary-tree	tree
with a binary-tree lookups only remain o log 2 n if the tree remains perfectly balanced

371534
rijndaelmanaged	aes
i ve done a little research and it sounds like asp.net uses the rijndaelmanaged aes encryption algorithm to encrypt the viewstate of pages.

371543
post-increment	pre-increment
the main difference is that i++ returns the pre-increment value whereas ++i returns the post-increment value

371547
temporary	copy
if the object is being used within an expression it will be copy constructed into a temporary variables

371547
deep-copy	object
the copy should be a deep-copy otherwise any changes to the original will affect the copy and thus the state will change in relationship to the expression using the object

371547
post-increment	pre-increment
in the same way as pre-increment it is probably best to implements post-increment in terms of pre-increment so that you get the same behavior

371550
communication	messages
you need to use special mechanisms to guarantee that communication happens between these threads as you would on a messages passing system

371553
temporary	copy
the postfix operator i++ changes the value in i but returns a temporary copy of the old value which cannot be modified by the assignment operator

371553
post-increment	pre-increment
pre-increment appears to be more efficient because post-increment has to increment itself and return a temporary value but a compiler will optimize this difference away

371555
order	add
i d like to known if there is a pattern that allows me to be notified at compile time if there are queries that refer to a wrong table structure for instance if i remove or add a field on a table and the query string refers to it in order to prevent runtime errors

371568
contains	elements
each elements is a stack frame contains the local variables and context of a single function call mdash

371570
order	add
i found only one useful solution here which won t break the ddd concepts to add a usual property maxcost to the class order and to update it each time when items list updates

371574
temporary	copy
because pre-increment returns a reference to the incremented variables rather than a temporary copy ++i is an lvalue

371588
display	width
the accuracy of this methods depends on the assumption that the display area covers the width of the monitor exactly

371602
installation	building
ruby in steel from sapphire steel is building on the visual-studio shell integrated mode that will merge with visual-studio 2008 if you already have it installed or simply be a standalone installation if you don t have visual-studio already installed

371610
access-control	authentication
right click the website in iis manager properties -- directory security -- authentication and access-control -- edit.

371638
synchronous	.when
the only time it makes sense is to have a worker thread make your synchronous request and notify the main thread .when the request is done

371638
synchronous	.when
.when are you using asynchronous synchronous threads -- and .when are you using either async sync in a thread

371640
keyboard	mouse
my wrists only hurt when i m doing stuff that requires me to move my hand off the keyboard and onto the mouse or arrow keys and back constantly

371647
ironpython	ironruby
also no use to you but microsoft are going to be releasing ironruby studio and ironpython studio at some point in the future

371652
administration	integrated
just follow the wizard s steps make sure you have administration rights on the sql-server check all your steps with the integrated help for detailled table indexes rules upsizing

371654
interactive	latex
not a markup language like latex or docbook but more something interactive like scribus

371660
quirks-mode	doctype
i see that you re using the transition doctype so i d start by changing that to strict if you can to get out of the difficult-to-predict quirks-mode

371703
object-reference	instances
message object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

371708
constructor	object
ordinarily if an object needs another object to run i like to pass it in the constructor

371708
constructor	object
but i can t do that in this case because one object has to be instantiated before the other and so therefore the second object does not exist to be passed to the first object s constructor

371708
constructor	object
i can resolve this by passing the first object to the second object s constructor then calling a setter on the first object to pass the second object to it but that seems a little clunky and i m wondering if there s a better way

371713
directory	folder
this basically says if the url doesn t lead to a directory that exists or a file then go through my index.php also block out the logs library application and configuration folder because sometimes they are in the document root on some of my projects because of server limitations

371721
lighttpd	apache
a few have suggested using lighttpd over apache

371726
instances	private
i would normally make the construction logic private to the factory using friend construct package level protection or similar to en sure that no-one could construct instances without using the factory

371743
quadtree	octree
the reason to use a quadtree is because you can then split on x- and y-coordinates an octree on x y and z making collision detection trivial

371781
display	height
all the text must be display no scroll bars. i think height 100 does this

371781
scrollbar	popup
the windows is a popup and it should never have windows scrollbar it can be resized but no scrollbars

371808
uicontrol	uibutton
interestingly corresponding classes like uibutton uicontrol don t use this idiom

371815
required	checked
i also found that swing was and still is quite involved and taking a look at the documentation provided by sun is required every once in a while -- every time i checked i seem to learn something new

371821
lighttpd	apache
for instance in some benchmarks lighttpd is even faster at serving static resources than apache

371828
children	nodes
essentially each nodes has links to 4 children that divide the nodes s space up into evenly distributed quarters

371828
binary-tree	tree
if you are looking for a binary-tree - like a red-black tree - then you want to use a data structure called a binary space partitioning tree bsp tree or a version of it called the kd tree

371835
textures	fbo
instead of rendering the scene directly into the framebuffer you can render it to a textures via an fbo then render that textures as a full-screen quad

371851
order	add
i should add that i m willing to re-write this at a later time for better performance and to learn more things but in order to get this site going in a month or less in my spare time i d like to limit the number of new things i need to learn

371855
put	get
easiest way round it is to put event unsubscriptions in the observer s dispose methods and remember to call it when you get rid of the observer

371861
selected	cells
the user needs to be able to selected a range of cells from a databound grind and display the sum in another cell not in a footer

371868
packets	subnet
in this case the scheme has worked pretty well and even if a manufacturer screws up and issues cards with duplicates mac addresses things will still work ok as long as those cards are not on the same subnet since beyond a subnet only the ip-address is used to route packets

371868
any	set
developers of third party vxd drivers were supposed to ask microsoft for a set of ids to use for any drivers the third party wrote

371944
iteration	set
set up your algorithm to use iteration instead of recursion and

371947
filtering	grouping
given that i have a valid directoryentry object for both the grouping i want to test and the account i want to check for i need a directorysearcher filtering string that will allow me to confirm that the account is in that grouping even if the account is a foreignsecurityprincipal

371951
webforms	asp.net
microsoft does provide abstractions above that with things like webforms and asp.net ajax but if you ever want to seriously be a web developer you still need to know what is going on behind the scenes even if you use webforms until the day you die

371951
silverlight	wpf
as for silverlight i actually went about it the other way and learned wpf first so i can t help you out too much

371974
textbox	button
the form controls can contain server controls like button textbox es etc

371984
profiling	trace
if the profiling is slowing your app down filtering it as much as possible and consider going to a server side trace

372005
tortoisecvs	svn
i use this to invoke tortoisecvs svn functions to open a command prompt in the corresponding directory etc

372009
key-value	key
it consumes the next matching two character key and colon as well leading to me only matching every other key-value pair

372012
show	next
try doing a little usability testing if only by asking the next person you see hey does it make sense to disable this or show you an informative dialog

372023
32-bit	64bit
i want to build a dll class library use com interop with c# target any cpu and register it as 32-bit and 64bit interfaces

372023
32-bit	64bit
i want to be able to at runtime display what interface was used - if i am using the 32-bit version or 64bit version

372045
glib	gtk
1 glib and gtk

372049
jax-rs	jax-ws
i think the best thing about it is it s integration with newer technologies like jax-ws and jax-rs jsr 311 restful spec

372068
installation	upgrade
ask yourself this will the developers be more effective and will their increased productivity actually increase benefit to the company or reduce corporate costs once you ve considered the upgrade transition installation on the servers additional testing etc

372087
contains	any
and if it wont work can someone tell me the best way to test if any of the objects in the arrays contains a property with a specific value

372090
arrays	loops
my solution was to create an arrays which stored all the urls by tracknum then create instance names inside my while loops

372108
parentheses	braces
python will implicitly join lines that are contained within parentheses braces and brackets as in your example code

372111
hosts-file	hosts
if you add entries to your hosts or use dns alias you can get more connections

372111
hosts-file	hosts
for example in testing add lines like 127.0.0.1 test1 to your hosts and then you can open two connections to and two more to

372121
subclassing	superclass
this uses a kind of abstract superclass with mixins to create concrete subclassing that are disjoint

372140
32-bit	64bit
how do i register the 64bit interface vs the 32-bit interface

372144
contains	set
where set is the string contains the characters to be found

372152
strcmp	strlen
although you link to the php manual the strspn function comes from c libraries along with strlen strcpy strcmp etc

372155
arrays	map
either way it s in your best interest to ignore the ordering of the arrays and treat post values as an unordered hash map leaving you with two options

372155
arrays	loops
loops through the whole arrays and continue when seeing the key you wish to ignore

372175
administration	account
logging in as a workstation administrator non-domain account that was originally setup on the machine as a last resort administration account all works fine

372187
default-value	arguments
the code requires you to specify the name but birthday is an optional arguments with some default-value

372188
any	set
in these single-inheritance languages interfaces are typically used if any class could use a particular methods or set of methodss

372197
32-bit	64bit
you need to use regasm.exe to register both the 32-bit and 64bit interfaces i believe you need to run each of the regasm.exe s in

372198
double	int
i have two processes one will query other for data.there will be huge amount of queries in a limited time 10000 per second and data 100 mb will be transferred per second.type of data will be an integral type double int

372202
constructor	object
also to my knowledge you can t call members on a function constructor unless it has been instantiated as a new object

372224
positioning	sidebar
i ve tried putting the header div inside a container div with relative positioning but the padding caused the header div to just overflow 15px over the container still leaving me with the sidebar

372249
varchar2	clob
however once or twice it was necessary to do some deep inspector of the blob and using xml allowed this to happen oracle supports querying xml in varchar2 or clob fields as well as native xml objects

372258
type-safety	generics
generics only provide type-safety at compile-time i was somehow ignoring this in my initial post

372266
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you would put your dal in app_code in a webforms project then i would put it in models in your asp.net-mvc project

372273
paradox	bde
- community site about paradox and bde

372277
content-length	content-type
writing a plain cgi app isn t difficult just output your headers especially content-type and preferably content-length if you know it and then just output the page

372279
google-chrome	firefox
i did a little experiment and it turns out that yes javascript is handled specially by ie but definitely not so by firefox safari opera or google-chrome

372286
exception-handling	try-catch
it s better to have one try-catch with multiple catches to handle each type of exception-handling differently

372291
mbunit	nunit
ok so i keep seeing how vs2008 has this nice unit test display and i can see people running nunit tests within it on dimecasts.net and this article seems to imply that mbunit v3 should have support for using visual-studio s test runner

372302
exception-handling	try-catch
i typically have one catch all try-catch and then i place try-catch blocks around areas of code i know have the potential to throw exception-handling type conversions etc

372310
exception-handling	try-catch
it is also therefore a best practice to only use try-catch around items that could fail and only where you would normally catch the exception-handling for useful processing

372310
exception-handling	try-catch
there are occasions where it s not inherently simple to prevent an exception-handling but it can be caught and used productively using a try-catch - for instance checking for exclusivity on file operations

372333
javascript	dom
javascript and the dom provide the

372333
google-chrome	opera
2016 update accessing the filesystem directly is possible via the filesystem api which is only supported by google-chrome and opera and may end up not being implemented by other browsers with the exception of edge

372339
credentials	account
or b create a specific account that your application can impersonate and then specify the credentials inside the web.config in the identity tag

372356
response	timeout
you could send an alert to connected clients through an ajax mechanism you build into the site that basically sits open and waits for a notification from the server for a period before it timeout and reconnects so essentially the xmlhttpobject is always waiting for a response

372368
perl	c++
it is intended to be a document that will explain why xml-rpc is being used how to use it with different languages we use java php javascript perl c++ and python what all the methods do what they return and why they might cause a fault exception

372378
exception-handling	try-catch
the merit of using multiple try-catch blocks is that it clearly pairs the operation you re attempting with the expected exception-handling

372383
credentials	security
however i cannot for the life of me pass security credentials across to my service

372383
handler	service
but on the server no matter what i do aspnetcompant mode on and off wcf service asmx service custom http handler etc .

372392
entity-framework	data-access
the cms.data is a data-access project that makes the translation from linqtosql or entity-framework model to the pocos model in cms.domain and viceversa

372412
attributes	properties
is there an attributes or properties that i can specify that will use the default endpoint address instead of append a methods name

372423
stderr	stdout
useful because you can feed the command input and get back both stderr and stdout separately

372455
rhino-mocks	typemock
you want to use the interface so as to make the class wrapper swappable during testing using rhino-mocks moq or typemock

372462
forwarding	port
i ve setup a reverse ssh tunnel using putty to allow me to vnc into a home computer without having to enable nat port forwarding

372495
project-management	scrum
i think you probably just need to get a book on scrum try agile project-management with scrum and that ll be a good way to go

372525
linux	osx
i use osx and linux regularly and know this works well

372580
reserved-words	keyword
visual-studio syntax-highlighting colors this word blue as if it were a keyword or reserved-words

372582
postback	ajax
you can also use the javascript xmlhttpobject to write your own ajax calls to the server - once again strictly speaking this is still a postback it just doesn t visibly update the entire page in the user s browser

372613
exception-handling	error-handling
exception-handling were entirely invented so that we can write less error-handling code not more as some other answers suggest

372613
exception-handling	error-handling
exception-handling were invented so that methods don t have to require these checks all over the place and you could have a straight series of code lines that were readable because they weren t obscured by error-handling

372613
any	set
i always have my debugger set to break when any exception-handling is thrown

372615
specifications	w3c
see the w3c html specifications on the input tag for more information

372620
buildpath	libs
supposing that all the additional libs that are required by the project and such are included in the project you downloaded eclipse will figure everything out and set the buildpath up for you

372647
primitive	int
only local primitive variables int chars and references to objects reside in stack

372658
python	c++
for those that have the tools and the know-how it would be very easy to find out which is most efficient c++ or python

372665
copy-constructor	constructor
what i really want to know is according to the c++ standard will foo f 42 directly call the foo int constructor or is the copy-constructor going to be called

372671
any	set
any styles set in the first will be overwrite in the second so say you have this

372679
webforms	asp.net
very clean output model more like classic asp then asp.net webforms

372691
google-chrome	opera
i m trying to submit a form who is rendered in a simplemodal dialog but my submit is never called when i m using ff3 opera google-chrome safari and ie works

372700
boost	stl
i notice that get set is not the c++ way as far as i can tell by looking at boost stl and even reading the writings of some of the top c++ experts

372701
python	c++
if you don t want to use c++ than it can be done in python

372705
constructor	object
the latter has the innate knowledge on how to use the prototype property of the constructor construct an object with proper internal links to the prototype and call the constructor function on it setting up this correctly

372705
constructor	object
because the constructor is just an object we can calculate it

372705
constructor	object
constructor can return a value overriding the newly created object

372705
constructor	object
as you can see x is of a with the prototype and all while y is our naked object we returned from the constructor

372723
arguments	default
and will use the default constructor of foo the one taking no arguments

372723
copy-constructor	temporary
the compiler is allowed to elide optimize out the temporary passed to the copy-constructor of foo in the first case if all semantic restrictions are still safisfied and even if the copy-constructor has side effects

372737
revision	svn
popular revision control systems like cvs and svn use text-based diff tools behind the scenes

372739
log4net-configuration	log4net
then later add the log4net section but delegate to the actual log4net-configuration file elsewhere.

372740
getter	setter
i tend to have getter and setter i just don t tend to call them getx and setx usually i ll do something like this for example

372742
dialog	pop-up
i thought about putting this in a try catch loop but i d rather do a test and then pop-up a dialog saying can t access smtp or something like that

372747
textmate	emacs
does anybody know if there is a color theme like the textmate dawn theme for emacs

372751
webforms	asp.net
specific to asp.net mvc usually smaller rendered page sizes when compared to asp.net webforms

372751
webforms	asp.net
it is an alternative to asp.net webforms which somehow is win forms for the web

372751
webforms	asp.net
asp.net mvc is by many considered to be cleaner and faster than webforms but usually requires a greater knowledge of html javascript.

372757
boost	stl
the stl and boost which was influenced by the stl just chose one design -- it s perfectly fine to have a different design for your classes

372757
python	c++
the reason is primarily that it makes it possible to write parsers to automatically wrap the c++ classes by other interfaces -- activex .net labview python etc..

372760
webforms	asp.net
asp.net mvc constrasts to asp.net webforms where no clear division of responsibilities is expected though good designs often attempt to enforce an mvc-like design

372760
sqldatasource	gridview
for example in webforms you can embed a sqldatasource with selection logic directly in your mark up and tie it to a gridview

372760
webforms	asp.net
asp.net mvc uses rest-based urls rather than the webforms postback model for user interaction

372760
webforms	asp.net
while asp.net webforms is relatively mature and has a number of controls developed for it including third-party controls asp.net mvc is still in beta as of 12 2008 and has many fewer controls available

372760
python	java
for comparison to other languages frameworks see ruby on rails ruby java struts or spring mvc java and django python among others

372787
getter	setter
for most objects you will want to have getter and setter but you should always consider how the object will actually be used when you write them

372787
boost	stl
boost and stl are full of getters and setters they just do not use the names get and set instead they use names like length end reserve capacity etc

372787
getter	setter
your getter and setter should do the same

372797
webforms	asp.net
i am testing the ui of my asp.net webforms app using nunit watin

372800
getter	setter
i only use getter setter when there is no alternative

372810
getter	setter
c did t even have the possibility of getter setter so there was a habit of using direct access to members as in a struct

372815
arrays	loops
trying to make this thing loops through a rather large arrays but if it finds a certain string in it stop entirely and go to the next thing had to take out some proprietary function names but m 300

372821
64bit	x86
note that this behavior can t be observed with double values on common processor as most x86 instructions have a version working with 64bit chunks such as movl

372828
radio	click
i wrote below code to remove checked item from radio grouping in my form by double click

372835
jquery	.post
have you seen this .post about how to implement client-side paging in a gridview control using jquery

372890
cryptography	security
if the security is that important to you that you are considering encryption then you should consider also looking at a security engineering book like applied cryptography by bruce schneier or security engineering by ross anderson - there are a lot of implementation pitfalls

372901
value	field
then you can simply have the epoch as a private static readonly datetime field and it doesn t matter what value you choose as it s all neatly contains within your custom struct

372919
instances	self
called when an attributes lookup has not found the attributes in the usual places it is not an instances attributes nor is it found in the class tree for self

372927
iteration	set
can you set statistics io on set statistics time on and post the display for one iteration

372933
arrays	loops
i then loops through the arrays and append a part of the where-clause like this

372933
append	input
i feel like this is dangerous since i am append user input to my query

372953
append	input
do the correct way use a preparedstatement or whatever your platform uses for injection-safe parameterization append and prepend the to the user input and use that as a parameter

372963
font-size	display
fwiw the right answer is to make your form resize properly adapting to any windows size and not to constrain the user to what looks right on your display at your resolution and your font-size

372968
contains	any
yes this scripting did not contains any whitespaces just encoded characters that sql decoded back and executed

372970
shell	bash
the single quotes are necessary at least if using the bash shell so the shell passes the glob pattern to git unchanged instead of expanding it just like with unix find

372972
lookup	any
why not create a periods lookup table with value 1 - 24 and any other columns that might be relevant like a description of the period or its name then do a left outer join between the periods lookup table and your projections table

372981
convention	standards
when i first started using it i read convention over configuration and uses a standards set of directory

372983
benchmarking	profiling
profiling or benchmarking is probably the only way to be sure anyway

372984
put	get
so you could put up a google map allow a click to set drag a marker and then use the webservice to get the timezone offset

373008
order	add
in particular i needed to add my users to the db_owner database role in order to allow them to assign other new users to fixed database roles

373010
subtract	time
subtract the delta from the initial time you read from the server in step 1 and display the remainder

373017
unique	words
my idea is to process all the words in the subjects stripes all numbers special signs commas etc and save each word in an index table where i have a unique index on the word column

373045
order	add
the user would have to be assigned to the correct roles in order to have the ability to later add other users

373050
constructor	object
in c++ defining a namespace and a set of free functions offers a similar solution without you needing to lock the creation of object by declaring a private constructor or else allowing users to instantiate non-sense object from an empty class

373051
gethashcode	equals
if your list contains objects you ve created overriding gethashcode and equals will help you out

373054
implements	extends
for example do i make a person object that contains the persongateway object and then write wrapper functions that pass calls to the gateway object or do i write the person object to extends the persongateway object and then only implements the specific functions that i need

373057
constructor	object
i read some documentation and created the bulk copy object with the constructor that lets me specify such things

373070
32-bit	64bit
though this has mostly gone away with 64bit i always make sure that awe is enabled if sql is the only thing running on the server and it s 32-bit

373075
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox would be my first two choices

373087
jquery	.post
i use jquery to make an ajax .post request to my server which can return http response with status 302

373089
configuration	environment
it s set to true by default in configuration environment development.rb

373099
pkcs#12	pem
i m having trouble figuring out what pem and pkcs#12 and all these things do differently from each other

373099
pkcs#12	pem
in a pem file the certificates and keys are base64 encoded and placed within some text delimiters a pkcs#12 file uses a binary encoding named asn.1 to structure the file - you can think of asn.1 as a binary form of xml

373099
pkcs#12	pem
openssl works best with pem while most browsers and emailapplications will expect pkcs#12 but you can freely convert between the formats

373101
dependency-management	build-process
one of maven s great strengths is that it does a lot of the build dependency-management without you writing any build scripting or having to even describe your build-process

373106
directory	folder
anyway the virtual directory en fr and es are inside their respective country physical folder

373131
implements	abstract
how about if you placed your write operations in an interface and then implements in explicitly on the abstract base-class

373140
triggers	insert
you can then use an instead of triggers to decompose an insert update on the combined column into the component parts

373183
alias	pwd
alias rm pwd

373208
triggers	insert
alternatively there are ways to create constraints beyond simple foreign keys depending on your database can you write a custom constraint or an insert update triggers to enforce vehicle-tag uniqueness

373210
carbon	cocoa
second carbon or cocoa

373210
carbon	cocoa
i don t think there s a way to do it in cocoa but here s how to do it in carbon in c

373211
command-line	cmd
here is a safer way use ls first to list the files that will be affected then use cmd-line history or history substitution to change the ls to rm and execute the cmd again after you are convinced the correct files will be operated on

373242
python	java
these days the recommendation is to use antlr as the parser generator using any of the antlr languages for the actual compiler java python ruby c# c++

373258
exponential-distribution	poisson
if i take samples according to a poisson process ie the gaps between samples have an exponential-distribution and n of them happen during activity x what s a good estimate for the duration of activity x

373261
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade to the latest 64bit drivers versioning 177.82 release date nov 12 2008 and the result is the exact same

373288
attributes	properties
you could use the newtonsoft library and jsonignore attributes for marking properties of your class you don t want to expose

373288
attributes	properties
there are other libraries with possible different properties ignore attributes name i personally prefer this one since it s very flexible in json converter extensions etc + it can easily serialization anonymous objects

373304
cassini	iis
cassini if you can use iis instead of vs s integrated webserver aka cassini

373327
required	checked
if it would be acceptable to required clients to checked a return-value for minor expected exception-handling do so - this is a judgement call see below

373328
void	main
during development and for debugging it is very useful to run a java class public static void main string argv methods directly from inside eclipse using the run as context menu

373328
command-line	cmd
what i want instead is to check a box somewhere or have a separate menu item run as java application with cmd line and then be prompted for the cmd-line every time with a nice history

373343
defined	declare
not only you can use not-yet initializer variables but you can dereference a null-pointer call functions not defined but only declare and do any other kind of stuff

373351
windows-xp	windows
i need to convert our current development environment from windows-xp 32-bit to windows vista 64-bit

373351
32-bit	64bit
fortunately there is a programfiles environment variables which maps to the proper directory based on the source process 32-bit or 64bit

373351
environment	building
the building environment is called from the command-line c windows system32 cmd.exe

373351
32-bit	x86
on one specific machine namely my dev machine at work it turns out that c windows system32 cmd.exe is actually a 32-bit process so the scripting find the x86 version of the program files directory and everything works great

373351
32-bit	64bit
on every other 64bit machine i can find including my home machine c windows system32 cmd.exe is the 64bit version and the 32-bit version is in c windows syswow64 cmd.exe

373351
32-bit	64bit
i understand now that the 32-bit cmd.exe should be called explicitly if that s what you need and by default you get a 64bit cmd.exe

373353
abstract-class	accessor
if anyone is interested in what i did i finally went for an abstract-class instead of interface and i did hide the methods in the derived class to get the right accessor

373366
teamcity	msbuild
the project builds fine normally however it would seem that teamcity transforms the build file into something it likes some msbuild mutation and when it comes to compiling the code for a part of the solution it balks when it sees an object initializer

373377
type-safety	generics
after the compiler has resolved the type-safety introduced by generics it erases the parameterization from the type

373378
value	field
i don t think you can do what you want with the reason field as its value are defined within a transition

373422
msbuild	nant
where it says by default nant msbuild task uses msbuild 2.0 from microsoft .net 2.0 however you can use msbuild 3.5 from microsoft .net 3.5 if you add the teamcity_dotnet_use_msbuild_v35 property with the value of true to your msbuild task in nant scripting

373423
arrays	map
i think in java you would call that a map or an associative arrays

373426
constructor	object
the are the object s constructor and in this case its an anonymous object

373436
32-bit	64bit
this dll is pure managed however it calls into a mixed dll which may be 32-bit or 64bit

373436
32-bit	64bit
on 64bit however the com+ dllhost.exe process runs as 32-bit and subsequently fails to load the native dll

373451
keyboard	mouse
if the menus are triggers through keyboard action the accelerators should be shown but if triggers by the mouse the accelerators are intentionally not shown

373507
radio-button	selected
there u will find radio-button selected for a share data source by default and a browse button

373521
python	lua
i know this would work pretty well in lua python and javascript.

373530
updating	updates
similarly if updating a progress-bar don t updates it every iteration

373532
rescue	throw
use raise and rescue for exception-handling not throw and catch

373547
silverlight	wpf
not in silverlight in wpf you have a visualbrush which can help with this but silverlight doesn t have one in version 2

373574
value	field
the combination could be used to populate a table with an appropriate set of value for the date time field and then do the loj against that table or more precisely from temp_table left outer join main_table ...

373583
32-bit	64bit
i haven t checked if explorer.exe itself was 32-bit or 64bit on the affected machine maybe this is related.

373586
ref	out
in c# to pass a variables by reference so the called methods can modify the variables s c# provides keyword ref and out

373586
ref	out
a methods can return only one value to its caller via a return statement but can return many value by specifying multiple output ref and or out parameters

373592
xsd	xml
do you want the xml or the xsd

373592
xsd	xml
for the xsd you can generate one using microsoft s xsd generator based off of an xml document

373593
maya	mel
mel maya expression language

373607
reflection	runtime
i personally prefer reflection instead of code generators but i agree that code generators are more flexible and resulting code obviously faster during runtime

373615
checkbox	listbox
in asp.net-mvc how do you distinguish between a checkbox click or a selectbox or listbox change from a human meaning controller modify the model and a checkbox click or a selectbox or listbox change from the controller meaning i m updating the view because the model has changed

373615
checkbox	button
view a gmaps user-interface with markers and polylines plus checkbox and button and vertex details and edge details divs

373615
checkbox	button
javascript functions that update the model when events on the checkbox and button fire

373617
having	select
in fact it would do more work having a select followed by a delete

373617
triggers	insert
if fred has insert an order for the customer but it is not committed john s delete through the triggers won t see it or try to delete it

373620
widget	button
instead i have a main object whose contains the listener and the widget and let it mediate between the different controls button textfields etc

373664
implements	abstract
as an example there s a data provider interface that is implements by an abstract basedataprovider that is in turn extended by a sqldataprovider

373665
google-chrome	safari
i ve tested in google-chrome do i need to test in safari

373669
google-chrome	safari
i have noticed some of the default fonts are smaller on safari then google-chrome also google-chrome uses the v8 javascript engine which has caused some people problems especially if you have a lot of form logic

373672
google-chrome	safari
simply google-chrome and safari have a lot of different features in their implementations and safari is pretty widely used

373674
keyboard	mouse
assuming that the course s software runs on windows there may be some that need to cover the basic of a computer what is a hard drive keyboard mouse monitor cpu motherboard etc

373674
relational-database	schema
now let s introduce the concept of a relational-database and how databases work in general and have projects with real world application have each student take a list of something they have like dvds or cds and put these into a database schema to efficiently store all this data

373679
google-chrome	safari
i ve noticed safari handles asian characters better than google-chrome

373679
google-chrome	safari
also google-chrome and safari rely on the same webkit for rendering pages but their javascript engines are totally different so if you use javascript in your pages you need to check both

373682
google-chrome	safari
yes safari and google-chrome even though they are using webkit the two versions of webkit that are being used are significantly different

373684
google-chrome	safari
safari uses mac fonts but google-chrome would use windows fonts

373684
google-chrome	firefox
i ve noticed that there can sometimes be problems where using a font like arial it shows up fine in firefox google-chrome ie but on safari it can cause a line to wrap because the font is slightly bigger

373689
lookup	any
incidentally be sure to store the claimed identifier as the primary key or equivalent lookup column rather than the user-supplied identifier or any other variation that you might see in the authentication process

373689
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
also to really be secure you need to do a case-sensitive comparison on the path of the url you can be case-insensitive in the host area

373718
export	report
i need to protect the protect the reports pdf and excel with the password while the user is export the report to to excel or pdf

373730
g++	gcc
under gcc g++ have you looked at ccache

373754
lookup	any
however if you have any language dependent data such as lookup tables then you will have to manage two resource sets

373771
sftp	ftp
great interface multiple-file search and replace with regexp support slick ftp sftp etc integration for browsing and editing remote files svn integration etc

373776
google-chrome	firefox
windows firefox or google-chrome all monitor usage statistics and analyze the crash reports are sent to them

373780
freebsd	linux
many versions of sed often provide an option like -r gnu linux and -e freebsd that allows you to use modern-style regular expressions

373794
order	join
i m not sure whether to consider topics like fork join wait notify lock order memory model basic just the basic and so forth to be part of what every reasonably seasoned developer ought to know or whether these are topics that are more for semi-specialists developers who have made a conscious decision to know more than the average developer about concurrent programming

373799
command-line	cmd
we can debate the cmd-line usage currently assuming the cmd name is ngrep

373830
getter	setter
in summary each approach has certain perks that may be useful depending on the scenario field access allows readonly getter no need for setter property access works when nothing special is required from your poco and seems to be the defacto approach

373848
.when	ready
you can then git-rebase that against your mainline .when you are ready to merge those changes

373856
textbox	button
i m hosting a custom editing control in a datagridview which for the record is a textbox and button together in a usercontrol

373856
onkeydown	onkeyup
i have tried onkeypress onkeydown and onkeyup in the datagridviewcell but they never get called

373856
any	set
note this problem applies when editmode is set to any variation of editonkeystroke

373865
children	nodes
ideally i would like to have a nodes class which has a property children which returns the right list

373896
value	field
in your case that may be the result of the query s properties sheet including a set unique value to yes which forces comparison of memo fields triggers the truncation or the format property of the field forcing display in uppercase or lower case

373896
value	field
do you have any other non-memo field with lengthy value you could try to selected just to see if it also gets truncated

373904
operators	keyword
actually i find the c++ syntax with minimal keyword curly-braces and rich set of symbolic operators serves to not distract from or crowd out the important stuff my variables my type defs my methods

373905
precompiled-headers	stdafx.h
you can check off the use precompiled-headers in project properties or when creating the project and you won t need stdafx.h anymore

373922
accumulate	aggregate
so there is a tendency for codeless or mouse-based development systems to gradually accumulate features that correspond to the primitive of programming languages something similar to function calls for reuse of pieces of a design references to parameters within functions things that loop conditional branching things that aggregate several actions into a single action things that do arithmetic or string operations etc

373923
perl	lua
it is also found in most scripting languages perl python lua etc

373923
pascal	ada
this language family includes pascal and its descendants in the modula ada and clu families

373923
haskell	scheme
in languages where lambda is common such as haskell ml caml and scheme a great deal of effort has been expended making allocation blindingly fast

373923
haskell	scheme
especially in ml caml scheme haskell even anonymous functions are dirt cheap ---use lots of them

373935
stax	sax
stax this is in the middle of the path between sax and dom

373935
versioning	upgrade
forget about proprietary apis such as jdom or apache ones apache xerces xmlserializer because will tie you to a specific implementation that can evolve in time or lose backwards compatibility which will make you change your code in the future when you want to upgrade to a new versioning of jdom or whatever parsing you use

373948
precompiled-headers	stdafx.h
stdafx.h is one way of having visual-studio do precompiled-headers

host	root
the reason i ask is if a client wants to host the site we ve writen under a virtual directory the site usually has to have it s file references changed - even down to url ...image path in css files because we usually develop the site as if it s a root application - sometimes the client doesn t know where they re going to host it until the day before drop-date

374310
solaris	linux
if you are using any solaris only external library you will have to locate an equivalent in linux and write a wrapper so that the rest of the application does not need to know what implementation is being used

374765
rhino-mocks	typemock
check out typemock or rhino-mocks for something that will help you do this

so my advice is to avoid getter setter unless the project you are working on already uses them because you can always change your mind later and make properties read-only write-only or whatever without modifying the interface to your class

375046
base-class	inherited
private inherited is useful when you want something to have the behaviour of the base-class and then be able to override that functionality but you don t want the whole world to be aware of it and use it

375046
base-class	inherited
protected inherited is especially useful when you have a base-class that derives useful functionality from another class but you only want its derived classes to be able to use it

375049

375177
listbox	textbox
to get the contents of any textbox or listbox control all we need is it s windows handle

375177
callback	methods
this methods takes in a callback methods which it calls with the handle of every child control it finds for the specified parent

375177
textbox	button
for eg. if we call this method with the handle of the calculator windows it will call the callback method with the handle of the textbox control and then again with the handles of each of the button on the calculator windows and so on

375177
callback	methods
since we are only interested in the handle of the textbox control we can check the class of the windows in the callback methods

sendmessage	message
you can read in the contents of a control by using the win32 sendmessage function and using it to pass the wm_gettext message to the target control

375177
textbox	button
this method will work for a textbox button or static control

375177
sendmessage	message
to get the contents of a listbox we need to first use sendmessage with the lb_getcount message to get the count of list items

375254
radio-button	selected
the problem is with the radio-button in the first row keeping its selected value

375254
radio-button	selected

375301
silverlight	wpf
i ve heard that the mvvm pattern originated by the wpf development community can also help with keeping silverlight controls blendable

375302
hide	show
you could add some javascript in the user-controls to test whether window.opener is non-null and on that basis hide or show the close page user-interface

375307
http-referer	referrer
the request for the child windows will probably have an http-referer referrer header that points to the parent page

order	add
for example suppose the user-interface issues a request to add a line to a purchase order and the business rules determine that you need an authentication code for some reason

375472
dialog	pop-up
in a non-layered app you d just pop-up a dialog and get what you need

375482
contains	elements
ensuring that the contains elements haslayout fixes the vast majority of my problems

375525
triggers	insert
the problem is that when i drag something inside the same list it triggers the drop event and that item is added to the end of the list wich is correct if the item is dropped in another list but not in the same when i drop it in the same list i want to insert it in that position it works if i disable the drop event

375532

you don t pop-up a new dialog

375548
web-services	api
the api will always be accessed remotely as a service most probably via web-services or wcf

375548
web-services	api
using web-services technology means that an xml based api will not need to change as new car types are added

375548
web-services	api
if we used an object based api then adding a new type would require a new query method defining the possible derived types that could be returned see extending web-services

375559
json	xml
if you don t do heavy data-exchange with a server amf might be overkill and json xml or your own format will suffice more than enough

375564
linked-list	hashmap
as for data structures - learn which one is good for whatever situation you envision sets sorted and unsorted lists arraylist linked-list maps hashmap treemap

375568
contains	any
depending on your application you may also want to consider the possibility that your input does not contains any tags

375597
xsd	xml
exposing the xml and providing an xsd is self explanatory when it comes to data

375603
tapestry	spring
the biggest issue that we had when using joda time was with integration with spring and tapestry as they both wanted to use the built-in date and time

375603
getter-setter	setter
we were constantly writing wrappers in getters setter for date and time either we would store it as joda time and one set of getters setter passed it through and the other would convert on the fly and some classes stored it internally as a java date time and the joda getter-setter had to switching it on the fly

375605
jena	jess
i need to keep a couple of jena models ontmodels specifically synchronized across a socket and i d like to do this one change at a time for various reasons -- one being that each statement added or removed from the ontmodels is also adapting a jess rule base.

375680
attributes	properties
i tried adding the bindable and localizable false attributes to the properties but that didn t seem to help

375682
any	set
any solution can work what you really need is a set of tests which will guarantee that basic operation like insert selected update and delete works

375683
boost	stl
does the stl or std library or even boost have any cases where certain includes must come in a certain order

375708
32-bit	64bit
more than likely the division limitation stems from the fact that you re compiling for 32-bit instead of 64bit

375708
64bit	x86
i don t recall seeing an integer division instruction that handles 64bit for x86

375708

can the two components use each other as if they were running within the same jvm via local method calls and how does osgi manage the marshalling of data across a network do you have to use serialization for example

375726
arrays	loops
therefore the only way i was able to access specific placemarks was to loops through the arrays and match the markers with my data based upon the coordinates

375734
schematron	relaxng
additionally it must satisfy a dtd or a schema an xml schema a relaxng schema schematron or other constraints to be valid

375739
superclass	subclass
the workaround has been that you have to copy the implementation for the get methods into the subclass even if it does nothing differently from the superclass

375743
hostname	proxy
tomcat automagically gets the served hostname protocol and port with mod_proxy you have to configure the fact that it s proxy in the connector see the options proxyname and proxyport

375765
filtering	grouping
i have an application that uses datatables to perform grouping filtering and aggregation of data

375765
filtering	grouping
so my question is if linq can be used to perform the grouping filtering and aggregation of my data and if it can is the performance comparable to datatables or should i just hunker down and write my own algorithms to do it

375768
put	get
if i put a dblink in the name of the queue in the dequeue options i get an error

375770

375784
quirks-mode	doctype
i ve found that at least in ie7 the doctype i ve specified causes it to use standards mode ie6 but if i take the doctype out it goes into quirks-mode ie5 i find the mode by using debugbar v5.1.1

375786
python	perl
i stole the idea of __next__ from python and applied it to perl

in your button click handler you would need to 1 scroll the viewer and 2 check the new value of the horizontaloffset to see if you need to hide or show either of the button

375795
sql-server	firebird
why not use a local database like sql-server ce or firebird embedded

nswindowcontroller and nsviewcontroller too has some special nib-handling code so that it retains all the top-level objects in its nib when it loads so that they ll stick around as long as it does

375868
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox google-chrome and safari but not in ie

375883
virtual-machine	vmware
the vmware fusion virtual-machine running under os x is seat of the pants significantly faster than the others

375887
directory	folder
what i m trying to do is keep the .dll files i want my website to use in a higher level directory then the folder i have set as the web root in iis

375917
svnadmin	dump
you can use svn-merge-repos.pl or you can merge several repository dump with svndumptool merge and then load the resulting dump with svnadmin load --ignore-uuid

375926
implements	sealed
i would make the class sealed possibly implements an interface which just has the value property

375930
vtune	gprof
a few other buzzwords if gprof does not do the job for you valgrind intel vtune sun dtrace

375932
filtering	grouping
you d be better off letting your database handle grouping filtering and aggregation

375935
nested	order
the nested set model encodes both parentage and sort order by enumerating all of the nodes using a preorder based numbering system

375948
nlb	iis
iis has convenient pooling via a nlb such as f5 but has the app-pool recycle issue and the lag caused by iis spawning on first demand the app-pool domain etc in the first place

375996
double	int
i have two complex objects with string int double list and other home made data type objects of the same type

375996
icomparable	equals
note the object doesn t implement equals i have no control on that and doesn t implement icomparable

375999
hide	show
i d put the edit form in a user-controls and show hide it a la lightbox style

376003
sequences	subset
given a value v a set size l and a sequences of numbers 1 n s how many size l subset of s sum to less than v

376006
directory	folder
can i use a virtual directory for my bin folder

376014
exception-handling	try-catch
but steven is correct every root methods must have a try-catch block surrounding any code that could throw an exception-handling your service should never have an unhandled exception-handling

376017
ado	jet
ado and the microsoft ole db provider for jet 4.0

376020
icomparable	equals
what i d do is write a class that implements icomparable and has a ctor that takes an object of your desired class and include your equals function

376021
radio-button	button
the other radio-button clears and the click event on the button you clicked on fires

376023
sequences	subset
discard the rest of the sequences because those items can never be a part of a valid subset anyway

376029
updating	updates
interestingly it is defined for updates of t1_appnt_event but not for the other column so i think someone could break the rule by updating the second column unless there is a separate triggers for that column

376038
selected	button
on the selected source tables and views screen i check the datasheet i m using selected the destination then click the edit... button

376039
midl	idl
when i define an interface in idl which does not derive from anything the midl precompiler warns as such visual-c++ 2008

376039
midl	idl
i have been looking at the d3d10 headers recently and d3d10.h obviously has been generated using idl midl adds a comment to this effect

376041
set-union	set
you could also potentially use the partial order of equivalence classes and set inclusion when questions a and b have the exact same set of tags up to reordering they re equal set-union set difference and set intersection then define a partial order for and comparisons

376051
solaris	linux
number one reason is that fonts are rendered differently on windows mac linux solaris etc

376053
revision	updates
updates the above stumbler code is for 1.x revision iphone os sdk

376059
sigaction	signals
signals can be dangerous on some oses and is deprecated on linux in favor of sigaction

376059
sigaction	signals
signals versus sigaction

376065
google-chrome	safari
hopefully it ll render ok in google-chrome and safari

376069
google-chrome	firefox
test in one major non-ie browser firefox or google-chrome would be my suggestion

376071
directory	folder
my windows service is creating a directory on a shared folder and i am getting a error

376085
any	set
any set of size k that sums to v either doesn t use s i so it s counted in num v k i-1 or it uses s i which means that the rest of the subset has k-1 elements uses only the first i-1 numbers in the sequence and sums to v-s i . finally count num v l |s| for each v less than v

376090
dictionary	arrays
i could always store a separate arrays of the keys but that seems kind of kludgey because i d always have to update the keys of the dictionary as well as the values of the arrays and make sure they always correspond

376092
javascript	dom
i was adding this div to the dom through javascript so i didn t need to worry about the z-index

376095
selected	cell
to selected a particular cell you can reference them with an index

376121
hide	show
i wan t to hide show menuitems in a contextmenu using some propery of databound object

376127
oracle-service-bus	osb
i have limited knowledge of java-based technologies and for business enforced reasons i may need to decide whether weblogic integration wli or oracle-service-bus osb is the better choice for integration a small number of standalone systemd together

376127
business-process	integration
both products seem capable of similar tasks though in one case wli the integration is more technically driven where the other osb is more business-process driven

376132
persistence	hibernate
we re in the design phase right now and i would like to know whether or not spring s persistence context entity manager we re going to use hibernate can commit from subflows

376133
conditional	operators
you can use your clipping code to detect this conditional and report it to the user operators equivalent of red clip light on a mixer...

376136
stdout	stdio
stdout is defined in stdio

376169
python	perl
so you could write cgi in perl python c or whatever

376169
python	php
i m not sure why you are against ror and php but you may also want to take a look at some of the python web frameworks 1 such as turbogears django zope etc

376172
fflush	stdout
you might not fflush the original stdout properly - losing information

376185
value	field
practice suggests to use an id in the value field

376190
firefox	opera
my approach is to code for firefox opera and the other non microsoft browsers

376192
debian	linux
i am running openoffice 2.4 on debian linux

376197
contains	elements
jeromy is correct the difference is in the li contains the selected and the surrounding elements considering you are floating the li s

376207
duplicates	contains
collect all entries contains any one of the five tags no duplicates

376211
google-chrome	safari
once your page is mostly done verify that it still looks good in safari and google-chrome also both highly-compliant browsers so you shouldn t have too much trouble then start fixing it for ie both 6 and 7

376211
pixels	line
trying to get all browsers to line up down to the pixels is an exercise in frustration and often futility

376218
openoffice.org	uno
why not look at using python-uno to load the document into openoffice.org and manipulate it using the uno interface

376220
primitive	int
this library contains collections that store the underlying objects int in your case as a primitive arrays int instead of an object arrays

376221
python	java
i ve looked at xlwt and xlrd for python as well as jexcelapi and poi-hssf for java

376227
malloc	free
is probrably using the new allocated memory but if it isn t malloc could be failing with out you knowing untill it is derefrenced with the free

376236
entity-framework	ado.net
also if i use ado.net entity-framework to implement my dal will modeling tables that have over 40 columns and doing crud operations be a performance issue to it

376249
subclassing	accessor
it avoids subclassing nsdictionary and if you are careful with writing accessor it shouldn t be too hard to keep synchronized

376264
business-process	bpm
if your applications are more user oriented and you re binding them together to create a new flow a business-process then the right tool would be oracle bpm

376281
perl	awk
if you want you could easily snip the cleartool diff crud off with a little awk or cut or perl or your poison of choice

376287
header-files	stdafx.h
this is because both of these header-files include stdafx.h and stdafx.h includes subform.h before frmmain.h

376296
element	dynamic
it seems that the .vcproj attribute that switches between static and dynamic libraries the configurationtype attribute of the configuration element isn t overrideable by the .vsprops file

376316
versioning	upgrade
if it shows 3 then it has been upgrade to 1.5 that s the versioning of the updated fielsystem

376319
sql-server	oracle
whether or not oracle or sql-server will accept it anyway is something you can check for yourself

376330
margins	padding
padding 0 in undo.css to reset the margins and padding but never as a pseudo selector

376331
document	element
it s not an xml document - there needs to be at least one and at most one root element

376333
arguments	undefined
additionally you are modifying pa multiple times without intervening sequence points which invokes undefined behavior the comma operator introduces a sequence point but the commas delimiting the function arguments do not

376348
constructor	object
this is happening because the calls happen very close to each other during the same milli-second then the random constructor will seed the random object with the same value it uses date time by default

376357
margins	padding
the only reason i use is to remove all padding and margins i actually always do this its the first css statement i write down always

376369
localization	translation
can i with asp.net resources localization translation strings to depend on one or other the english grammar in a easy way like i pass number 1 in my translation it return you have one car or with 0 2 and higher you have n cars

376373
spaces	output
to tackle the problem i first transform the xml to add carriage returns and white spaces and then use a pre tag to output the xml

376394
python	perl
i would use template toolkit unfortunately it is currently only implemented in perl and python

376409
binary-tree	nodes
my answer would be that no it s not an appropriate place to use shared_ptr as the use of shared_ptr implies that the object is actually shared - however a nodes in a binary-tree is not ever shared

376415
contains	set
the only gotcha to all of this is if the result set to work with contains a lot of joins or even nested joins

376416
python	ruby
i m at the point now that i feel like loose xaml is not a second class citizen as i can handle events write value converters run python ruby jscript to do things like connect to sql server

376419
swing	awt
this is not true for graphics swing awt however which tend to be unpredictable and not necessarily reproducible across different platforms

376427
getter	setter
ie even if the controllers class implements the required functionality of setting up connectivities the users can still access setter getter functions in the the dto directly to set them up themselves.

376432
value	field
only change the value of that field when you the developer know that there has been a compatibility-killing change to your code

376433
python	tcl
it has out of the box support for the javascript lua python tcl and vbscript languages

376433
macros	let
you can write the macros by hand or you can also let zeus write them for you

376441
clisp	sbcl
on windows i might get clisp if sbcl gives any trouble

376444
asp.net-mvc	webforms
with asp.net-mvc you can have multiple forms unlike in webforms

376462
ienumerator	ienumerable
however with just ienumerable ienumerator there is no way to know for sure wether or not there are more if you use foreach

376463
iteration	elements
if you really need to know that a particular iteration is the last you could identify the last elements in advance and then take different action when you encounter that elements

376474
textbox	button
the page comprises a textbox to enter the customer s insurance number a button to send the number for checking and a frame in which the results appear

376551
command-line	cmd
i m trying to checkout a repository via cmd-line the svn co cmd using the svn+ssh protocol

376555
any	set
as has already been stressed though your choice of fonts depends a lot on the exact set of languages you re targetting usually you can be confident that any commercial font covers at least all the languages of western europe english french german italian spanish portuguese etc.

376587
perl	c++
concurrency in perl on an aix box is not the same game as concurrency in a c++ winforms app

376609
export	report
i need to be able to export trac tickets from a report or custom query to excel including the ticket description

376610
shell	bash
it s very common to wrap jar file shell bash script to setup arguments and enviroment variables before starting the jvm

376632
stax	sax
in addition to sax and dom there is stax parsing available using xmlstreamreader which is an xml pull parsing

376653
prolog	lisp
in paip chapter 11 norvig solves the zebra puzzle using a prolog embedded in lisp

376669
revision	svn
so svn knows which revision you ve merged into a branch and from where

376670
attributes	properties
as far as setting it in the authentication attributes the only idea that i have is to set it to the empty string in the attributes definition then use reflection on the controller s type to get and modify the customattributes properties corresponding to the authenticationattributes the one whose type is authenticationattributes for each methods you care about

376672
if-statement	for-loop
his code should run pretty fast it would most likely translated to a cmov in x86 so the if-statement inside the for-loop won t cost that much anyways

376673
base-class	inherited
if you have an interface then use the abstract base-class only where the inherited chain is sensible

376676
connect	inet
the last gui programming i have done was with visual basic which include objects like winsock and inet to easily connect to the internet and retrieve the source from webpages

376677
contains	lookup
now i m debating with myself whether i have to create a lookup table for example civil status data which can only contains fixed values like single married separated widow widower

376678
arrays	loops
a loops won t work if the inputs aren t a list arrays per the question

376695
globalization	localization
this will make other things easier in the future like localization globalization

376698
default	reset
but i don t understand how to use a default configuration file to read at first time i run my application or in case if application settings needs reset

376716
vba	vb6
classical visual basic vb6 vba etc. the same program could be written in vb and run with identical results and comparable speed either compiled or interpreted

376717
traffic	packets
i understand that any sort of packets inspector would still block my non-http traffic but if that is the case i m sure the firewall wouldn t have any other open outgoing ports anyway

376717
webserver	host
if the server already has a webserver on port 80 is it possible to use some sort of virtual host listening on port 80 mydomain.com 80 and myapp.mydomain.com 80 on the same machine

376721
order	add
for example should it be possible to add the same instance of orderline to two different order

376721
order	add
so given that you ll want to be able to validate whether an orderline should be added to the order you may indeed want to surface the lines property as only an and provide add orderline and remove orderline methods which can handle that validation

376722
python	perl
it s a must for symfony but you can really see it help automate your work with a language your already familiar with - no need for learning python perl etc

376725
google-chrome	firefox
i m not encountering this on flock which is a firefox variant nor on google-chrome ie

376737
linux	unix
lastly if your application is running on a unix linux variant port 80 will require root privileges

376738
constructor	object
i m writing a php application with testability in mind so my classes always ask in their constructor for the collaborator object they depend on in respect to the dependency injection pattern

376738
arguments	default
what i want to achieve though is to be able to instantiate a class with null value passed to its constructor arguments in order to triggers a fallback mechanism which instantiates a default implementation class for each collaborator

376738
default-value	arguments
should i use an ioc container instead or is there another way of giving object-type arguments a default-value

376743
rewrite	rule
as you can see the rewrite rule itself is very simple

376757
python	php
for instance i have since learned that sending php code through a python module one that allows django to serve php files content changes a great deal about what is accessible to the script and what is not

376788
margins	padding
margins padding height and width will be your friends sometimes you need to specify these value to see the same thing on many browsers

376798
constructor	private
shouldn t the initialization take place in a static initialization block or in a private constructor

376828
interpreter	runtime
in some interpreter languages many fundamental operations are so expensive that the additional overhead of checking types at runtime doesn t matter

376828
strong-typing	types
strong-typing generally means that there are no loopholes in the types system whereas weak typing means the types system can be subverted invalidating any guarantees

376828
static-typing	typechecking
to see the difference think of c the language is typechecking at compile time static-typing but there are plenty of loopholes

376830
solaris	linux
on windows and linux solaris xmlstarlet

376858
perl	awk
i can t live without it and it is gradually displacing my sh ksh awk and perl scripts.

376871
textmate	emacs
custom textmate bundle snippets textmate s bundle editor is superb even though textmate lacks some important vi and emacs capabilities like split buffers

376874
selection	highlight
i am not able to get the selection object s start and end offsets in opera v9.50 when the selection is collapsed just point and click instead of highlight text

376874
firefox	opera
this is my simple test code which works in firefox and safari but does not work in opera

376878
spring	guice
you may consider looking into dependency injection di frameworks like spring or guice these will let you inject the appropriate value directly into the places you need to use them instead of going through the indirection of the additional class

376892
macros	basic
my faves are notepad++ which i use for everything that s not wrapped in a visual-studio project and a small macros in visual-studio that turns a c# variable declaration into a basic property

376901
typedef	struct
any typedef involving distinct struct will work

376922
python	ruby
we plan to have really deep support for python much in the style of our ruby support

376922
python	ruby
one of the things which really helped in our ruby work was the feedback from our early adopters so if you try python and have issues with it please let us know so we can fix it

376925
contains	set
the easiest way to do what you want is to make a subclass of nsmutabledictionary that contains its own nsmutabledictionary that it manipulates and an nsmutablearray to store an ordered set of keys

376925
dictionary	arrays
all of your method implementations in the 10 methods above would then either go directly through your hosted dictionary or your ordered key arrays

376933
contains	elements
contains 1 the first elements of the arrays because the parentheses in the provide an arrays context but there s only space for one value in

376933
contains	elements
and contains 5 because it is a scalar context and arrays evaluates to the number of elements in the arrays in a scalar context

376987
required	checked
edit2 in the header you can checked for the macros __cplusplus and use that to set for c++ and other languages respectively because c++ will required extern c declarations and other languages will probably complain about them

376993
for-loop	arrays
if you want the value arrays to be zero-based change the for-loop to be 0 to n-1

377037
perl	ruby
specifically talking about popular scripting languages why would one choose to use ruby over python or perl or vice-versa

377039
contains	any
this works fine for all but one scenario - when i use the allwordsmatcher object type that will look for dataitem objects contains all words being searched for as opposed to any words exact phrase or regular expression for instance

377043
python	ruby
there aren t huge differences between ruby and python - both are object oriented languages with more similarities than differences really

377043
python	ruby
if you need to interact with some existing infrastructure then it may matter a great deal - for example if you need to work with some rails related infrastructure then you ll probably want to go with ruby if it s django then you ll want python

377049
g++	gcc
instead of having xcode use gcc to build .c and .m files tell it to use g++ and your issues will be resolved

377065
updating	updates
the advantage you will have from doing it this way is that when you update your code and edit the file in your project directory and recreate an updates sis file on updating the sis on the device the versioning file will automatically get replaced with the current one

377072
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

377079
iteration	elements
at the next iteration through the loop you ll get an indexerror exception-handling because a is only two elements long

377081
python	ruby
i just came across this comparison b w ruby and python which is in terms of performance and memory management

377100
webforms	asp.net
does this compatible with asp.net mvc or its only compatible with asp.net webforms

377152
stderr	stdout
one of the problems is that unison expects the password prompt to print to stderr but plink prints it to stdout and causes unison to be confused so i thought well should be simple enough hack my thru plink s code and make it print the prompt to stdout

377155
haskell	c++
so this works for a list of any element type - it s what would be called a function template in c++ or a polymorphic function in haskell not the same as a polymorphic class in c++

377158
onmousedown	onmouseup
if you set the mouse cursor in the onmousedown and reset it in the onmouseup anything works fine

377176
selected	listbox
so whenever an item in the listbox is selected set the context menu of the listbox according to the selected item

377181
installation	environment
the windows managed application runs without problem on both 32 and 64 bit environment but i need to create different installation that uses the 64 or the 32 scilexer.dll

377187
required	checked
i currently have code in my applicationcontroller to checked if a user is logged in and has the required access to perform a given action the tests take place in a before_filter

377191
32-bit	64bit
the 32-bit in syswow64 and the 64bit in the real system32

377219
postgresql	mysql
are there tools to convert it to another database format mysql postgresql or even gadfly

377221
smalltalk	lisp
or something lisp or smalltalk - was once the next big thing but it probably never will be again but still a language that changed signficantly my approach to programming in other languages

377240
python	ruby
your criteria fairly closely matches python and ruby they both have a growing market base in web development and are fully capable of producing desktop applications as well

377240
python	ruby
whilst they are fairly closely matched python has a slightly larger library of re-usable code modules whilst ruby s strength leans more to it s well-established frameworks

377241
groovy	java
if you are expert in java you will probably really enjoy groovy

377241
groovy	java
what is really nice about it is you can mix and match groovy classes and java classes

377241
groovy	java
so if you find yourself forgetting the groovy syntax you can just drop into java

377262
scala	ocaml
go for a different paradigm functionnal lisp haskell ocaml erlang scala etc

377265
malloc	free
use new and delete over malloc and free

377293
directory	folder
this tells git-daemon to serve up all projects inside the current directory which i assume is the project directory containing the .git folder

377299
attributes	properties
also i had to make the heading a properties i set as an attributes on the modalpopup control

377303
snmp	mib
does anybody know a good tool to assist in the development of an snmp mib with correct formatting and syntax

377332
order	add
and things are getting even more mysterious when you keep the unique constraint and add a 3rd column any type to this table since the result of a selected is then sorted according to the natural order

377336
constructor	object
instead of forcing clients to use a factory perhaps you can simply inject object into their constructor sidestepping the need for a factory

377353
convention	standards
oh yes i m the coding standards police i just wrote a simple scripting to periodically check and fix the code my coding standards is simple enough to implement that. i hope people will get the message after seeing all these coding convention cleanups messages

377393
radio-button	selected
each item has a radio-button associated with it making it possible for the user to selected one of the items created by the repeater

377393
radio-button	selected
the radio-button has the clever attribute groupname used to set a common name so they get grouping together and thus should be dependant so i can only selected one at a time

377393
radiobuttonlist	databound
since i use a repeater could have been a listview or any other templated databound control i can t use the radiobuttonlist

377473
buffering	streaming
if possible have your code working with streaming that will be buffering in memory for the unit tests and filestream in the production code

377477
profiling	debugging
with adobe flex builder 3 im trying to do some profiling on swf files but the problem is that i can only do this on debugging swfs

377486
icollection	ienumerable
i assume this is because of the special treatment that xmlserializer gives icollection and ienumerable objects

377497
rollback	commit
now session 2 s triggers must wait for session 1 to commit or rollback before it performs the check

377506
double	int
for the third invocation of mymethod using objd why is the double overload being used when i am actually passing it an int

377519
double	int
i d guess that when calling mymethod 5 5 could be a double or an int as well and double has higher priority

377520
scons	cmake
you can generate .vsproj files with cmake or scons or similar cross platform build system

377533
base-class	subclass
there is a precedence issue - the overridden methods is defined in the base-class so for best methods purposes the overload even with an implicit-cast is preferable since it is defined in the most-specific type the subclass

377556
python	java
i m programming a simple network chat with a python server and a java client

377563
rollback	commit
either commit or rollback

377573
value	field
the trick is to use reflection to poke value in as a way to get access to the non-public field and methods

377577
python	java
it is compatible accross many languages python and java included and it is human readable

377577
json	xml
you may have a look at the following page comparing xml json and yaml

377592
sequences	unique
one thing to consider is using two tables - one table that holds the unique urls and another that stores the click information and either using a unique sequences number to join them or the url since it is unique

377593
javafx	swing
javafx is now out and there are promises that swing will improve along with javafx

377607
default	reset
default are specified in the via the .kcfg xml rather than hardcoded in a few places of your app and you have a setdefault methods to reset all value

377616
order	join
if you want to modularise your code you might want to modularise your db schema - this is the customers area this is the order area and this is the products area and use join link tables between them even if they re 1 n relations and maybe duplicates the important information duplicates the product name code price into your order_details table

377628
authentication	login
this page should also redirect the user to the wordpress login screen if they re not already logged in with the appropriate level of authentication

377636
mouseover	mouseout
ive got the problem that i dont know how to stop my function with mouseover and restart it with mouseout

377644
message	alert
is there some way i can show custom exception-handling messages as an alert in my jquery ajax error message

377645
compact-framework	.net
i strongly recommend that you use .net compact-framework for development and not c++ mfc

377646
domdocument	domxpath
i would suggest that you use domdocument and domxpath rather than simplexml

377648
groovy	java
grails groovy on rails but it runs on the jvm and can use java libs

377650
versioning	upgrade
my approach to this is to use sql patch files files contains the sql statements to upgrade the db schema data with a versioning number at the start of the filename

377650
any	set
this approach can be extended to include the ability to set up a new database based on a full dump file and then applying any necessary patches to it to upgrade it as well

377664
value	field
it appears that ob 7 treats lookups using differently from those using like if you have two value a and a and make a query with where f a then it finds only the a field not the a field

377666
versioning	upgrade
my approach to this is to use sql patch files files contains the sql statements to upgrade the db schema data with a versioning number at the start of the filename

377671
mobile-devices	blackberry
the only time you should be optimizing the bytecode instead of just your algorithm is when you are targeting mobile-devices such as the blackberry where the jvm for that platform is not powerful enough to optimize code at runtime and just executes the bytecode

377679
fadeout	fadein
i m not sure exactly what you want to happen with regards to your fadein and fadeout effects in your fadeengine however i can give you two pieces of advice

377686
endpoint	uri
wsdualhttpbinding requires that the client has a public uri that provides a callback endpoint for the service which is unfortunately not the case here source

377691
button	popup
i have a button i need to display a popup in javascript

377709
value	field
i want to be able to check the value inserted before it is written into the table - in this particular case it is an integer field where the data must conform to a rule

377717
32-bit	64bit
a is a pointer which depending on the machine architecture has a specific size 4 bytes on 32-bit systems and 8 bytes on 64bit machines

377722
delphi	c++
i read mark nelson s article about permutations in c++ with the stl function next_perm very interesting and useful after that i wrote one class method to get the next permutation in delphi since that is the tool i presently use most

377723
contains	any
i would only add that any optimization won t make a hoot of difference unless it is in code where the program counter actually spends much time like in tight loops that don t contains function calls such as comparing strings

377784
contains	any
when i then create a new project console application that references the utilities.dll assembly that contains the extension methods i do not need to add a reference to system.web.dll to the new project if it does not use the extension methods that extends any class in the system.web.dll assembly for example system.web.ui.control

377788
pointers	stack
basically compilers allocate memory on stack for the local variables of a methods just once at the start of the methods by adjusting stack pointers and release it at the end of methods again by adjusting stack pointers assuming it s not c++ or it doesn t have any destructors to be called

377793
protected	public
in order to compile it needs to be able to resolve everything in the public protected api

377794
firefox	safari
it will work fine in safari but not firefox

377794
firefox	safari
however it now stops working on both safari and firefox

377798
value	field
i have a field that must either contains a unique value or a null value

377798
triggers	insert
i think i should be enforcing this with either a check constraint or a triggers for insert update

377843
instances	private
now i went with a private instances that gets instantiated at methods level

377849
value	field
in order to enforce this constraint you ll need a function that counts the number of occurrences of the field value

377868
imultivalueconverter	ivalueconverter
note for this solution to work you also need to modify your converter to implements imultivalueconverter instead of ivalueconverter

377872
document	element
now if i attach this element to the document body

377879
any	set
if using mssql 2000 you ll need to set arithabort on right before any insert update or delete is performed on the table

377893
pixels	line
something along these line should do the trick modify the image type dimensions and pixels arrays as appropriate

377895
for-loop	loops
in both cases the type info for the object o is determined at compile time.in the second instance o is seen as being global to the for-loops and in the first instance the clever java compiler knows that o will have to be available for as long as the loops lasts and hence will optimise the code in such a way that there wont be any respecification of o s type in each iteration

377898
versioning	upgrade
see if you can upgrade the driver to a new versioning

377907
python	java
it supports java and c# on top of python

377920
associations	model
since i have the following associations in my model

377934
unique	words
one words of caution - if you ever selected into a temp-table table-var for processing you need to use varbinary 8 not timestamp in the temp table - otherwise your temp table will get its own unique timestamps upon update

377950
unsigned	integer
typecast your signed integer to unsigned to halve the number of branches

377958
compile-time-constant	constants
any expression involving a non-compile-time-constants is not a compile-time-constants although javac may do constants folding within the compilation unit

377974
sql-server	oracle
since getting access to said oracle is a real pain mainly a bureaucratic obstacle more than anything else we re just planning on linking it to our sql-server and using the link to access data as we need it

377983
checkbox	button
that way if you decide to change to radio button or checkbox or a command-line interface later on only your user-interface code will change and not the database tables.

377985
windows-server	windows
the .net send command also has options to send by windows domain or to specific users by name regardless of where they are logged in or to every system that is connected to a particular windows-server

378001
substitution	replace
uses two parameters to replace to do the substitution

378009
vbscript	vb6
since the top answer here is in vb6 i thought i d add one here in vbscript since that s what the question is asking for -

378031
json	xml
passing and parsing xml instead of json or html where appropriate

378048
pycairo	cairo
i m using cairo + pycairo for this and it works well

378050
sql-server	oracle
also sql-server doesn t really know anything about the indexes or statistics or cache kept by the oracle server

378050
sql-server	oracle
therefore the oracle server can probably do a much more efficient job with the join than the sql-server can

378056
selected	listbox
the example below selected the item in the listbox based on a right mouse click and then customizes a context menu stripes based on the item the user right-clicked on

378057
onmousemove	keydown
i get events like onmousemove onlbuttondown up dblclk but i don t get events like keyup keydown or mousewheel

378069
double-quotes	single-quotes
also on windows systemd .bat file instead of shell scripting the single-quotes need to be double-quotes and the backslashes need to be carets or it all comes crashing down

378091
asp.net-mvc	webforms
can anyone recommend a good tutorial on more advanced asp.net-mvc usage which will help me understand how to move away from webforms

378097
highlight	selected
i also want to stop the treeview from highlight the top level nodes if the user selected them stop the treeview from changing the background-color of the node and selected it

378105
web-config	app-config
i also found this page how to get intellisense for web-config and app-config in visual-studio .net but it says to remove the xmlns attributes before running the application

378113
internet-explorer	firefox
this is actually a browser hack some browsers will match it and some won t internet-explorer matches firefox doesn t not sure about others

378137
getter	setter
then all getter and setter will access properties age

378153
repository	entity
i have then created seperate entity models which are simply poco s and i have used a repository pattern to fetch the data from my database and map them into my own entity models or rather i have a repository pattern that builds up and iqueryable that ll do all this

378155
google-chrome	firefox
all the modern web browsers google-chrome ie safari and firefox come to mind are all ipv6 aware

378158
constructor	object
so far there are two possible ways - one is to run my code as executable and dynamically load a proess on top of it seems to be very hard and tricky or to make my code a shared object load it via ld_preload and initialize from some static variables constructor

378161
jprogressbar	jlabel
so to implement this i thought it would be simple to just use a list of jpanels each with a jprogressbar and a jlabel each of which can just accept focus to determine if it and others are selected

378165
g++	gcc
you can view the result in gcc of the preprocessor substitutions with g++ -e -dreport test.cpp

378174
selected	cell
how about a jtable which you can set to allow multiple rows to be selected with an internal jpanel occupying the single cell in each row which contains a jprogressbar and a jlabel

378179
jtable	jlist
the standard way of doing this kind of things is to use jtable or jlist as a container

378180
internet-explorer	firefox
added i suggest you use some client-side html debugger like internet-explorer developer toolbar for ie or firebug for firefox

378204
contains	elements
i have two arrays contains the same elements but in different orders and i want to know the extent to which their orders differ

378208
repository	entity
the orderby does work if i apply it in the query in my repository - this is all a part of a bigger thing though and the whole idea is to not have the repository applying any sort filtering or anything like that but merely map the database entity classes to my own ones

378208
filtering	sorting
in the bigger picture this method is being used by a service class which is then supposed to add filtering sorting and all that - and the point of all this is of course to separate things out a bit but also to allow easy transition to a different database or a different or m later on if that would be the desire

378211
assign	add
you can add your items to the jlist s by first adding your task to the jlist object s listmodel see the create a model section from the java tutorials and then you ll want to assign a custom listcellrenderinger which will accept your task and rendering on the jlist as a jpanel in the list itself

378253
required	checked
this way by adding the extra repository you get all the benefits of checked out and building in one step and at least stand a chance of managing situations where changes required for project1 break project3 because of code shared with project2 and you suddenly need to get an emergency fix out for project3

378259
double	int
how do you round a double down to the nearest int in vb .net

378261
value	field
for normal lookup field only the lookup value is rendered

378261
value	field
for my custom field the string representation of the lookup value is used 1

378261
value	field
is there a way to change the custom lookup field so that it will render only the lookup value when exported to a spreadsheet

378266
vb.net	vb6
are we talking vb.net or vb6

378307
versioning	upgrade
the advice i heard from one of the authors is to have a scripting that will upgrade the database from versioning to versioning rather than building up from scratch each time

378319
directory	folder
i frequently find myself with a folder open in windows wishing to have a command-prompt open with the same working directory

378319
directory	folder
so what is the quickest way to open a command-prompt with a working directory of the current windows explorer folder

378319
command-prompt	cmd
win - r cmd enter start command-prompt

378328
fclose	fopen
but this dumps indices as double you can write it out more nicely with fopen printf fclose

378336
value	field
you can post all needed information if you include a salted hash field calculated from value of non-editable post fields

378336
hash	md5
the hash could be an md5 of

378356
vb.net	vb6
there were times i fired up vb6 vb.net later to work out some complex interaction and then translated it over to it s win32 equivalent in c++

378358
svnkit	svn
1.which lib are you using for accessing to svn svnkit or javahl

378382
deployment	install
the access developer extensions offer a basic but functional install that can take care of the general deployment scenarios

378388
environment	building
is there any sdk or add-in provided by microsoft to allow this to be compiled on a non-team system building environment

378406
mstest	nunit
in general this is a main reason why many people choose something like nunit xunit.net or mbunit over mstest

378457
ndepend	fxcop
an alternative to fxcop would be to use the tool ndepend that lets write code rules over c# linq queries namely cqlinq

378474
ndepend	fxcop
an alternative to fxcop would be to use the tool ndepend that lets write code rules over c# linq queries namely cqlinq

378474
ndepend	fxcop
ndepend overlap with fxcop on some code rules but proposes plenty of unique code rules

378493
any	set
i thought that baseexception would take any set of arguments

378493
constructor	object
also how i am supposed to pass an exceptions.baseexception object into exceptions.baseexception s constructor

378514
methods	extend
an overriding methods in a derived class may in fact want to extend rather than simply replace the base class methods of the same name

378538
export	report
i can export my report into sharp looking pdf files or excel spreadsheets and several other formats

378576
boost-asio	boost
starting with i think boost 1.36 which contains asio 1.2.0 you can use boost-asio windows stream_handle or windows random_access_handle to wrap a handle and perform asynchronous read and write methods on it that use the overlapped structure internally

378608
contains	set
a root category contains a set of top-level categories

378608
contains	set
each top-level category contains a set of sub-categories

378608
duplicates	contains
this arrays contains duplicates whenever an organization appears in multiple sub categories

378611
arguments	default
i tested xcodebuild without any arguments on one of my projects just now - it did a default build of my project without errors

378620
radio-button	selected
how do i get the value of the radio-button that the user selected in my submit method

378637
any	set
there is a branch-and-bound algorithm that should work for any set of operators you like

378663
windows-mobile	windows-ce
is windows-mobile that same as windows-ce

378681
ready	live
once you have your site ready but before you let it go live test it with javascript off and just add whatever you feel you need to make your site appear and function to them

378702
value	field
when i now want to create a new user account in the control panels the browser automatically fills in the value for the name and password field although i want to create a new user

378708
windows-mobile	windows-ce
think of windows-mobile and a windows-ce customer

378746
positioning	slider
i am developing a iphone based course video system in which i need to associate slider with certain time positioning of the video

378751
defined	declare
all the functions declare defined extern c won t be mangled so you can do other operations on them easily

378751
instances	destroy
you will also probably want functions to construct destroy instances of myclass you can of course use new delete for this

378757
hide	show
since there are few events to work with in notes developers commonly use the document refresh as the event to cause the field to hide or show

378757
hide	show
then in your hide when formula for the subject field you specify your criteria for when to show or hide that field

378757
value	field
anytime field value change followed by a refresh of the document form that hide when formula will be re-evaluated

378757
value	field
in the scripting you can propmt the user for a value set the display-only field and then call for a document refresh

378769
click	mouse
you must have an event listener waiting for the mouse click event

378786
abstract-class	superclass
do you tend to write a dealloc methods in the abstract-class and release where appropriate and then allow for children to call super dealloc and then worry about only instance variables they add which aren t part of the superclass

378791
internet-explorer	firefox
it covers the internet-explorer firefox and opera web browsers with focus on the html css dom and ecmascript technologies

378808
ifconfig	linux
i need to do a number of network-related things in c++ that i would normally do with ifconfig in linux but i d like to do it without parsing the output of a group of system calls

378813
setinterval	settimeout
passing strings instead of functions to settimeout or setinterval

378816
value	field
so i have two fields one called triggers a checkbox with the value on and another subject that is a text field

378816
value	field
i also want this to be recalculated whenever the value of triggers changes so i selected the refresh fields on keyword change option on the triggers field

378825
short	zero
if you only have five different value you can easily do the test by packing the bits in to a short or an int and checking to see if it is any of the zero or one bit answers

378825
boolean	int
public static boolean morethan1bitset int b

378834
webserver	security
similarly knowing about security principles is more important than knowing the latest buffer overflow in some webserver

378848
double-quotes	single-quotes
i m concerned that should terms contains double-quotes or an apostrophy if i use single-quotes in the javascript then my function will fail

378854
ironpython	ironruby
they are very nice features and i m especially looking forwarding to ironpython and ironruby as well as new tdd features of vs2010

378866
contains	elements
i need to distinct to selected non-repeated elements like in example i have in one column contains these values ee432 - ee432 - ee352 - ee352 my sql statement will return only ee432 and ee352

378874
contains	any
if terms contains quotation marks by the time you have done it is already too late to replace any quotation marks your javascript will be invalid

378874
double-quotes	single-quotes
if it could contains both single-quotes and double-quotes you need to sanitize the output on the server using a server-side technology more sophisticated than

378883
stream	send
i have the next function to send an input stream in the response object

378905
groovy	java
i have to ship some groovy code to some users that have only java installed no grooy no groovy_home etc

378945
include	ssi
from your code it looks like you re using apache ssi include

378967
updating	updates
set lazyredraw will buffering screen updates instead of updating all the time

378985
hide	next
if some of the returned value are null i need to hide the image that s next to it

378985
hide	show
i am using a panels to determine whether to hide or show the image but am having trouble with the statement

379014
subclassing	superclass
the superclass should not release objects that its subclassing create

379015
packets	subnet
is it possible to send a udp broadcast packets to a different subnet through a router

379017
default-value	arguments
string arguments are nullable so i can continue to do the initial display of the page as i always have without having to worry about specifying some kind of default-value for the argument

379019
methodology	waterfall
1 what software development methodology do you use waterfall agile scrum xp

379023
deployment	install
the .application file is the deployment manifest that is used to install the application

379023
any	set
it will in turn call setup.exe for any prerequisites you have set up

379045
groovy	java
you have here another example of groovy app called from java in this case from ant but the general idea is the same

379045
groovy	java
as mentioned by frankowyer you have the exact groovy jar explicitly listed on the classpath arguments of the java

379048
silverlight	wpf
that s plenty of time for us to start looking at wpf silverlight as have the clockcycles to do so

379057
protected	public
which concerns protected fields but what is said there is even more true for public ones

379067
difference	zero
i ve seen huge difference between estimated plans simply by changing the default from say zero to null or not having one

379076
.when	ready
.when you re ready to get the driver get the jdbcdriver service and look for the class that you re interested in

379082
environment	building
this means your build-process needs to have a runtime environment and deal cleaning up after bad building and all that but the payoff is typically 10+ or more faster cold launch with no code changes

379091
webforms	asp.net
unit testing legacy asp.net webforms applications

379094
filtering	grouping
then i will start uncommenting the joins select columns grouping order fields filtering to issolate different parts of the query to see what is happening

379131
listbox	textbox
i have a textbox and a listbox side-by-side

379131
listboxitem	textbox
the item index in the listbox corresponds to line number in the textbox and the content of the listboxitem is a processed version of the corresponding line in textbox

379145
convention	standards
where is the best place that i can find sql industry standards convention definitions that are most commonly used

379158
getter	setter
also you can add debugging assertions inside the setter routine and the getter routine though this is less useful to make sure the object is in a valid state when setting the value

379175
contains	lookup
to clarify i need to maintain the ability to lookup a value contains in the dictionary using a string

379203
key-value	key
with that being said though when i m working with xml i usually end up testing each node name or creating a key lookup table since the names in the data source i m working with aren t key-value coding compliant

379206
lookup	any
i always lookup the function code for any function i m not already familiar with. why is there a distinct

379212
apache-poi	jxls
per this so post i found out about jxls which uses apache-poi

379221
attributes	properties
for each loop or child we create a movieclip add a textfield to it label the textfield then add a properties of path xmllist int . path to the containing movieclip with a value of that current childs path attributes from the xml

379255
.when	ready
and stripes out the first character .when you were ready to use it

379260
uiresponder	uiview
in order to detect touches you need to subclass from uiresponder which uiview does as well

379266
nsarray	nsdate
a lot of the core cocoa data types like nsstring nsdate and even nsarray and nsdictionary have methods for loading data from a url like heng-cheong leong mentioned but they abstract away all the low level stuff and probably won t be suitable if you want to deal with http-headers

379267
keyboard	mouse
the user does something with the keyboard or mouse and that event is sent to the rest of the software

379270
web-applications	webserver
if you take a step back your web-applications are based around a loop - the webserver s accept loop

379270
click	mouse
they write when a mouse click occurs here do this

379287
compact-framework	.net
there are some differences between the two platforms the biggest being that the compact-framework only provides a subset of the .net

379289
pointers	stack
with multiple scene pointers stored in a stack of sorts at one time scenes could be stored in reserve and maintain their full state when returned to or even do things like dim but to continue to draw while the active scene drew over them as an overlay of sorts

379298
windows-server	windows
actually powershell v2.0 was finalized and shipped with the release of windows 7 and windows-server 2008 r2 in early august

379298
windows-xp	windows
windows-xp windows server 2003 should follow very shortly

379307
initializer	getter
in the case you give here i d probably put the initialization in the getter so the child object is only initializer when it s actually going to be used ie when the getter is called and then only if it s null

379317
base-class	inherited
by inherting and providing an interface you provide a contract the interface but get the easy implementation benefits of inherited while still allowing others to support the contract outside of the base-class limitations

379329
duplicates	contains
the timestamp field is standard in my design to indicate record creation it is a pattern thing that is used in by base persistence class and its kind of duplicates in this table as the person1requesttimestamp contains the same data

379332
websphere	ibm
a few people are pushing hard for using websphere integration developer and websphere process server as the defacto platform for developing future applications...because they feel ibm is a stable vendor the tools are made for the enterprise they drank the business agility bpel kool-aid etc

379338
turbogears	cherrypy
edit the turbogears framework takes the cherrypy web server and bundles other related components such as a template engine data access tools javascript kit etc

379343
implements	extends
it seems to me its very easy to implements an implicit operator versus a typeconverter so i m assuming they aren t equivalent because of the prevalence of typeconverters in the framework see anything that extends frameworkelement

379355
object-reference	instances
i am thinking many people who develop custom-controls encounter this problem...the error i get is error creating control - customcontrolname object-reference not set to an instances of an object

379373
16-bit	8bit
only difference is width of external data bus which is 8bit for 8088 16-bit for 8086

379383
contains	any
i have a std vector contains a handful of numbers which are not in any particular order and may or may not have gaps between the numbers - for example i may have 1 2 3 6 or 2 8 4 6 or 1 9 5 2 etc

379385
shell	bash
our dev team is looking for an ide like vi or nano or even textpad for windows that has the capability to autocomplete and error correction for bash or shell script for linux

379394
any	set
it lets any piece of code set the mouse cursor to what they want without worrying about what their caller or callee s set it to

379432
selected	listbox
i am able to select multiple values in the listbox but i don t know how to figure out what values were selected when the form is submitted

379449
double	int
fraction double value int

379453
managed-code	native-code
p invoke f - helps to find native-code signatures for managed-code

379454
python	java
in doing so you d learn some new technologies app engine and languages python for django javafx while taking advantage of what you already know about web apps and java

379455
bug-tracking	mantis
mantis simply stores bug-tracking information

379471
doxygen	phpdoc
the documentation libraries phpdoc and doxygen perform a kind of code analysis

379471
graphviz	doxygen
doxygen for example can be configured to rendering nice inherited graphs with graphviz

379471
xdebug	xhprof
another option is xhprof which is similar to xdebug but lighter making it suitable for production servers

379491
base-class	inherited
the statement that inheriteding from a base-class allows you to inherited behavior whereas implementing an interface only lets you specify integration is absolutely true

379494
textmate	bbedit
however textmate bbedit and subethaedit do nicely too

379499
actionscript	haxe
while most other languages are bound to their own platform java to the jvm c# to .net actionscript to the flash player haxe is a multiplatform language

379520
32-bit	64bit
for a 64bit hash i currently use lookup3 and fnv1 which are both 32-bit hash together

379526
.net	wcf
wcf service on the server side .net 3.5

379528
png	gif
this will require a bit more code as what your code is trying to do is to download an already existing image such as a gif png or even another jpeg and converts it to jpeg

379562
dependency-injection	inject
use dependency-injection to inject the single configuration object into any classes that need it

379592
implements	extends
one thing you could do is instead of relying on the built-in behavior you could implements a ssoauthorizeattribute which extends the authorizeattribute class and overrides onauthorization

379604
base-class	inherited
i have an action filtering attributes on a base-class all my controllers inherited from

379611
constructor	private
i mainly use readonly on private field where my private field can only be set from constructor

379624
.when	ready
if you must do it try to doll up your page as much as possible with what you want google to think of it .when it s ready not what it is now

379648
ref	out
now i d never considered designing a webmethods with an out ref arguments and it got me wondering why they would ve used it

379648
ref	out
i thought fair enough so theoretically providing i can figure out a way to pass out ref arguments to webmethodss that means i can just pass in two arguments that can be set by the methods but when i do this

379648
ref	out
is there a reason or a way to use out ref arguments in webmethods that i m missing

379648
ref	out
if there is how do i reference webmethods with multiple out ref arguments

379652
fontfamily	font-size
i would like all of them to have the same fontfamily and font-size

379662
.when	ready
it s better to take the time to make a well thought out page and .post it .when it s ready

379672
sql-server	oracle
i know sql-server pretty well and i m new to oracle so please bear with me

379675
value	field
and indeed when i type in a value into the text field component of the spinner jformattedtextfield and then press enter it works

379675
value	field
what i want now is to be able to have the text field respond to enter without having to manually type in a new value which sorta defeats the purpose of making a spinner out of it

379677
for-loop	arrays
from a text file i m trying to store two strings from that file into arrays and then do the same with the next line or until i desire using a for-loop

379698
lgpl	gpl
lgpl differs from gpl because you can mix lgpl code and code release under closed licenses as far as i know lgpl was created for libraries in order to spread the use of the free software as much as possible

379713
implementation	instantiation
the use of inherited allows public methods from the policy implementation to be accessible through the templates instantiation

379740
subclassing	superclass
isinstances is preferrable over type because it also evaluates as true when you compare an object instances with it s superclass which basically means you won t ever have to special-case your old code for using it with dictionary or str subclassing

379786
identity-column	sql-server
sql-server 2005 will throw the following error when you overflow the identity-column

379786
32-bit	64bit
int 32-bit signed will go up to 2 147 483 647 and bigint 64bit signed to 9 223 372 036 854 775 807 that s 9 quintillion enough for 1.3 billion id s per person on the planet

379790
python	c++
in my experience doing things the naive way drawing each object to the screen will bog down in python quicker than c++

379790
python	c++
however with python it s going to be a lot quicker and less painful to code it the clever way see for example pseudodc which will blow the naive c++ implementation out of the water

379838
checkbox	textbox
i ve got a form with a bunch of textbox that are disabled by default then enabled by use of a checkbox next to each one

379838
checkbox	textbox
when i click the checkbox and disable the textbox i still get the invalid field error despite the depends clause i ve added to the rules see code below

379838
checkbox	textbox
here is a sample of the list of checkbox textbox

379846
duplicates	contains
note that strictly speaking this only follows the specs if the original list contains no duplicates items otherwise the original list may be missing items

379867
shell	bash
problem customer x is a windows user who wants to be able to trigger pre-packaged bash commands by using mnemonic keywords or tag hints when she is logged in to her redhat box via shell

379867
put	get
customer x is willing to specify ahead of time what commands she is likely to want to use in windows-speak and then hire the developer to translate those into bash commands and then put them together in a scripting that allows her to talk windows-speak to bash and get back the list of commands

379867
perl	ruby
is there a perl python ruby script out there that does something like this already

379882
curly-brackets	braces
there is no difference between curly-brackets and braces for delimiting code blocks and expressions since everything is an expression

379907
settimeout	fadein
check out jquery fadein with a settimeout standard javascript function

379907
hide	show
i basically hide and show them so it can go in a loop

379913
puts	gets
but a timer may be a better systemd or a function that gets them all puts them in an arrays then pops them off one at a time with a delay in between fading them in one at a time

379917
click	mouse
starting with jquery i m measuring the mouse s acceleration and offset during click - drag - release events using a timer

379936
zend-amf	amfphp
amfphp was the best solution for this until recently as it now lends itself to the zend-framework more specifically now it is zend-amf

379953
grouping	sorting
if you re sorting or grouping on the memo fields that could do it because sorting on memo fields is supposed to truncate them to 255 characters though in the test i just ran on a2k3 sp3 with all the latest post-sp3 patches mere sorting doesn t truncate but group by does

379970
xlib	x11
clx the x11 client implementation for cl doesn t link to the xlib implementation but speaks x11 directly

379970
lisp	let
this can let you write your application or application host in c or c++ and call to lisp code

379986
unpivot	pivot
pivot and unpivot

379990
value	field
another approach is to add a prefix to all user generated values remember you have both a value and a text field for all options

380003
ia-32	x86
if you just need to understand what each instruction does the reference manual for the ia-32 x86 ia64 instruction sets are located here

380008
compact-framework	.net
using c# .net compact-framework i am creating a gui control that contains and controls children that are also custom controls system.windows.forms.usercontrol

380009
oracle	mysql
usually the term database is reserved to the standard notion of a relational database such as mysql ms sql server oracle etc

380014
google-chrome	firefox
the error doesn t come up in firefox or google-chrome as i would exepect as the ajax is asynchronous

380019
dlopen	dlsym
functions dlopen dlsym dlerror dlclose

380046
click	mouse
when the user click do the tiles have mouse event listeners or does some other collision detection methods loop through the tiles and check each one to see if it s been hit

380056
pentaho	birt
you can look at pentaho mondrian including jpivot or at eclipse birt

380068
hide	show
we have created our functional faux- to show so we can hide it by class -ing it as replaced adding

380074
unsigned	bigint
for example int does not match bigint or int unsigned

380074
innodb	myisam
this effectively copies the entire myisam table to an innodb table then once that succeeds it drops the myisam table and renames the new innodb table to the name of the former myisam table

380074
innodb	myisam
innodb has better performance than myisam though innodb needs more attention to tuning the configuration innodb supports atomic changes transactions foreign keys and innodb is much more resistant to corrupting data in a crash

380074
innodb	myisam
unless you re running an old unsupported version of mysql 5.0 or earlier you should use innodb as your default storage engine choice and use myisam only if you can demonstrate a specific workload that benefits from myisam

380088
digits	zero
then the display timer itself is a collection of these digits wired up to propagate zero left

380088
click	mouse
the tile itself will handle the mouse click it is a button after all and call its reveal methods

380091
unsigned	integer
the foeign key field and the field being referenced must be of the same type i only use integer and after hours of pain they must be unsigned

380106
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere mq 5 and 6

380108
ref	out
what i only just realised is that to add to the confusion if you use ref instead of out then you don t do this you d treat the webmethodss exactly as you would have if you d used them to call a regular methods inside your application

380153
defined	declare
as requested where the weaponsdb pi is declare and defined

380176
postback	ajax
when you submit an asp.net form to postback it sends everything back through the page lifecycle i don t think there really is anything for a jquery ajax request to talk to

380182
order	add
i need to add next and previous links to a web page displaying messages in date order

380188
.when	ready
my personal rule of thumb is that it s just because it works doesn t mean it s ready .when you can explain why it works it s ready

380191
contains	any
it s often everything in srcroot but if your project is laid out in the root - src projfiles manner the srcroot will only contains your project file and not any sources

380201
.net	wcf
i would suggest presuming that you are considering msmq you are using windows with ms technology looking into wcf or if you are using ms-sql 2005+ having a trigger that calls into .net code to run your processing

380232
lazy-loading	interceptor
even if you were able to get lazy-loading to work over wcf which we were able to do you still would have issues using the proxy interceptor

380240
selected	textbox
if user selected value from dropdown first and then he don t want that value and he types another text in that textbox then at this time the dropdown should be set to index 0 as user is typing another value

380240
textchanged	textbox
i used textchanged event of textbox but it is not working

380277
defined	declare
you must provide a compilation unit that defined the symbols that were declare in the header and make the environment compile and link it together

380311
dictionary	arrays
rather than use sessions if you have a login you can monitor it based on logins and keep them active by recording the most recent activity per user in a dictionary arrays

380350
windows-xp	windows
i m using the windowss-xp but if u are using windows server then give access rights to the user networkservices

380357
stderr	stdout
nohup sends stderr and stdout into files

380358
capacity	storage
given my internet speed and storage capacity it would take me hours out of every week to just copy across and re-name appropriately every piece of media that is downloaded completely legally i might add by hellanzb

380363
subtract	time
no difference though vb historically uses a weird indexing in loops which means that you have to subtract 1 from the highest index most of the time

380370
compatibility	platform
well personally i d like to see a true java 2.0 which ditches backward compatibility in order to clean up some of the messes of the past - and largely make it like c# but with the existing platform independence

380387
lan	wan
work home.ps1 and work work.ps1 modify the hosts file to go through lan or wan addresses

380392
keyboard	mouse
a good radio keyboard + laser mouse

380400

380455
tokenize	parsing
i am looking for a clear definition of what a tokenize parsing and lexer are and how they are related to each other does a parsing use a tokenize or vice versa

380460
darcs	svn
if you just want to know whether this directory is under revision control or not you can look for the folder with all the data in it -- for svn it s called .svn you may have to switch on view hidden directories for darcs its _darcs

380464
data-structures	tree
for building all kinds of nifty dynamic data-structures like tree linked lists etc

380466
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it s impossible to implement asp.net-mvc the abstract concept not the 3.5 implementation out of the box with webforms apps becuase these controls so tightly bind the view and control

380470
directory	folder
and as greg states there is also a .svn folder in each directory under svn

380490
solaris	linux
note that this is in c++ or plain c as the main application is a portable c c++ some other languages program that also runs on linux and solaris

380490
sendmessage	message
we did some more investigations seems that half of the overhead is preparing and sending each message using sendmessage and the other half is the actual screen drawing

380498
children	tree
you represent a certain focus in the tree plus a context up to parents down to children which gives you the whole tree in a form where it s easily modifiable at the focus and it s easy to move the focus up and down

380509
callback	methods
application a pass callback methods to dll b

380509
calling-convention	function-pointers

same web-services running on the vs 2005 webserver work without a problem and can connect to the database

380540
web-services	webserver
do not know what is the issue with web-services published on iis in respect to connect to oracle 10g when the same services running on vs 2005 webserver work without the problem

380553
virtual-functions	derived-class
furthermore your questions seems to be confusing two different concepts virtual inheritance which means sharing one base class between two intermediate base classes and virtual-functions which mean allowing derived-class function to be called via base class pointers

380558
pyopengl	pyglet
other choices would be pyglet or using pyopengl you can most likely draw to a wx widget too though i ve never done it

380558
pygtk	cairo
personally i d do it in python using whatever library i m most familiar with in my case i d use pygtk and cairo and worry about performance only when it becomes a problem - then profiling and optimize the bottleneck if its python code thats slow i ll know which bits to run in c instead

380570
contains	any
this file does not contains any objective-c runtime information

380573
debian	linux
in my version of mail debian linux 4.0 the following options work for controlling the source reply addresses

380581
assign	add
then in ad you would assign mydomain nick to a grouping with other people that use this same app and then in sql-server you would add that grouping to security and assign it a role

380607
webforms	asp.net
does anyone know how to set up a default querystring to an asp.net webforms which is set up as a start up page

380637
versioning	upgrade
the other difference related to this is that in 2k8 the files get upgrade based on the versioning info resource - if your modules dont have newer versionings they dont get replaced

380666
instances	self
so what you re doing in your __init__ methods is exactly what we did above setting an attributes of the instances self

380671
downgrade	upgrade
as 2008 doesnt do a naive uninstaller + install the install step would need to be able to handle both upgrade and downgrade scenarios

380691
reflection	runtime
annotations and attributes have to be checked at runtime using reflection

380706
notepad++	textpad
ordinarily text editors identify this bom correctly notepad does as does notepad++ i m not familiar with textpad

maybe you can replicate the environment with a vmware disk image or in virtualbox or similar and debugging this faster

380750
redmine	trac
trac doesn t have time management support while redmine does

380750
redmine	trac
for these reason in my company we are thinking to switch from trac to redmine

380757
redmine	trac
i d recommend redmine like the other posters as it is more complete than trac

with this you can identify wrong calls new free or malloc delete or missing

380788
criteria-api	icriteria
you can use the setmaxresults methods on iquery if you use hql or icriteria if you use criteria-api

380813
downcasting	upcasting
upcasting is allowed in java however downcasting gives a compile error

380817
perl	awk
one thing to add i know it can be solved from perl or awk i m interested in a better solution in bash not in those languages.

380835
document	editing
i have what seems like a typical usage scenario for users downloading editing and uploading a document from a web page

380839
websphere	ibm
disclaimer i work for ibm as a websphere consultant so my thoughts are influenced by that and the ibm product most often suggested as an answer to the above questions websphere service registry and repository

380846
any	set
is there a configuration option i can set can t find any in the api to achieve this or will have to hack the dojo code or perhaps create my own versions of stackcontainer and tabcontainer in order to rid myself of the hotkeys

380850
canvas	pixel
i have done some serious googling trying to figure out how to draw polygons and then be able to access the pixel buffer of the canvas surface

380850
silverlight	wpf
my findings indicate that this is not possible with the wpf silverlight graphics so i need to use a custom graphics library but have only found some 3d libraries

380866
aes	des
auto | des | 3des | aes

380889
coalesce	isnull
i have tried isnull case statements coalesce and dynamic sql with execute and sp_executeutesql and failed to implements any of these

380895
installation	environment
this is a common environment in a lot of installation where the clients own the server and previous experience has taught me that clients or competition can t be trusted to keep their grubby hands off the database

380932
getter	setter
while the anonymous-function gets executed right away the getter setter get executed for the first time when they are called

380937
localization	translation
to use the built in localization resource provider in asp.net can only handle translation strings see getstring key locale with no user defined arguments if i have read the documentation correct

380962
rhino-mocks	nunit
i am using nunit and rhino-mocks

380978
configuration	environment
the sharepoint configuration database and the sharepoint content databases should in a production environment always be configured with full recovery

380985
udp	tcp
tcp udp 53 dns

381008
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it seems like vs might be reading this as a webforms app instead of an asp.net-mvc app maybe

381011
nsbuttoncell	nsbutton
subclass the appropriate control like nsbutton and nsbuttoncell

381011
highlight	cells
â you ll be implementing your own custom cells for some things you want to do in a table but will have to change the way rows are highlight in a subclass of the actual nstableview object itself

381016
hide	next
however some of the value that are returned are null and if so i need to hide the image thats next to it

381016
hide	show
i am using a panels to determine whether to hide or show the image but am having trouble with the statement

381017
constructor	object
when the customer list is double clicked the event looks up the record casts it to a linq-to-sql customer object and supplies this to the constructor of the customer inspector form

381020
environment	building
the building from this containers will be used for our testing environment and load-testing environment

381020
.when	ready
for example .when release 1.1 is ready for a pre-production build the stable integration containers is branched into a new release 1.1 folder in the production release structure

381025
getter	setter
in the above example i am creating a new object inside of the function and then attaching getter and setter to this newly created object

381060
pointers	stack
so what you want is need is to detect when any function is called with a specific pointers parameter on stack - this is the impossible part

381062
selected	button
using javax.microedition.lcdui.command commandlistner and commandaction won t work since these need only recognize the commands selected with the side button

381072
click	mouse
datagridview.cellcontentclick is not firing if i mouse click a datagridviewcheckboxcell very fast

381073
methods	extend
for instance imagine that types b c and d all extend type a and then a methods public a getsomea returns an instance of either b c or d depending on a randomly generated number

381082
verilog	hdl
is there a similar mechanism in hdl vhdl or verilog

381124
disposable	dispose
if your image serving site happens to do any inline image-processing generation you can quickly swallow up memory by not calling dispose on any disposable resources - particularly those that are wrapping native functionality.

381135
default-value	default
because css does not provide a default keyword the only way to restore the default-value of a property is to explicitly re-declare that property

381146
administration	account
after this point it s all about the security of the other computers and the local computer if the browser was running as a least privileged used instead of an administration account

381155
attributes	properties
2. style tag and style attributes isn t so obvious but in ie they can use the behavior or expression properties to invoke script content

381155
onmouseover	onclick
3. any onclick onmouseover etc

381167
checkbox	textbox
what i envision is being able to generate a control which has basic controls in it textblocks labels date pickers textbox checkbox etc based on types of my data

381181
comma	words
so it means find any words character found more than once followed by a comma followed by a spaces zero or once followed by one of any character

381185
function-call	inline
inline means there is no function-call invocation the body of the function is duplicates in assembly at every call site

381188
comma	words
in this case 1 matches the words before the comma and 2 matches the first character following the whitespace after the comma

381205
disassembly	shellcode
i ve disassembly the shellcode

381214
google-chrome	firefox
i have observed this behavior in google-chrome and firefox

381216
methodology	waterfall
do programmers who practice the waterfall methodology are they open to functional specifications

381217
machine-code	shellcode
shellcode is machine-code that will run when the bug occurs

381226
implements	extends
you can extends defaultwidget to create your own nicewidget and implements your own calculateheight to return a nicer size

381226
python	ruby
which is what i could do in python ruby etc

381235
boost	stl
this is what i m doing now and i m using all of the nice things like stl atl wtl boost sqlite directx etc

381235
irrlicht	ogre
if you just want to make a game with artists and other people collaborating to create a finished product use one of the existing engines ogre irrlicht nebula torque etc and just add in your game logic and art

381235
boost	stl
as i ve come to realise that other libraries such as stl boost directx etc have an order of magnitude or three more man-hours of development time in them far more than i could ever spend on that portion of the game engine

381242
environment	building
if your building machine caught fire and you had no backups of that machine how quickly and easily could you re-building your environment of libraries and cross-compiling

381255
any	set
when working on my own where i can set my own model and program any way i want i start by writing up functional specs and then implementing them

381262
perl	php
the should be trivial to accomplish using php perl python etc

381264
methodology	waterfall
frankly the functional specifications should already be part of your big-m waterfall methodology

381290
32-bit	64bit
you can with some processors the nehalem can do this but previously all memory access was aligned on a 64-bit or 32-bit line because the bus is 64bits wide you had to fetch 64bit at a time and it was significantly easier to fetch these in aligned chunks of 64bits

381311
methodology	waterfall
the waterfall design methodology is one of them if it s not used correctly

381315
spacing	layout
layout is the positioning spacing etc

381364
document-ready	ready
you are using the jquery s document-ready function raised whenever the dom is ready to be traversal and manipulated instead of the system.application.init event raised after all scripting have been loaded but before objects are created

381368
processor	cpu
the cpu always reads at its word size 4 bytes on a 32-bit processor so when you do an unaligned address access â on a processor that supports it â the processor is going to read multiple words

381369
detailsview	gridview
that is..can you disable viewstate for an entire page with standard controls like detailsview gridview and would it still work

381369
detailsview	gridview
or in order to work with controlstate for standard server controls you have to modify their behavior by creating a new custom gridview detailsview

381381
any	set
if you set the page directive variables trace true does that show you any load times which out out of place

381382
.when	ready
.when they are ready they can finally log in to avoid having to type their name all the time

381385
icollection	ienumerable
the .net 3.5 extension methods ienumerable t .count will enumerate behind the scenes if the return-value does not implement icollection t which may be undesirable

381396
selected	listbox
if the user selected an option in 1 listbox it should filtering the other listboxes

381399
implements	abstract
imho you should implements an abstract strategy that says persists this on database

381414
any	set
if i have a large set of continuous ranges 0..5 10..20 7..13 -1..37 and can arrange those sets into any data-structure i like what s the most efficient way to test which sets a particular test_number belongs to

381414
binary-tree	nodes
i ve thought about storing the sets in a balanced binary-tree based on the low number of a set and each nodes would have all the sets that have the same lowest number of their set

381414
binary-tree	nodes
i think that would prune about 25 of the sets on average but then i would need to linearly look at all the rest of the nodes in the binary-tree to determine whether the test_number belonged in those sets

381414
any	set
i could further optimize by sorting the lists of sets at any one node by the highest number in the set which would allow me to do binary search within a specific list to determine which set if any contain the test_number

381419
constructor	private
obviously if you prefer you can make the members private and pass them in to a constructor rather than using the initializer list

381419
callback	methods
if you re worried about templates for instance if functhatneedscallback is a lot of code which gets duplicated then use an abstract class to define a virtual methods which the parameter must have and use that methods as the callback

381421
floating	margins
anyway i d immediately try floating the containers div .cssdivnino left as well explicitly setting top and bottom marginss to 0 and keeping a close eye on ie6 s suite of float margins bugs

381434
spring	jsf
i m developing an application using spring webflow 2 facelets and jsf

381436
pascal	delphi
when i was working with delphi i had to convert code samples from c into object pascal - doable but tedious lots of friction

381445
export	csv
we currently allow data to export in more traditional file types...pdf csv html and a few others

381452
teamcity	nant
the annoying thing is that nant gui can run the build file without error so i don t see why teamcity should fail since i believe it to be using the same subversion client as nant gui and the same ms .net-framework-version too

381471
directory	folder
the wildcard option on the getdirectory call will allow you to grab all the directory contained in the windows folder directly that match the pattern sys

381471
directory	folder
for instance say you wanted folder that are contained by folder directly inside the windows directory - i have no idea how you would go about something like that i m afraid...i don t imagine exporting the entire tree to xml and using xpath to do it would be so efficient - the xpath would be fabulously simple for parsing out using wildcards - but converting to xml wouldn t be so efficient.

381476
web-config	app-config
to your app-config or web-config file

381488
append	input
an injection attack on a vulnerable input script on a client site caused a trojan-loading script body to be append to each and every text field in their database via an automatic ms sql script

381494
binary-tree	tree
instead of a binary-tree it should be a ternary tree

381494
contains	set
each node should have left middle and right nodes where the left node contains a set that is strictly less than the node set the right is strictly greater and the middle has overlap

381495
double	int
if you are dealing with simple values like int or double it will not matter performance wise if you resize and set or reserve and push_back

381495
constructor	object
if you are dealing with more complex object that have a significant constructor it is better to use the second push_back based method

381495
constructor	object
if you object do not have a meaningful default constructor then the push_back approach is the only technique that works

381497
put	get
i put it in my root assembly for my application framework and enforce is at the root so it is very easy to get to

381504
required	checked
in the code you checked via their roles that the user holds the required privileges to perform a function

381509
keyboard	mouse
can t you just place a transparent windows over the entire control and capture all the mouse and keyboard events there

381520
display	width
the width of the treeview should drive the width of the other objects and i need the height of the textblock to change to display the full text

381548
.when	ready
.when the hardware parameters are altered the hardware will take a few seconds to reconfigure itself and then signals that it is ready to be used

381550
callback	methods
that get methods probably doesn t call your callback immediately

381550
callback	methods
try putting an alert within your callback methods

381550
put	get
does that one happen before or after the alert your put after get

381558
any	set
does any one have a list of ie s default css values so i can set it in a css so this thing will be more firefox friendly

381559
hash	md5
if it s a well-known algorithm like md5 and someone can get hold of the hash output then on their own cpu time they can rapidly check against possible passwords and if they find a match then they ve got the password

381563
installshield	uninstaller
so i then went to installshield and removed all custom actions install uninstaller commit and rollback as well as the associated setproperty s and built and install again

381568
json	xml
should the representation html xml json returned by a restful web service be determined by the url or by the accept http header

381574
specifications	w3c
the w3c have a sample stylesheet in the css2 specifications which describes the typical formatting of all html 4.0 html40 elements based on extensive research into current ua practice - copying that into a stylesheet is probably the best you ll do

381608
quirks-mode	doctype
another issue is whether the doctype of your application is using standards mode or quirks-mode

381618
32-bit	x86
no unfortunately psyco only runs on 32-bit x86 right now

381624
rewrite	rule
this may help you add the rewritecond to only apply when the connection is not ssl then add the l option to your redirect rule so rewrite processing stops at that point so the last rule doesn t override the ssl redirect

381638
order	add
under the assumption you have access to modify the structure of the table which you may not then add a sticky field which allows you to mark items as sticky and attach an order to the sticky items if you like

381656
pointers	stack
using arrayss on stack is also discouraged because you don t have range checking and passing the arrays around will lose any information about its size arrays to pointers conversion

381656
constructor	object
note if you allocate arrays with new and allocate non-class object like plain int or classes without a user defined constructor and you don t want to have your elements initialized initially using new -allocated arrays can have performance advantages because std vector initializes all elements to default values 0 for int for example on construction credits to bernie for remembering me

381661
lisp	let
paul graham uses the term in his books on lisp referring to variables defined using the let expression

381678
selected	textbox
the textbox autocompletes on city name and when you selected something it gets removed from the textbox and added to the list

381679
windows-server	windows
i took out the shared windows hosting account with wild west formerly godaddy exported the aspnetdb tables and data to a .sql file and recreated them on the ms sql-server edited the connection string in web.config to use the connection string supplied by wild west then used filezilla to ftp copy the files and folders to the windows-server

381690
widget	button
in terms of widget if you can afford the screen real estate you may be best off for the initial selection screen with two side-by-side list boxes with a move here and move back button

381715
function-call	inline
there might be some edge case where you have a vector access inside an inline function inside an inline function where you ve gone beyond what the compiler will inline and it will force a function-call

381720
webforms	asp.net
i use precompiled updateable web sites exclusively for asp.net webforms

381727
swing	awt
for now anyway gnu java gcj has not implemented a lot of these - most importantly i think that the desktop awt swing has not been done

381731
contains	set
a standard methods is to set it to null when it contains no valid value

381736
spaces	output
if you need to build a single piece of code that only considers valid output and thus doesn t bother walking over the entire combination spaces then you re going to have some thinking to do

381763
http-headers	content-type
the content-type as you refer to it in the comments to your question is part of the http-headers

381773
any	set
you can do that now but you have to set it up yourself- there s no service that will automatically put your web site service in the cloud any more than you would if you just hosted a web site with rackspace

381782
contains	elements
how would i define an elements that can either contains plain text or contains elementss

381785
controller	routes
you should be able to define your username route your above regex route and add it to the router first then just add your controller routes for example

381785
controller	routes
if i request does not match one of your controller routes it will then try to match it against your regex route

381821
xilinx	fpga
if you are using xilinx fpga s this can be supported in some of their chips

381837
scala	java
i think scala is going to develop into this replacement language which we java developers can switch to when ordinary java does not cut it

381846
constructor	private
making the comment even more general you class should declare assignment operator and copy constructor marked as private and not defined or manually defined to avoid double deletes of the pointer

381848
click	mouse
you can also capture the click event and check which mouse button fired the event with event.button in some browsers anyway

381850
ref	out
one thing java would do really well to implements is something equivalent to ref and out parameters

381853
numerical	matrix
linear algebra involves lots of tricky issues with numerical precision hilbert matrix and as much as i like doing my own thing this is one of those areas where you might want to use a good solid foundation that s already been well-tested

381854
constructor	object
also because your object contains a raw pointer and obviously owns it it is deleting it this implies ownership you must also make sure you override the compiler generated versions of copy constructor and assignment operator

381857
textbox	button
the click event of the select link is hooked up using jquery to replace the text in the original address textbox with the address the user is selecting and then click the submit button via javascript

381857
webforms	asp.net
with an asp.net webforms application i could simply store the best matches in viewstate and it would be available to me on the postback from the user selecting the address

381859
itemscontrol	grid
also adding an extra button after the itemscontrol isn t a good option either because my control uses a uniformgrid and i want my extra control in that same grid

381866
any	set
is there any time frame set for when .net 3.5 sp1 will be pushed to all windows users

381873
linqdatasource	gridview
i have a gridview that is using a linqdatasource for it s datasource

381873
postback	ajax
note i m not using an updatedate panel simple postback refresh no ajax

381874
sql-server	mysql
i m at square one on a project that will need to repeatedly import data from mysql .dmp files into an existing sql-server database

381874
sql-server	mysql
my first thought is to read the dmp file in as text and perform some sort of find replace on it to convert mysql conventions into sql-server but that sounds messy difficult and prone to error as unanticipated items creep into the source file

381890
internet-explorer	firefox
this works well but in firefox 3 and internet-explorer 7 i haven t tested with any other browser won t open this file inside the browser they both show the download dialog box as expected

381890
internet-explorer	firefox
how can i get firefox and internet-explorer to open the document inside the browser and provide the correct default filename to save

381896
worksheet	excel
and here for the root of the excel vba reference which includes a section concepts that discusses the major objects like workbooks and worksheet cells and ranges etc

381896
any	set
you ll have to set a reference to the excel objects in your project before you can create any of these objects

381904
sql-server	mysql
specifically write an application script to walk the structure of the source database mysql in this case and generate the equivalent ddl for the target database sql-server in this case

381904
sql-server	oracle
i have found this useful for cases where i was upgrading the database oracle 6 to 7 as well as switching products like access to sql-server

381905
sql-server	mysql
i think you should load all those data into new mysql installation and then use sql-server integration services to import these data into sql-server

381905
oracle	mysql
sql server white papers migration from mysql oracle sybase or microsoft access to microsoft sql server

381912
webforms	asp.net
all in all between the controllers models and extension methods it adds up to a lot more code that is easily testable in mvc that in either classic asp or asp.net webforms

381917
jquery	.post
check out the .post client templating with jquery

381965
any	set
if you want to find out if set a is a subset of b then you can iterate through b removing any corresponding items from a

381975
boolean	int
for example consider cases when is false boolean or 0 int

381978
value	field
using crystal-reports 11 i m trying to get a subtotal amount to force it to show a negative-number when a database field has a value credit memo

381988
csv	xml
what are common techniques for storing data in flat files other than xml and csv

381992

they are generally licensed in two forms one for the developer to generate localization assemblies or resx source code and one for the translator to store translation strings to from an internal database

382041
reflection	runtime
runtime presence of generics in reflection api

382042
compatibility	platform
it s supposedly the fastest delegate you can find on most current platform compiles down to 2 assembly instructions. versioning 1.4+ gains some boost.bind compatibility

382051
instance-variables	accessor
if i have an instance-variables name of foo i want to write it s accessor as bar

382063
decimal	octal
if the web service returns 0010 i want the autocompleteextender to also display 0010 and not interpret it as octal and display a decimal equivalent

382081
variables	boolean
this requires a global locking boolean variables

382082
instance-variables	ivar
you can use the form property ivar to indicate that a particular instance-variables should be used for the property for example

382083
httpd.conf	.htaccess
i also came across a topic in the apache documentation that suggests putting the configuration in the httpd.conf file instead of .htaccess files

382108
value	field
using sql-server how do i scripting a constraint on a field in a table so that the acceptable range of value is between 0 and 100

382115
content-disposition	content-type
maybe you ll have to use content-disposition attachment to let php specify the content-type location leave the task to the webserver

382129
content-disposition	content-type
when you put the object in s3 you need to also include content-type and content-disposition headers and whatever else you may want

382137
getter	setter
i have cursed at the annoyance of making getter and setter myself though so i understand why one would want to make creating those as easy as possible but i d rather see get set and getset annotations than more syntax thingamajiggers to do the job

382166
contains	any
it s dangerous to store the raw pointer contains in any smart pointer for later use

382171
google-chrome	safari
this works like a charm in most browsers except that it doesn t in webkit browsers like safari and google-chrome

382171
selected	button
is there any way using javascript or otherwise to selected which submit button will be used when the user hits the enter key in a text input on an html form

382172
value	field
the mapping doesn t have to involve just poking the input value into a output field

382174
text-editor	editor
the gui editor is a plugins and even the text-editor is a plugins

382177
constructor	object
but this won t solve the issue of passing this from within the constructor since at that time no shared_ptr is managing your object yet

382195
command-line	cmd
for more advanced cmd like a replace after you have performed the substition simply hit the key then the â up arrow key and it fills your command-line with the same command

382234
value	field
i have an integer field in a clientdataset and i need to compare to some value something like this

382249
highlight	selected
i m trying to get rid of the blue highlight functionality where it highlights the selected row and the

382249
selection	highlight
i m trying to seit it up so you just click on the button without getting the row selection and mouseover highlight functionality

382267
seam	jsf
the move to a newer version of richfaces will also result in never versions of jboss and seam as the current production build of richfaces 3.2.1 requires jsf 1.2

382292
textbox	button
alternately you could have a textbox with an id of id and a submit button in a form that posts to home get

382294
put	get
these control where the to workspace and from workspace blocks get and put their results

382313
document	element
we find a div in the existing html document called tablediv and then we create a table element and add it to tablediv

382319
implements	extends
i realized that a more elegant approach is indeed to use a router but for that you would need to create a custom one by extends the zend_controller_router_abstract class and implements the route methods

382329
unique	words
for every unique words in your text you create an instance of this class

382350
positioning	sidebar
then you also have to figure out where to positioning the pages widget relative to the others in the sidebar since positioning is something the wordpress admin usually does on the widget admin tool

382362
constructor	object
in the constructor an object calls a static method of the registry with this

382383
authentication	login
however when using the microsoft application data application block sqlhelper class to call out to a database using a trusted connection authentication fails for the nt authority anonymous login user

382384
unique	words
what does the spread of unique words to documents look like

382400
session-cookies	cookies
try using session-cookiess to store state between pages -- they re fast pretty widely compatible and will zero out when the browser shuts down to keep from spamming your users cookies jars

382441
default-value	default
i highly appreciate your question as i am deeply convinced that default-value rules should be implemented on the code-side not on the database-side and this for a very simple reason when users are the one that initiate database changes inserts selected and updates these changes shall integrate all business rules and default values are basically business rules

382441
default-value	arguments
arguments in favor of the default-value mainly refer to a kind of security principle do it on the database side because you will forget to to it on the code side your language is not made for that it s easier to do it on the database side that does not make any sense once you have chosen not to implement any default-value on the database side just check that your business rules are properly implemented while debugging

382445
delphi	c++
there is nothing i haven t been able to do in c++ vcl that i couldn t do with delphi vcl and almost all delphi components work fine in c++ builder

382459
dbd	dbi
having all connections to a db go via a single instances of a dbd dbi type class would seriously throttle your request throughput performance

382468
authentication	impersonation
impersonation is only half of the story you also need to look at delegation assuming your network is using kerberos authentication

382483
tuples	set
then use set operations to get the tuples set you want

382487
binaries	install
does anyone know how to install ironpython 2.0 with ngen ed binaries using the msi package

382492
value	field
in case this field is found its value will be settled to the the domain name of the user that requests the report and will be printed out

382516
protected	public
this mean it could have more than one sections of private public or protected

382518
declarative	imperative
declarative code is easier to make bug-free than imperative code

382527
variables	boolean
i use a globals record set up in the main form to store all global variables have one element of that called globals.appinitialized boolean and set it to false in the initialization section of the main form

382528
aes	dsa
now this application was never fully finished so i don t support things like dsa key-pairs but i do support rsa key pairs with sha1 md5 using idea aes i think my 3des code does not work correctly but i may have fixed that since

382535
versioning	upgrade
deactivate reactivate feature -- i would wrap the updated dll back into the sharepoint solution file change my code above to reflect the new versioning and use stsadmin to upgrade the solution

382536
python	java
is there an online java book like dive into python for learning python

382550
haskell	c++
what s called generic in c++ java and c# is called polymorphic in haskell

382562
superclass	inherited
i would now like to create a family of related components and to do so would like to create a superclass of this component and then inherited this component and others from there

382562
constructor	object
there are a lot of ways to do this i m sure but i m finding myself wondering is there a tool that will convert .dfm files forms or tframes to raw object pascal constructor code

382566
lisp	apl
it s certainly not as sexy as learning apl or lisp or ruby etc. for fun but it was necessary and urgent

382576
uilabel	uiview
i have a .xib file containing a uiview and 2 uilabel subviews linked to a class named note with outlets assigned to each label appropriately the definition for this class contains the following

382576
getter	setter
i m assuming i don t because i m not explicitly retaining these objects anywhere in my code and i don t synthesize these into getter setter

382613
perl	ruby
learned two new environments objective-c cocoa touch and ruby rails after sticking with perl for many years

382641
multiplication	modulo
this approach isn t unbreakable but it s a step up from using a constant for the xor-ing - and prngs are very simple to implements typically consisting of one multiplication and modulo operation for each word

382675
iframe	popup
i am looking for a way to position a div it would be a popup that would be activated by a user hovering and or clicking much like lightbox over an a split iframe where the top iframe is content from my server and the bottom iframe is content from another server

postback	ajax
ajax on the other hand uses javascript to do partial loads of a page allowing small amounts of data to be loaded from the server without needing to do a complete postback

382734
shell	tcsh
i m using tcsh as my shell

382738
contains	set
it looks like the div contains the calendar date is pushing it down because it s the excerpt has a width set to 100 set it to 90 and you see it will go to the top

382739
key-value	key
obviously the correct action if there is a matching tx_ptr in n but not in m is to insert a key-value pair into m with the current tx_ptr as the key and as the value a list of the current tx_ptr and the tx_ptr that was already in n

382751
contains	elements
the feed is linked to within the head elements of a valid html 4.01 strict page with the link is pointing to the correct url the linked feed is a valid atom-editor 1.0 xml file served as application atom-editor+xml and contains the correct

382751
firefox	opera
firefox opera safari and ie8 beta 2 all do correctly find out the feed and lighten up the relevant address bar button - it s just ie7 that stays greyed out

382755
innodb	myisam
while i agree with the innodb comments i will give a solution to your myisam problem

382760
put	get
if you can t get an alias to work just write a short shell scripting chmod +x and put it somewhere in your path like home bin

382760
tcsh	bash
i don t have any experience with tcsh but with bash you do it like any of these

382781
emacs	vim
question does emacs have a canonical equivalent of vim s folding with foldmethod indent

fwrite	fclose
look up fopen fread fwrite fclose ftell for functions to read write the data

382798
mod-fastcgi	mod-perl
the main problem i m having so far is trying to decide if i should use mod-perl mod-fastcgi or both to run my scripting because i m having a difficult time trying to analyze the pros and cons of each mod

382815
svg	vml
typically across the 3 drawing methods the major browsers use canvas svg vml text support is poor i believe

382821
attributes	properties
any object could be changeflow enabled by deriving from a common base class and adding a few attributes to the methods and properties that needed tracking

382829
environment	building
if your solution is made up of multiple projects you might consider creating multiple solutions in your building environment

382835
versioning	upgrade
if you can upgrade to the 3.5 versioning of msbuild

382840
configuration	installation
i had worked in projects on where both types of applications are needed it all have to do with your requirements if you don t want to worry about installation and or client configuration a web based application is what you are looking for but if the application requires high responsiveness and a lots of calculations then you should think in a winform app as mentioned before layering your application will help you to reuse your code

382865
execution	restart
this gives you the added benefit of being able to restart the execution

382883
constructor	object
where windows is the root object number is an object inside windows constructor is an object inside number prototype is an object inside constructor and constructor is an object inside prototype

382893
constructor	object
is the windows object an item named number which contains an item named constructor which contains an item named prototype --- which is where the methods are named --- which contains a method named constructor. that final means and treat this as a function with no arguments.

382923
pipe	tail
i agree with madcoder that tail -f allows you to connect things using a pipe while less cannot

382923
nano	vim
for example vim replaced vi and ed virtually everywhere in the pc world nano replaces pico not because it s better but because it s free mutt and pine basically replaced things like mail in many places

382985
export	report
you can export that report to file open it in visual-studio and see the date field logic

382995
constructor	object
for object created in stack the constructor returns the object rather than pointer as shown below

382995
pointers	stack
and stack object automatically destroyed when variables obj_class goes out of scope but object created on heap lives for ever.so to destroy heap object c++ gives you delete operator that takes pointers as argument and destroys the object the pointers is pointing to

382999
ruby	php
over the last 2 years i have leading a small group of ruby on rails python-django php enthusiasts to actively canvass the adoption of these frameworks inside the enterprise

382999
ruby-on-rails	django
there is now a strong buy-in for the fact that ruby-on-rails django and its ilk may actually be better for a certain class of enterprise apps especially simple lightweight ones in the areas of km workflow etc

383031
response	timeout
it would also be trivial to implement it in objective-c connect wait for a response or timeout repeat

383053
disposable	dispose
the best approach for dealing with a disposable resource is to dispose the instant you are no longer using it

383068
32-bit	64bit
initally i tried to install a 64bit version sql-server express 2005 on my computer but no matter what i tried only the 32-bit version seemed to work...so that is what got installed

383068
32-bit	64bit
the 32-bit sql-server express 2005 was working fine but recently i installed a 64bit version of sql-server express 2008 - with all the tools and features

in x509 the standards for encrypting the data this way are pkcs#7 and cms defined in some rfc i forgot the number

383129
associations	model
i have a relationship in a core data model that feels like it wants an associations class

383129
attributes	properties
a simple association between the two is part of the picture but creating a new class which has the required properties as attributes and then has a relationship to each of the other classes just doesn t feel quite right - for instance it allows for a relationship to not have the desired properties

383130
contains	set
have the permissions been set on either the mailbox or mailbox database contains the mailbox you are attempting to access

383165
textmate	emacs
i m not sure what platform you are on but textmate can do all of that as can emacs

every built-in function and every built-in constructor has the function prototype object which is the initial value of the expression function.prototype

383211
communication	messages
note that we re talking erlang here which uses messages passing as opposed to shared state for communication between concurrent processes so techniques for unit-testing concurrent code in shared state languages may not be applicable

383221
firefox	opera
i would imagine pipelining as supported in http 1.1 would mitigate the connection limit issue but it is disabled by default in firefox and ie opera has it enabled

383232
constructor	object
functions additionally have a public prototype property which is used only when the function is used as constructor when an object is constructed using new the property of the new object is set to the prototype property of the function that was used as constructor

383232
constructor	object
but this is not always the case since the prototype property of the constructor function can be reassigned but the of an object cannot be reassigned after the object is created

383248
downgrade	upgrade
a thread in upgradeable mode can downgrade to read mode or upgrade to write mode

383255
protected	public
public or protected methods generally always deserve separate

383265
protected	public
for public protected internal methods ie

383280
sftp	ftp
the zeus ide has html and css syntax highlighting and it can also be configured to do seamless ftp sftp editing

383281
webforms	asp.net
in standard asp.net webforms

383290
arguments	undefined
arguments and returns undefined

383290
google-chrome	opera
google-chrome and ie7 has named their functions opera and ie7 tells you that it will not reveal the implementation

383290
google-chrome	opera
i get undefined from opera and ie7 null from google-chrome and object object from ff3

383306
uiscrollview	subviews
i made an instance of uiscrollview and added some subviews on it

383307
object-reference	instances
the error is object-reference not set to an instances of an object

383315
object-reference	instances
question updates to include object-reference not set to an instances of an object

383320
firefox	safari
now i have run into another issue that works well in ie7 but not in firefox 3 and safari

383322
aptana	pydev
you can use aptana with the eclipse pydev plugins to do all that and a lot more

383328
buffering	streaming
aside note that not all streaming even guarantee to flush - for example gzipstream etc retain a working buffering of uncommitted data even after a flush - the only way to get it to flush everything is to close it

383336
vb.net	vb6
while i have no direct experience about vb.net against vb6 old habits i do for c++ against stripped-down c-like c++

383347
constructor	object
i ve got the default constructor customer but then i ve also got a customer datarow dr since i load this object from a database and that s a simple way to do it

383348
python	ruby
and the reason is that ruby and python are just giving access to the full range of values that one can specify in floating point form as specified by ieee

383354
silverlight	wpf
i ve used it succesfully in java swing windows forms wpf and silverlight

383356
selected	button
be able to show any label or button in the correct language upon the selected culture

383366
constructor	object
function is the constructor of function object

383366
required	checked
the implementation you checked were consistent in that it is implements as a function object itself as some pointed out the ecma specifications required this

383366
constructor	object
function.prototype.prototype does t really make much sense but as function.prototype is implemented as a function object which could possibly be used as a constructor it should at least exists

383366
constructor	object
objects which are created using function.prototype as constructor would inherit its properties - but as there should be no reason to do something insane like this setting it to null undefined or an empty object is reasonable

383400
environment	building
douglas schmidt s ace adaptive communications environment is a mature highly portable open-source framework for building high-performance multithreading servers

383405
put	get
i put together a small test page to isolate the problem but couldn t get it to work at that page either

383408
constructor	private
you can even make all the constructor private if you want

383411
groovy	java
i can t vouch for the quality as i use neither python nor django however the ruby ruby+rails support for netbeans works well and it supports other languages such as java and groovy well also

383422
operators	keyword
but by doing so you run risk of someone forgetting to use the new keyword and the this operators being all fubar

383423
decrement	increment
the ++ increment and -- decrement

383425
having	select
then you ll be better off having it in its own table rather than doing a select distinct on the table every time you need to show the droplist

383427
default	reset
have you tried reloading the default after calling reset

383434
perl	awk
it is shorter and more concise than what can be written in perl or awk

383441
having	select
by having a select with multiple values eg select col1 col2 col3

383441
execute	declare
using output parameters declare the parameters before execute the query then get the value from them afterwards

383467
order	add
in order to index your content using lucene.net you ll have to create some mechanism service of triggers which will add new rows and remove deleted rows from the lucene index

383468
click	mouse
just call and this will prevent it from accepting mouse click

383478
constructor	object
to answer your question directly logically it is an object s private copy of the prototype property of its constructor

383478
constructor	object
but if we change the prototype on the constructor already created objects will continue referring to the old object

383487
curly-braces	parentheses
if you make an error in parentheses curly-braces or something you ll see that you syntax highlighting breaks showing you that there s something wrong and where it went wrong

383495
pointers	stack
raii has many facets using smart pointers stack using vectors instead of variables length arrays etc. but all in all is about writing as little code as possible letting the compiler clean up the stuff at the right moment

383502
push	pull
i agree with frankodwyer flip the protocols from a pull model to a push model

383503
assign	add
this is a side-effect of #1 if i want to add 10 methodss to every object i create i could just write a creation function that manually assign each methods to each new object.

383503
constructor	object
note that this snippet is able to avoid hard-coding the constructor function name as unlike the previous example it has no need to actually instantiate the object - therefore it can be copied into each target function without modification.

383519
udp	tcp
moreover the protocol caters for reliable ip multicasting which in a multi-client environment may give you performance-wise a definite edge against anything implemented using point-to-point tcp or udp connections only

383519
python	java
since spread has c and java client apis plus python it sounds like a very good match to your problem

383525
versioning	upgrade
i would like something for the whole tests without having to upgrade to this beta versioning yet

383527
cos	sin
x cos î 1 + y sin î 1 r1

383527
cos	sin
x cos î 2 + y sin î 2 r2

383527
cos	sin
a cos î 1 sin î 1 b |r1| x |x|

383527
cos	sin
cos î 2 sin î 2 |r2| |y|

383540
dictionary	arrays
javascript has no built-in general map type sometimes called associative arrays or dictionary which allows to access arbitrary values by arbitrary keys

383540
getter	setter
javascript s fundamental data structure is the object a special type of map which only accepts strings as keys and has special semantics like prototypical inherited getter and setter and some further voodoo

383540
arrays	map
note hash tables sometimes called hash maps are a particular implementation of the map concept using a backing arrays and lookup via numeric hash values

383556
variables	boolean
however the actual size of a boolean variables in memory is not precisely defined by the java specification

383560
click	mouse
i would like to have mouse over to pressed not mouse over then focused when the button is click

383563
boolean	int
the boolean values are compiled to int data type in jvm

383582
32-bit	16-bit
since strings in java are unbounded in length and each character has 16-bit and ints have 32-bit you could only produce a unique mapping of strings to ints if the strings were up to two characters

383582
mapping	unique
but you could use biginteger to produce a unique mapping with something like

383591
32-bit	64bit
we tried running dnn on windows 2008 64bit and 32-bit a while back

383592
methods	extend
for the more general case you might create a high level subclass of object introduce a integerize methods there and extend every single class from that

383608
double	int
use double version check for overflow over max int or max long and cast to int or long

383635
firefox	opera
the next step would be to pass the string to javascript and in javascript you could take advantage of the ability to embed base64 images supported in firefox opera not ie

383658
textbox	button
only difference is i will be using it to highlight textbox and button

383699
json	xml
in the old days web services used xml as their primary data format for transmitting back data but since json appeared the json format is specified in rfc 4627 by douglas crockford it has been the preferred format because it is much more lightweight

383699
dictionary	arrays
in various languages this is realized as an object record struct dictionary hash table keyed list or associative arrays

383699
json	csv
json to csv converter

383701
json	xml
i suggest json be used in any ajax-like applications where xml would otherwise be the recommended option

383702
ruby	php
there are also solutions for php python and ruby although i can t recall their names right now

383705
hash	md5
aside from this there are cryptography hash functions such as md5 and sha where collisions are extremely unlikely though with a lot of effort can be forced

383705
hash	md5
note there are also some theoretical weaknesses in some hash functions md5 but for your purposes that probably doesn t matter and you could just use the most efficient such function - those weaknesses are only relevant if someone is maliciously trying to come up with strings that have the same code as another string

383710
drawimage	draw
override the onpaint methods on the form and use the drawimage methods on the object from the painteeventargs.graphics property to draw a bitmap of an arrow

383712
teamcity	nant
visualsvn + teamcity + nant + sql-server

383713
defined	declare
it lets you defined a list of methods and classes can declare that they implements the protocols

383713
assign	add
going back to our delegate implementation before we can add the same angle bracket syntax which tells the compiler that we expect the object we re assign to implement this protocols

383725
32-bit	x86
i run nant scripting out of powershell x86 mode on a vista 64 machine but an sdk prompt 32-bit would works as well

383727
teamcity	msbuild
note that teamcity can also use msbuild which can run visual-studio .sln files

383727
build-server	msbuild
that s a great place to start when getting your feet wet - just have the build-server run your build scripting that uses msbuild to call your .sln file

383731
udp	tcp
last year i have worked on tcp udp client-server application project.it was simple server listens to certain port socket and client connect to server s port etc.. but i have no idea about how to develop serverless lan chat program

383731
udp	tcp
udp tcp multicast broadcast

383738
gentoo	linux
both the web service and the client are running on a gentoo linux x86-64 box running glibc-2.6.1

383738
debugging	trace
it seems like this should be easy to debugging but when i trace through a good request on the service side it looks just like the bad request in the socket._socketobject.close function turning delegate methods into dummy methods

383747
capitalization	capitalize
capitalization of methods tends to be a mixed bag my methods tend to be verbs and are already distingished by parens so i don t capitalize methods

383762
communication	messages
spread functions as a unified messages bus for distributed applications and provides highly tuned application-level multicast grouping communication and point to point support

383772
credentials	account
one potential problem is that when savecred saves the credentials it saves it for whenever runas invokes that user account

383787
json	xml
consider sending down json instead of xml

383787
json	xml
json is less verbose than xml and will usually take up less space

383787
json	xml
if your client-side code needs an xml object reconstruct it from the json you just downloaded

383787
json	xml
to avoid encoding issues i d try wrapping the compressed data itself in either xml or json when sending it down

383815
number-theory	primes
if the primes n becomes bigger you might have to switch to an algorithm using a little bit of number-theory

383815
python	ruby
if i remember correctly assuming the riemann hypothesis holds which most people do one can show that the running time of the following algorithm in ruby - sorry i don t know python is log log n log n 3

383817
meta-inf	jar
to give you a picture of the problem the current resulting jar when viewd with winrar has 3 instances of log4j.properties in root path and 7 instances of file spring.schemas in meta-inf path to name a few

383825
wicket	spring
if you re not tied to spring asp.net-mvc i would suggest wicket as it allows for exactly the type of behavior you re describing

383836
malloc	free
setting pointerss to null in java is not the same as in c where setting a malloc ed pointers to null prevents it from being free

383847
constructor	object
the standard stl containers place a copy of the original object into the container using the copy constructor

383849
authentication	login
further although i could login to the 2005 instance using windows authentication i could not access the planboard database with it

383849
authentication	login
i am not quite sure why it worked before and then didn t work after the 2008 install...but after specifically entering my windows username in as a sql-server login to the 2005 instance and giving it rights to the planboard database...i can now login use windows authentication to access the 2005 database as well

383877
authentication	login
since postgresql authentication based on host and login user i suspect the confusion lies between the user name you re giving to the postgresql connection and the unix user you re logged in as

383887
versioning	upgrade
now that i ve upgrade my sdk to the latest versioning which i presume is the versioning that the online docs refer to i get behaviour that is at least consistent with the docs

383919
push	pull
seems to be there s a push and pull between coordination of data and flexibility of behavior which can be mitigated by putting the singleton around just shared data with the smallest amount of behavior as possible to ensure data integrity

383936
exception-handling	error-handling
the exception-handling technique is an error-handling logic which works in parallel with program logic

383954
linked-list	queue
if i know that i need constant-time insert delete from either end of the list i might pick the linked-list concrete implementation or more likely use the queue interface

383955
selected	button
i was able to selected the same plug-in shown in your screen shot mylyn bridge java development to get an enabled uninstall... button

383986
linux	unix
dunno what linux unix does

383990
virtual-functions	base-class
you could instead use a base-class with virtual-functions - all plugins would be derived from the base-class

384029
httpresponse	httprequest
if the system had httprequest and httpresponse objects the simplest way to dispatch would be to use a single function that routes to all of the possible choices

384038
internationalization	localization
i have always thought that the terms internationalization and localization and their funny abbreviations i18n and l10n were universally accepted and used for talking about software which is aware of language and cultural difference

384051
hide	show
if you mean an overlay element you can use the webbrowser navigating and loadcompleted events to show and hide the element

384057
hide	show
you are going to need to add another function call to hide the other div after the first call to show it

384057
hide	show
mm_showhidelayers logo hide logoeasteregg show

384059
internationalization	localization
internationalization localization

384065
any	set
i don t have any experience with cruisecontrol but looking at your set of requirements i d probably write a scripting to do the job

384065
python	ruby
if your tasks are more complex for instance because you want the script to run on other platforms too then i d probably use ruby or python

384065
python	ruby
either way either bash ruby or python are excellent for text processing or for this task in general

384065
any	set
for instance you might set up a subversion or git hook such that the scripting will run upon any commit

384078
object-reference	instances
i can write the code below and everything seems like it s going to work fine as well but then when i run the code i get an error on the project.status.statusname saying the object-reference not set to an instances of an object

384081
metaclass	subclass
if you re working with an existing class you can either subclass it with one of these methods or else add these methods to the metaclass

384083
googletest	cppunit
i prefer cruisecontrol.net with cppunit but i don t have any experience or knowledge of the googletest framework

384085
python	java
if you want the protocol to also abstract away the method invocation have a look at xml-rpc which java and python and pretty much everything else has good support for

384102
tortoisegit	svn
nobody has ever accused git of being easy-to-use no tortoisegit for example although i hear it s coming so you might be better off with svn beanstalk

384117
syntax-highlighting	code-folding
zeus has support for the php language syntax-highlighting code-folding smart indenting autocomplete etc

384132
linux	unix
in linux unix you can use the posix dlopen dlsym dlerror dlclose functions to dynamically open shared libraries and access the symbols including functions they provide see the man page for details

384134
openjdk	jni
for that matter java accomplishes this through its jni java native interface interface so you could probably look at the source code for openjdk to see how java accomplishes this on both unix and windows

384138
object-reference	instances
but of course i get the object-reference not set to an instances of an object on the line me.status.statusid proj.status.statusid

384146
constructor	object
i personally wouldn t use the constructor to load the object you can either use a shared function or use linq directly in your code to load your object

384154
svn	rcs
once you re comfortable with rcs and accept the benefit of retaining changes you can move up to learning svn or git or any other real system which are far more robust and better suited for team environments

384165
darcs	svn
previous to that the only reason i used svn over darcs which has a really nice command-line interface was because i found a good free svn server

384204
compatibility	platform
once you start using nsinteger for compatibility if you ever compile for a 64bit platform you should use ld as your format specifier

384208
logout	login
then add all of your other routes for login logout etc

384213
attributes	properties
one simple solution is to use an attributes on the custom properties and get them by reflection from the host

384219
compatibility	platform
once you start using nsinteger for compatibility if you ever compile for a 64bit platform you should use ld as your format specifier

384247
browser-cache	caching
i have tried clearing the server caching and browser-caching but it doesn t help too

384249
javascript-engine	spidermonkey
non-ast based interpreter spidermonkey the new kjavascript and javascriptcore execution engines frostbyte and squirrelfish probably the opera javascript-engine and v8 have no need a lot of these constructs as they are used primarily for the purpose of describing behaviour -- not implementation

384254
show	next
i ve occasionally seen times where i ve had to show the css in the browser and then next time i ve been to the real page it s used that new css

384291
constructor	object
i am trying to refactoring the code so that the validations happen in the object constructor instead of the old way a separate few validation routines

384319
base-class	inherited
this isn t the good part since you should always edit this part yourself but if you inherited methods and properties from either a base-class or as in your case an interface it will copy the documentation automatically

384324
firefox	opera
in firefox opera and ie 7 i see the ocean.png and am able to click it

384324
google-chrome	safari
when i load this same code in safari windows and mac as well as in google-chrome the ocean.png is not seen and there is no button to click

384324
google-chrome	safari
is there something i can add or do to get this code design to work in safari and google-chrome

384332
perl	ruby
i did not tag my question with a language name since a program in perl or ruby or whatever would work as well

384341
value	field
you could then wire up the properties in your containers like so where specifying a type of static for the parameter would cause the value to be replaced with the static field that was referenced by the parameters value

384343
firefox	opera
maybe ie firefox and opera finds it illegal syntax and rewrite the input outside of the select but webkit does not

384352
bar-chart	charts
i want to know whether this is possible using google charts api first create a bar-chart with the given input data

384354
optgroup	selected
selected can have optgroup and option

384355
formatting	import
you may also want to add traceback formatting with import cgitb

384362
configuration	logging
without access to your configuration file or the code from which the logging is initiated i would guess that you re implicitly using the default values for the root logger which

384380
google-chrome	opera
this code is tested in ff3 ie7 google-chrome 1 and opera 9

384411
constructor	object
the id can only be set though the constructor so if you want to change the id which is very unlikely you have to create a new object which has a new id and therefore a new hash code

384422
sql-server	mysql
i ve only tried mysql - sql-server via ssis once but the error i found related to mysql datetimes not converting to sql-server datetimes

384433
revision	updates
i wanted to record in the revision history that i had actually updates it to the latest version even though there was no change

384464
protected	public
internal types cannot be part of a public protected api as the consumer would have no way of using it

384473
any	set
one trick i use is to place a ttimer on the main form set the time to something like 300ms and perform any initialization db login network file copies etc

384485
stderr	stdout
we had to write our own report generation our own stdout and stderr capturing our own status mailer

384494
any	set
just like any set of dependencies.

384494
put	get
put all your messages and polls in one app and get through one rev

384500
contains	set
thickbox is opened from parent windows when button is pressed with ajax content div based form that contains the set of inputs with autocomplete support

384500
thickbox	jquery
the content of thickbox is loaded dynamically so what s the correct way to have an initial callback to manipulate thickbox content with jquery kind of thickbox .ready

384505
silverlight	wpf
you can make xslt-templates that produces html for the browser or xaml for wpf silverlight

384506
boost-test	googletest
googletest especially with the new mock library unittest++ and boost-test are all being investigated

384507
postback	ajax
ajax updatepanel makes it and i think it s the easiest way ignoring the ajax postback overhead

384518
access-control	authentication
use proven encryption algorithms cryptography random number generators hash functions authentication schemes access-control systems rather than rolling your own

384547
google-chrome	firefox
so runs on all major browsers that i ve used and this list includes ie firefox google-chrome opera

384580
reflection	runtime
check for any uses of reflection as classes can be loaded and methods can be dynamically invoked at runtime without knowing at compile time which ones they are

384582
children	nodes
this way a nodes is consistently either a leaf or a list where the car is the leaf and the cadr is the children nodess

384582
children	nodes
by-levels takes a list of nodes and collects values of the top-level nodes and recursively find the next children to use as the next nodes

384585
web-applications	webserver
that said i have not actually done this with tomcat and most of the web-applications that i ve worked on forward to a generic error page at the webserver level

384596
display	width
how do i count the display width of some text

384603
filtering	grouping
the types of operations people will want to do with the reports are predictable filtering sort grouping by add or remove columns export to csv etc

384626
constructor	object
in order for a constructor to be called the instance has to actually be created and you can t just return another object from a constructor

384626
object-reference	instances
updates one drawback of this approach is that although each instances would behave as a singleton it would still have its own object-reference and therefore you might also want to override equals for equality comparisons

384630
moss	wss
what is the difference between moss wss

384636
oracle	mysql
however in many circumstances this is not required you are developing for the oracle platform or sql server or mysql whatever so you shouldn t sacrifice the benefits of your chosen rdbms just for the possibility of an entirely seamless transition

384639
firefox	opera
the task seems to be pretty easy how to include a javascript file in xml-document so that at least opera and firefox could actually parsing it and execute the code

384640
bazaar	git
basically id does not make any sense with bazaar git and other distributed source code management tools

384647
indexoutofrangeexception	argumentexception
basically if the icomparer misbehaves the quicksort call with throw an indexoutofrangeexception which is wrapped in n argumentexception

384667
markup	xhtml
xml was never intended to be a display markup like html thats why xhtml was developed html that conforms to xml standards

384672
unsigned	integer
if you design your software around platform-neutral integer type names probably using the c99 header which when the types are available on the platform provides in signed listed and unsigned not listed

384679
common-lisp	tcl
there are couple of things it obviously lacks such as ltk since you have already included common-lisp and tcl tk

384679
python	tcl
same for documentation for python and tcl may be it would be better to add emacs-w3m for fast and convenient documentation browsing

384690
defined	declare
a bit more information i have the base datafile type and the generic-list declare in the same unit while tdescendantdatafile is in a second unit and tdescendantlist is defined in a third one

384716
postorder	inorder
taking your question at face value you want to print out the nodes in breadth-first order rather than using one of the standard depth-first orderings inorder or pre-order or postorder

384721
put	get
when i double click on a control in the designer it opens the .h file which i ve understood to be for prototype declarations and if i put all the guts to the functions in there i can get my program to work but i don t like having the code in the .h file

384727
triggers	insert
â but when we need to denormalize something for performance or insert data into a changes table used by all clients to figure out which objects they need to expire in their session cache we use triggers functions in the database layer to insert a new row and send out a notification postgresql listen notify stuff from this trigger

384734
.net	wcf
in modern .net world the server is usually built using wcf

384737
constructor	object
this could mean that temporary object created earlier in the constructor stay alive for much longer than they need to due to the closures maintaining references to them

384737
constructor	object
luckily again this isn t always an issue as i don t often create temporary object in my constructor

384750
constructor	object
this could mean that temporary object created earlier in the constructor stay alive for much longer than they need to due to the closures maintaining references to them

384789
xsd	xml
i ve got few files in resources xsd files that i use for validating received xml messages

data-access	nhibernate
one thing to note though that bite me is that you will make to sure you wrap all your data-access in a transaction and ensure nhibernate actually commits its changes

384820
textbox	onblur
is there a way to specify some javascript to execute on the onblur event of an asp.net textbox

384867
textbox	button
i have an asp.net user control that contains a textbox control and a button control

384867
textbox	button
i need to have a piece of javascript that will run whenever the textbox changes and disable the button if the value of the textbox is invalid

384867
textbox	button
my question is this how do i put javascript on the textbox that can reference only the button that is in the same user control

384867
textbox	button
remember there are many asp.net user controls each with a button and a textbox and i only want the invalid value in a textbox to affect the one associated button

384890
declarative	imperative
for various reasons that i won t go into i want to stay with a declarative language and not some imperative scripting language such as groovy

384898
base-class	inherited
i have read that private variables in a base-class are technically inherited by child classes but are not accessible

384906
protected	public
but ultimately it is the base-classes job to manage the state of those fields via any public protected etc members

384906
subclassing	base-class
the subclassing has to include all the fields from the base-class for it to make sense

384923
aggregate	grouping
i thus decided in grouping the count aggregate result into a subquery...ie s karwin s latter solution

384935
any	set
on a recent episode of .net rocks episode 404 they mentioned that a lot of visual-studio issues could be reduced if you set the platform target to be x86 instead of any cpu

384935
32-bit	64bit
at my company we have a mix of 32-bit x86 and 64bit x64 developer machines

384996
postgresql	mysql
somebody advised me to use php with postgresql or mysql

385040
googletest	gmock
however now i would take a long hard look at googletest and gmock as they would probably complement each other quite well

385042
sql-server	mysql
i m a mysql guy working on a sql-server project trying to get a datetime field to show the current time

385060
webserver	nginx
the parser is completely seperate from the webserver -- we have nginx merb as our web application server and a rake task calling c++ as our backgroundworker -- yet they do exist on the same machine

385094
32-bit	64bit
if your third-party components are unmanaged code or the assembly was built with anything but platform anycpu you need to target 32-bit unless the vendor provides a 64bit version

385095
authentication	login
i actually have the auth stored in the mapped drive where it says authentication using user. i also use the same username for the samba share as the xp login though not the same pw

385098
firefox	safari
it works fine with and tags but when i use import inside a it doesn t show up in the arrays - only as a cssrule style is undefined in safari 3 and firefox 3

385102
any	set
i can t figure out any way to set it up with a flow

385125
deployment	install
but you can set its deployment target to 2.0 and not use 2.2 features when running on a device with a pre-2.2 operating system install and your application should work fine

385129
compact-framework	.net
this is the smart device application build against .net compact-framework 3.5

385137
put	get
set the log level to debugging and make sure this is not on a production machine because it produces a lot of output per individual event get put

385137
python	php
i think how your example above of fastcgi is missing something but i admit its been a while since i ve done anything but php or python fastcgi

385147
cosine	atan2
any other format is going to rely on another implementation of sine cosine atan2 and square root at a minimum

385151
derivative	cosine
for example the derivative of sine is cosine only when you use radians. but degrees are typically more familiar and easier for people to interpreter so you might want to stick with degrees

385156
solaris	linux
i ve been working on a project of porting an old solaris cl program to run on linux and barring some unrelated hardware issues that s finished

385158
feedback	account
i would not recommend automatic lock-outs not so much because they are necessarily evil but because they provide immediate feedback to the malicious user that they tripped a sensor and let them know not to do the same thing with the next account they sign up with

385162
pygtk	gtk
since you are already familiar with pygtk why not use gtk

385162
pygtk	gtk
after all pygtk are just bindings round gtk which is written in c

385167
python	ruby
however at a larger scale you re into a substantial development project and python or ruby start becoming viable options

385178
data-access	ado.net
what is the best way to code the following generic data-access functions ado.net c# or vb sql-server or oledb

385187
double	int
if there might be an issue with precision loss when using double or you won t be doing trigonometry i d suggest your solution of mapping to an int range - this will give you the best resolution can easily be converted to whatever display format you re locale will be using and - after choosing an appropriate 0-meridian - can be used to convert to floating point values of high precision

385187
wgs84	gps
for fun i wanted to convert gauss-krã¼ger-koordinaten which are in use by the german katasteramt to gps coordinates - let me tell you that was ugly one uses the bessel ellipsoid the other wgs84 and the gauss-krã¼ger mapping itself is pretty crazy on it s own.

385189
latitude-longitude	location
i ve done several mapping projects using google-maps location searches based on latitude-longitude or zip codes interactive mappings and kml data

385210
command-line	cmd
you can also get statistics from the cmd-line by running the jrmcd cmd that is available in the jrockit_home bin directory

385224
enterprise	platform
if you go to more enterprise platform such as .net or java they have a much higher barrier to entry but they also come with a lot of infrastructure to help you make applications that scale

385224
memcached	apc
that being said php + memcached apc + beanstalk goes a long way

385239
cakephp	symfony
there are a lot of tools libraries out there that give you a framework to work in making it less likely that someone will write poor less-maintainable code see cakephp symfony pdo smarty etc etc etc

385240
hosts-file	hosts
back in the early 80 s smtp was pretty much the only publically known protocols that had to be available to map for an entire site -- and the dns lookup was done with the common hosts on many systemd

385253
shell	bash
is this starting the bash shell

385256
getter	setter
grade and teacher are automatic properties which are roughly equivalent to getter and setter in java which would be methods

385264
command-line	cmd
running simply at the cmd-line uses the value in that variables and then interprets it as a cmd -- which runs a new shell

385264
text-editor	editor
for example if you re in a text-editor and you want to interpolate the output of a shell command the editor knows which shell program to run by your environment variables

385275
sysadmin	puppet
finally i d point you to another configuration dsl though perhaps more for sysadmin usage puppet

385281
linux	bsd
on windows there s filemon for bsd osx there s fs_usage and linux has dnotify and inotify

385283
javascript	dom
you can be sure that the entire dom is ready for use and there is no dependency on the order of the source code meaning you could move the javascript to an external file in the future to take advantage of various caching mechanisms on the client-side

385289
dictionary	arrays
in this case you might want to consider reading the nicknames in the xml file into an arrays if your test ids are really just sequential integers or a dictionary if not up front then using that to locate each nickname rather than trying to do a bunch of xpath queries

385290
groovy	java
an upcoming alternative to that is groovy and grails which is backwards compatible with java and may be less of a learning curve for you

385293
output	mode
i want to mention how we can redirect top command output to file using its batch mode -b

385313
search-engine	web-crawler
you can go a long way by simply blocking ip addresses that cause a certain number of hits in some time frame some webserver support this out of the box others require some modules or you can do it by parsing your logfile and using iptables but you need to take care not to block the major search-engine web-crawler and large isp s proxies

385344
player	movie
i have tried two methods one is the press the done button come with the movie player another is the press overlay button and add action mmovieplayer stop there however both come the same result when i replay the movie again the screens keep blinking

385349
ruby	php
keep it simple and well documented and you will find that developing a large scale web app in php is as easy as it would be in asp.net ruby or whatever

385356
callback	methods
javascript is client side the cache is on the server side so you need to do a callback to a methods in your asp.net application that returns the content of the cache

385373
pointers	stack
edit based on stack trace in your comments the routine _crtisvalidheappointers is saying that the pointers being freed is bad

385381
constructor	private
note that _asynccallbackread and every other variables beginning with an underscore is a class private member assigned in the constructor of devicesession

385381
callback	methods
because the callback delegate refers to the methods of a specific instance of devicesession detailed and strongly typed context information contained in the members of this instance of devicesession is automatically in scope

385399
json	xml
and finally theres a xml api you can look up at the msdn link as well and it can be fetched essentially the same way as the json you just need to decode it differently

385403
python	lua
i come from classes object orientation languages and recently i have been learning those fancy dynamic languages javascript python and lua and i want some tips about how to use oo in those languages

385408
python	perl
i know i could write a perl or python script that would do this but is there a way i can do it in the shell

385417
smalltalk	scheme
smalltalk uses a similar sort of scheme

385422
utility	gnu
specific platform implements specific nonstandard extensions -v works with gnu s time utility as demonstrated below the question is tagged linux

385440
dreamweaver	notepad++
i would much rather use dreamweaver or even notepad++ free which does syntax-highlighting and more

385460
command-line	cmd
from the command-line start run type cmd press ok type

385464
delphi	c++
it s bad enough dealing with all the c++ developers who prefix every member in sight with _ - and i m speaking as a former delphi developer who used to prefix every member with f

385467
constructor	object
let s create a constructor for object with foo as a prototype

385484
required	checked
the rule is that given any project in source control all that is required to build is to do a checkout and build the project or run some tool that is also checked into the project

385491
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested firefox ie7 opera and google-chrome

385491
google-chrome	opera
google-chrome does a normal if-modified-since and opera ignores the key

385500
png	gif
only stream jpg gif or png files

385501
compression	streaming
i ve used it before and it worked excellent for creating zip files and compression data streaming

385515
tuples	any
pass it a pair of tuples with whatever arity you like and it will return true if the two points lie on any n-dimensional diagonal

385527
decrement	increment
you could use a shared memory segment and increment a count each time an application is opened and decrement when the application is closed

385529
insertion-sort	quicksort
edit in response to comments using quicksort instead of a simpler algorithm like insertion-sort is another example of an idiom that everyone understands and expects

385534
any	set
if you are developing some application its better to get the number of records from your result set or data set or any container you are using to hold the result instead

385534
oracle	mysql
in mysql there is nothing like rownum what we have in oracle and neither we have row_number what we have in ms sql server nor any other variant

385543
spaces	output
it logs console output and has tons of great addons logs and charts warning counts disk spaces used size build on cm change and a nice web-interface for the team to watch

385547
contains	any
you encapsulate something when you contains it and don t let any of the deals loose

385550
python	tcl
i would not consider alternatives such as python and gtk+ because of all the alternatives out there only tcl and lua were designed from the start to be married to c programs

385550
tcl	lua
both tcl and lua have very simple c apis and you will learn more understand better and be in better control of your application if you learn to use the native api yourself instead of having swig generate code for you

385572
double	int
i need to convert strings in python to other types such as unsigned and signed 8 16 32 and 64 bit int double floats and strings

385660
contains	any
option 2 might not be viable since the textedit can contains any amount of text

385661
highlight	selected
notepad++ has a convenient feature if you selected a word in your text not necessarily a keyword the word is highlight throughout the text

385663
png	gif
very low overhead using png gif format

385666
webforms	asp.net
webforms or asp.net mvc

385669
oracle	mysql
this presumably can be done with to_char since we re dealing with oracle mysql does not support this

385677
histogram	plot
i have a process which generates a data vector from a sensor.i m using intel integrated performance primitives v5.3 update 3 for windows on ia-32 to process it further for some calculations.i want to know if there is any c++ library which allows to plot the vector as a histogram bar chart during data acquisition.i can write the multithreading code but need information on availability of plotting functions in c++

385705
webserver	upload
i have a .net program to upload an image to a webserver

385713
unsigned	integer
assuming you have signed integers in your columns you may need to use cast a b as signed since the result of the operator is an unsigned 64-bit integer in mysql

385732
player	movie
i originally wanted to stream the movie avi mpeg flv etc using a flash media player but after a bit of searching it seems that flash can only stream flv s

385735
lookup	any
but looking for a free or paid service that can do bulk lookup or any reverse-dns tools that you recommend or use

385738
ip-address	hostname
so you d need to resolve the hostname to ip-address which you could do using ping if you wanted to use a shell-script and then jwhois the ip-address which will usually automatically look it up in arin apnic ripe as appropriate

385740
licensing	gpl
also the way the licensing scheme works with spingsource gpl doesn t help much as it practically means that you will be relying only on springsource for now and for the future

385747
declarative	imperative
yes it s imperative rather than declarative and repeats the event name - but it s still pretty compact

385784
checkbox	listbox
this listbox has an associated style to display the answers in the form of radio buttons or checkbox which i would like to hide or show depending on the question type as

385850
swing	awt
for more information about repainting in awt refer to painting in awt and swing

385875
.when	ready
.when you re ready these links may help

385909
radio-button	selected
i like to have a popup modal dialog that need to show the list of options like a radio-button selected event

385909
dialog	pop-up
when i run this no radio-button is shown in the pop-up dialog

385931
exception-handling	try-catch
this means that the developer doesn t have to surround an exception-handling throwing clause inside a try-catch block

385948
required	checked
the limitation i found with the httphandler is that some services pbbs for example required an image link to have an image extension - i got around this by processing all 404 s with an asp.net page that checked for the .jpg extension in the request

385960
any	set
is there any way to tell that o.x is defined and set to undefined

385962
contains	elements
where contains just checks whether any elements in the arrays is x

385994
exception-handling	try-catch
create a try-catch block in the static main that catches every exception-handling and prints it to a logfile

386023
windows-server	windows
however office and windows are way bigger in terms of revenue than windows-server and exchange are

386034
jtapi	tapi
in old era we had a cti computer telephony integration standards like jtapi and tapi for that what are the common standards if any in the era of ip telephony today

386051
compatibility	platform
having them all install gives you a platform free of any compatibility issues

386068
erlang	prolog
now prolog is not just a functional language but an ai language however some time ago i learned erlang which is based on prolog

386070
udp	tcp
the sip communication will use tcp instead of udp because we specified it in the url and your application can look up the account information before you speak with the caller

386071
.net	wcf
first one is to use wcf with .net 3.5 for the service

386113
.net	wcf
the wcf framework is part of .net 3.0 and not .net 3.5 so you don t need .net 3.5 in the clients

386113
credentials	security
the credentials based wcf message security is fulfilling the ws-security 1.1 standard which can also be used with a wse client

386115
private	self
is self a modifier like private in java

386121
triggers	insert
you could use an on insert triggers possibly to send the row right to msmq where your application listens for events as new messages come in

386162
updating	updates
if i selected a row for updating in ms sql-server and want to have it locked till i either updates or cancel which option is better -

386174
administration	credentials
this will always return to false even though i am using the exact same credentials with mysql administration and logging in correctly

386175
http	ssl
http already works over ssl which can authenticate the server encrypt the traffic and with a bit more work authenticate the client

386183
base-class	inherited
now i want the create a instance of generic.ptadao of t with the type of obj which could be anything that inherited from my base-class pta

386185
button	popup
click on the edit... button a new windows will popup

386193
single-sign-on	security
after single-sign-on a major benefit would be to be able to use any ad tools you have to security admin the application report on permissions create acls etc

386200
sql-server	ms-access
my application is written in ms-access i know i know but i have no choice on top of a sql-server backend

386200
sql-server	ms-access
i d prefer this happen through ms-access so i don t have to have a searchme table sitting on my sql-server but any good result is acceptable

386211
value	field
i ve taken a look at the datacontext log and i can see that the field with the zero value is not include in the query

386232
openvz	xen
my other solution was to install xen or openvz and create n different vps per each ip but as you can see is definitely a pita -

386245
sql-server	oracle
i have an asp .net application that connects to an oracle or a sql-server database

386251
ip-address	hostname
this can be an interface name an ip-address or a hostname

386268
dependency-injection	abstract-factory
yes the important ones are dependency-injection and inversion of control but lets not forget the abstract-factory and registries

386281
selected	checkbox
i need one more checkbox by the name selected all

386281
selected	checkbox
when i select this checkbox all checkbox in the html page must be selected

386285
configuration	installation
you as the vendor can give guidance on any relevant configuration and you may get involved in support and possibly installation but ultimately it s up to them to figure out what works for them

386290
selected	button
the link below gives an example using button to de selected all

386290
selected	checkbox
you could try to adapt it to use a checkbox just use you selected all checkbox onclick attribute

386297
reflection	runtime
i have been in a similar situation where i used lots of reflection to create generic objects and call generic methods using types that were not known until runtime

386303
google-chrome	safari
the for each...in construct doesn t seem to work at least in this case in safari 5 or google-chrome 5

386315
base-class	inherited
each of our model classes inherited from an objectbase base-class which include db access functions and change tracking so when someone changes a value through a property the object is automatically marked dirty and notifications are fired to whatever object user-interface has subscribed to those events

386315
contains	any
however much of the code i have been looking at seems to suggest that the model class should not contains any intelligence and should just be a containser for data

386319
google-chrome	opera
hi i m trying to fix a bit of test html to work with opera google-chrome

386319
google-chrome	opera
in google-chrome opera and safari it pushes the sidebar element down

386319
margins	padding
i ve played with the margins and padding but it still doesn t work

386321
selected	checkbox
my requirement is to have one morecheckbox selected all which is used to selected all 5 checkbox

386333
selected	checkbox
create a method that is fired when the selected all checkbox is checked and then find the other checkbox by id and mark them as checked

386333
selected	checkbox
it s unclear what you should do if the selected all checkbox is unchecked though so perhaps it should just be a link

386343
stdin	pipe
note that due to an apparent bug in the subprocess module the call to popen has to specify a pipe for stdin as well which we close immediately afterwards

386345
constructor	private
socket has a constructor that takes a winsock socket as parameter and stores it in a private variables

386362
fogbugz	trac
you also would like to add some lightweight project-management software like fogbugz trac - it does not have to be free but obviously cheaper is better

386367
value	field
linq to sql ignores updates to the current value so if the field was already zero you may not see any updates

386380
export	report
i m paging the table using the storedprocedure paging methods but i need an index because when i want to export the report i need to get the entire query without pagination and to get the total records i need a selected all

386468
fogbugz	svn
i d stick with svn and use trac or bugzilla or fogbugz

386468
fogbugz	svn
bugzilla or trac or fogbugz and svn

386479
hash	md5
md5 hash

386483
scriptaculous	jquery
support for jquery prototype scriptaculous mootools

386498
checkbox	textbox
the first is a textbox column and the second is a checkbox column

386501
firefox	safari
i got it to work in both safari and firefox haven t tested the other browsers yet

386506
actionscript	mxml
i think that i just don t fully understand how data binding works in flex - this is not a problem when using mxml components but when using actionscript classes the binding does not work

386526
order	add
do these relations get added in order or randomly do yours queries come in order as you show them or randomly and is this essentially a batch process -- load them up read off the queries -- or do you expect to do it on line in the sense that you may add some then query some then add some more and query some more

386537
instances	self
you are not in an instances methods so self is the current class object

386562
expression	evaluation
one efficient solution to the problem is to obtain all nickname attributes nodes by evaluation just one single xpath expression

386562
document	element
here we suppose that the ttest elements are children of the top element of the xml document

386571
solaris	linux
we run on linux for this project but generally support solaris and windows too so multiplatform solutions are preferred

386612
directory	folder
or can it be a folder directory on my computer

386614
any	set
i m not finding any articles indicating how to set up a localized project solution in visual-studio

386622
object-reference	instances
i am getting the infamous object-reference not set to instances of an object

386629
png	gif
since the png and gif graphics files are essentially representations of bit patterns perhaps you can find the compression algorithm they use

386631
compression	streaming
also are you sure that there is enough redundancy in those streaming to even allow compression

386631
compression	streaming
i would imagine that the compression scheme in those roms exploited redundancy across many strings ie if timbuktu occurred in 58 different strings and not so much within a single streaming

386640
environment	building
at the end of the day most third-party tool vendors on windows tend to target the ms environment so if you re writing c++ code professionally and need want tools like leak detectors you pretty much need to be able to building with the ms compilers even if they aren t your main development-environment

386646
ironpython	ironruby
silverlight only supports .net languages such as visual basic c# managed javascript ironpython and ironruby

386655
python	java
we are investigating using python for a couple of larger projects and my feeling is that in most cases python is plenty fast enough for most scenarios compared to say java because it relies on optimized c routines

386664
syntax-error	syntax
syntax-error invalid syntax

386665
shadowbox	lightbox
i have an image gallery that is swapping images and i want to link the swapped image to come up even larger in a shadowbox lightbox

386667
spring.net	ninject
unless there s a very good reason i wouldn t go reinvent the wheel and implement a ioc containers myself specially because there are are a lot of good options like unity ninject or spring.net

386671
required	checked
if you re on a domain make sure to note such and make sure that anonymous access is checked if required for your application

386673
swing	awt
as a general tip the painting in awt and swing article describes how you should handle repainting in either awt or swing

386674
python	c++
swig pyrex or boost.python if you re using c++ all provide good mechanisms to do the plumbing for your python interface

386674
python	tcl
the c api for python is more complex than that for tcl or lua but isn t infeasible to build by hand

386674
python	c++
edit in rsponse to dutch masters comment keeping someone with c or c++ programming skills on the team for a python project gives you the option of writing some of the application for speed

386676
integer	zero
maybe zero is the correct answer to a null integer field maybe an error message could go in a text field

386692
any	set
and you can undo to any versions of row without set database to recovery mode

386697
continuum	bamboo
i like to start a discussion about several cis like cc bamboo continuum etc

386697
continuum	bamboo
i had more problems when i tried to build a project with bamboo or continuum

386706
python	java
python integrates easily with c++ natively or with java via jython or with .net via ironpython

386715
32-bit	64bit
when it tries to launch a link to a 64bit binary such as the internet-explorer 64bit shortcut in start menu it always ends up launching the 32-bit binary

386715
32-bit	64bit
a 64bit app resolves this to the 64bit program files directory but a 32-bit app won t

386715
32-bit	64bit
besides going through a 64bit trampoline process which is not an option due to how our plugins architecture works is there any way for a 32-bit app to launch shell links exactly the way a 64bit app would

386726
checkstyle	cobertura
good amount of useful plugins like integrated checkstyle findbugs cobertura and so on - heck we even put continuous-integration game to our hudson

386744
httpwebrequest	webclient
for c# i prefer to use httpwebrequest over webclient because you can have more option in the future like having get post parameter using cookies etc

386752
oracle	mysql
we had some performance issues but those were mostly related more to poor algorithm design or database engine limitations we use oracle ms-sql mysql and had short romance with berkeleydb used for speed optimizations than to python itself

386752
python	c++
as others say - any computation intensive algorithm code that depends on bit-stuffing some memory constrained computation - can be done in raw c c++ for cpu memory saving or any other tricks but the whole user interaction logging database handling error handling - all that makes the application actually run can be written in python and it will maintain responsiveness and decent overall performance

386779
virtual-machine	virtualbox
if all else fails it s always possible to create a virtual-machine using virtualbox or something similar and do a full windows install on the linux machine to run your software

386791
contains	any
parent and child here indicate the relationship the two classes would have if you were using inheritance. the containing child class must then wrap the interface of the contains parent class to expose any functionality of the contains class

386810
version-control	cvs
support for lots of version-control systems i ve used it with cvs svn and starteam

386822
order	join
the server already has to do all the join and stuff which is typically the hard part then has to order the result set the way you specified then finally takes the 1000 first results

386826
32-bit	64bit
this works fine on 32-bit machines both xp and vista but on 64bit vista don t have x64 xp to test with the redrawing just isn t working properly

386826
32-bit	64bit
edit2 running a 32-bit xp virtual-machine on my 64bit machine and the application doesn t exhibit the redrawing issue in the vm

386826
nvidia	ati
a co-worker says there s fewer issues with an ati card at home than with nvidia but i ve been updating my video drivers pretty much monthly for the past few months and it s still not resolved so we can t just release our product and just tell our customers that some day the driver manufacturers may get around to fixing this

386835
bug-tracking	redmine
redmine for bug-tracking and wiki

386835
redmine	trac
redmine is an open source ruby on ruby-on-rails application that supports multiple projects much better than trac and seems to be much easier to administer

386853
png	gif
have you tried using a gif or png

386853
png	gif
the format of the image must be one of png a w3c standard gif or ico

386870
firefox	opera
i can see it in firefox and opera too as is

386871
32-bit	64bit
i ve seen issues where brand new 64bit machines had display issues with programs that looked fine under 32-bit but would exhibit odd issues on 64bit machines

386874
scp	ssh
the suggestion to copy a dumpfile using scp with the -l flag is a good one but i should note that i don t have ssh access to the database server

386885
jsonp	ajax
ajax comet jsonp and all that jazz are serious overkill

386889
versioning	upgrade
the very important thing is to make sure not to let the licenses lapse as the renewals on licenses cost a fraction of the initial cost and also include versioning upgrade

386903
constructor	object
as claudiu have pointed out in a comment below the above code doesn t work if you assign the constructor to the same object it has created

386904
content-disposition	content-type
as explained by alex s link you re probably missing the header content-disposition on top of content-type

386934
linux	osx
because this application is used on windows osx and linux we ve defined environment variables to properly map volumes from the different file systems

386936
any	set
this way you only need 1 set of queries to crud any particular content type since the data passed to the crud functions is just blindly serialization

386937
unique	words
they have two tables the first is a unique list of all the words that appear in entries and the second is a many-to-many reference between the words and the entries

386945
execution	jobs
i already set up a user for execution the folding home jobs hoping that i could limit him with the etc security limits.conf file

386948
numerical	matrix
maxima is a system for the manipulation of symbolic and numerical expressions including differentiation integration taylor series laplace transforms ordinary differential equations systems of linear equations polynomials and sets lists vectors matrix and tensors

386948
arbitrary-precision	numeric
maxima yields high precision numeric results by using exact fractions arbitrary-precision integers and variables precision floating point numbers

386948
polynomials	algebra
mathomatic is a free portable general-purpose cas computer algebra systemd and calculator software that can symbolically solve simplify combine and compare equations perform complex number and polynomials arithmetic etc

386948
simulink	matlab
scilab is a numerical computation system similiar to matlab or simulink

386956
webforms	asp.net
for someone starting on web development coming from the asp.net side i would strongly recommend asp.net mvc like the guy before me did it is closer to real web development than webforms and it promotes though it doesn t guarantee a more elegant architecture

386967
contains	any
there s a reason that in sql-server any expression contains a null term evaluates to null

386967
coalesce	isnull
if one of the terms in an expression is null the result of the expression is meaningless - unless the expression explicitly indicates via isnull or coalesce what to do if the term is null

386988
parentheses	braces
with many non-us keyboard layouts typing square brackets or braces is even more cumbersome than typing parentheses anyway which makes programming in most languages very strainful so consider yourself lucky

386996
innodb	myisam
the fulltext search-engine is only available for the myisam engine not innodb which is the most commonly used engine due to its referential integrity and acid compliance

386996
innodb	sphinx
often what is done to keep the innodb referential integrity acid compliance and speed without having to install plugins like sphinx fulltext search-engine for mysql is to split the quote data into it s own table

386996
innodb	myisam
basically you would have a table quotes that is an innodb table that rather than having your text field data you have a reference quote_data_id which points to the id on a quote_data table which is a myisam table

386996
innodb	myisam
you can do your fulltext on the myisam table join the ids returned with your innodb tables and voila you have your results

387000
constructor	object
you want to create a new object by calling the constructor

387020
put	get
then use with rcov and you will get some very readable out put that will tell you what files have 0 usage

387048
ssl-certificate	ssl
if you are trying with ssl enabled and you are not getting a pop up box about accepting the tree ca s trusted root certficate then perhaps the ca or the ssl-certificate taht the edirectory server is user has expired or is broken

387060
emacs	vim
same environment will work on solaris as well but this is of course force you to use vim as editor i pretty sure that emacs can work with both ctags and cscope as well

387060
driver	kernel
it s might be more complex depending on the type of driver your are porting i m assuming kernel driver the windows and solaris subsystems are not so alike

387076
object-reference	instances
i get an object-reference not set to an instances of an object. error when running the above code because i guess field.fieldtyperow.fieldtypelabel isn t actually part of the query of data

387091
constructor	object
type safety the constructor orderedpair object object belongs to the raw type orderedpair

387093
selected	button
i ve tried using the browse button to selected the reference instead of picking from the list windows but that adds a gac reference too

387111
instances	private
if you care a lot about security for instances if you are storing private user data such as credit cards you should definitely use openssl or some other secure implementation instead of rolling your own

387116
32-bit	64bit
i run vista 64 and the other members of my team run xp 32-bit the only issue we ve had so far was with a third party com-component where the interop assembly wasn t easy to generate on the 64bit machine

387124
webforms	asp.net
recommended by the asp.net team to use cache instead of session we stopped using session from working with the webforms model the last few years

387128
order	add
dave and others i tried implementing your code and it is choking on the first order by clause where we add all the counts

387130
mathml	latex
i d like this page to collect and monitor the best import export tools for latex to .doc .rtf or to other useful html mathml formats

387150
frame	width
through experimentation i have seen that the iphone will refuse to draw a frame that is bigger than 2000 pixels in either height or width

387157
forwarding	port
it s not a simple port the code forwarding and get the benefits scenario

387158
functional-programming	imperative
functional-programming exists far outside the mainstream which slows down the crossover of programmers from imperative languages to f#

387169
any	set
you don t explain what should happen if more than one result matches any given set of parameters that is reached so you will need to change this to account for those business rules

387171
order	add
then add this order by and get the first row returned

387182
openoffice.org	acrobat
for latex to word you can go through rtf with tex2rtf not so good or through adobe acrobat which can produce pdf that word can read not good either or go through html as above but best is to use tex4ht which can generate openoffice.org odt format from which conversion to word is easy

387188
value	field
indexing a field really only works if a your where-clause is selective enough that is only selected out about 1-2 of the value

387188
value	field
an index on a gender field which can be only one of two or three possible value is pointless and b your where-clause doesn t involve function calls or other magic

387191
.when	ready
this is one of the things that we suggest to our customers .when they are ready to launchd but need data

387217
sql-server	postgresql
p.s i was considering postgresql 8.3 until i did some benchmarking and found out that sql-server 2005 express is much faster for my needs better integration i guess

387255
bluetooth	usb
will tell you how to programmatically read messages contacts agenda and send them over usb or bluetooth

387266
defined	declare
the problem is that when you try to call setstate inside of lockedstate coin the class unlockedstate is an incomplete type it has been declare but not defined

387267
getter	setter
and if you re coding in c# automatic setter and getter are a boon

387273
hide	show
the way i have accomplished this is by creating a user-controls with exposed show and hide methods

387291
filtering	grouping
for example if you have 55 000 rows returned for the report and the report server then has to grouping sort and or filtering those rows to render the report then that could take additional time

387291
filtering	grouping
i would have a look at the way the data is being grouping and filtering in the report then review your stored procedure to see if you could offload some of that processing to the sql code maybe using some parameters

387291
filtering	grouping
try and aim to reduce the the amount of rows returned to the report to be the minimum needed to render the report and preferably try to avoid doing the grouping and filtering in the report itself

387304
authentication	login
for the def authentication user pass function i try to get ldap to bind to the domain using their credentials if i catch an exception then the login failed otherwise let them in

387309
directory	folder
task under directory home i have various users home folder aaa bbb ccc .

387335
compatibility	legacy
if the choice is between sql-server 2005 and sql-server 2008 with no legacy compatibility issues you should probably go with sql-server 2008

387339
oracle	mysql
i am pretty well versed with sql server mysql oracle etc but putting these database products aside is there a resource that will help me design relational databases well

387350
windows-xp	windows
since i develop on a mac i m a switcher after 20 years on windows and very happy having done so i test the sites in firefox 3 and safari 3 on my os x machine on a windows-xp vm i test firefox 2 ie6 7 and 8 using ietester plus whichever other browser i want such as opera and chrome

387352
google-chrome	mobile-safari
when the user creates a home screen shortcut for the site it will launch in fullscreen mode separate from the normal mobile-safari application and without the url bar or other google-chrome

387356
xsd	xml
and i don t mean like the xsd.exe utility does - all that does is convert the xml of an xsd file into classes in a .vb - it doesn t append any extended functionality

387367
specifications	w3c
personally i feel as long as your html validates to w3c specifications isn t that all that matters

387367
markup	tidy
html validator plugins for firefox aka tidy is all any web developer needs to see if their markup is correct what s wrong and where it s wrong

387367
google-chrome	firefox
even if you could do true debugging each browser parses html it s own way so even if you could step through firefox to see how a rendering bug occurs that won t help you with ie or safari google-chrome at all because they execute parsing in their own manner

387383
linux	unix
if in unix linux replace th4e 1 2 with 1 2 and make sure your app has execute rights if you don t know how to do this i guess you don t need it either

387389
webserver	host
i created a webservice when it hosted on my local computer it works fine but when i publish it to the web host it doesnt work any more i guess its a question about how the webserver is configured but can i make some changes in web.config so it will work

387395
checkbox	button
on the advanced options button there is a checkbox called refresh the data table

387420
double-quotes	single-quotes
assuming all three double-quotes are required and using single-quotes in the sql - much easier in this context

387421
textbox	button
i have a small application to convert several file formats with a main windows form which contains several textbox button etc

387437
progress-bar	progress
it allows you to update the user-interface thread with progress notifications so you can update your progress-bar to show realistic values something much more user-friendly than having a marquee style progress-bar

387450
preserve	copying
you can only preserve the owner and grouping if you do the copying operation as root

387451
rhino-mocks	moq
this would allow mock-ing of objects using free tools like moq or rhino-mocks but it could potentially open up security risks for classes that were never meant to be derived from

387451
default-value	return-type
i could create a tool that given an input assembly would output an assembly with the same namespaces classes and members but would make all of the methodss virtual and it would make the methods body just return the default-value for the return-type

387463
height	frame
you can change the frame like this where height is the number of pixels the tableview will take up between its origin and the top of the keyboard

387466
required	checked
i d like to be able to checked if the required fields in the form aren t filled so i can inform the user

387475
enterprise	platform
more recently i ve been involved in the selection of an integration platform to serve in an enterprise service bus pattern

387487
google-chrome	firefox
you would have to punch a hole in the firewall to use a new browser like firefox or google-chrome

387488
logout	login
but now when i logout and login again it still has the value how can i reset the value of the cookie to be blank when i start a new instance

387493
temporary	copy
rework your data-structures so the compiler isn t inclined to copy huge temporary objects around

387494
order	join
therefore it should lookup the data to do the record insert but should never join to the lookup table to get information about an existing order

387500
arrays	loops
yuliy is right the 320kb buffer is likely an arrays 20 of whatever is returned by channelmeasset - based on the size of the rep movsd loops

387502
wicket	spring
it s probably being used more than wicket but less than spring asp.net-mvc at least from conversations with my own peers

387534
firefox	safari
for firefox and safari the first condition is true for ie7 the second condition is true but for ie6 it falls to the last condition

387541
configuration	installation
as part of the installation process the user could skip the oracle software installation or customize it and the user could customize override the database configuration in all of its major details database schemas tablespaces sizes disks etc.

387541
sql-server	oracle
back to the insurance claims processing product--let me please add that i was originally hired to lead its conversion from a sql-server database to an oracle

387545
base-class	inherited
i would also include a string to define the assembly class i wanted to run in that configuration as well and make sure that assembly had a class that either inherited from a base-class or implemnented an interface so i could load it up as a known type and execute a known methods called something like execute

387577
contains	any
ok thought i understood idipose but just reading the best practices section of accelerated vb.net and it states that the object doesn t contains any objects that implement idispose so you don t need to iterate through the containsment tree calling idispose

387585
any	set
but are you trying to set cookie from any other place

387589
arrays	loops
and then loops over the resulting arrays calling compare on each component of the string

387590
ruby	php
i assume you can use silverlight to talk to a .net java php ruby python whatever backend through soap rest plain xml over http as you can with adobe flex and javafx

387595
value	field
whether it s parameterized sql filling in all columns except primary key in my code or even running insert into securityuser username value ch00k from server explorer it s always a primary key constraint in this case the primary key is securityuserid and i have double checked that it is an auto increment field and it always works and keeps working once i ve opened the table in visual-studio

387607
getter	setter
if you plan to set and or change these value dynamically during execution then use class-variables with getter and setter

387616
json	xml
otherwise xml or json are adequate file formats

387618
any	set
i m not as familiar with .net but with web apps in general you need to make sure that you set your response headers before writing out any body otherwise they may not be sent

387626
children	nodes
in c# 2.0 does anyone know how to display the count of children nodes like outlook does with unread email

387627
json	xml
you could even use xml json an .ini file.

387630
value	field
if they don t use a hashtable or generally dictionary implementation and just omit the value field

387632
progress-bar	progress
it allows you to update the user-interface thread with progress notifications so you can update your progress-bar to show realistic values something much more user-friendly than having a marquee style progress-bar

387633
exception-handling	error-handling
how should exception-handling be dispatched so that error-handling and diagnostics can be handled in a centralized user-friendly manner

387633
exception-handling	error-handling
the proper error-handling strategy depends on the type of exception-handling and the operation being attempted

387636
updating	updates
so my question is when i have an attached entity in linq-to-entities and i want to save some updates say i m updating the name in this case

387654
memmove	memcpy
i have experimented with memmove and memcpy and can t replicate this behavior

387654
memmove	memcpy
why do memmove and memcpy behave this way

387656
aes	des
but remember that block algorithms such as aes and des work with 8 or 16 byte blocks so you will need to pad the arrays to what the algorithm needs

387671
memmove	memcpy
why do memmove and memcpy behave this way

387673
cryptography	security
these are serious hardcore cryptography algorithms judged by security experts

387679
entity-relationship	diagram
i would highly recommend learning how to put together a simple entity-relationship diagram

387702
stderr	stdout
it would have to apply automatically to stdout and probably stderr too

387702
stderr	stdout
if you use any of the features of io handle with your tied stdout or stderr it s basically a crapshoot to get them working reliably - i could not find a way to get the autoflush methods of io handle to work on my tied handle

387711
value	field
otherwise i suppose you can update the field value in the ondatabound event

387717
any	set
the default maxrequestlength set in the machine.config is 4096 which should accommodate any posting in a form

387720
shell	bash
bash shell script version no sed awk

387739
chdir	mkdir
that is _stricmp _chdir _mkdir _getcwd instead of stricmp chdir mkdir getcwd etc.

387741
order	join
one thread probably the main thread will create and start these worker threads and then perform a join on all the workers in order to wait for processing to complete

387759
contains	any
if you open and close your connection inside of the update function and your dataset contains a thousand items then you will destroy the performance of your application and ruin any transactional capabilities

387762
version-control	git
if you like git as a version-control system you could take a look at gitorious.org for hosting

387768
png	gif
i would really like to use a png instead of gif or jpeg

387773
memmove	memcpy
memmove and memcpy don t work that way because it s not a useful semantic for moving or copying memory

387775
r5rs	r6rs
this seems to be the case in both r5rs and r6rs

387776
32-bit	64bit
if you need to surpass the available usermode address space there are 64bit systems at your disposal or 32-bit with extensions such as pae

387780
recurring-billing	payment-gateway
hi i m looking for a payment-gateway that can do recurring-billing that changes month to month

387783
value	field
the calculation of the marging value for each transaction is carried out by concrete implementations of an abstract margincalculator class and the concrete implementation to be used depends on the type of the product for the particular transaction given by a certain field of the product object

387790
any	set
im not sure of any payment gateway that does this natively however you can set up the recurring billing profiling then modify it in your code as needed

387800
buffering	streaming
it has been quite a while since i worked with barcode scanners but i doubt they have changed that much the older ones used to just piggyback on the keyboard input so from a programming perspective the .net result was a streaming of characters in the keyboard buffering either typed or scanned made no difference

387834
exception-handling	error-handling
it uses exception-handling for error-handling - i modified it to provide return codes in a mater of minutes

387843
google-chrome	firefox
the first argument in a w3c-compliant browser google-chrome firefox safari ie9+

387865
value	field
i m writing a custom validator that checks that at least one field has a value

387879
contains	set
the users session is stored in the database the cookies that i set on each domain contains the session id

387879
firefox	opera
now i have found a way to do this in firefox using image tags that executes php scripts on the other domains essentially creating the different cookies on the different domains but this method doesn t work in ie havn t tested opera or safari etc

387885
scheme	lisp
i recommend everybody to learn lisp scheme or smalltalk

387885
visualworks	squeak
and yes there are more than one free ones squeak dolphin smalltalk x and visualworks non-comercial

387921
globalization	localization
i have a page that i use with globalization localization and i am redirecting via server not code from www.spanishversion.com to www.englishversion.com but the url is masked to still say www.spanishversion.com

387988
maya	mel
before maya 8 the only scripting language available was the built in mel maya expression language

388002
attributes	properties
for attributes whose type is an immutable value class that conforms to the nscopying protocol you almost always should specify copy in your properties declaration

388002
attributes	properties
since in almost all cases you want to prevent mutating an object s attributes behind its back you should mark the properties representing them copy

388006
associations	model
not to mention that if you had several columns in different model that needed this behavior you d either have to create lots of these objects ex stock_positions stock_actions transaction_kinds etc... or you d have to design it generically enough to use polymorphic associations

388017
.when	ready
.when you clear the semaphore it will become ready to run again

388023
any	set
however the methods is not implemented anywhere because the delegate is not set for the myeaglview in any of those samples

388028
sigaction	signals
if you are using linux check the portability section of the signals manpage and the sigaction manpage which is preferred

388049
visualworks	squeak
in multiplatform smalltalk vms go for visualworks or squeak

388049
scheme	lua
well there are a lot of more to get your hands on scheme lisp ruby lua bash

388062
installation	building
is that something i m going to have to wrapper around say an nsis installer building scripting or are there hybrid administration management installation tools

388063
variables	boolean
i added an explicit type conversion dt_bool to my boolean variables that was part of my expressions and the error went away

388068
expression	evaluation
you can use the identexpr option to specify indent by evaluation an expression writing a vim scripting function

388084
value	field
on another note if you find a text field works you can use it to display static text by putting your text in quotes in the text field value making it a java object

388092
combinations	permutation
usually you have to take into account permutation of how your types interact with each other 1 types is fine 1 x 2 is fine by 3 you have 6 ways to manipulate your types by 4 you have 24 combinations to choose from so you should take this complexity into account as well

388099
mouseleave	mouseenter
is adding another image inside the stack panels and then setting it s visibility to visible the right approach on mouseenter and then swapping back on mouseleave

388102
transfer-encoding	chunked
the reason of this is because the request is been sent with a transfer-encoding chunked header instead of a content-length header

388121
boolean	int
i picked miniature_count over owns for the name because owns sounds like a methods that should return a boolean instead of an int

388134
value	field
this will give a list of the matches indicating which is a person and which a venue and allow you to then selected one of those and open a detail view by checking the value in the third field

388162
32-bit	64bit
it places the release of commodore in the middle of 2009 with features including cross-compilation targeting native 64bit code from a 32-bit ide

388165
memmove	memcpy
finally memcpy memmove aren t what you are looking for those are for making copies of blocks of memory from from area to another memmove allows source and dest to be part of the same buffering

388168
delphi	c++
it mentions delphi tiburon due 2009 which has extra features which is followed by c++ with those same features and hopefully 64-bit support

388193
prawnto	prawn
i think that the way to go for reporting in ruby ruby-on-rails is using the prawn and prawnto libraries

388206
children	tree
many of the object in the model have children in large lists or tree

388219
authentication	login
you can also store the same persistent cookie for authentication users for displaying times before they login

388223
google-chrome	firefox
and this is how it displays in firefox 3 google-chrome 1.0 and ie7 click for full size

388235
.when	ready
.when your calculation thread is ready to output to the buffering it would grab the mutex write to the transfer buffering and release the mutex

388235
.when	ready
.when your transmit thread was ready to send a packets it would try to lock the mutex

388253
compact-framework	.net
as of v1.7 the dotnetzip distribution now includes a version built specifically for the .net compact-framework either v2.0 or v3.5

388264
installation	upgrade
for example i ve setup netbeans flexbuilder eclipse textmate vmware fusion openoffice firefox dragged terminal.app to my dock upgrade the ruby installation and related gems and so on.

388264
macports	fink
macports or fink

388265
arrays	map
if you write your 2d arrays well you can actually use a single arrays and just map two-dimensional addresses into a single index

388269
emacs	vim
if you re an emacs vim user there s aquamacs and macvim

388276
virtualbox	vmware
you ve already done everything i have except i m using virtualbox instead of vmware

388277
keyboard	mouse
another tip is to get a decent keyboard and mouse

388277
keyboard	mouse
get yourself a real keyboard and a real mouse with multiple button

388295
python	c++
python c++ scheme and others all let you define functions that take a variable number of arguments at the end of the argument list.

388295
optional-arguments	arguments
also what about optional-argumentss anywhere in the arguments list

388297
ubuntu	linux
i m a .net developer and been asp programmer for more than 10 years so all i did was microsoft related never ever aparat of installing and playing with ubuntu i had experience in the linux world

388304
constructor	object
when i thought about it i came to the thought that a copy constructor would not be useful if one needs to make a copy of an object whose type is not known as in having a reference to a base type

388305
sigaction	signals
a set of default signals handler are install by the os when your program begins but you can install a custom signals handler using sigaction

388313
selected	listbox
when a listbox is focused and an item is selected that item s background is systemcolors.highlightbrush

388313
selected	listbox
when the listbox loses focus however the selected item s background becomes systemcolors.controlbrush

388314
cursor	row
this command sets the positioning row column of the cursor as well as specifying the cursor size start stop and whether it is actually visible cursor

388315
superclass	subclass
especially problems where a subclass does not implement clone but inherits from a superclass that implements cloneable

388324
python	perl
look through their catalog and install all the usual packages you re used to from linux or other systems -- including development-related stuff like flex bison emacs doxygen m4 perl python etc

388328
selected	checkbox
the goal is to make the checkbox checked if there s a change on selected

388328
selected	checkbox
for example if i selected a value in the second checkbox it should fire an event to check that element box

388329
any	set
since it s based from the functional-programming model the map and reduce steps each do not have any side-effects the state and results from each subsection of a map process does not depend on another so the data set being mapped and reduced can each be separated over multiple processing nodes

388344
code-coverage	ncover
in the target do-unit-tests i set up which test assemblies are run by setting a property and calling for ncover to do a code-coverage run as follows

388345
integration	bpm
but and that s a bit but in my view developing with biztalk is somewhat difficult not because microsoft did a bad job at it on the contrary - developing with biztalk is somewhat difficult because microsoft wanted to create a tool that could realistically allow enterprises to solve their bpm and integration needs well and in my experience these problems are almost never simple so microsoft had built a server that has many capabilities is very strong and very flexible at the cost of complexity

388345
integration	bpm
if however you believe as is often the case that your solution would grow to become a bpm integration platform in your organisation and you need something more robust - i would put my money on biztalk being a better candidate

388359
bazaar	git
but bazaar is really slow and i m thinking of moving to git

388379
order	add
please add order to your data-members

388389
mbunit	nunit
it adds to nunit the rowtest feature from mbunit

388394
liferay	jboss
each container liferay jboss etc. has its own internal way of differentiating between multiple instantiations of the same portlet

388402
any	set
another idea that comes to my mind is if you use any templating system like tiles as you are mentioning jsp but velocity or others come to mind you shouldn t have too many points where you d have to set the buffer size from jsps

388422
macports	fink
i second macports it is more up to date than fink and closer to the freebsd ports system where i come from

388431
contains	any
similar checks are not possible on the other fields since they can pretty much contains any thinkable string

388439
protected	public
since object.clone is protected rewriting it in the interface would force all implementers to provide a public implementation which class designers might not want to they might opt to keep it protected

388442
pointers	stack
saves stack pointers and then

388445
python	perl
several languages perl python many others can do named arguments which are akin to doing optional arguments anywhere in the parameter list.

388448
contains	any
the cloneable interface doesn t contains any members

388448
protected	public
a better design would be to have something like .net s memberwiseclone as a protected methods in object and then a public clone methods within the interface itself

388465
ref	out
ref is in and out

388467
ref	out
ref tells the compiler that the object is initializer before entering the function while out tells the compiler that the object will be initializer inside the function

388467
ref	out
so while ref is two-ways out is out-only

388485
rhino-mocks	moq
it s good and balanced though slightly dated it mentions rhino-mocks as a sidebar and doesnt mention moq - even if nothing is actually incorrect

388492
png	gif
this is especially lame for creating a web based game using png or gif sprites

388499
safari	opera
i think if you look at safari and opera you ll find they also filtering the image

388559
jtapi	tapi
for example cisco ip phones can be controlled using tapi and jtapi integration into their call manager pbxs

388570
testdriven.net	gallio
why doesnt testdriven.net work with my gallio mbunit tests

388587
python	lua
one can always use lunatic python and access scipy inside lua

388601
firefox	opera
according to mozilla opacity has been supported since firefox 0.9 opera 9 and safari 1.2 and filtering since ie4

388602
perl	c++
as for bad languages people use c++ perl and php for web applications

388638
required	checked
to transmit 1000 blocks 10 000 checked bits overhead are required

388642
value	field
i have a repeater that should show a bound field value only if it exists

388658
google-chrome	safari
since you are on windows anyway you could try using the inbuilt javascript debugger of google-chrome which is a browser very similar to safari although the javascript engine is different

388682
compact-framework	.net
if you want to use .net you can use a windows mobile phone and use the messageinterceptor class with .net compact-framework

388715
worksheet	excel
how do you transfer a worksheet from one excel app 1 to another 2 if you have two excel apps open using vba

388717
windows-xp	windows
wpf requires either windows vista or windows-xp sp2 which is not an onerous requirement but it is a relevant one

388755
silverlight	wpf
wpf also shares a lot in common with silverlight so it has transferable benefits

388817
aspect-ratio	scale
in order to scale the image to be full bleed and maintain the aspect-ratio you can do this instead

388817
internet-explorer	firefox
i ve tested it in firefox webkit and internet-explorer 8

388827
ildasm	cil
i ve done a lot of static analysis in .net cil last year and the best way to go is to use ildasm or any disassembly that will give you some quite easy to parsing il language text file

388830
vb.net	vba
that being said the frameworks which you use to access data are quite different in the c# and vba worlds they re even quite different betwween vb.net and vba

388874
space	input
what i m looking for is an algorithm that takes as input timed periodic measurements of the available space alternative suggestions for input are welcome and produces as output an alarm when things are abnormal and the file system is likely to fill up

388879
order	add
then you should add your oledb parameters just like you already have but you have to be careful to add them in the same order they appear in you sql command

388885
background-color	transparency
the background-color chosen to represent the transparency pixels

388922
short	zero
you have short term bursts of activity which average out to zero and long term trends superimposed that you are interested in

388930
freebsd	debian
i can find it on debian and freebsd

388937
pixels	line
of course i could count the number of newlines and add newlines lineheight and then -given that i manage to put 60 chars per line just divide the number of chars and add as many lineheight pixels as needed

388958
any	set
set up correctly this can ensure you have the ability to rebuild any release from any point in time exactly as it was shipped but that furthermore you don t need to do that as every binary you#ve ever generated is source-controlled

388973
value	field
more importantly if the user enters a value in one of the 100 field that causes the backend to not store value out of range what happens

388976
lightbox	jquery
if its not possible using the lightbox v2.04 then what other ways can i accomplish the shadowing overlayed flash video pop-up with jquery and or prototype

388984
random-seed	generator
i would think that if you could generator an initial random-seed periodically once per day or hour or whatever you could use a fast stream cipher to generator random numbers from successive chunks of the stream if the stream cipher uses xor then just pass in a stream of nulls or grab the xor bits directly

389003
triggers	insert
you can add a triggers that checks how many rows are being updated count the insert magic triggers table and raiseerror if that s too many rows

389012
parentheses	operators
the parentheses are the grouping operators to allow you to extract the information you want

389018
environment	building
and building it in your working environment as far as i know it support wide variety of platforms architectures

389019
put	get
basically the global.asax file doesn t actually get compiled so vs2008 put in a fix to prevent you from modifying it since your modifications will have no effect

389024
python	java
let s take e.g jruby it s ruby + java then there are things to embed ruby in python or the other way

389024
python	php
let s say your write all for python but do implement a bridge to php

389039
inherited	subclass
the joined subclass mapping in particular i think you will find helpful assuming wibbleextended inherited from wibble

389045
derived-class	base-class
usually base-class derived-class pattern is used when you have an interface in base-class and that interface is implemented in derived-class is-a relationship

389045
derived-class	base-class
in your case the base-class does not seem to have any connection with derived-class - it may as well be void

389045
base-class	inherited
if there is no connection between base-class and derived class why do you use inherited

389050
firefox	opera
i know that microsoft isn t developing it any further and that firefox safari opera and camino all run on mac and from my stats they are most used in that order .

389062
python	java
java is certainly nice but i ve been doing just fine with python and qt via pyqt4 lately

389062
swing	swt
i find that i get things done faster than i did in swing or swt too

389068
pyside	pyqt
the python bindings for this pyqt have not been re-licensed but another project called pyside has been created to provide python qt bindings

389084
python	tcl
java python tcl tk c#.

389088
scheme	lisp
if you have a chance i would recommand getting a copy of lisp scheme and doing some projects in it

389094
methods	extend
i d like to extend it with a join methods

389117
contains	elements
the spec states that a is an inline elements so it can t contains a nested list

389175
debian	linux
debian linux 2.6 webserver

389191
put	get
then selected it from your new database this at least ensures you can get back what you put in

389212
average	minimum
minimum peak or average

389216
dictionary	arrays
in the 10 years i ve been programming i can count the number of data structures i ve used on one hand arrays linked lists i m lumping stacks and queues in with this and dictionary

389216
linked-list	heap
i ve never needed to use a red-black tree skip list double-ended queue circularly linked-list priority queue heap graphs or any of the dozens of exotic data structures that have been researched in the past 50 years

389224
order	add
as others have pointed out oledb does not use named parameters so you should actually be using the following ensuring that you add parameters to your oledbcommand in the same order they appear in the sql statement

389225
exception-handling	error-handling
in both cases you would need to invoke some error-handling code and it seems to me exception-handling are just the ticket

389229
data-structures	dictionary
dictionary and list are the main data-structures we use

389231
dictionary	arrays
for example an ordered dictionary data structure an associative arrays that alows sorted traversal by keys is as likely as not to be implemented using a red-black tree

389231
data-structures	tree
many data-structures splay tree come to mind are interesting for their optimal behaviour in certain circumstances temporal locality of reference in the case of splay tree so they are mainly relevant for use in these cases

389232
iteration	elements
i ve just finished reading java generics and collections -- the generics part hurts my head but the collections part was useful they point out some of the difference between skip-lists and tree both can implement maps sets skip-lists give you built-in constant time iteration from one elements to the next tree are o log n and are much simpler for implementing lock-free algorithms in multithreading situations

389236
data-structures	tree
if you use stl map or set data-structures then you are probably using a red-black tree without even knowing it

389238
compact-framework	.net
i installed the windows mobile 6 professional sdk as well as the .net compact-framework 3.5 runtime on the device and all that worked fine

389251
cos	sin
or since a 90â sin a 1 and sin b sin 90â - x cos x

389251
cosine	sine
that means you convert the distance travelled into an angle a take the sine of that multiplying by the cosine of the course directions and take the arcsine of the result

389320
32-bit	64bit
i would still consider making a small trampoline application who s only job was to launch the given application link and compiling a different one for use on 32-bit and 64bit systems

389320
32-bit	64bit
either that or build two versions of your application a 32-bit and 64bit one

389322
optional-arguments	arguments
0 or more mandatory arguments followed by 0 or more optional-arguments followed by 0 or more mandatory arguments followed by rest arguments followed by 0 or more mandatory arguments

389322
optional-arguments	arguments
then optional-arguments get bound and if any arguments are left over they get bundled up in an arrays and bound to the rest argument

389326
updating	updates
suppose you re updating a customer s address and need to touch on another database your updates ... methods in your customermanager class then can call both databases inside of the methods

389327
pixels	line
cocoa doesn t have any way to draw a single pixels to a view other than faking it by using a line with a length of 1 pixels like this question mentions

389338
unmanaged	c++-cli
if you need native c++ then you can create an assembly that include managed and unmanaged c++ directly from visual-studio the native c++ calls c++-cli which then calls through to your vb.net

389341
keyboard	mouse
i ve tried the keyboardnavigation.directionalnavigation cycle but that doesnt seem to do anything for me and i was grasping at straws since this has nothing to do with the keyboard it s all mouse based

389346
business-objects	data-access
create the data-access code and business-objects

389346
business-objects	data-access
i would typically split data-access and business-objects business logic and presentation web site winforms into their own projects plus anything that i might want to re-use at a later date also goes in its own project

389352
pthreads	fork
speaking of platform-dependent recipes on windows use createprocess on pthreads linux mac use fork + execvp

389389
mousedown	mouseup
there are mousedown and mouseup events that you can handle to get a similar effect

389389
keydown	keyup
you ll have to do that with a keydown and keyup event

389389
mousedown	mouseup
also be aware that a mousedown event may not ever be followed by a mouseup event if the user moves the mouse after pressing down to a point where it is no longer over the button

389389
mousedown	mouseup
you can capture the mouse in mousedown to guarantee you get the mouseup event i think

389390
constructor	object
if you call a function with the new keyword that function becomes a constructor and the this keyword will not point to the current object but instead to a newly created empty one

389390
constructor	object
in that way javascript constructor can take on one of the roles of classes in traditional class-based oo serving as a templates or blueprint for new object

389396
sharepoint-designer	sharepoint-list
i m using sharepoint-designer to insert a data view on to the master page then dropping the custom sharepoint-list on it from the data source library

389397
mousedown	mouseup
there are mousedown and mouseup attached events available

389398
python	php
i have tried probably all combinations of encode decode within python and php

389409
google-chrome	firefox
if you look in the firefox application directory wherever you installed it on your system you ll see a google-chrome directory with a bunch of .jar files

389415
sftp	ftp
i m sending a file from a mainframe host to a linux ftp sever using sftp

389438
onmousedown	onmouseup
that didn t work so then i thought maybe it s actually the onmouseup or onmousedown events that triggers the anchor tag so i added a clickswallow methods to onmouseup and onmousedown methodss

389439
datagridview	databound
i have databound datagridview in a desktop app with columns that have their tooltiptext property set yet no tool tip is displayed when i hover over gridview cells or cell headers

389450
contains	any
this way i can have any contains page react to changes in a user-controls without having to do a partial or full postback

389451
google-chrome	firefox
if a user leaves their browser windows open to this page for about 45-60 minutes then attempting to navigate elsewhere will cause ie v7 for sure v6 as well i believe firefox or google-chrome do not have this issue to display the following popup

389451
profiling	debugging
i ve seen that in a similar question someone suggested using ibm page profiling to debugging this issue

389456
sniffing	traffic
results of sniffing the http traffic on get someform.asp response there s a valid per-session set-cookie header but on post process.asp request there is no cookie header at all

389461
methods	extend
either way i would extend object class and create a methods for this purpose

389496
freebsd	linux
what are some alternatives to make for linux freebsd

389497
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
you can also subclassing uiscrollviewcontroller and override the touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended methods

389502
webforms	asp.net
i would tend to stay away from the webforms model and use asp.net mvc

389572
order	add
inside columns section of gridview add dynamiccontrol controls with the datafield attributes value to the name of your column in the order you want

389574
webforms	asp.net
now i m assuming that you will be building a webforms application because webforms technology in asp.net is more mature has better third-party support and has far more documentation

389574
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you are inclined to asp.net-mvc then just keep in mind that a good design will be one or the other - asp.net-mvc isn t a part of webforms it is an alternative to it

389574
.when	ready
while true that isn t really the advantage - the advantage comes down the road .when you are ready to learn and do unit-testing

389574
linqdatasource	sqldatasource
if you don t use a business layer then you ll use sqldatasource or linqdatasource objects to access your data directly from the user-interface

389578
contains	elements
the ul#remapped query is the elements in my code that contains the new structure and then i did some additional querying again based on my dom structure to extract the values i needed from the dom and generate an xml string which was then posted to the server

389582
queue	fifo
i ve been searching for information for a common kernel implementation of queue that is fifo data-structures

389644
constructor	object
the myclass object does have a constructor

389649
entity-framework	nhibernate
choose a crud object oriented approach choices are entity-framework microsoft suggested choice linq2sql nhibernate my personal suggestion

389663
linux	unix
we use autoconf and automake for linux and other unix platforms

389664
uitableview	uiview
my fear is that uitableview intercepts touches and becomes the responder to any such flickering which the uiview might be waiting for

389664
uipagecontrol	uitableview
so my question to you usability ui experts is is putting a uitableview inside of uipagecontrol a poor design choice

389676
postback	ajax
most of the problems and hard to track down bugs i ve had to deal with in .net web programming came down to me not fully understanding the asp.net basics like postback viewstate refresh and asp.net databinding the basic handcoded method not the fancy no-code grid stuff in 2.0 - once you understand that stuff the master pages themes and ajax stuff is pretty easy

389694
priority-queue	heap
the main example that comes to mind for me is a which uses a graph and a priority-queue implemented by a heap

389705
protected	public
rearrange code so private protected and public methods and grouping

389732
linked-list	queue
you seem to confusing an abstraction a fifo queue with an implementation a linked-list

389744
for-loop	loops
a continue statement without a label will re-execute from the condition the innermost while or do loops and from the update expression of the innermost for-loops

389744
if-statement	loops
it is often used to early-terminate a loops s processing and thereby avoid deeply-nested if-statement

389781
methods	extend
i can confirm that making a web service or page methods call through jquery will extend an asp.net session expiration in the same way that a regular postback will

389813
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
.net provides two classes sorteddictionary and sortedlist and both are implemented using a binary-tree

389813
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

389813
sorteddictionary	sortedlist
sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist

389813
sortedlist	sorted
if the list is populate all at once from sorted data sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary

389815
contains	elements
since b is contains inside a b s z-index will only apply when resolving other elements inside a

389816
any	set
in a future version of sql-server ansi_nulls will always be on and any applications that explicitly set the option to off will generate an error

389824
innodb	myisam
you asked in a comment about whether to use myisam or innodb

389824
rollback	commit
innodb supports transactions so you can choose to rollback or commit changes

389824
innodb	myisam
innodb is actually faster than myisam in quite a few cases so it depends on what your application s mix of selected updates concurrent queries indexes buffering configuration etc

389824
innodb	myisam
innodb wins over myisam frequently enough that it s clearly not possible to say one is faster than the other

389864
oracle	mysql
oracle mysql sybase microsoft terradata

389866
google-chrome	firefox
what about other browsers like opera or firefox or google-chrome on windows

389901
exception-handling	error-handling
assertions should never be used in place of error-handling exception-handling or robustness and you should never assert anything related to malformed or incorrect user input -- such things should be handled gracefully

389961
defined	declare
another alternative would be to declare a struct to hold all your functions and then defined your functions statically

389999
constructor	object
student when you create an object from it needs the students name and student id so the constructor needs to be something with a name string and a student id -- call it a string too -- to initialize it

389999
assign	add
you d add a methods to student that takes a course and a grade finds the course and assign he grade somehow

390045
revision	svn
otherwise just issue a separate svn merge for each revision statements and it will pull it all together

390047
xapian	sphinx
as an alternative to sphinx and lucene a relatively simple search-engine can be created using the xapian library

390058
expression	brackets
testing your regular expression i see your backslash is applied to the square brackets

390062
python	perl
here s my assumption you re going to do a one-time conversion from perl to python

390068
python	perl
cons is written in perl much like scons is written in python

390080
localization	translation
then use a localization resource that you pass in a textual key and the language translation is resolved based on the site s localization pattern

390083
selected	textbox
but when trying to load via a model the textbox has the value set as expected but the dropdown doesnt get a selected item set

390098
triggers	insert
for every row added to books you ll insert 7 rows into hash_index either via a triggers or crud proc

390100
exception-handling	try-catch
rather than catching the exception-handling and dislpaying a messagebox which is a view responsibility i do nothing in the controller and let the view wrap that area in a try-catch

390105
firefox	safari
it works like a charm on safari and firefox except for it s position when dropping down

390109
python	perl
i think that one approach thanks to the pragmatic programmer chapter 3 - text manipulation is to create a script that does that job for you maybe python powershell or perl

390111
solaris	linux
systems such as linux solaris irix

390111
freebsd	netbsd
freebsd netbsd openbsd dragonfly

390124
defined	declare
if you use an auto_ptr in to hold a forwarding declare type you will have to provide a destructor even if empty and defined it after the full class declaration has been seen

390125
conditional	operators
and in many cases explicit operators are more useful with the acceptance that they can break if conditional aren t right for example with if they don t have a value

390127
average	max
i imagine that the transport software could first determine the average and max latency then start the stream and tell the receiver to wait for that max latency before starting to play the audio

390127
udp	tcp
i guess the simplest solution would be to just open a tcp stream send a few packets back and forth to determine their running time or even use udp for that then use the results as the guide for my max latency value then simply fire the audio data in its raw form uncompressed 16 bit stereo along with a timing code over the tcp connection

390148
administration	host
changing the default timeout in coldfusion administration is not an option as this is a shared host

390150
credentials	account
i would like a test bind with test credentials if possible - this would mean that account is valid

390150
kerberos	ldap
i know that ad uses kerberos but not sure if java s ldap methods do

390153
checkbox	button
the user control will display the question answer appropriately meaning render the answers as a list of checkbox for multiple choice answer or radio button for 1 answer only

390163
malloc	free
for example in a single threaded support library for malloc and free it would not have mutex protection for the heap as an optimization

390169
kerberos	ldap
in that case you could just do plain kerberos and not bother with ldap

390181
lgpl	gpl
it would have to be berkeley lgpl or similar license no gpl as the product can t be entirely open-sourced

390202
linux	unix
in terms of unix linux variants you ll find that out the box its ssh and enabling telnet is generally considered poor practice

390219
hosts-file	hosts
i do have 127.0.0.1 localhost in my hosts i can t really think of anything else i can do

390242
value	field
i have a program that continually polls the database for change in value of some field

390253
square-bracket	backslash
the first closing square-bracket is escaped by the backslash so it s matched literally

390260
google-chrome	firefox
the code that netadictos posted seems to work fine in ie7 firefox 3.0.5 safari 3.2.1 and google-chrome but it doesn t work in opera v9.63

390264
triggers	insert
the next best change is to add a triggers to the database to enqueue each insert update event into a queue

390266
litespeed	apache
i ve been hearing things lately about the litespeed webserver as being a drop-in replacement for apache webserver

390285
h.323	sip
it is used for sip h.323 and many others use this for streaming audio content

390289
conditional	operators
i just refactored some code that was in a different section of the class i was working on because it was a series of nested conditional operators

390310
spring	guice
i have also swapped out spring and used guice for the ioc

390326
subclassing	base-class
i have a base-class with a virtual methods and multiple subclassing that override that methods

390334
swing	awt
create a awt or swing frame with a stop button

390338
groovy	java
i d recommend looking at grails it lets you become comfortable with all the java libraries and frameworks like spring springmvc hibernate sitemesh and so on but gives you a much better dsl for web applications and much more concise code with the groovy language think of it as java with dynamic typing blocks closures and so on

390345
base-class	inherited
use the new modifier to explicitly hide a member inherited from a base-class

390345
derived-class	inherited
to hide an inherited member declare it in the derived-class using the same name and modify it with the new modifier

390350
base-class	subclass
to get the behavior you want in this situation you could remove the virtual on the base-class and use new on the subclass

390351
methods	extend
in short this means that you can extend string with a methods providing your own code

390354
sqltransaction	rollback
for historical reasons the app code is using sqltransaction but some of the stored procedures are also using t-sql begin commit rollback tran statements

390354
sqltransaction	rollback
the old behavior of the code was that if any of the sprocs failed application logic would also cause the outer sqltransaction to also rollback

390354
sqltransaction	rollback
but now we want to change the logic so that even if there is a failure the outer transaction should continue executing the remaining sprocs in its sequence then at the end since we know there were failures we rollback the entire sqltransaction

390354
sqltransaction	rollback
the problem is that at least as it is presently coded is that if any of the sprocs does a rollback the outer sqltransaction appears to lose its connection so any subsequent attempt at reusing the transaction fail

390354
sqltransaction	rollback
is there a way i can rollback in t-sql but still maintain the outer sqltransaction

390355
constructor	object
the order of destruction of static object in c++ is the exact opposite of the completion of their construction when their constructor finishes execution

390365
contains	elements
each list elements contains the line number as an int and a string that contains the error warning message

390375
any	set
if you try to set any other members it fatally errors

390375
methods	extend
i realize i can do this with the __set methods and simply have it fatal error if you try to set a member which doesn t already exist but that s annoying to have to include in every class definition although i could define each of my classes to extend a base class with that methods but that s also annoying

390405
alignment	spacing
correct spacing and alignment

390408
function-call	inline
also with short static-methods the compiler is more likely to inline them saving a function-call

390441
python	perl
i guess something like this is what i was looking for -- a module that did some basic interpretation of perl and passed the result as a python object

390472
external	host
i must then forwarding this form data to an external image host and get the response

390476
contains	set
if i wait for 2 that means messages whose struct contains a mtype set to exactly 2

390484
value	field
my validator will check that only one of those three field textfieldone textfieldtwo textfieldthree has a value

390484
value	field
i m also checking the value of the other field that were passed to the validator

390554
versioning	upgrade
for more information about upgrade support see the versioning and edition upgrade and hardware and software requirements topics in sql-server 2005 setup help or sql-server 2005 books online

390554
versioning	upgrade
for more information about edition upgrade see the versioning and edition upgrade topic in sql-server 2005 setup help or sql-server 2005 books online

390567
value	field
well basically i am working on an ms-access application and on the form where administrators will view and edit user data i want to be able to call an event with the old and new value of a field whenever it is changed

390567
value	field
i ve tried a few form level events so i don t have to go into each of the fifty field and edit their onblur events to check for a new value but have had no luck

390572
relational-database	schema
the first way follows normalization better and is closer to how most relational-database schema are developed

390578
constructor	object
normally this will work however because sometype has not defined a parameterless constructor the call to activator.createinstance will throw an exception of type missingmethodexception with the message no parameterless constructor defined for this object

390585
malloc	free
remember that c doesn t need the size for free and operator new can just use malloc

390589
python	perl
now that you ve seen the error of configuration in perl code avoid making the same mistake with python code

390594
attributes	properties
i am trying to build an object through an attributes on a classes properties that specifies a column in a supplied data row that is the value of the properties as below

390594
attributes	properties
in a build methods on a base object i am getting the attributes values set on these properties as

390594
attributes	properties
and how do i set these properties through reflection now that i have the attributes

390601
triggers	insert
these are kind of like triggers that fire after a record s been insert updated or deleted

390608
while-loop	loops
difference is that the do loops executes do something once and then checks the condition to see if it should repeat the do something while the while-loops checks the condition before doing anything

390613
attributes	properties
once you got the properties i think you should use attributes.getcustomattributes instead of memberinfo.getgustomattributess since you exactly know what attributes you are looking for

390630
perl	php
you setup your application here be it php perl python java ruby whatever

390642
.when	ready
stylistically i prefer while easy-expr .when easy-expr is known up front and ready to go and the loop doesn t have a lot of repeated overhead initialization

390649
put	get
while i realize that i could never possibly get to those limits especially with the cpu usage limits put in place it s nice to be about to have a bunch of pictures up on my website without worrying about running out of space

390649
postgresql	mysql
if the pricing is due to licensing costs why don t you see more host with windows and .net but with alternative databases such as postgresql or mysql available to keep the pricing to a minimum which providing basically the same functionality

390662
data-members	private
this code will only compare non function data-members of your class as well as skipping anything private which is generally what you want

390667
google-chrome	firefox
if you re using firefox try ie or google-chrome to check if that s the case

390677
openssl	nss
how do i convert public key generated by openssl into one nss would understand

390677
openssl	nss
i ve generated key with openssl exported it into pkcs12 format imported it into nss database and then extract public key with mccoy utility

390677
openssl	nss
update looks like openssl contain nss key inside so the question is - how do i find out which part of openssl key is also a nss key

390694
put	get
then use get post put delete to interact with that instance

390710
asp.net-mvc	webforms
now that s not to say that you can t do any of these things with webforms but asp.net-mvc makes it easier

390710
asp.net-mvc	webforms
both webforms and asp.net-mvc are capable of absolute garbage if you are careless

390710
asp.net-mvc	webforms
as always careful planning and well thought out design will result in a quality application regardless if it is asp.net-mvc or webforms

390711
llvm	gcc
if by free you mean free as in free speech open source code available then look for llvm which can compile c++ c objective-c code using gcc as a frontend

390711
llvm	gcc
douglas gregor works on a native llvm frontend for c++ without the need of gcc

390716
asp.net-mvc	webforms
asp.net-mvc is about getting control back from webforms working in a stateless environment and implementing the model view controller design pattern without all the extra work that normally takes place in an implementation of this pattern

390716
webforms	asp.net
if you want control clean code and to use mvc design patterns this is for you if you don t like working with markup don t care about how malformed your markup gets then use asp.net webforms

390716
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i should also state that webforms and asp.net-mvc have their place i was in no way stating that one was better than the other only that each asp.net-mvc has the strength of regaining control over the markup

390730
value	field
assuming i can t store a variables length arrays as single field value the other option is to have a string that is delimited somehow and split by code in the application

390730
contains	any
an audit trail would contains the usual information - user time date action and can be any length

390733
httphandler	httpmodule
and second if you have for instance a web site inside the default web site you will have both web-config but the more specific will override some of the attributes of the web-config from the default web site but the ones that are not override will be there ie httphandler httpmodule the site will try to load those so you will need to add the remove tag inside the httpmodule to remove them

390740
rabbitmq	activemq
i ve been looking at xmpp activemq rabbitmq mule esb etc

390783
asp.net-mvc	webforms
compared to webforms asp.net-mvc is simultaneously a lower-level approach to html generation with greater control over the page output and a higher-level more architecturally-driven approach

390783
asp.net-mvc	webforms
let me capture webforms and asp.net-mvc and show why i think that the comparison favors webforms in many situations - as long as you don t fall into some classic webforms traps

390783
asp.net-mvc	webforms
ruby-on-rails s approach is similar although the logic is a bit more explicit and less magic. a view page in an asp.net-mvc app is usually simpler than a webforms page because they don t have to worry as much about routing business logic or data handling

390783
asp.net-mvc	webforms
however it certainly doesn t qualify as an example of good naming or easily understandable code and it is much harder for new developers to pick up than webforms this isn t just opinion i had a summer intern learn webforms last year and asp.net-mvc this year and the differences in productivity were pronounced - in favor of webforms

390783
asp.net-mvc	webforms
however if you ll be doing more than crud and or you are reasonably competent with architecture then asp.net-mvc may feel like a straightjacket until you really master the underlying routing model which is considerably more complex than simply routing in a webforms app

390783
webforms	asp.net
i also think that it is important that we don t fall into the trap of thinking that asp.net mvc is an anti-pattern of asp.net webforms

390783
asp.net-mvc	webforms
this is what makes webforms superior to asp.net-mvc in my book asp.net-mvc makes you pay a real world price in order to gain a bit more testability or worse yet to simply be seen as cool because you are using the latest technology

390783
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in the end i concluded that while i think we need to spend a lot more energy on webforms architecture and testability asp.net-mvc really doesn t answer the call for me

390787
value	field
you could make the field a compound value that include conceptually a process-id and a timestamp

390787
updating	updates
then a polling process that is waiting to own access to the field can observe that the timestamp has not updates in some time t which is much greater than the time of the updating loop s sleep interval and assume that the previously-owning process has died

390795
export	csv
it s the little details that ll kill you on this of course but in general i ve had success with export the data as csv from excel then reading it using a rool or scripting munging it as needed and inserting it

390795
perl	ruby
there are good csv packages available for python ruby and perl

390800
attributes	properties
verify that all properties of the class including the validation application block attributes survive serialization

390801
any	set
but the empty set does not have any elements and thus i can not find an element that is not in b

390801
any	set
there are no elements in the empty set so there can not be any elements of the empty set not in some other fixed set

390813
webforms	asp.net
i also read that asp.net mvc is able to serve up more pages faster than webforms and probably related to this the individual page size is smaller than an average webforms page

390870
value	field
solution 2 would be to compare data in the recordset to data in the control in the afterupdate event for controls bound to field in recordsets there is allways a step where the value in the control differs from the one in the recordset

390886
environment	building
writing tests in a pair environment is the best of both worlds and therefore should building the confidence quicker

390890
subtract	add
the main idea is to have some basic within a specific realm pinned down not unlike how in elementary school an arabic number system in base 10 with the operations of add subtract multiply and divide and place value like tens hundreds etc

390890
breadth-first-search	depth-first-search
graph-theory consisting of paths breadth-first-search depth-first-search and minimum weight spanning tree

390890
differential-equations	derivative
derivative integrals and partials differential-equations over the complex number systemd or some higher dimensional spaces like n x n matrices of real numbers

390890
least-squares	regression
probability and statistical theory including arithmetic and geometric mean median mode as well as the idea of least-squares and linear regression with just enough algebra so it all makes sense

390890
combinations	permutation
finite mathematics such as permutation combinations enumerator and asymptotes

390895
required	checked
to fulfill this requirement the article suggested that you put everything that is required for your built-in the repository and when you checkout the code or the build-server checked out the code you are ready to build the project right away without first installing any other tools

390939
primitive	int
you can t type-hint primitive though no int bur

390943
primitive	int
please note though you can only specify types for classes and not primitive such as strings or int

390945
contains	set
i have a set of tables in oracle and i would like to identify the table that contains the maximum number of rows

390964
publish-subscribe	messaging
see publish-subscribe asynchronous messaging paradigm

390968
web-services	security
http security and asp.net web-services see authentication section

390969
required	checked
your build scripting might want to checked that the expected versioning s of the required software packages are install before the build may proceed

390977
istream	std
right now i m using an std istream and reading my input char by char and then storing when necessary in an std string

390982
compact-framework	.net
tibco ems has superb support for .net clients - including compact-framework .net on wince

390982
solaris	aix
so if you re building a heterogeneous distributed application involving messaging code running on windows unix aix solaris linux or mac os x then tibco ems is the ticket

390982
compact-framework	.net
and also have wince industrial embedded computers that use the compact-framework .net tibco client.

390990
standard-library	boost
you can either use the standard-library with boost

391006
virtual-functions	base-class
i want to make foo an abstract base-class but obviously make cannot be in this abstract base since virtual-functions cannot be static

391031
mime	rfc
that s the mime encoding of headers rfc 2047

391066
hash	md5
other hash are still unbroken but we have to keep in mind that ressearchers concentrate their efforts on mainstream algorithm that is md5 and sha1 so unbroken hash may be unsecure aswell

391068
buffering	streaming
in addition flash has some awesome mp3 streaming functionality and a complete set of tools for buffering hosted files

391076
tuples	any
what my function does is take the tuples of 4-byte integers make an 8-byte integer using struct to avoid any issues of sign and then dividing by the constant 10000

391076
versioning	upgrade
however depending on the library you use and its versioning it s quite possible that later on after some upgrade you will be receiving decimal.decimal s and not two-integer tuples anymore

391126
union-all	union
are you doing a union or a union-all

391131
pointers	stack
for stack there s a trick in c where you take a look at the address of the first local variables defined in your current function to get a rough idea about where stack pointers is at the moment

391165
decimal-point	digits
p the maximum total number of decimal digits that can be stored both to the left and to the right of the decimal-point

391165
decimal-point	digits
s the maximum number of decimal digits that can be stored to the right of the decimal-point

391183
environment	building
if you want to be able to re-generate today s building next year you need to be able to re-create your environment first

391186
difference	count
there might be some difference in the actual methods available on each of these particular in .net 3.5 and count extension methods but that has more to do with arraylist being somewhat deprecated than anything else

391194
authentication	login
so the first time they run this app they won t be able to login because they haven t entered the ad domain name so want i want to do is check the web.config to see if there is an adname value in there if there isn t forward them to the settings page if there is then they should be asked to authentication and then forwarded to the index page

391211
handler	service
web service handler .asmx handles web service pages

391251
value	field
you can access the value field by configurationmanager.appsettings adname .tostring ..

391269
logging	trace
i already have an aspect that logs the trace but that works at a pretty low level logging every method call

391294
.net	wcf
as far as i m aware wcf is supposed to replace .net remoting so i d go for that

391304
groovy	java
if you re a java developer you ll also like that java code is valid groovy code and a groovy class is a java class so the integration is seamless both ways

391309
google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome anything webkit based you can use the transform

391360
boost	stl
well i ve been using c++ for over 10 years now so my answer would be learning strict memory-management c++ templates stl then boost

391390
command-line	cmd
i use phpunit on a integration server to run all tests and if i launch phpunit cmd from the cmd-line i receive

391414
firefox	safari
do you see the same problems in safari and firefox

391424
pointers	stack
you may set stack size for the threads you created and inspect stack pointers value by looking at the local variables which must not be optimized-out addresses

391424
pointers	stack
just do some math by using the initial size initial stack pointers value and current stack pointers value you will get some nice numbers

391433
selected	checkbox
once there selected the make single instance appliation checkbox

391433
selected	button
you can create view that easily in the same properties windows by selected the view application events button

391450
databound	gridview
i have a databound gridview

391454
autotools	cmake
i ve used cmake for more of my projects including porting some autotools based ones and i can say that it does its job very well

391486
entity-framework	ado.net
however it has been announced recently that linq to sql will be taking a back seat to the entity-framework now that it s been passed to the ado.net team

391501
preprocessor	lexer
a lexer is one of the very few situations where you can justify using both goto s and the preprocessor

391527
mocking	stubs
when you say build database stubs that hints at mocking in unit tests

391546
reflection	runtime
the dynamic type is essentially object but will resolve all methods property operator etc calls at runtime via the dlr or other provider such as reflection

391550
constructor	object
i know that when you call an constructor function with the new keyword you get a new object with a reference to that function s prototype

391550
constructor	object
i also know that in order to make prototypal inheritance you must replace the prototype of the constructor function with an instance of the object you want to be the superclass

391551
solution-explorer	csproj
if you copy and paste a user-controls from one project to another using the visual-studio solution-explorer it puts that user-controls into the vbproj file not sure about csproj as an applicationdefinition instead of as a page

391556
constructor	object
the copy constructor initializes a class as a copy of another object

391589
keyboard	mouse
you need to trick emacs into thinking that the keyboard was not being used which is not as intuitive as tricking it into thinking that the mouse was used

391638
value	field
for mysql to use the index you have to explicitly compare the int field to a value true 1

391646
value	field
i m not a database expert but doesn t it defeat the purpose of having an index on the field if there is only two possible value of the field

391646
value	field
if there are only two possible value - then i don t see the purpose of having that field indexed

391648
malloc	free
raii this lets you have automatic memory-management you no longer have to remember to free everything you malloc

391648
boost	stl
stl boost this is the c++ class library full of useful utilities and bits

391648
dictionary	arrays
all the standard containers are in stl like dictionary and arrays and lists along with algorithms that you can apply to them eg if you have a list of data items you can provide a small function object called a functor and then pass both to a generic algorithm

391660
ref	out
or between an out parameter and a ref parameter the extra keyword do tell maintenance programmers something and allow the compiler the double check what you are doing

391661
httphandler	httpmodule
after some research on the internet i found that i needed to create either an httpmodule or httphandler to do the routing and then setup a wildcard mapping to the .net v1.1 of aspnet_isapi.dll in iis removing the verify the file exist checkbox

391707
32-bit	64bit
of course in the 32-bit and 64bit windows oss a flat memory model is used and there is no distinction to be made between pointers in these oss though pae adds something conceptually similar

391718
revision	svn
how can i search if a file named foo.txt was ever committed to my svn repository in any revision

391724
asp.net-mvc	webforms
when comparing a given bit of functionality to webforms make sure to include all of the designer-generated c# and the code-behind c# along with the .aspx code to be sure that the asp.net-mvc solution is really not in fact much simpler

391740
perl	ruby
but if you have the time and energy perl and ruby have enough similarities that a lot o the ideas from rails could probably be implemented in perl

391742
perl	ruby
perl on rails which is written in ruby

391742
perl	ruby
all existing rails utilities are currently written in ruby so they would also need porting to perl

391743
derived-class	base-class
it has to be virtual and jon skeet has already whipped out the spec to prove that it is because given a reference to the abstract base-class the concrete derived-class s implementation must be called

391772
children	nodes
after inserting 7 other nodess in this way and returning from the function i noticed that calling insertafter on a qdomelement nodes with the returned qdomdocumentfragment was not inserting any new children

391772
children	nodes
the message printed was nodes has children 0

391773
specifications	w3c
according to the w3c specifications

391782
constructor	object
the following would create an object of class a and call the constructor and then call the destructor on function exit

391796
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

391821
textbox	button
i have a button called clear to clear out the search result in gridview and also the textbox where user enter the search criteria

391839
put	get
if the reference actually doesn t change then in practice you ll get away with it here the internal synchronization of concurrenthashmap -- and indeed the java.util.concurrentlibrary in general -- guarantees that objects put into the map are safely published to other threads

391841
xml-serialization	ixmlserializable
but you can specify custom xml-serialization logic implementing ixmlserializable in your class and serialize any private fields you need want

391888
any	set
if you set the visible property of a windows forms control to true that property still returns false if any of the control s parent windows are hidden

391902
python	java
python doesn t force you into java s nasty one-class-per-file style

391910
textbox	button
try to design the search box button so that it is obvious that you can initiate a new search just by typing in the textbox and clicking the search button

391922
32-bit	64bit
is the solaris code 32-bit or 64bit

391923
linux	unix
i wasn t the only one who thought this was obscure and knuckleheaded sometimes i started with unix in a nutshell and sobell s practical guide to linux commands

391937
compact-framework	.net
the common language runtime for the .net compact-framework is approximately 12 percent the size of the full .net common language runtime

391937
compact-framework	.net
the .net compact-framework processes uniform resource identifier uri strings prefixed by file differently from the full .net

391937
compact-framework	binaryformatter
because of size and performance considerations the .net compact-framework does not support binary serialization using binaryformatter or soap serialization using soapformatter

391960
arrays	loops
if the code uses arrays does it operate on them as a single structure f90 or always using loops f77

391971
constructor	object
all new object do hold a reference to the prototype that was present on their constructor at the time of construction

391982
google-chrome	firefox
if you re targeting browsers that support webrtc currently firefox google-chrome and opera

391991
value	field
the way i am doing it is looping through all text field drop down boxes and checkbox and storing their value in the form_load event

391999
instances	self
if the methods depends on any internal state of the object or must know which instances of the object it is addressing then do not make it a class self

392011
ms-access	oracle
we use ms-access as a front-end to oracle tables via odbc and it has been working well

392016
solaris	linux
oh and all of this has to work on windows linux bsd os x solaris and most other common platforms

392020
sql-server	oracle
i know the oracle version does this but i d assume the sql-server or other versions would as well

392023
subclassing	base-class
now i can test the base-class without having to make any subclassing

392053
webforms	asp.net
the two main advantages of the asp.net mvc framework over webforms are

392053
webforms	asp.net
now these reasons don t really make asp.net mvc any better or worse than webforms in a black-and-white sort of way

392053
webforms	asp.net
asp.net mvc has its strengths and weaknesses just like webforms

392053
webforms	asp.net
the reason your code doesn t feel right or look right might be because you have several years of webforms experience under your belt and only 1-2 months of asp.net mvc experience

392075
value	field
the gotfocus events for most controls look at what the current value of focusfield is and then call a lostfocus function that does that same case statement work for focusfield so that the previously focused field will get validated

392113
selected	textbox
the best thing i can suggest is to replace the combo-box with a read-only textbox or just perhaps a label - that way the user can still selected copy the value etc

392115
boolean	int
edit you can also install the spl type handling extension which gives you wrapper types for strings int floats boolean and enums

392116
data-structures	tree
basically you do a grammar parsing over the input language and have actions that rewrite to a highly optimal ast tree output which remain as linked data-structures in memory

392125
python	c++
unfortunately there aren t any good python examples of this so it can be confusing to convert from the c++ code to python

392151
linux	unix
under linux unix you can use objdump -t to list the exported symbols contained in a given object

392152
environment	building
building qa test and development environment

392152
configuration	upgrade
you really have to understand upgrade os components your own shared layers your own applications. upgrade are hard and someone has to work out configuration management what s running where as well as source code control and the like

392163
static-typing	typechecking
dynamic-typing refers to when the typechecking takes place dynamic-typing takes place at runtime static-typing takes place before runtime

392180
javascript	dom
despite that html dom javascript is

392180
javascript	dom
html dom javascript standard is in

392211
object-reference	instances
i get intermittent object-reference is not set to an instances of an object errors when uploading pdf files in fckeditor in dotnetnuke 4.9

392211
object-reference	instances
innerexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

392211
object-reference	instances
message dotnetnuke.services.exceptions.pageloadexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

392211
object-reference	instances
--- system.nullreferenceexception object-reference not set to an instances of an object

392216
contains	any
if there are any enclosing try statements whose try blocks contains the throw statement then any finally clauses of those try statements are executed as control is transferred outward until the thrown value is caught

392217
python	ruby
i m looking for a library in ruby or python that would take some html and css as the input and return data that contains the positions and sizes of the elements

392230
python	ruby
that said it can be very handy in smalltalk and ruby to be able to modify an existing class but python doesn t like to do that directly

392240
perl	ruby
since rails is written in ruby perl on rails implies rails written in perl no

392243
python	ruby
scriptor i think what you likely are looking for might be something in javascript more then ruby or python

392313
dialog	pop-up
as an alternative you could pop-up the diagnostic in a dialog box

392321
semantic-web	ontology
there are several well know semantic-web ontology like foaf for decribing people icalendar for events geo for places

392324
pixels	line
in java the line reads which display the arrays of int pixels into image

392328
silverlight	wpf
i think many of us are waiting for the trailblazers to go ahead and create really good sample apps using mvvm in silverlight and wpf for that matter

392347
expression	evaluation
for anybody developing in c# on silverlight here s a pretty neat trick that i ve just discovered that allows evaluation of an expression by calling out to the javascript engine

392351
for-comprehension	either
if you want to find all matching elements you could either use filtering or the equivalent sugary for-comprehension

392384
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if webforms are working for you and asp.net-mvc isn t then keep using webforms

392393
abstract-class	base-class
i only recommend using abstract-class if you want to refactor out the boilerplate implementation for a particular interface implementation such as using a base-class to do your generic crud persistence work

392410
common-lisp	lisp
for learning lisp i ve been recommend to read practical common-lisp by peter seibel

392422
moss	wss
one issue you should be aware of with user profiling is that they are only available for moss as opposed to wss

392422
environment	building
if the solution you are building will need to run in both moss and wss environment you should plan accordingly

392426
lookup	any
because we can directly access any element in the arrays by adding the offset to the pointers we can lookup any element in the same amount of time regardless of the size of the arrays

392426
data-structures	tree
higher level data-structures such as hashtables stacks and queues all may use an arrays or multiple arrayss internally while linked lists and binary tree usually use nodes and pointers

392426
linked-list	tree
a binary tree is a data structure similar to a linked-list however instead of linking to a single node each node can link to two children nodes

392426
binary-tree	nodes
when data is inserted into a binary-tree it uses several rules to decide where to place the new nodes

392426
binary-tree	nodes
when searching a binary-tree for the value of 75 we only need to visit 3 nodes o log n because of this structure

392426
children	nodes
even though there is 5 nodes in our tree we did not need to look at the remaining two because we knew that they and their children could not possibly contain the value we were looking for

392444
javascript	dom
supports html dom javascript

392457
linked-list	hashmap
since if someone copies your hashmap the linked-list has to be copied too and not just the pointer

392457
constructor	private
or you can make the copy constructor and copy assignment operator private and don t define them disallowing copies of your hashmap

392469
asp.net-mvc	webforms
webforms codebehind is somewhere between classic asp and the asp.net-mvc pattern

392469
asp.net-mvc	webforms
webforms does not enforce the separation of concerns in the way that asp.net-mvc does but it does allow much more of the code to exist behind the actual page

392473
directory	folder
instead of creating folder in visual-studio i create a directory structure for my project on the filesystems

392473
directory	folder
if i add existing file on a folder named services and navigate to a file in the directory structure

392473
directory-structure	organization
i have an entire directory-structure worked out already as i am mimicking our client developers using the same structure for organization

392501
sqltransaction	sql-server
opens a sqlconnection and a sqltransaction against a sql-server 2005 database

392501
sqltransaction	rollback
does not commit or rollback the sqltransaction - intentially keeping this alive to demonstrate describe the problem

392501
sqltransaction	sql-server
opens sqlconnection and a sqltransaction against a sql-server 2005 database

392512
oracle	mysql
first apologies if this is obvious but schemas are to oracle as databases are to mysql in over simplified terms a logical collections of tables

392535
32-bit	64bit
64bit will not solve you memory problem with resharper 4.0 since visual-studio 2008 runs as a 32-bit process anyway

392544
host	dns
nick is partially correct but it also has to do with people who will try to host multiple sites on one shared account and will use a different database for each and a scripting to serve the correct content with a little dns masquerading

392556
uipagecontrol	uitableview
to achieve what you are trying to do the best approach would be to use uitableview with uipagecontrol as explained in the pagecontrol sample

392561
google-chrome	firefox
to me as well as opera and google-chrome they look like ordinary script tags however to firefox and ie they dont recognize them and will not run the scripts

392562
uiscrollview	subviews
if you want to detect touches inside any of the subviews of the uiscrollview you will have to subclass uiscrollview and override the touchesshouldbegin and touchesshouldcancelincontentview methods which are specifically created for this purpose

392562
uiscrollview	subviews
other than this there is no way you can identify touches in the subviews as uiscrollview tends to handle all touches itself and doesn t pass them to its subviews

392586
directx	gdi
opengl allegro windows gdi and directx api support

392594
logout	login
but everything from blogging sites to email always force you to logout before you can login to another account

392599
processor	cpu
the trace cache of the intel processor was conceived to store such ops to optimize the superscalar performance of the processor as the cpu executes uops not the architectural instruction-set available for execution by programs

392602
ip-address	hostname
use a different hostname or use its ip-address directly to connect to the site

392610
duplicates	contains
because each duplicates summary contains the same info this change in section seems to be sufficient

392620
tortoisecvs	svn
using tortoisesvn 1.5.x and tortoisecvs from the testpilot site will give you all the overlays for both svn and cvs working copies

392624
python	c++
the only language i really excluded was c++ python i don t like because of the scalability problem

392627
python	c++
it s completely possible to write a working server in python without classes eliminating the self variable class references and likewise just as easy to write c++ with clean syntax

392627
perl	c++
it shorter development cycles than compiled languages like c and c++ but is higher performance arguable but i ve always been anti-java p than interpreted languages like python and perl and you don t have to work with unofficial implementations like mono that may from time to time not support all of a language s features

392632
virtualbox	vmware
my work vm is currently running inside virtualbox but i have used vmware in the past

392645
python	c++
yes i know c++ and python aren t languages you are limited to or even considering but i m refer to them generally here

392646
png	gif
a png is almost always smaller than the equivalent gif and will not lose quality like a jpeg file

392668
updating	updates
but this seems like it would require the person class to inspect the state of the seat before sitting in it as well as having to updates the seat s seated property instead of the seat updating the property itself

392678
splash-screen	splash
first i display a splash-screen a form and this splash would call another form

392678
splash-screen	splash
problem when the splash form is display if i then open another application on the top of the splash and then minimize this newly opened application windows the splash-screen becomes white

392696
any	set
it could be lighter than other editors with similar feature set which doesn t make use of any framework

392696
textile	bbcode
it supports html textile wiki syntax markdown bbcode

392698
internet-explorer	google-chrome
my plugin should work in internet-explorer mozilla and google-chrome

392718
build-process	ant
the build-process can very well be managed by maven or any other ant nant tool you want

392727
base-class	inherited
suppose you have a base-class and you use the base-class in all your code instead of the inherited classes and you use shadow it will return the value the base-class returns instead of following the inheritance tree of the real type of the object

392730
rollback	commit
create a single transaction per request in a httpmodule and handle commit on endrequest rollback on error

392733
haskell	lisp
for those of you experienced in both haskell and some flavor of lisp i m curious how pleasant to use a horrid term it is to write code in haskell vs

392733
haskell	scheme
some background i m learning haskell now having earlier worked with scheme and cl and a little foray into clojure

392753
haskell	lisp
in this regard haskell shines just as brightly as common lisp does

392753
haskell	lisp
on the other hand programming in haskell is much less interactive than lisp and the tremendous amount of reflection present in languages like lisp just doesn t fit the static view of the world that haskell presupposes

392764
difference	factors
it must be just me who always measures a factors 5 performance difference

392778
subclassing	superclass
a virtual methods is show to be overridden by a subclassing and calls to that methods even on the superclass type or from inside code of the superclass will call the replacement implementation from the subclassing

392778
subclassing	superclass
in this case-when the methods is called on the superclass type the original implementation is used the new implementation is only available on the subclassing

392787
splash-screen	splash
first i display a splash-screen a form and this splash would call another form

392787
splash-screen	splash
problem when the splash form is display if i then open another application on the top of the splash and then minimize this newly opened application windows the splash-screen becomes white

392794
any	set
any ideas how can i set my hosting environment to full-trust or any other ways to solve this

392795
digits	zero
to denote floating point numbers one must follow with a zero digits 99.0 or an explicit conversion 99.to_f

392795
conditional	operators
the usual operators for conditional expression and and or do not follow the normal rules of precedence and does not bind tighter than or

392800
user-interface	splash-screen
you need to display the splash-screen in a different thread - currently your new form loading code is blocking the splash-screen s user-interface thread

392800
splash-screen	splash
start a new thread and on that thread create your splash-screen and call application.run splash

392800
user-interface	splash-screen
you ll then need to make your main user-interface thread call back to the splash-screen s user-interface thread with control.invoke begininvoke when it s ready so the splash-screen can close itself

392806
dto	dao
2. send parameters to repository dao to get dto and bind dto to user-interface controls

392867
local-variables	function-call
local-variables and function-call stacks use the stack

392890
32-bit	64bit
i m working on 64bit vista for several months and i must say that you can really feel the difference compared to the 32-bit platform

392890
32-bit	64bit
regarding the memory problem - i actually think 64bit platform will solve the problem since 32-bit processes here are using the full 2g address space which is usually not the case on 32-bit platforms

392892
perl	ruby
honestly i think ruby has superseded perl in many respects it s good at roughly the same things but has much nicer features and is easier to use

392892
perl	ruby
perl still has cpan though which even ruby can t match although ruby has a lot of useful libraries too

392893
haskell	lisp
note there is a template haskell that lets you write macros just as in lisp but strictly speaking you should never need it.

392899
shell	bash
keep in mind that i am using the msys version of git 1.6.0.2 at this time with modified path and running git itself from powershell or cmd.exe not the bash shell

392906
binary	hex
where 308191300b06092a864886f70d01010d03818100 is prefix made from that asn expression up to bit string field including size of bit string pack h converts binary data to hex representation and unpack h converts string in hex back to binary

392911
freebsd	linux
i have ported a few such engines written in c++ and c# for hosts operating on linux freebsd and also solaris on an old ultrasparc iii - yes mono still runs there

392919
ruby	php
additionally my experience in other higher-order dynamically typed languages javascript and ruby yes javascript is a more powerful language than php in terms of language features left me a knowledge with many ways to solve types of problems easily but being restricted in such a way i had no way to use these powerful features

392919
perl	ruby
why perl and not ruby

392922
sql-server	mysql
your question was about mysql and i know little to nothing about mysql as a product but i thought i d add that in sql-server a truncate statement can be rolled back

392967
default-value	default
this sets variables to a default-value default if variables has not been set yet or retains the current value of variables if it has been set already

393004
hash	tie
my favorite features were being able to put perl data-structures arrays and hash and code directly in configuration files and execute them and the ability to tie code to syntax like arrays

393021
numerical	matrix
there is also the question of whether you d want the matrix to hold integers doubles or other numerical values that may play a role in some matrix functions

393045
c++	lua
lua is very fast - scripts can be precompiled to bytecodes and functions execute close to c++ virtual methods calls

393056
libpng	zlib
you can find a matrix class in the lydos.matlab library documentation which is distributed as open source project under the zlib libpng license

393061
primitive	int
defining primitive data types demonstrate how to define a type that behaves like an int but has a lowest valid value of 1 and a highest valid value of 10

393062
processor	cpu
assume that each guess takes one cpu cycle and given the fastest processor calculate how long it would take to break a password given a certain number of permutation

393082
c++	lua
why i like lua is that it excels as a language especially when used together with c c++ as it s supposed to be

393096
perl	ruby
true perl has it quirks but the language comes from an understanding of things that is very close to mine so i m much less comfortable with python and to a lesser degree ruby

393096
rebol	perl
i m very interested in languages also in lesser known like factor boo rebol and so on but all in all is perl my choice

393103
reference-type	generics
still the main argument of generics arrays are problematic is still valid in my opinion and collections should be preferred over reference-type arrays

393105
command-prompt	cmd
also in windows cmd-prompt i get a message that says the file is not recognized as a cmd or operable program

393107
contains	elements
you could also create a decorator for collection which contains extra methods like getmaximumvalue and make it update the value returned every time elements is added removed if there s need

393114
32-bit	64bit
is it 32-bit or 64bit

393123
dialog	pop-up
i see lot of example opening pop-up with jquery but don t see anything that will let me open new page in pop-up modal dialog box

393185
python	java
it took a whole day to migrate the same algorithm from python to java

393185
python	java
at the end of the day a few benchmark trials showed me clearly that the java program was some 20 25 slower than its python counterpart

393185
python	java
so in two hours i completely rewrote the whole thing in python and it was some 40 faster than the original python implementation hence orders of time faster than the java version i had

393186
testdriven.net	ncover
you may need team system to get baked in coverage analysis for vs but there is always ncover comes with testdriven.net

393188
mbunit	nunit
other alternatives are xunit.net nunit and mbunit

393188
mbunit	nunit
again i can t really compare them due to lack of experience with nunit and mbunit but i believe that all three are quite stable and usable

393191
contains	set
spotlight indexes at the file level so a file contains a complicated data structure may need to be split into a set of files for spotlight to index it in a useful way

393196
contains	set
i don t know about vb.net but in all oo language with which i m familiar the normal approach is for a mutable object to contains the methods that set its own attributes values rather than putting that work into a second class

393218
javascript	dom
dom by itself does not have nice selectors for javascript and other scripting languages but toolkits like jquery allow you to select elements by class name nicely

393219
children	nodes
if you want to manipulate all children of a comment nodes you cnn add to these comment divs and access them with

393224
contains	any
the standard simplejson encoder encodes strings according to the json standard any string contains a is translated to

393227
bug-tracking	mantis
mantis bug-tracking is interesting with a workflow you can easily customize

393247
contains	set
so a file contains a complicated data structure may need to be split into a set of files for spotlight to index it in a useful way

393254
hide	show
if i however i swap hide for fadeout and show for fadein then a is still fading out while b is still fading in and it looks pretty confusing

393258
abstract-class	superclass
considering that the abstract-class number is the superclass of classes

393258
integer	short
integer long and short .

393267
gettext	poedit
i am using gettext for the translation files but don t really like poedit

393285
.when	ready
selected takes an arrays of file descriptors includinig sockets and returns .when at least one of them is ready to receive

393307
ellipse	pixels
essentially given a 3d coordinate and a radius is there a quick way to just create a 2d circle ellipse on a pixels grid

393310
freebsd	linux
it runs on various linux distributions mac os x freebsd netbsd and ms windows

393312
webforms	asp.net
another point is that there may be parts of c# that are specific to webforms such as ajax functionality to name one example though the asp.net mvc may be another worth looking at to some extent

393327
unique	words
you have a bug in your description counting takes o n time but sorting takes o m lg m where m is the number of unique words

393329
interpolation	splines
most simply that would give you a polygon but interpolation splines should probably also give you nice results

393331
any	set
haproxy offers a much richer set of features for load-balancing than mod_proxy_balancer nginx and pretty much any other software out there

393341
http	ssl
we did have a little problem once involving switching from http to ssl where our site would send authenticated users to a non-secure page and unauthenticated users would be sent to the secure login page that was kind of strange to see but did make some sense in the end that was solved through ssl termination for the best solution aside from going back to a single server which was the immediate solution

393343
perl	ruby
if you have cygwin use either bash script or install python perl or ruby and use them instead

393362
perl	tcl
tcl is no better nor worse than perl ruby python or any other scripting language in this regard -- they all do basic file operations with equal aplomb

393379
perl	ruby
i hate detest and thoroughly dislike perl so i d suggest python or ruby

393379
python	ruby
the exact thing you want to do can be written very tightly and neatly in python using os.path.walk or os.walk but python ruby bash shell scripting and even a pipeline of ls -r | aek with an awk program would do it perfectly well

393381
sql-server	ms-access
i m upsizing an existing ms-access backend to sql-server 2008 and because we want to use sql-server merge replication i ll have to change all current primary keys currently standard autoincrement integers to guid

393403
gentoo	linux
actually i have photoshop cs3 working under wine on gentoo linux

393419
jibx	jdom
other alternatives could be castor jibx xmlbeans or jdom

393428
textbox	button
how do i preserve the transparency color of the button listview and textbox when they are disabled

393448
hosts-file	hosts
usually i start right away with using a hosts to block a lot of unwanted sites

393448
hosts-file	hosts
which is actually the same as using a hosts

393481
mp3	wma
it plays aac mp1 mp2 mp3 ogg vorbis aiff wma

393522
value	field
you have to refer to the field value in the recordset to get the correct data

393529
google-chrome	safari
it only seems to occur with google-chrome works fine in safari firfox and ie

393534
unique	words
what is left are basically unique words related to that question with all the filler-english removed

393554
put	get
if i put this line of code inside each thread i get an operationalerror telling me that the database file is locked

393554
put	get
if i put this line of code in the main program and pass the connection object conn to each thread i get a programmingerror saying that sqlite objects created in a thread can only be used in that same thread

393556
linked-list	arrays
i use a lot of lists and arrayss but i have yet to come across a scenario in which the arrays list couldn t be used just as easily as if not easier than the linked-list

393563
bash	zsh
don t forget zsh as an option - your bash knowledge is relevant plus it has got some neat scripting and command-line features

393578
linked-list	arrays
you can use pointer math on the arrays to access each element whereas you need to lookup the node based on the pointer for each element in linked-list which may result in page faults which may result in performance hits

393578
linked-list	nodes
each linked-list nodes requires the data as well as one or more pointers to the other elements in the linked-list

393630
configuration	installation
are you sure your installation configuration is complete and correct

393642
linked-list	arrays
so even if you don t know the number of elements in advance an arrays list may still be faster than a linked-list for adding elements as long as you are adding them at the end

393642
linked-list	arrays
accessing elements in an arrays list is also faster than a linked-list even if the accesses are sequential

393642
linked-list	nodes
linked-list nodes can potentially be scattered over many different pages

393669
export	report
is there a way to disable or override the excel and pdf export function in sql-server report services

393687
attributes	properties
i would like to add attributes to linq 2 sql classes properties

393691
linked-list	nodes
there are other cases where null is appropriate such as a getnextnodes nodes method when called on the last nodes of a linked-list

393695
datagridview	propertygrid
this would allow you to fully control the metadata used by ui binding tools like propertygrid datagridview etc

393709
asp.net-mvc	webforms
you can mix both webforms and asp.net-mvc pages in the same application so you may want to just develop a single webforms page for the one that requires the reportview

393710
google-chrome	opera
then for the odd site that you have to have flash for use an alternative browser such as opera or google-chrome for which let flash be installed

393719
directory	folder
if you do not normally have the rights to write something into the c program files-folder vista will silently redirect those writes into a secret folder inside your user directory

393725
dotnetnuke	umbraco
edit i have looked at dotnetnuke umbraco my web pages starter kit graffti cms sitefinity.net but as far as i can tell these can t be easily retro fitted

393726
wmd-editor	wysiwyg
if you want just a simple wysiwyg editor try using fckeditor .net integration or wmd-editor the one stack overflow uses

393760
append	input
you need to create a string of all these input name value pairs encoded for a url append to the end of your requested url which now becomes

393775
first-class-functions	lambda
well it has first-class-functions style primitives with delegates and has gained better syntactic support for the style with anonymous delegates and lambda

393804
nsmutablearray	nsarray
using nsarray nsmutablearray as the top-level container and wrapping the struct in an nsvalue will probably make your life a lot easier

393813
button	popup
while i am pressing a button #b more than this onclick of the button i have to open another popup windows

393824
push	pull
alternately is there a way i can have git detect whether or not to pull from push to a particular host based on ip-address

393829
attributes	properties
you can use a partial class to make your entity implement a interface that declares the same properties of your entity and then put the attributes on the interface

393829
attributes	properties
this way you can use the interface type to get the attributes from the properties

393830
contains	elements
it seems to contains every elements symfony does and then some

393842
attributes	properties
i don t know if there is a way to indicate which attributes must be placed in each properties using the dbml designer or xml file but maybe you can find a way to use this alternative to help you with your problem

393845
perl	c++
i have several independent executable perl php cli scripts and c++ programs for which i need to develop an exit error code strategy

393868
hide	show
i know how to show and hide hidden-files in the terminal - but is there a way to hide certain files like .ds_store when showing hidden-files

393880
constructor	object
generally an nsstring constructor does return an object that is actually of type nscfstring which is a thin wrapper around the core foundation cfstring struct

393889
actionscript	mxml
mxml is great for doing declarative layouts much easier to follow than doing everything programmatically in actionscript

393893
environment	execution
restrictedpython provides a restricted execution environment for python for running untrusted code

393895
internet-explorer	google-chrome
while i am clicking in mozilla and google-chrome it is working fine and gives an alert but when i use internet-explorer 7 version 7.0.5730.13 it wasn t supported

any	set
do any query on google with query terms which don t belong together - they won t be cached - and you ll still get a result set back to you in a couple of hundred milliseconds it s absolutely incredible

393904
put	get
you might want to get rid of the extra space after the closing parenthesis this may just be a typo in your post though put in a semi-colon and return false so that it doesn t attempt to follow the link

393906
any	set
all we care about is that any positive signed integer msb cleared compares below anything with the msb set

393914
put	get
you can also name it ls as long as you put bin first in your path and use the full path to bin ls in your scripting so that you don t get recursive interpretation

393929
attributes	properties
if you want to make your xml output a little more pretty you can use xmlelement and xmlattribute attributes on your class properties to have them serialization into your schema of choice

393939
value	field
what if you used ajax to get the value of the password field send it then clear the field

393951
attributes	properties
also it sounds like you might want to control whether certain properties of your class are serialization as attributes or elements

393953
expression	evaluation
the usual thunk implementation of lazy evaluation represents an unevaluated expression as a data structure contains a function pointers plus the arguments to be passed to the function

393968
contains	set
that is if i had two or more sets and i wanted to return a new set contains either

393982
tic-tac-toe	chess
now lets try implements chess instead of tic-tac-toe

393984
postgresql	firebird
sqlalchemy includes dialects for sqlite postgresql mysql oracle ms-sql firebird maxdb ms access sybase and informix

393989
stderr	stdout
don t try to encode too much meaning into the exit value detailed statuses and error reports should go to stdout stderr as arkadiy suggests

393989
stderr	stdout
any detailed diagnostic information should go to logs or to stdout stderr

393993
contains	elements
s1 now contains all elements not in s2

393993
contains	elements
s2 now contains all elements not in s3 the old s1

393996
web-services	api
our api will be completely online and restful there is any web-services alternative to link this data to excel

394009
nsstring	nsdata
if you want to load the contents of the file into memory many of the cocoa data classes such as nsstring nsdata and even nsdictionary have initwithurl methods which initialize directly with the contents of a web request

394012
scala	java
martin odersky the father of scala was also a primary contributor to the implementation of generics in java including his work on the pizza and gj implementations

394019
ole-automation	com
in terms of interacting with excel ole-automation com replaced the use of dde

394032
contains	any
in xpath 1.0 a convenient test if a given string contains any whitespace characters is

394033
entity	poco
i m looking for something that generates poco style entity objects with a static mapper class for transferring data to from the database through entity objects

394033
entity	poco
i understand that nhibernate can generate poco style entity objects

394036
directory	folder
i also need the .bat file to execute silently unless a user interaction is required - this scripting copies 11k+ files to folder on a networked machine and occasionally windows forgets if the destination is a file or directory and asks for the user to tell it what it is this is a whole other issue not for discussion here...needless to say i am annoyed by it

394040
constructor	private
i also tend to mark the parameter-less constructor as private to ensure that the form is properly instantiated

394071
value	field
the class has a print methods that prints the value of it s field

394076
csv	xml
consider you could use xml a data file text csv

394109
postgresql	mysql
for added bonus if when you realise decide that using sqlite for any concurrent application is going to be a disaster you won t have to change your code to use mysql or postgresql or anything else

394122
boolean	int
the only field types i m using in this dataset are int strings boolean and a few tarrayfields that hold arrays of integer fields

394134
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
and the last option is to do nothing just keep the data format private and don t publish them and obfuscation your application to prevent from reverse-engineering

394146
inherited	subclass
one situation that often comes up is that i have a list of objects that inherited from one class and need to be display in a list but each subclass has a slightly different way of being display

394147
callback	methods
since every methods call carries with it the callback reference in the disconnect methods the service can remove the callback reference from its internal store

394182
strchr	strlen
in that case why to use strlen or strchr just check for 0 null char

394200
variables	boolean
you can although may not be a good idea do boolean checks on multiple variables

394205
callback	methods
your user can then extended the classes and provide appropriate methods functions instead of callback

394228
kohana	drupal
drupal kohana etc.

394238
linux	uname
for example in linux uname -a

394245
versioning	upgrade
unless the upgrade looks bad according to the above criteria it s better to go with it and if you have any problems revert to the old versioning

394253
malloc	free
pointers are the most difficult feature of the language to learn especially when you get into malloc and free

394260
subclassing	inherited
what i mean is subclassing can be described as has-a and inherited could be is-a

394266
pure-virtual	base-class
an interface is an abstract base-class with all pure-virtual members

394272
arbitrary-precision	numeric
if your application relies on numeric processing search for an arbitrary-precision arithmetic library however i don t know if there are python libraries of this kind

394282
subclassing	inherited
my understanding is that subclassing is the same as inherited so these are both is-a

394284
for-loop	loops
best way for ascii string traversing in for-loops is to check for null char in the loops it self

394298
any	set
the internet options security panels allows one to set initialize and scripting activex controls not marked as safe for scriptinging to enabled for various zones but files on the local computer don t appear to be in any of the listed zones

394344
versioning	upgrade
while you don t want to upgrade just because there s a new versioning there s another consideration which is availability of the old versioning

394346
latitude-longitude	great-circle
i use closest in quotes in the sense of latitude-longitude distance and not great-circle distance and cover the cases where the circle s center lies on one side of the bounding box s boundary but points on the circle sneak across the bounding box boundary

394347
expression	evaluation
pathname listed evaluation an expression composed of the

394350
versioning	upgrade
i usually assume that ignoring a new versioning of a library coz it doesn t have any interesting features or improvements is a mistake because one day you ll find out that this versioning is necessary for the migration to the next versioning which you might want to upgrade to

394350
versioning	upgrade
if a lot of testing are required it is best to upgrade to the newer library at the next release major versioning of your software like when moving from v8.0 to v8.5

394355
has-many-through	associations
you might wanna try a has-many-through associations instead of a named scope

394363
perl	ruby
find 1 is a fine tool as described in the previous answer but if it gets more complicated you should consider either writing your own script in any of the usual suspects ruby perl python et al. or try to use one of the more powerful shells such as zsh which has a globbing commands and you can specify things to exclude

394376
postgresql	mysql
if you don t want to use activerecord an orm may be a bit complicated for your usage right now you can still use the ruby-mysql library or even better imho is to use the ruby dbi dbd library here which has dbd drivers for mysql postgresql out-of-the-box

394387
contains	set
the algorithm complexity of contains delete and add operation of set on some good implementation such as hashset would give you the efficiency you want

394392
contains	elements
point to the beginning of both arrays then advance the pointer contains the smaller elements

394397
global-assembly-cache	gac
if there are multiple applications or you want to drop the file somewhere other than the application directory you generally need to either adjust the path variables or register the assembly in the global-assembly-cache gac

394398
global-assembly-cache	gac
an alternative is to have the dll registered in the gac global-assembly-cache

394446
decrement	increment
i m thinking of a sessionlistener to increment the count when a session is created and decrement it when the session is invalidated or times out and an aspect to guard calls to the url

394452
updating	updates
if you are updating an existing record in the save methods then you need to use an updates statement

394465
contains	any
i m using apache + mod_wsgi to host my python application and i d like to get the post content submitted in one of the forms -however neither the environment values nor sys.stdin contains any of this data

394492
selected	textbox
i can selected my value and the proper values are insterted into the textbox

394512
inverse	cosine
note that the tj x and tk x in the wolfram article i linked to used the cos and inverse cosine these are polynomials and in practice you use a recurrence formula to get the coefficients

394512
cosine	sine
don t get me wrong taylor series will work properly for sine cosine with reasonable precision for the range -pi 2 to +pi 2

394512
cosine	sine
if i were stuck on a desert island with a nonscientific calculator and i needed to calculate sine and cosine i would probably use taylor series since the coefficients are easy to remember

394512
cos	sin
but the real world applications for having to write your own sin or cos functions are rare enough that you d be best off using an efficient implementation to reach a desired accuracy -- which the taylor series is not

394521
32-bit	64bit
while it s my understanding that there s no fundamental reason a program written for 32-bit hardware oss not to run on 64bit hardware oss in practice i ve found many programs intended for 32-bit versions of windows that will not work on 64bit versions of windows

394521
32-bit	64bit
why would a virus scanner or firewall written for a 32-bit system not run on a 64bit system

394524
installation	building
this makes it possible to create a lightweight c# or vb.net application that takes in the unique id of your choosing and building an installation with the id embedded

394527
global-assembly-cache	gac
the gac global-assembly-cache allows you to effectively register a dll to be used throughout the system and works as an evolution of the old registering mechanism

394533
32-bit	64bit
the best explanation i ve found is offered here which basically says 32-bit programs are run on an layer of emulation which doesn t allow the system access you d get from native programs run in a 64bit environment

394536
webserver	upload
i upload it to my nearest webserver and sure enough it works

394540
folder	dir
however i guess i could just label my root parent dir with a tag like projectnameissourcesafecheckedin and for every folder and only the parent folder i will drill in and count the lines in classes

394542
submitchanges	datacontext
now with a single global datacontext that s easy i just add the new child records to the relation collections of the lookup objects and hit submitchanges

394561
32-bit	x86
the x64 .net installs the x86 .net at the same time so that it can run 32-bit forced binaries which are supposed to be forced only if they p invoke 32-bit binaries

394563
postback	ajax
the hiddenbuttonid click event is trying to do a full postback for the page whereas the ajax call will not do a postback

394563
postback	ajax
there is no reason to do a postback and then follow it up with an ajax call

394563
postback	ajax
the point of ajax is to eliminate the need to postback the page and instead just reload a small amount of the html on the page using a small callback to the server

394570
32-bit	64bit
so know that you ll be in a world of hurt if you want to mix 32-bit and 64bit apps on the same iis instance in iis 6

394616
command-line	cmd
in order to run it i m executing the following cmd in a cmd-line windows

394620
command-line	cmd
since we know you can run it from the cmd-line the other thing to do is create a windows shortcut and modify the properties you ll have to look around i don t have a windows machine to look at so that the cmd it executes on open is the java -jar cmd you mentioned

394626
.when	ready
you can use detach attach to remove the associations to the data context with which you retrieved the object then connect it to a new data context .when you are ready to updates it

394645
haskell	erlang
i don t have experience in either haskell nor erlang but on the surface they seem the same

394645
haskell	erlang
my question is then is haskell considered to be as good of a solution to server building as erlang supposedly is

394646
sql-server	oracle
dunno about oracle but to make this work with sql-server you need a timestamp field in your table

394653
keyboard	mouse
copilot helps you fix someone s computer problems by letting you connect to their computer see what they see and control their mouse and keyboard to help fix the issue

394672
ftp	scp
you should consider using a deployment script ant rake perl to automatically scp ftp your changes up from your development machine instead of checking out from subversion on the server

394680
document	editing
that way if i m only editing code i don t have to check out the large document folder

394686
windows-xp	windows
windows-xp has built-in windows assist which lets you send an invite to another windows machine typically via e-mail and allows you to remotely control the machine with them watching

394690
haskell	erlang
the question of whether haskell is as good as erlang depends on what people want from a language

394690
haskell	erlang
one of the easiest differences to note is that haskell is a statically typed language with type inference and erlang is a dynamically typed language

394691
any	set
obviously you will want to be careful about keeping production passwords out but you will want examples and plain text instructions so that any it tech should be able to figure out how to set things up

394708
pascal	delphi
delphi or pascal there s nothing delphi-specific here

394714
haskell	erlang
last time i looked the libraries and frameworks for building scalable servers in erlang looked a bit more mature than those for haskell

394717
contains	set
your question says nothing about order and if you examine your three requirements you ll see that the postcondition says that array2 is unchanged and array1 now contains exactly the same set of integers that is in array2

394721
selected	button
in ib set the file s owner for the view as your viewcontroller class selected file s owner in inspector windows click on the i button and set the class as your viewcontroller

394721
selected	button
now with the file s owner selected click on the blue button with a white arrow in the inspector windows

394723
versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade to the latest versioning of f# 1.9.6.2 also known as the september ctp

394763
put	get
and if i just put smallerarray.extractpiece in largerarray.extractarray i still get problems

394774
decrement	increment
normally only use increment decrement when pointing to elements of an arrays

394774
subtraction	addition
addition subtraction of a integer to a pointer means move the pointer forward backward by n elements

394788
instances	self
since you are overriding the methods just for this one instances object this way is simpler and has exactly the same effect as using self

394803
32-bit	64bit
if you don t know what this means just remember on a 64bit machine pointers are 8 bytes and on a 32-bit machine pointers are 4 bytes

394809
conditional	operators
if python does not have a ternary conditional operators is it possible to simulate one using other language constructs

394812
versioning	packaging
the reason for this is that your build may change with newer versioning for example new packaging scheme different testing etc. which may make it incompatible with older maintenance releases

394814
python	java
the order of the arguments is different from many other languages such as c ruby java etc. which may lead to bugs when people unfamiliar with python surprising behaviour use it they may reverse the order

394829
webserver	host
i have tested the app through the vs 2008 default webserver host and everything works fine

394853
sql-server	ingres
i ve noticed ingres and oracle developers tend to use the first style whereas microsoft sql-server users have tended to use the second but that might just be a coincidence

394867
derived-class	base-class
the bug in the code is that your base-class declares the to accept a reference of type of the derived-class

394867
derived-class	base-class
thus your derived-class and your base-class are still assignable

394887
expression	evaluation
although it does have the benefit of evaluation expression left to right which is clearer in my opinion

394906
keydown	keyup
back in the dos-days the same scancodes have been used for games because it has been the only way to detect keyup and keydown events

394940
directory	folder
the sample app has two folder in its root directory lib src

394942
simplemodal	jquery
i am using simplemodal in jquery and i have one confirm dialog

394947
redland	rdflib
i ve played with jena sesame boca rdflib redland and one or two others some time ago but each had its problems

394952
python	ruby
list monad in ruby and python

394953
push	pull
the view needs your model to create the user-interface pull from model and to receive updates from it push by model

394956
asp.net-mvc	webforms
we have our own webforms based cms and the main selling point about asp.net-mvc is that it gives us cleaner html which our designers would love

394959
formatting	printing
but if the user has to enter some code where tabs and formatting are important in an edit box inside a web browser he navigates through the webpage controls every time he hits the tab key instead of printing the tab character

394965
webforms	asp.net
the main con is that asp.net webforms which is what i tend to code in is not easily unit tested which is why asp.net mvc is so attractive to people

394966
dialog	pop-up
if you need further interaction based on the results of your initial dialog then i would consider either adding another modal dialog that you pop-up after the current one is closed with your ajax results or insert the ajax results into your main interface and deal with it there

394968
authentication	login
openid if you just want to be able to authentication people using their login credentials from another trusted site

394984
python	java
edit i should have said that the processes i m starting in this instance are either python scripts or java programs

395003
json	xml
to avoid reinventing the wheel any serialization protocol will work for on the wire data xml json and you might consider looking at beep for the basic protocol framework

395017
haskell	erlang
while i agree that haskell is a more solid language and nicer to program in erlang is much easier and has many libraries specifically intended for uses like these

395019
google-chrome	firefox
i noticed ie and google-chrome have a 1px border by default on the other hand firefox have a 2px border which results the textarea to be 502px instead of 500px any workarounds

395022
default	reset
you can set all of your browsers default styles to be the same by using a reset css sheet at the top of your document

395061
rdfs	owl
his book semantic web for the working ontologist effective modeling in rdfs and owl has gotten high marks for its practical coverage of the area

395065
udp	tcp
but my programming question was whether there is a way to send tcp udp packages via php so i can knock via a webclient

395068
initializer	shadowing
you need to initializer the database outside of main otherwise you will just declare a local-variables shadowing the global one

395077
haskell	erlang
i don t have experience in either haskell nor erlang but on the surface they seem the same

395077
haskell	erlang
there are some pretty stark differences between haskell and erlang

395077
haskell	erlang
like haskell erlang doesn t share state between processes so it s easy to write multi-process software

395077
haskell	erlang
but the programming style between haskell and erlang is a bit different since erlang emphasizes the use of small processes to perform concurrent processing

395077
haskell	erlang
i love haskell -- it s one of my favorite languages -- but if i was going to write server software i d probably use erlang

395092
httpd.conf	hosts
your site is hostsed by an apache web server so you should be able to do the following in your site s httpd.conf or virtual hosts block

395107
carbon	cocoa
i see something in carbon about archiving windows hierarchies but i d want this to work in 64-bit cocoa in snow leopard

395110
perl	php
this would allow you to store data and to exchange it with your full-fat 3.5 server or indeed with java perl php etc

395111
32-bit	64bit
when a 32-bit application is run on 64bit windows

395111
32-bit	64bit
a 32-bit driver can t be installed on the 64bit os

395113
javascript	dom
but you could write a javascript injector bookmarklet that adds a button to any web page and lets you grab the dom or body html manually whenever you want.

395116
pixels	line
using the pixels blocks just mentioned a 240w-x-320h image would become 64 line of 60 characters.

395118
json	xml
the returned contents it could be html text xml or json

395120
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox tested in 3 opera tested in 9.6 and google-chrome tested in 1 but not in msie7 haven t tested in msie8

395150
filtering	sorting
if so then what you call implicit paging will probably be necessary as sorting and filtering over a partially obscured result set is counter-intuitive

395158
pointers	stack
onto smart pointers - a lot of the time we just create objects on stack

395158
pointers	stack
we re returning a pointers to str - but str was created on stack so we be deleted once we exit foo

395171
decimal	octal
forces it to be parsing as a decimal number otherwise strings beginning with 0 might be parsing as an octal number might depend on the browser used

395172
malloc	free
when managing heap-allocated memory acquired from malloc or new it is usually the responsibility of the programmer to free or delete that memory before the pointers is destroyed

395174
assign	add
first how did you add the movie clip and assign it a name

395186
mdiparent	mdichild
i have created an mdiparent and an mdichild

395186
mdiparent	mdichild
methods b - alternatively in the load methods of mdichild i have the following code which causes the mydialogbox s owner to be set to mdiparent

395197
methods	extend
couldn t you just extend arraycollection and override the contains methods

395254
hash	md5
and replace timestamp w the current time in msec since 1970 counter a counter that you increment once per download hash md5 hash of concatenate timestamp counter secret salt where secret salt any favorite code you keep secret

395260
radio-button	textbox
flash gives us a much larger arrays of user-interface controls and widgets - when a specific type of interaction requser-interfaceres more than just a textbox or radio-button or drop-down menu we can buser-interfaceld whatever we need

395297
nsinteger	int
i see a few things that need to be cleaned up here but the most obvious mistake is that you re treating primitive-types such as int and float as pointers you should also be using nsinteger and cgfloat but that s not as critical

395312
hide	show
the user-controls would pass through most of the properties and events but in response to the .readonly property it would hide the combobox control and show a readonly edit box instead

395314
strong-typing	types
i want to use strong-typing i do not want to send the types as an argument to propertyrepository.register

395317
mockito	junit
i am using junit 4.1 and in the same test i am using mockito

395318
decrement	increment
other members of the interlocked class such as add decrement exchange increment and read all perform their respective operations atomically

395320
value	field
propertyrepostiory.registerproperties could then set the value of the readonly field using reflection if this works - i haven t tried it

395364
document	element
you could with a whole lot of effort iterate through all of the rules defining the style in question in all of the stylesheets in the current view of the document evaluate them for the element in question and if none applied.

395375
firefox	safari
firefox and safari for os x windows by the way

395379
jquery	.post
i use jquery .post to send some data also json formatted to the server running php which works fine

395379
callback	methods
then when i request the same data from the server using jquery get the callback methods never executes

395388
configuration	environment
i m a configuration manager and i m working on windows and unix environment

395409
javascript	dom
i can totally see people who don t like javascript start using silverlight just so that they can use managed code for dom manipulation

395416
contains	set
you can set each row of the datagrid to fit based on the contents of a particular column of that row by setting the variablesrowheight attributes to true on the datagrid and setting the wordwrap attributes to true on the datagridcolumn that will contains the variables height content

395445
gnome	xfce
gnome kde fluxbox icewm xfce etc

395480
any	set
a favorite food property of any pet subclass instance that allows the individual pet to have a favorite food identified out of the set of foods that are actually accepted by its species

395491
knapsack-problem	np-hard
if you want to keep them as individual os folder on the cd that s fairly difficult in fact i think it s a kind of knapsack-problem which is np-hard

395509
ubuntu	linux
i m very familiar with how to setup the environment on ubuntu linux and the only part i m getting stuck on with os x is how to install mysql autostart it and install the python mysql bindings

395512
linux	osx
edit i m on windows but if something works on osx windows and linux that would be great.

395519
noncopyable	containers
unlike auto_ptr unique_ptr can be put into a containers because containerss will be able to hold noncopyable but movable types like streams and unique_ptr too

395536
contains	any
none of these three items contains any other they are siblings all commonly held within the page

395539
python	php
if polling is used it would need to be very short 100ms which would lead to an awful lot of unnecessary requests which will be expensive for the little php socket server i ve cobbled together - i know i know python would be better for the server but i don t know it well enough

395540
32-bit	64bit
32-bit to 64bit migration considerations

395542
silverlight	wpf
that said silverlight does provide a fantastic deployment model for wpf applications

395557
pascal	delphi
i know someone who has a one-man company developing applications in delphi and pascal

395567
subdirectories	archive
src - main source archive a myriad subdirectories some two or three levels deep ignoring artefacts like rcs subdirectories

395577
text-align	display
if your is an inline element i.e defaults to display inline apply text-align center to its container

395580
yaml	ini
this is xml think about ini or yaml as well file and requires compile to php during first start but after that any path is absolute

395592
json	xml
while researching the issue of json vs xml i came across this question

395605
environment	building
finally if he building a really great environment for the programmer to work in and pays well then that might help as well

395649
safari	opera
it is then you know how to write the most compatible style possible in the first place thus saving all the time in degugging and rarely have any problems with any of the major modern browsers ie6 ie7 ff2 ff3 opera 9 safari 3 win mac

395649
safari	opera
other than that ff2 ff3 opera 9 safari win mac ie7 ie8 are relatively similar in the rendering engine at least with much less bugs than it has with ie6

395650
hash	md5
now this can sorta be done with get parameters like an md5 hash token but i m interested in url mapping as a general solution to many problems

395656
contains	set
my guess is the programmer set the data to either the id of the name or a pointer to the object that contains the name

395675
groovy	java
how can i reference a groovy domain class from java class using eclipse

395679
jtextpane	jlabel

395707
buffering	streaming
let the basic i o libraries handle the data streaming buffering between processes and let the os deal with the thread management

395707
linux	unix
keeping the answer as simple as possible will get you more success especially if you aren t very fluent in linux unix based systems yet

395715
python	ruby
the small companies can take a shot with open source and python ruby etc

395725
javascript	dom
i use the web developer extension -- for dom css stuff but usually related to javascript

395727
javascript	dom
it s better for dom inspection and browsing than firebug in my opinion and much less powerful when it comes to javascript

395727
javascript-debugger	developer-tools
google-chrome also comes with some handy little developer-tools especially for javascript just use page control the page icon beside address bar - developer and you ll see a javascript-debugger there

395751
python	ruby
ruby has better support for such declarative styles and i am glad the core python language is not going down that route

395789
16-bit	8bit
there is 16-bit of data to be presented in an 8bit value which is always tricky

395789

395846
raw-sockets	ethernet
i have heard that windows-xp sp2 blocks raw ethernet sockets but i have also heard that raw-sockets are only blocked for administration

395892
.net	wcf
as said .net 3.5 win forms app iis-hosted wcf service however what is important is i wish any and all wcf services to require this authorization procedure however it should be session http header or otherwise as i do not want anybody to be able to hit these services from the web

395906
debugging	trace
ace_debugging declare #include ace task.h in source header file.i trace debugging define by

395921
contains	any
if there are no requirements on what the packet should contains if any arp packet will do then you can obviously send an arp request if you re on an ethernet network simply by trying to send something to any ip on your own subnet ensuring beforehand that the destination ip is not in the arp cache by running an external arp -d tar.get.ip.address command but this will probably not be what you want

395960
cherrypy	pylons
python-based solutions like cherrypy or pylons in what context are application servers a better alternative to php

395960
webserver	host
i tend to favor php simply because it s available on just about any webserver especially shared host but i m looking for other good reasons to make an informed choice

395962
windows-mobile	windows-ce
there are a few different ways to attack this - note that the tool instructions will vary a bit based on what version of windows-ce windows-mobile you are using

395962
windows-mobile	windows-ce
windows-ce prior to os version 6.0 don t confuse with windows-mobile 6.x had a 32mb process virtual memory limit which tends to cause lots of fun fragmentation issues

395968
gridview	formview
what are the similarities and differences between gridview detailview formview

395970
cherrypy	pylons
there are several products in php which fill the same space as cherrypy or pylons

395972
python	php
python is simply a nicer language than php so that might affect your decision

395972
cherrypy	pylons
personally i would not describe either pylons or cherrypy as an application server if you want a python application server try zope

395982
metaclass	subclass
what is the flow of class instantiation subclass metaclass super type and methods invocation

395991
expression	evaluation
these occur after the evaluation of a full expression one which is not part of a larger expression after the evaluation of the first operand of a ||

expression	evaluation
the c and c++ standards specify that â œbetween the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression

395993
value	field
just assign the provided value of this to the internal owner field

395995
parentheses	operators
from what i m reading is described as applies a function to its arguments. however it doesn t seem to work quite like apply ... in lisp because it s a binary operators so really the only thing it looks like it does is help to avoid parentheses sometimes like instead of foo bar quux

395999
order	join
compare code examples that do the same thing join with a newline non-empty descriptions of items from a mylist list in different languages languages are arranged in reverse-alphabetic order

396021
entity-relationship	diagram
this is the partial entity-relationship diagram for identity module in turbogears python

396022
unique	words
you can then sum these together to get a unique value for the words based on it s letters

396026
hashtable	sorted
the important thing is to make the key for your hashtable the idea of a sorted word - where the word is sorted by letter so car acr

396030
png	gif
i was about to make the same remark as wouter use png modern format which is highly compressed as opposed to bmp lossless as opposed to jpeg and full color and with several level of transparency as opposed to gif

396046
binary	hex
with some experimentation with a very large dictionary i found no word that exceeded a frequency count of 9 for any letter so the signature can be represented as a string of numbers 0..9 the size could be easily halved by packing into bytes as hex and further reduced by binary encoding the number but i didn t bother with any of this so far

396052
contains	set
if you want to restrict access to tables you can easily set up an additional table contains all the table names and grant select-list select-record insert update delete access to the roles grouping as sketched by jv

396060
administration	account
the concept is similar to grouping however role is usually easily mapped directly to business logic think of roles such as administration user clerk account manager regional manager etc

396060
required	checked
in the controllers code you checked via their roles that the user holds the required privileges to perform a function

396083

i mean to open the built-in windows gui from cmd line- not to launch by schtasks

396101
runas	cmd
on the test computer i m running msvsmon.exe as application not as services i m running it using runas cmd with the user that i have created

396109
python	java
it s more complex than for example java s super keyword mainly because of multiple inheritance in python

396114
toupper	tolower
it is actually better to convert the string to uppercase toupper as that has been apparently there are further optimizations that the just-in-time compiler can do as when compared to the tolower

396151
double	int
when foldl is used the sum is immediately calculated so applying sum to an infinite list will just run forever and most likely in constant space if youâ re using things like int s double s float s

396158
.net	wcf
there is wcf and all .net libraries for you to implement something like that

396165
google-chrome	firefox
when i tested firefox ie and google-chrome was trying to download the file and asked the user where to store it opera displayed the file

396171
firefox	safari
when logged in try to click one of rows avboka link this is where a dialog is shown in firefox and safari

396173
linux	unix
on linux unix

396184
superclass	subclass
if you need to access a subclass from a superclass then there s a good chance that your model is broken it should be one class

396185
value	field
his code provides foreign key constraints parametized indices field value constraints and so on

396185
value	field
each field value in mnesia can be any erlang term so if you re at a loss for a unique-key on any one particular field you can often combine some fields to give you a value that will always be unique - perhaps username dateposted timeposted

396188
perl	ruby
take a look at the variable or better yet at perl ruby python etc

396192
superclass	subclass
it allows a subclass to defer to it s superclass

396192
superclass	subclass
however in all subclass situations you ll make use of super to extend a superclass

396192
python	java
it does happen in java smalltalk and python

396211
conditional	operators
if you have a long set of conditions for the conditional ternary operators

tell whether the variables contains any one character not in the allowed ranges

396243
directory	folder
user settings are stored in an obfuscated directory deep within the user document settings folder

396250
development-environment	virtual-machine
we use vista as our primary operating system but we run the delphi 7 development-environment in a windows-xp virtual-machine

396251
version-control	git
i usually version-control code text data with git and simply use save as with a version name for graphics binary data

396251
rollback	commit
i d have to rollback to see changes and you wouldn t even get one of the great features of version-control see the changes you did in a specific commit just by looking at diff

396260
contains	elements
as the button are all contains in a block elements i d like to do something like this

396274
authentication	login
i now have the distinct feeling that the reason for this is that as i mentioned to access the form i needed to login using windows authentication

396278
any	set
do you have any svn keywords set on those files

396285
litespeed	apache
litespeed vs apache from litespeed tech

litespeed	apache
litespeed vs apache

396287
animation	rotation
for example i learnt that certain animation aren t possible in 2d such as rotation etc

396300
vbscript	jscript
using preferably jscript but vbscript will also do how does one walk a dll obtaining the properties and their attributes contained therein

396300
value	field
an example of their use would be to initialise field to their default value spaces for strings zeros for binaries and current date for dates

396309
animation	rotation
things like rotation motions or transformations can be prerecorded or prerendered as animation or image sequences and seamlessly integrated into a 2d game

396346
postgresql	mysql
if you have fast and slow response timed data storage on the frontend server going with a lightweight database storage like mysql or postgresql maybe not that lightweight

396353
virtual-functions	base-class
edit ppinsider has provided more information on the gcc case in which he demonstrates that gcc implements the pointers to the virtual base-class by making use of an otherwise empty vtable no virtual-functions

396366
markup	xhtml
the asp.net mobile controls render the appropriate markup html 3.2 wml 1.1 chtml xhtml while dealing with different screen sizes orientations and device capabilities

396378
libsndfile	portaudio
but with some lines of code it is possible even in a portable way using the already mentioned portaudio and libsndfile lgpl

396397
safari	opera
for standards-compliant browsers like mozilla opera safari etc

396439
checkbox	button
what is the cleanest way to align properly radio button checkbox with text

396439
checkbox	button
not only that they mostly relied silently on an estimated height of the radio button checkbox but they also behaved differently in different browsers

396442
constructor	object
or are you passing a mock object into the constructor at setup

396442
constructor	object
so you have to think about the setup process as is this something i will want to repeatedly reproduce every time i need to use this object in the real world. if i am passing a db connection into the mapper s constructor in the setup that s fine but doesn t that mean i ll have to pass a live db connection into the mapper object s constructor every time i want to really use one

396457
any	set
any time new functionality is introduced or when a breaking bug fix is applied this number will be advanced and the maintenance number will be set to zero

396491
groovy	scala
i d say look at scala or groovy

396491
groovy	java
if you don t like java s generics at all then you might prefer groovy which is dynamically typed

396491
scala	java
if you like the idea of generics but find java s implementation of them confusing like i do then you might like scala which handles generics more sensibly

396495
emacs	vim
out of all the features in use in modern text editors initial research seems to indicate that this is one feature that both emacs and vim do not actually support

396495
text-editor	editor
if correct this would be pretty exceptional since it s quite difficult to find a text-editor feature that has not made its way into at least one of these two old-school editor

396495
emacs	vim
question has anyone ever seen or implemented this feature in either emacs vim or both

396500
silverlight	wpf
i ve seen an example that calls a webservice which uses wpf constructs to convert a wpf formattedtext object to a pathgeometry but those objects aren t available in silverlight

396502
firefox	opera
the following works in firefox and opera sorry i do not have access to other browsers at the moment

396517
emacs	vim
i don t think this feature has a direct analogue in either emacs or vim which is not to say that everything achievable with this feature is not possible in some fashion with the two old-school editors

396517
emacs	vim
and like most things emacs and vim power-users would probably be able to achieve such a task exceedingly quickly even if mere mortals like myself could spend five minutes figuring out the correct grep search and replace with appropriate back-references for example

396566
value	field
there is also the issue of non-integer key field which may be the case for enumerated value and similar

396569
swing	swt
because i m not very fond of writing webapps i plan to build a gui swing or swt that would only manage pojos do some reporting and invoke methods from the container

396573
kate	kde
kate kde advanced text editor

396578
show	next
aaron has been using and teaching objective-c and the frameworks now associated with cocoa since his days at next and it show

396613
ftp	ssh
if you don t have ssh access just upload an svn export via ftp

396626
delphi	vb.net
delphi is also much faster than .net you can not notice speed if you develop database applications but if you work on image processing or other intesive algoritams delphi code is faster comparing to c# vb.net

396626
delphi	c++
microsoft c++ is only compatible with previous versions but coding in c++ is horror i know its powerfull but can t be comparad to delphi when time is critical for those who did t use delphi just search google for vcl components and see how big is delphi comunity

396644
python	perl
an example would be something that allowed one to escape out into a python or perl snippet in the middle of c code and where the snippet spit out c that is then compiled as normal

396685
getter	setter
somewhat similar to what you ve described for testing the presence of a default constructor i ve used testutil to automatically test getter and setter

396691
.when	ready
what this means is that you can stash the value of return or of throw and call them later .when you re really ready to return or throw

396697
contains	any
for the impatient this gets a list of filenames filtering out .txt files then sets the foundcontents to true if any of the text files contains the word orion

396698
haskell	erlang
if you want a good balance i d combine reading some of the erlang-specific sources already cited or joe armstrong s book programming erlang software for a concurrent world with some of the tutorial links from the haskell web site

396700
pointers	stack
note that i said stack is empty on function entry - well it really isn t but you can analyze every function individually and then just move up the call stack you have a return pointers somewhere so you know where you have to return - return-1 is some call for which you can also get an image of stack

396700
pointers	stack
conservative collection as opposed to precise scanning - where you ask yourself is this value on stack interpreted as a pointers a reference if it is then it is alive

396710
buffering	streaming
it is perfectly ok to transfer large amounts of data to a wcf-based service but you should look into a binding that supports streaming instead of buffering transfers basichttpbinding or a custombinding so each service instance doesn t hog too much memory

396717
pylons	django
using application servers like pylons django etc

396717
python	php
i put forth the effort because coding in python is much more enjoyable to me than php and after you get the apache config right once you never really have to mess with it again

396717
ruby-on-rails	django
on another note if you decide to go with a framework like django ruby-on-rails pylons ..

396720
updating	updates
updating your updates bloginfo description gives you your blog s description headline generally under your blog s title

396723
put	get
then on my controller i just had to get the parameters and put them in the this- data so my function would continue as usual

396755
wordpress	vbulletin
and after that it s a matter of looking in the footer for tip-offs such as powered by wordpress or vbulletin etc

396757
joomla	drupal
yes there are some telltale signs for common cmss like drupal joomla pligg and ruby-on-rails etc

396764
icollection	ienumerable
i would also return a read-only icollection or ienumerable unless you ve got some specific reason not to.

396773
multicast	packets
one caveat for multicast packets however is if there are any wifi connections the access point will use the slowest possible bit rate for the multicast packets and requires acks from all clients even those who are not part of the multicast grouping

396782
checkbox	button
yet people who argue that the user s don t read anything will often suggest putting bits of long dry explanatory text to help users who are confused by some random poor design decision like using checkbox for something that should be radio button because you can only select one

396791
transparency	frame
no windows frame and with transparency background

396815
paypal	fedex
ups s plain old xml api asks for the username and password with each call so does fedex s pox api so does paypal s soap api and cybersource s soap api--this seems to be fine enough for real world usage

396815
put	get
if the last option i guess you d have to have some sort of login methods or something on the service something that would send an okay you re logged if you pass in this hash value with future requests. but not all rest clients will be expecting to receive cookies just simple get put post delete requests without any state

396816
webforms	asp.net
these are the values that need to be set in the httpbrowsercapabilities object for a asp.net webforms site to run i would try making sure these are set and see if that fixes your problem i m not sure if it would but hey it worth a shot right

396830
sftp	ftp
the team works in zend studio 5.5 connected to the live server via ftp or sftp

396838
firefox	opera
you may prefer firefox opera safari because it s safer technologically superior or whatever but you may lose several users that way remember firefox has only recently reached 20 of usage share

396838
internet-explorer	firefox
.com works better with modern browsers like firefox should be just fine but provide a download link for firefox if the page worked for internet-explorer users anyway

396839
search-engine	seo
given that most sites want a good search-engine ranking and search-engines are scraper bots there s not much you can do that won t harm your seo

396849
interop	tlbimp
i have an interop assembly generated by tlbimp the generated classes are heavily evented and the performance is very important

396863
db2-connect	ibm
you generally have to buy db2-connect from ibm to get these files and i suspect it would be a similar situation for the .net

396877
google-chrome	firefox
while i m an avid user of firefox or google-chrome and sympathize with the underlying sentiment i think you should be careful about how you describe the problem

396877
google-chrome	firefox
the rest of the time i use firefox - or google-chrome at so.

396878
thickbox	jquery
another alternative is using jquery s thickbox plugin

firefox	opera
download firefox. messages wether i be using ie8 partner build firefox 3.1 beta 2 or another browser like opera safari

396901
administration	account
if i try to log in using the windows administration account it

396921
contains	elements
what are the elements that your new developers training program that you will not let a developer touch your code without completing it would contains

396933
32-bit	64bit
initially the .net application also gave me 80040154 but then i figured how to make it produce 32-bit code and not 64bit so now the errors in c# and vbscript applications are the same

396933
administration	account
and i am working from account with administration priviledges

396937
document	element
another approach you might be able to get away with would be wrapping the text in a span element either in the document or dynamically and or temporary by scripting and using the span to measure positioninging assuming it s not picking up any additional styles that may affect the positioning

396957
device-driver	hardware
if those don t do it for you then you need to drop down to hooking the operating system calls or more likely the hardware level which usually involves writing a device-driver hooking the idt interrupt descriptor table

396980
entity-relationship	diagram
start with an entity-relationship diagram between entities

397046
haskell	scheme
if not check the functional programming like lisp scheme or haskell languages or programming in logic like prolog

it allows memory usage optimization to the extent impossible in high-level languages as python or ruby

397051
google-chrome	firefox
this occurs in ie firefox and google-chrome

397055
python	php
here s a literal translation to python of the php version by jfs

397068
constructor	object
one method that i have used in the past is to store my object properties in an xml file writing a custom save routine which adds to a passed ixmlnode and a new constructor which reads from a passed ixmlnode

397068
attributes	properties
i store component as a node and the properties as attributes unless the properties is another object then it would be a child node

397071
json	csv
there are also converters for csv json and other formats

397071
stax	sax
the .net side supports xmlreader and xmlwriter while the java side supports sax stax and dom

397080
oracle	mysql
as well as i know neither mysql oracle nor ms-sql like it when user plays with their datafiles.

397082
fflush	stdio
stdio file streams are fflush then closed

397082
fflush	stdio
stdio file streams are fflush then closed

397100
pascal	delphi
now i m pretty comfortable with delphi pascal sql c# and java

397120
csv	xml
it will let you save objects and lists to xml csv databases etc

397128
communication	messages
i think it is more flexible to add a two-way communication cross platform - maybe boost or corba or just straight ip based with my own messages protocols

397139
minesweeper	pong
if you re interested in game design then you could try cloning pong easy or minesweeper harder

397166
contains	elements
the elements will be default initialized which means for a pointer that the pointer will contains a null pointer value

397187
authentication	login
what i mean is do i need to authentication just to see anything other than the login page or do i see some things when i m logged in and other things when i m not etc

397196
versioning	upgrade
all is well right up until somebody install on the same machine .net3.0sp1 and along with it msvcrt80 versioning 1433 is install and a policy to automatically upgrade

397205
python	lua
once ironpython reached maturity we decided that since python is a little more full-featured and well-integrated with vs as well as having more people who use it we would replace all our lua with python

397205
python	lua
lua is a fine little language i m not sure i can think of any advantages of lua over python at this point

397223
contains	elements
the right side value in this statement is a list which contains x 2 plus the elements of keys x 0 y and the elements of keys x 1 y

397223
contains	elements
so the version using a b will causing y contains itself as its elements

397227
contains	any
business-objects should not hold any state and hence will contains only static-methods

397227
any	set
also suggest is there any asp.net framework that can generate dynamic asp.net ajax pages based on a set of user-interface instructions like mozilla xul

397228
groovy	java
calling groovy from java and vice versa is very painful to configure

397228
eager-loading	one-to-many
if it isn t eclipse problems then it s eager-loading fetching in the view one-to-many relationships weird empty file bug behavior a weird property getter bug â it just goes on and on

397249
emacs	vim
btw the killer emacs feature that makes me care about vim vimpulse is that different frames can edit the same file

397259
order	join
your solution with a join and then order on the display_order column is the most nearly correct solution

397285
32-bit	16-bit
i just found out that in c# you can use u1234 16-bit and u00001234 32-bit

397292
internationalization	localization
if anybody know how to do the internationalization and localization in wpf through only xaml

397294
button	slide
the user will be able to create tabs by clicking on a link or any other element for that matter they will be able to inline edit its name whenever they have more tabs then the length of the div the button will be visible allowing them to slide inside the div i will have events bound to their load click and double click events

397308
groovy	java
we eschewed all java and went pure-grails and groovy

397308
spring	grails
yes grails is immature compared to spring perhaps

397308
spring	grails
the complexity grails embodies is a reflection of spring s hibernate s own complexity

397313
python	perl
i m in the process of rewriting the perl program openkore in python under the name erok reverse of the original kore

397337
autodesk	maya
i develop tools in autodesk maya

397337
contains	any
these guis often contains what you d normally expect to see in any basic windows

397337
maya	mel
this is due to the fact that maya runs all scripts be they mel or python in a single thread that the main maya gui shares

397348
jquery-plugins	jquery
most jquery-plugins are open source with liberal licenses like jquery itself

397371
dependency-injection	repository-pattern
we are using the repository-pattern for our data-access and structuremap for dependency-injection

397390
google-chrome	firefox
i understand that firefox addins can be created in javascript and google-chrome

397406
knapsack-problem	subset-sum
this sounds a lot like the subset-sum problem and knapsack-problem so i strongly doubt you can do this with a simple query

397409
buffering	streaming
it s widely used also in the c++ standard-library c++ streaming buffering for example have functions pub.

397415
priority-queue	heap
response to comment yes the priority-queue is based on a heap

397415
priority-queue	heap
response to forthcoming comment since the priority-queue is based on a heap an interesting property is that by changing the priority of a value through its index means that afterwards the value won t necessarily be at that index

gethashcode	equals
unfortunately since this has 2 methods gethashcode and equals there is no direct delegate versioning of this except perhaps or

397443
scheme	lisp
it s good in game ais because of its nice list manipulations at least in lisp and scheme and for mathematical computations because of its syntax

397443
haskell	scheme
scheme lisp and haskell have a syntax that makes mathematical computations easy to read

397450
perl	ruby
all of these can also be done in a compiled language but for me it is faster and easier to do them in a scripting language i use ruby but perl and python are just fine

397463
perl	ruby
i find scripting languages very useful obviously when there s a specific task that fits the language s strengths string processing with perl web development with ruby or whatnot

397463
c++	lua
c++ for example is a very expressive language - but it s development costs are higher than say lua

397466
knapsack-problem	np-complete
sounds like the knapsack-problem which is np-complete

397466
oracle	mysql
in oracle you would use the cube function to turn this into a generic version not sure about a mysql equivalent

397488
python	java
is there something like python interactive repl mode but for java

397493
contains	any
it s important to understand that if you want to save what is currently contains in the variant you still have to know the type as with in the boost any case

397493
boost-variant	boost-any
boost-variant is quite big and is not completely standard compliant while boost-any is standard compliant but uses dynamic memory even for small types so it s slower

397496
python	java
jython is a python implementation which lets you inspect and interact with java objects

397497
data-members	private
altrnatively you could make all your value data-members private and provide accessors that return an error or throw if it isn t set

397505
groovy	java
since groovy also includes classes from the core java platform you ll be able to use those classes as well

397514
groovy	java
it actually was meant to try and test groovy code but since groovy is a superset of java it allows plain java stuff as well

397529
groovy	java
i ll write desktop apps in java but groovy allows me to blend in scripts as well

397529
perl	ruby
in the past i ve used bash+awk+sed some perl ruby etc etc...for one off tasks it is mainly a matter of what you and the rest of your team are comfortable with

397544
java-3d	jogl
plenty of libraries out there to help you get started jogl and java-3d for example you should look into using some called a scene graph which will help you provide a good foundation to start from

397562
search-engine	web-crawler
my website has content that expires frequently and new stuff comes in that s why i wanted it updated whenever the search-engine web-crawler comes to my site

397581
constructor	object
problem i need to throw an exception when my class s constructor receives an object in its parameters that is not found within a given list i ve built elsewhere

397589

397612
shell	bash
given the dangers of suid shell scripts is there a more secure way of giving passwordless access to scripts bash php with root permissions in linux

397636
verilog	vhdl
the free model foundry has a large number of models some in vhdl others in verilog that are available now

397669
python	php
python web-apps tend to require more initial setup and development than the equivalent php site particularly so for small sites

397703
contains	any
then see if you get any windows and if they contains the right contents

397716
sql-server	mysql
i don t know if it works in mysql but in sql-server you can use a trick for this

397738
32-bit	64bit
the host server i was on was a 32-bit os and the one i moved to is 64bit

397755
haskell	scala
as to the second question haskell has a nice range of libraries although some are more mature than others but scala a hybrid oo-functional language running on the jvm has the advantages that you can more gradually transition into the functional style and you have the full range of java-accessible libraries available to you

397796
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and microsoft and opera and google-chrome would all use different methods my guess is they arrays not associative arrays use something like stl s std vector

397801
punctuation	words
instead of matching foreign language characters there are so many of them in many different ascii ranges you might be better off looking for the characters that delineate your words - spaces quotation marks and other punctuation

397815
postback	ajax
i am attempting to manage an ajax connection by calling a button onclick method on a separate web part in order to force the partial postback on the consumer

397821
attributes	properties
then use the attributes properties in your asp.net page like this

397823
constructor	object
there s no way to determine whether a call to your constructor will succeed without knowledge of some other object which leads to a confusing and easily misused api

397834
spring	grails
i think spring s support of grails is going to be a big boost

397867
mersenne-twister	generator
george marsaglia has written an excellent random number generator that is extremely fast simple and has a much higher period than the mersenne-twister

397872
http-post	post
http-post open a popup via javascript set the form target to it s name as target and post

397884
authentication	login
is this an example of where it s more appropriate providing the app with a central sql authentication login whilst users get read only rights for integrated security

397896
isapi-rewrite	isapi
if you are trying simply to have multiple sub-domains handled from a single web application you can fake this sub-domain behavior outside of asp.net entirely using an iis-based server hosting a single web application with an isapi-rewrite tool such as ionics isapi-rewrite filtering assuming you have the ability to add an isapi filtering to your hosting environment

397896
hosts-file	hosts
you can t really test the original domain map in cassini either since the windows hosts doesn t allow rules with ports

397896
webserver	host
while this approach allows you to host several sub-domains and potentially several full domains from a single application the restriction on redirect rewrites within the asp.net webserver cassini will leave you restricted to testing the functionality of these final location new-sub-domain

397926
contains	set
i would like to take a set of controls input selected textarea which are contains within a div and send their values as json via ajax to a server

397933
twitter	gmail
when you register one of them for example twitter it says why dont you invite your friends from hotmail or yahoo or gmail

397960
32-bit	64bit
where this long q i 0xffffffffl business promotes q i to a 64bit # and ensures its high 32-bit are 0 s

397969
linked-list	nodes
now you have have a linked-list of nodes all allocated on the stack

397972
autotools	cmake
i suggest learning cmake - it s a great cross-platform build tool that is much easier to use than make autotools

397973
checkbox	button
when it comes to radio checkbox and submit button it gets a little more complicated but clean semantic html can be displayed the way you want it using css

397996
32-bit	64bit
run on 32-bit machine and on 64bit and no problem happens beside having more memory available

397997
subtraction	addition
for addition subtraction multiplication shift left the logical operations equality

398012
click	mouse
please see this it covers all combinations of mouse click with notifyicon as well as much more

398019
click	mouse
please see this it covers all combinations of mouse click with notifyicon as well as much more

398036
contains	any
in any mouse event from notifyicon simply look at control.mouseposition this contains the x y of the mouse

398038
click	mouse
this shows and handles all the mouse click combinations for notifyicon

398047
selected	listbox
each listbox can filtering the other one so if the user selected an item in listbox 1 listbox 2 3 4 and 5 should be filteringing

398047
selected	listbox
if the user selected an item in listbox 3 listbox 1 2 4 and 5 should be filtering

398047
selected	listbox
another scenario would be where i selected an item in listbox 1 it filtering the others and then i selected an item in listbox 2 and it further filtering listbox 1 and the others like a chain effect

398092
version-control	bazaar
you might want to look at the code for some python version-control systems like mercurial or bazaar

398106
ironpython	ironruby
about the monstrous hybrid there s no such thing it s just a very active port like ironruby or ironpython in .net land

398106
solaris	linux
given that the fun and capability factors are more or less equal i d pick jruby just in case i happen to have to deploy on linux solaris or something that s not windows in the future

398108
.net	wcf
if i were doing it today i d use asp.net mvc for the web front-end wcf for web services and either eliminate the c++ client or consider writing it in c# with .net or mono

398113
selected	listbox
and then handle the item selected event on listbox 2 in a similar matter cascading updates down your page control

398133
freebsd	debian
i d rather move to freebsd or debian in the future.

398135
google-chrome	firefox
this works with the latest versions of firefox google-chrome opera and safari

398154
web-deployment	web
web application projects and web-deployment projects are here

398158
oracle	mysql
the framework providers sql oracle mysql specific classes provide the implementation that queries the db schema processes the class mappings and renders executes the db access code as necessary

398159
having	select
i love not having to worry about inner join and select count

398178
configuration	environment
maintaining the configuration also gets tedious and unmaintainable as business requirements and models constantly change and evolve in an agile environment

398182
serialization	marshalling
orms generally handle marshalling the values of individual columns into the appropriate types so that you don t have to parsing serialization them yourself

398190
contains	any
let s assume all i really want to figure out is the id of the form table that would contains any search results found in the child answer comment tables so i can show the entire form that containss the located entries

398200
contains	set
i think it s important to note that good gui specification should contains a set of guidelines principles for the entire project to ensure consistency

398200
any	set
i usually inherit from a well established set of guidelines ex and then list any difference

398205
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in webforms you could put a different web.config in the the admin directory to take care of this is there anyway to do it in asp.net-mvc

398209
constructor	private
anyone who has programmed with actionscript 3.0 has most certainly noticed its lack of support for private constructor and abstract classes

398209
constructor	private
i know actionscript 3.0 follows the current ecmascript standard and this is the reason for its lack of private constructor but what about abstract classes are they not in the ecmascript standard eather

398209
constructor	private
i guess the more specific question is why does ecmascript standard not support private constructor

398213
required	checked
ruby-on-rails then required this file and checked for the correct class definition

398221
ubuntu	debian
if you are running debian or ubuntu you will soon find out that you will not be able to live on the bleeding edge like many cpan module authors seem to do

398257
firefox	safari
trying to debugging with eclipse i see that when using safari it is the doget method that is called while when using firefox is dopost

398257
firefox	safari
practically it seems that safari fires both post and then immediately get while firefox fires only post as it should according to the html form

398263
32-bit	64bit
an integer may be 64bit instead of 32-bit

398264
javafx	swing
how to use javafx in your swing application

398278
mysql-spatial	postgis
the spatial functions in postgis are much more functional not constrained to bbox operations than those in the mysql-spatial functions

398285
grass	gdal
grass r gmt gdal postgis mapserver are some of the tools i use on a regular basis

398294
ubuntu	debian
if you re on debian or ubuntu try installing the texlive-fonts-recommended package

398305
directory	folder
i originally thought that i could just create a virtual directory to a network share that would be the upload folder however that solution has turned into a permissions nightmare

398336
directory	folder
i use microsoft synctoy 2.0 to synchronize my project directory with a folder on a network share

398337
openlayers	mapserver
a combination of postgis for storing the data mapserver for generating map tiles and openlayers for the interface should give you something to start with

398342
lgpl	gpl
regardless of sun s commitment to open-source you can license your java application with gpl lgpl mit or even the so-called proprietary licenses

398353
silverlight	wpf
i know that wpf 3.5 sp1 supports a stringformat in a binding but can silverlight do the same

398360
constructor	private
private constructor and abstract classes are not good oop elements

398368
lgpl	gpl
often software is release under multiple licenses which allows the user to choose the terms firefox for example uses this approach and is triple-licensed gpl lgpl and mpl

398374
instances	destroy
the current dom instances in the browser is destroy

398410
configuration	installation
the advantage of having the entire installation configuration self documented in the scripts configuration that create the unattended installation

398410
configuration	installation
very hard to keep track of configuration installation changes that took place before cloning as none of it is scripted

398419
sorted	lookup
to process a lookup break down the identifier at the dashes into a list sorted by decreasing length with the neutral default language english as the empty string

398421
click	mouse
this shows how to use multiple contextmenus as well as different ones with any combination of mouse click

398424
contains	set
however the record set does not contains information on how the resulting values are generated - therefore the computation formula is lost

398429
lgpl	gpl
rant gpl and lgpl are terrible licenses written by very bad lawyers who can t get their terminology straight

398429
put	get
the real world answer is that people who put their java libraries under lgpl most likely intend for them to be linked to redistributed within commercial java applications so it s extremely unlikely that you will get into any trouble if you simply redistribute those unmodified libraries with your application

398446
administration	account
i would set up a service account and give it administration privileges and run the task under that account

398448
directory	folder
a simple dummy task might be to create a directory in the temporary folder

398458
contains	any
if you know of any articles or books that contains details about different implementation trade off of each of them please direct me

398476
directory	folder
in my templates folder i make a directory called html and then inside that a new directory called mod___mainmenu and then a make copy the default.php file from the existing mod_mainmenu folder from the modules directory

398477
administration	enterprise
as a stupid but check item goto central administration operations convert license type and ensure that you have the enterprise client access listed

398494
configuration	environment
what i try to do is separate the configuration settings that will be different for deployments to different environment into separate files organized by logical functions and then not include these files in the deployment scripts.

398531
where-clause	sql
also if it is not needed by any where-clause or order by or anything else within the optimized sql and all the attributes that are needed happen to be in an index then that query can read only the index and not touch the table at all.

398549
processor	cpu
see at some point in the near future processor speed will not be able to increase using the same cpu technology

398550
imagemagick	magick.net
not being a fan of microsoft s track record when it comes to handling and creating files of standardized formats i would suggest using imagemagick available as a .net library in the form of magick.net beware currently has a spyware popup i have alerted the site owner

398556
pointers	stack
this will work for objects created on stack but not a regular pointers in c++

398564
perl	php
all programming platforms languages commonly used to implement web services java .net php perl rails etc. allow easy binding of web service end-point s to a base uri

398572
silverlight	wpf
silverlight 4 and later has the same stringformat binding property as wpf

398579
python	java
i have been programming in python php java and c for a couple or years now and i just finished reading hackers and painters so i would love to give lisp a try

398579
scheme	lisp
so my recommendation would be to read first the little schemer then its a couple of hours and its worth it if you decide lisp or scheme or whatever dialect is not what you where looking for you will still have a very fun new way of thinking about recursion

398593
hotmail	webmail
in case anything should fail i will sometimes email myself important pieces i am working on to webmail account such as yahoo or hotmail

398598
attributes	properties
you could do some special things like add attributes to your class and properties but they are really not needed

398611
scheme	lisp
it uses scheme which is a nice and clean dialect of lisp

398621
compact-framework	.net
see subject note that this question only applies to the .net compact-framework

398650
contains	any
since the string may contains anything it could have the vulnerable concatenation in another function it is impossible to have the tool determine with any certainty that a problem exists

398676
google-chrome	opera
i ve run fiddler and windows network monitor and verified that all links on the page are it works fine on ie 7 8 safari opera and google-chrome

398678
multicast	wan
as for the topic we have not much experience with multicast over wan however my feeling is that pgm + wan + high volume of data would lead to retransmission storms

398681
compact-framework	.net
the .net compact-framework supports

398681
compact-framework	.net
the .net compact-framework throws a

398693
tail	eof
you can either use a tool such as tail or powershell or you can write some dumb code that seeks eof and then looks back for n newlines

398702
gettext	poedit
to work with or have translators work with the gettext files i recommend looking at the free cross-platform poedit that may edit the .po files

398704
sql-server	oracle
or do i just need to use oracle or sql-server to develop a robust product

398706
bmp	png
i tried octave but for some reason it can t even load a png bmp or anything other than 1 specific format

398709
data-structures	linked-list
if you really want to consider correct consider rethinking the question in terms of data-structures â what you might be asking is how to implement a linked-list in a database

398713
youtube	flickr
mysql is good enough for flickr facebook wikipedia google and youtube to use it says wiki - i d say they each serve more load than you re likely to reach

398716
oracle-xe	oracle
oracle also has a free version called oracle-xe

398718
postgresql	mysql
i can say that both mysql and postgresql will work as well as any dbms in most situations

398733
postgresql	mysql
if you have a choice between postgresql and mysql i say go the postgresql route because if you get deep into stored proc and function development postgresql will give you a much more robust feature set to work from

398757
constructor	object
i think you might want to be careful about which object are being created - put debugging statements in the client s constructor

398765
order	add
you can simply add another ascending column to that table date id whatever and then order the query by that other column descendingly and limit the result to 1 row

398766
solaris	linux
and coldfusion 8 works on linux macintosh and solaris as well though i ve never used cf myself

398778
google-chrome	firefox
i have ie 7.0 firefox 3.0 and google-chrome 1.0

398786
difference	count
it s more of a stylistic difference in the same way that some people prefer count over count 1

398789
conditional	operators
maybe a block followed by the conditional operators

398793
updating	updates
this could be circumvented by doing an updates on the item to be moved to and index of -1 maybe then updating the rest and finally moving the new item at -1 to the new index

398794
implements	abstract
you could declare an abstract base-class or you could have an interface that your object implements

398803
selected	button
i would like to place the selected report name and the company name in the report header these are the name values the user selected from the dropdown lists just before hitting the view report button

398811
tree	trie
and that was wikipedia s comments on the tree not trie

398818
put	get
this bug is rarely put to the test one probable reason it didn t get fixed in vista sp1

398820
lgpl	gpl
i was already bitten when the mysql interface libraries switched from lgpl to gpl in the 3.80 versioning

398846
double	int
2 the code return math.round n precision precision .tostring does not compile due to an ambiguity between math.round double int and math.round decimal int

398856
data-structures	map
i d especially like to understand how storage and retrieval in data-structures work in .net in some way analogous to stl deque vector map etc...

398863
python	ruby
i m working through the project euler stuff in common lisp python and ruby

398866
constructor	object
i am running into a design disagreement with a co-worker and would like people s opinion on object constructor design

398866
constructor	object
currently objects are constructed using an application class which contains all of the current settings for the application event log destination database strings etc... so the constructor for every object looks like

398866
constructor	object
the problem is that in the bottom of the call stack you call the parameterized constructor then higher up the stack when the new object expects a reference to the application object to be there we ran into a lot of null reference errors and saw the design flaw

398866
constructor	object
i wanted to change the objects constructor to accept only the arguments it needs so that public object application would change to public object classmember1 classmember2 etc...

398870
oracle	mysql
or you can purchase mysql but than advantage over mssql oracle goes away

398872
python	java
there are many open source implementations for all major platforms including c++ java python one published by google itself

398882
callback	methods
when i call a methods of the com class from a button event handler in my wpf windows the methods works without any problems but when i call it in one of the event callback within my static class it throws following exception-handling

398888
python	c++
there is also one plugin that translates the c++ api to python plugins can be written in python

398888
python	c++
i want to allow users to write plugins in c# in addition to c++ and python

398899
memset	malloc
once the pointers actually pointerss to something via malloc or by assigning to it the address of a struct my_t then you can properly memset it

398900
common-lisp	scheme
first of all scheme and common-lisp are fairly different in rather deep ways like scoping

398900
common-lisp	lisp
for common-lisp as well as practical common-lisp i d recommend david lamkins s successful lisp

398910
linux	aix
i vaguely remember from my unix aix and hpux i ll admit i ve never used shared memory in linux days that deletion simply marks the block as no longer attachable by new clients

398918
versioning	upgrade
what you need to do is make sure all subsequent install upgrade properly over the previous versioning so that different folder are not required

398949
sql-server	oracle
if everyone else in the extended project is using ms sql-server and this guy chose oracle how do you transfer expertise and staff into or out of this project

398953
constructor	private
effective-java second edition item 4 discusses using private constructor to enforce noninstantiability

398959
daemons	systemd
one written in c that makes the interface to the operating systemd and the other in java that provides the daemons api

398961
javascript	dom
check the dom level 2 core reference to see the various possible types of nodes so you can filter out the undesired ones with a simple snippet of javascript

398996
ienumerator	ienumerable
however the most common meaning of this is something that implements ienumerable returning an ienumerator

399030
32-bit	64bit
in practice pointers will be size 2 on a 16-bit system if you can find one 4 on a 32-bit system and 8 on a 64bit system but there s nothing to be gained in relying on a given size

399031
installation	upgrade
advertise your msi in active-directory installation and upgrade does not require administrative privileges

399039
postgresql	mysql
i have used mysql and postgresql for more than five years on and off and both are good

399039
postgresql	mysql
do note however that mysql vs postgresql is one of the holy flamewars like linux vs windows etc

399039
postgresql	oracle
postgresql is more oracle-like in syntax and in some of the features indeed it has been occasionally called poor man s oracle

399039
postgresql	mysql
of the two postgresql has for a long time been considered more robust and mysql - faster however both advantages are by now somewhat debatable

399068
ruby	php
theres a couple of cms s in python php and ruby using that design and well.

399078
perl	awk
it is different with for example python sed grep awk perl rename apache find and so on

399078
any	set
is there any rule set which tells when i should and when i should not escape special characters

399085
command-line	cmd
is there a way call the source cmd programmatically and not from the cmd-line

399114
integer	short
for integer types we have short int int and long int which is pretty straightforward

399115
unmanaged	c++-cli
i found that c++-cli was the best option for building a bridge between .net and unmanaged c++ though as noted by other posters com in another option

399115
unmanaged	c++-cli
if you are not comfortable with hosting the clr then push as muc hof your app code as possible into dlls and then write a small c++-cli app that brings up your unmanaged user-interface

399116
webforms	asp.net
i prefer asp.net webforms because i think it allows for extremely rapid web app development but i am sure you will receive recommendations for

399128
32-bit	64bit
the two most common floating point formats use 32-bit and 64bit the longer one is double the size of the first one so it was called a double

399132
windows-live	hotmail
hotmail windows-live contacts api beta - api reference

399132
google-docs	spreadsheet
i ve been using google data api to successfully download my gmail contacts and google-docs spreadsheet

399155
required	checked
on secure communication checked required secure channel ssl require 128-bit encyption require client certificate and enable client certificate mapping

399162
ruby-on-rails	django
choose between ruby-on-rails and django

399162
ruby-on-rails	django
i like ruby-on-rails better in general but django s admin interface can save you a lot of time when you need it

399163
32-bit	64bit
really what this means is that it uses twice the space of a floating point value -- if your float is a 32-bit then your double will be a 64bit

399163
double	int
the name long double is likely just down the same tradition as the long int vs

399163
integer	short
short integer for integral types except in this case they reversed it since int is equivalent to long int

399175
expression	evaluation
you might like to look at the shiny ball book aka effective perl sanitised amazon link specifically the chapter on regular expression to get a feel for then difference in regexp engine evaluation types

399188
canvas	scale
apply a scale transform to the canvas in blend

399189
grouping	sorting
finally with linq in c# you now get much better functionality for working with collections aggregates grouping sorting filtering etc that may have given datasets the advantage

399193
macros	vba
there s lots of different ways to get at the messages in an exchange mailbox but since it seems this is something you re only going to want to run once to extract the data i d suggest writing a vba macros to run inside outlook itself having opened the exchange mailbox in question within outlook

399215
value	field
i d guess that a fast way perhaps the fastest way to do it might be to add all the objects into a dictionary or a hashset using the property as the key field a methods like hashset.add has a return code which tells you whether this property value has already been added

399219
entity-framework	ado.net
even if entity-framework was slower it is the focus of the ado.net team at microsoft and will be improved many times

399259
similarity	distance
you could then use a shortest path algorithm to give you the distance between the nodes as a measure of their similarity

399264
row	col
a run instance is created for each row col and 3x3 square

399264
contains	set
the run class contains the set of numbers not yet placed within the run

399267
any	set
what you were binding to was the property and propertychanged from inotifypropertychanged was only being called when the property was being set the binding engine was unaware of any changes that occurred within the collection

399272
backgroundworker	winforms
however if you re trying to do some background work in a winforms application i recommend you check out the backgroundworker control

399281
sql-server	mysql
the test queries run significantly faster on sql-server express than they do on mysql

399281
postgresql	mysql
bottom line - mysql used to be a good option but consider sql server express and postgresql as better current alternatives

399284
directory	folder
the text of the email is stored in individual files in the respective mailbox folder directory

399340
radio	click
checkbox radio you can click on the text as well as the checkbox to check the checkbox as well as focus i believe blah blah blah

399340
checkbox	textarea
other inputs if you click the text it will focus the input textarea text file this functionality isn t as useful as checkbox radios

399343
explode	implode
anyway he pointed to article about f# that have two functions for string manipulation explode and implode

399361
decimal-point	digits
in fixed-point representation there are a fixed number of digits after the radix point a generalization of the decimal-point in decimal representations

399361
digits	radix
contrast to this to floating-point representations where the radix point can move or float within the digits of the number being represented

399361
32-bit	64bit
in k r c float referred to floating-point representations with 32-bit binary representations and double referred to floating-point representations with 64bit binary representations or double the size and whence the name

399364
selected	checkbox
the for attribute let the user click on the label also to selected the checkbox with the corresponding id not name and not being annidate i can better control the layout with css

399379
having	select
how can you go about updating a record without having to select the data first in linq

399383
user-interface	drawing
i echo the sentiment that putting a huge number of items in a list of any sort is probably not a good idea user-interface or otherwise but if you really have to display a large number of items don t forget to wrap the adding of items with a beginupdate and endupdate to prevent the drawing of items until the endupdate method is called

399392
binary-tree	tree
for example a function that can give you the length of the list independent of the type of the elements or a function does a binary-tree lookup independent of the type of keys stored in the tree

399394
concatenation	comma
why are you concatenation all values into one single string separated by a comma as a delimiter

399405
32-bit	64bit
today almost all languages guarantee to implement ieee 754 binary floating-point numbers at single precision 32-bit and double precision 64bit

399406
sql-server	mysql
i know that mysql and sql-server have full text search but i am not too certain on access

399411
configuration	environment
this just uses yaml load to load the configuration from the database configuration file database.yml which you can use yourself to get the information from outside the ruby-on-rails environment

399413
maya	pyqt
i m not sure if this is germane but some googling turns up that pyqt is pretty popular inside of maya

399413
wxpython	maya
utils.executedeferred is a maya function. be sure to check out how to create a non-blocking gui on the wxpython wiki

399428
put	get
try to get something put together that works even if its horribly inefficient and clunky then really spend some time looking at how things can be improved

399431
dialog	pop-up
this program creates a form windows and immediately creates another non-gui thread which wants to pop-up a modal dialog windows on the form s gui thread

399444
reference-type	generics
the difference between a and a hashtable is that a is a generics type that can specialize to store value types along reference-type

399445
minimum	max
minimum coupling and max coherence makes it easy to cut out defective parts

399447
getter	setter
would i still need to create getter and setter methods for each attributes like so

399455
any	set
it buys you being able to use your generic daos on any valid result set

399455
getter	setter
a similar scripting can readily take a sql table statement and convert it in to a java bean at least the base members that then your ide converts in to a flurry of getter setter

399455
having	select
mind is does kind of suck having to write a select statement with a zillion columns in it since you can t and shouldn t anyway use select from ... select always always leads to trouble ime

399462
python	ruby
not sure about ruby i had a search around but couldn t find anything although there is undoubtably a module for this but i know python has a maildir.mbox module which would use in the following way

399473
joomla	drupal
i am only intimately familiar with big systems like drupal and joomla but i know there are bare bones products for exactly what you are doing

399493
joomla	drupal
installation is extremely easy and it is much easier for the end user to manage than drupal or joomla

399499
python	php
a really nice system done entirely in python is plone if your more comfortable with python vs php

399509
sql-server	postgresql
i need to synchronize these two testdbs actually the direction is from sql-server to postgresql

399509
sql-server	postgresql
i ve already read this article microsoft sql-server to postgresql migration by ian harding but it seems to be a one-off solution

399511
content-disposition	content-type
not precisely but you can do it by hyperlinking to the img file and setting the content-type and content-disposition headers in the server response

399530
selected	cell
2.1 selected table row will show a view with cell details

399530
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
theelements sample code gives a basic idea of how to use uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller but the example does not discuss passing information from child controller to parent

399530
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in my case i have a uitabbarcontroller one of the tab shows a uinavigationcontroller with + on the top right corner or navigation bar

399530
uinavigationcontroller	uitableview
now + will open an interface for user input and that input will be used to store the data say in sql and create a new table cell in uitableview embedded in uinavigationcontroller

399534
perl	c++
too many years doing c c++ java c# perl etc

399549
worksheet	excel
it looks like the excel saveas method makes the saved worksheet the active workbook so i just close this without saving

399560
instances	private
i suggest using a wrapper class with a private static instances of the class you want to use for the singleton

399561
http	ssl
we provide a way for you to give your users either an opt-in or opt-out choice in the transmission of the usage data and the data is sent either over ssl the default or standard http

399582
content-length	http-headers
looking at the http-headers i see it s 200 with a content-length of 0

399616
keyboard	mouse
for a scripting utility i need to be able to record a series of keyboard and mouse events that occur when an application has focus

399623
hardware	monitor
the most important hardware updates and most underrated is the monitor

399639
instances	destroy
to answer your question i think i agree with your edit pass the pointer-to-provider into your app constructor store it as member data of the app instances and delete it when you destroy the app instances

399664
value	field
1 eav entity attributes value table - dynamic field but pain for reports and not very efficient but sometimes its the only way to go

399669
versioning	upgrade
i m using subversioning 1.4.6 and i cannot upgrade to versioning 1.5 right now

399682
defined	declare
the only way to declare that member function is to defined the class and then declare the function within that definition

399691
any	set
i need to include hidden the value say typeidentifier.type1 in user-controls one.how can i do this.i just need the object member to be set to typeidentifier.type1 what ever control in the user-controls it is.the thing is that i can t directly reference the enum above in my user-controls project.. - any help

399692
internet-explorer	firefox
there is a problem in internet-explorer 7 and firefox 3

399692
internet-explorer	firefox
i am able to read the data in file my.php but all the content is hidden when it is showing modal in internet-explorer 7 and firefox 3

399697
droppable	draggable
you may also want to look into jquery user-interface s draggable droppable and sortable plugins

399715
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
for your case these would be the uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller

399719
value	field
i was able to come up with a disgusting horribly hacky workaround that basically uses reflection to update the field in the class to the correct value

399736
stdin	pipe
you can pipe in whatever text you d like on stdin and it will be just the same as having the user type it themselves

399737
principles	srp
srp the single responsibility principles a class should have only one reason to change

399737
principles	lsp
lsp the liskov substition principles subtyping must be substitutable for their base types

399760
environment	building
i need to configure my eclipse workspace such that it mimics the building environment and show compilation errors when sources in package a refer package b

399784
environment	building
apply dev environment service packs reasonably quickly but check on a viewmodel first so you can see whether the building still works and then give that building to qa for smoke testing before upgrading the dev machines

399787
firefox	opera
all other browsers work perfectly firefox safari and opera on my mac and firefox on pc

399795
configuration	upgrade
other than obvious uses in programming i ve seen makefiles used to perform repetitive tasks on servers to manage system settings such as user grouping creation package upgrade updates and copying configuration files into place

399808
debian	linux
a lot of gnu linux packagers make use of this debian rules and others

399815
ubuntu	linux
now i switched to linux ubuntu to see how it works out there and strangely the stars in the table cell are layed out perfectly while the stars on the context menu don t even show up

399821
variables	boolean
it depends on the language.java flags it as an error as only boolean expressions can be used inside the if parenthesis and unless the two variables are boolean in which case the assignment is also a boolean

399850
g++	gcc
gcc and g++ will let you get away with a lot on the default level

399850
g++	gcc
i just wanted to point out that i don t use -werror but i do understand it s utility on gcc g++ because i use

399862
contains	set
this will lead to a set of form.id values which are distinct and which are the ids of forms which have at least 1 answer or comment which contains the string to search in the field which is full-text-search enabled

399867
javascript	dom
i know how to hook up events from the dom elements like click etc but i m building a tiny javascript library plugin to handle some preview functionality

399868
required	checked
some compilers the most well-known for sure provide built-in lint -style checked but that certainly isn t required

399870
any	set
say you want to get the uptime of a whole set of hosts or basically perform any slow operation

399871
struct	unions
another warning that can be helpful if you re handling unions and struct at the byte level is -wpadded

399890
web-config	app-config
you ll need to make sure your class library s app-config file is deployed and link it into the web-config

399907
linked-list	arrays
i m writing a sparse matrix class in c++ in which every row and column are arrays of linked lists from a class i created aptly named linked-list

399909
subtraction	addition
you can also do this without addition and subtraction

399910
value	field
it looks as though the observe_field functionality is what i need to use but i m stuck on how to update the value of an existing text field

399915
row	col
matrix row col + val

399918
arrays	map
create an arrays of marker locations and add those to your arrays as you add the markers to the map

399922
abstract	extends
for the class wich extends phpunit_framework_testcase it should be abstract and the warning disapear

399937
linked-list	nodes
ex circular linked-list means there is nodes pointes to any previous nodes

399950
contains	elements
the recommendations i ve seen are suggesting that the views are separate with common elements contains within a control to stay dry

399957
select	union
so far i can select things using some primitive predicate search and then union and intersection for more complex things

399999
32-bit	16-bit
if you compile this program with open watcom and run it you ll get 6 because far pointers that it supports consist of 32-bit offset and 16-bit segment values
