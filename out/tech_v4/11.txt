110123
webforms	asp.net
i m using asp.net webforms for blog style comments

110131

postgresql	mysql
sqlite is nice and they have really nice documentation however you should be aware that it is not a full featured sql database like mysql postgresql or the commercial variants

110158
swing	gwt
the easiest way to think about it is that building a gwt app is kind of like building a java swing application that hooks into a server

110158
firefox	safari
when you re done it all compiles down into html and javascript and has very good modern browser support ie6+ firefox opera safari

110162
duplicates	contains
since you don t want to store duplicates the studio information address etc in each movie entry you store a relation to it so each movie item contains a reference to a studio item

110162
oracle	mysql
it s important to learn the syntax for the one you re using eg don t learn oracle syntax and then try and use it in mysql but they are similar enough that the concepts are the same

110172
any	set
one thing you can do is to create client classes corresponding to the web service data contracts with any additional functionality that you want and set the web service reference to reuse existing types

110182
revision	svn
well you can run svn info to determine the current revision number and you could probably extract that pretty easily with a regex like revision 0-9 +

110189
getter	setter
beans with just getter and setter

110192
revision	updates
the revision will be updates with the revision number at the next commit to

110197

my quakewatch app has a subscription feature it means i had to email latest quakes as they happend but i can not run a background-process in-app engine to monitor new quakes

110275
scheduled-tasks	task-queue
now task-queue can be used for running batch processing or scheduled-tasks

110275
updating	updates
models should be specially designed considering all the transactions you wish to have in future because entities only in same entity grouping can be used in a transaction and it makes the process of updating two different grouping a nightmare transfer money from user1 to user2 in transaction is impossible unless they are in same entity grouping but making them same entity grouping may not be best for frequent updates purposes...

110305
positioning	sidebar
i know i m working on positioning the sidebar

110321
associations	model
there s probably a more elegant way to break up that string and create delete ingredient model associations as needed but it s late and i can t think of it right now

110326
vmware	esx
from my experience moving up the vmware application stack has never been problematic server to workstation to esx

110326
vmware	esx
however i would verify this by export all of your vms from the workstation install to an esx install to make sure you re not seeing any weird issues related to running the high-end tool from vmware

110331
internet-explorer	firefox
i just tested your example html in firefox 3 webkit nightly internet-explorer 7 and all of them rendered exactly the same with the number at the top where it should be

110341
raw-sockets	packets
the tutorials i ve found online on using raw-sockets all describe how to build a syn flooder but this is somewhat easier than actually establishing a tcp connection since you don t have to construct a response based on the original packets

i strongly recommend vmware over parallels as vmware supports 2 virtual cpu s i think it s up to 4 virtual cpu s in v2

110454
persistence	hibernate
even better if we are talking about a database based web application i would go beyond the core j2ee patterns and use hibernate or the java persistence api to create a domain model that supports lazy loading of relations and use this in the view

110489
graphviz	doxygen
i can t recall the details offhand but the graph features may require you to install graphviz and tell doxygen the path where it can find graphviz s dotty.exe

110491

secondly they both protect you from sql-injection only as long as you don t use dynamic-sql that is sql that writes more sql and then executes it

110562
getter	setter
is there a similar way to define a property so that i could invoke it s getter and or setter in the function code

110564
factors	primes
with this technique you can quickly test for factors near the square root of n much faster than by testing individual primes

110564
factors	primes
if you combine this technique for ruling out large primes with a sieve you will have a much better factors method than with the sieve alone

110564
factors	digits
with that i can factors a random 40 digits number like 124321342332143213122323434312213424231341 in about .05 seconds

110573

just make sure when you create the flat file connection manager selected delimited format then set ssis column length to maximum file column length so it can accomodate any data

110587
value	field
in a db2 triggers i need to compare the value of a clob field

110591
value	field
edit i also have to sort and filtering by the value of the user defined field

filtering	sorting
i know how to do it in c# sql with a key value table but i don t know how to do it with nhibrenate including filtering and sorting by the user defined fields

110605
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
i tested cakephp but it s too much a la ruby-on-rails style and i didn t like it

110612
getter	setter
using your domain objects in jsps can make your domain harder to refactor and promotes the indiscriminate use of getter and setter hence breaking encapsulation

110617
32-bit	64bit
however you can use 32-bit ssis even on 64bit server

110617
32-bit	64bit
it is already installed when you installed 64bit version and all you need to do is run the 32-bit dtexec.exe - the one installed program files x86 microsoft sql-server 90 dts binn replace 90 with 100 if you are using ssis 2008

110619
cvs	git
cvs update becomes git fetch and rebase if you have local changes or just git pull if you don t

110619
cvs	git
cvs commit becomes git commit and git push

110619
cvs	git
using git because you get to perform local commits and can manage local history the need to push to the central repository may not be felt as much by the individual developer as with something like cvs

110624
linux	osx
crossftp clients available for windows mac osx and linux

110629
joomla	drupal
basically joomla drupal phpnuke dotnetnuke umbraco are all examples of what we don t want

combine gyroscope and accelerometer data

110819
pointers	stack
writing local variables contains in registers to stack saving stack pointers so if you don t have to make a call this is time saved

110819
32-bit	16-bit
for example on a 32-bit processor it is likely to be more efficient to manipulate 32-bit values than 8 or 16-bit values

110819
16-bit	8bit
i ve had situations where i ve discovered that my compiler insisted on doing 16-bit arithmetic on 8bit values with all of the to and from conversions to go with them

110819
double	int
shorts and int double and floats then the compiler is adding implicit type conversions for each mismatch

110825
associations	model
so i have a comment model and i have a hasmany associations on my person model to the comment model

110830
order	add
sorry but order of information in a database is determined by the information itself you always have to add a column for order

110830
order	add
further to retrieve things in this order you ll need to specifically add .order_by x to your queries or add order to your model

110843
common-lisp	scheme
if you usually program in one language and switch to the other only occasionally then unfortunately you are doomed to write common-lisp in scheme or vice versa

111095
user-interface	system-tray
question to clarify why you re attempting this if the only user-interface on the process is the system-tray icon why would you want to kill that and but leave the process running

the text you eval can reference local-variables of the function and within eval you can even create new local-variables by using

111111
contains	set
a new set of local variables is kept every time a function with a closure is called given that the function contains a function declaration inside it and a reference to that inside function is either returned or an external reference is kept for it in some way

ruby-on-rails	django
it s easily integrated with other technologies django ruby-on-rails php etc. just like memcached

111148
wait	hang

111151
boost	stl
i hope boost format will soon be included in the stl

111164
execution	exit
the results of the compile as well as the test execution exit _ success exit _ failure are used to updates the project build dashboard

once i have a match i save the results into a hashtable as a cache and then use the cache results if i get that same input set later

111199
configuration	environment
perhaps an environment variables perhaps some values read from a configuration file

111199
configuration	environment
ultimately you will have to test the final everything-is-actually-hooked-up-for-real top-level function that passes the real environment variables and the real configuration file and puts everything together

111213
pointers	stack
if you have code that could fail return or throw that is most normal code then you should have your pointers wrapped inside a smart pointers assuming you have a very good reason to not have your object created on stack

111213
hide	show
but when you code at all you must use the best tool at your disposal and sometimes it is never hide an error and show it as soon as possible

111222
managed-code	unmanaged
100 managed-code - there are no interop or other unmanaged calls in the engine

111222

32-bit	64bit
the 32-bit version of windows has the runtime the 64bit version does not

111224
defined	declare
if you declare and defined std string constants at namespace scope the compiler will generate additional code that runs before main that calls the std string constructor for each constant

111224
c-strings	c++
if your application has many constant strings if you have generated c++ code that uses constant strings c-strings may be preferable in this situation

111239
interop	vsto
note that vsto is not necessary for doing non-bundled extensions - you can do this with any .net development tool if you install the primary interop assembiles for office

111239

private-key	rsa
other problems like finding a path that crosses every vertex in a graph or getting the rsa private-key from the public key is harder o e n

111329
private-key	rsa
another interresting thing is that a sollution would be harmfull for public private-key encriptions like rsa

111341
coalesce	udf
i m not sure if a udf utilizing coalesce or something similar might work

111364
value	field
this could be easily implemented on the existing code by adding a set of dirty field to the model and adding column names to it each time you __set__ a column value

111385
code-coverage	emma
emma and the eclemma plugins for eclipse to get some insight in your code-coverage

or does kerberos use ssl in any way

111390
getter	setter
should simple javabeans that have only simple getter and setter be unit tested

111390
getter	setter
what about beans with some logic in getter and setter

111404
kerberos	ssl
a short answer ssl and kerberos both use encryption but ssl uses a key that is unchanged during a session while kerberos uses several keys for encrypting the communication between a client and a client

111404
kerberos	ssl
in ssl encryption is dealt with directly by the two ends of communication while in kerberos the encryption key is provided by a third party - some kind of intermediate - between the client and the server

111442
unique	words
a possible solution would be to assign a unique prime number to each of the words

111449
virtualization	vmware
if cost is not a factors you might consider runtime virtualization software such as vmware thinapp or xenocode postbuild both of which allow .net applications to run without having to install the .net runtime

111461
getter	setter
to be clear i understand the value of getter and setter when you need to do some translation of the underlying data

111469
multithreading	wait
i believe the above code would be ok assuming you re fine with not knowing which thread set the status to true and you can wait for all the multithreading stuff to finish before reading that flag

111471
revision	svn
on checkout svn will substitute the revision number into the file

111477
getter	setter
the biggest difrence is that if ever you change your internal structure you can still maintain the getter and setter as is changing their internal logic without hurting the users of your api

111483
quicksort	heapsort
i used merge sort but not quicksort or heapsort

111501

moss	wss
for the record wf was developed in conjunction with k2 s development team and the new k2 blackpearl is built on top of wf so is moss 2007 and wss 3.0 s workflow engines

111598
put	get
i have tried doing honeypots where you put a field and then hide it with css marking it as leave blank for anyone with stylesheets disabled but i have found that a lot of bots are able to get past it very quickly

111598
value	field
there are also techniques like setting field to a certain value and changing them with javascript calculating times between load time and submit time checking the referer url and a million other things

111600
associations	model
if you don t mind investigating how a non-java api handles these problems it s worth looking at ruby-on-rails activerecord which allows ruby server pages to work directly with the domain model and traverse its associations

111622
local-variables	class-members
if i run into danger of mixing up local-variables or methods parameters with class-members then either the methods or the class is too long and benefits from splitting up

111623
contains	any
getters and setters commonly do not contains any logic and are just used in java for the lack of properties

111631
order	add
however this methods only works for properties that were already exactly identical for the different projects you can not use it in order to add an include path to a set of project that were using different include path

111646
value	field
if you need to ensure the field has a value i would recommend moving such initialization into an initialize methods that is called both from your constructor and from a methods marked with the ondeserialized attributes

111649
getter	setter
test the language or the ide automatically generated getter and setter

111654
boost	stl
for other stuff which tends to be stl boost then i add an underscore suffix to all member variables and i don t bother with hungarian notation

hide	show
if you re worried about flickering for accessibility reasons just sniff for ie6 and replace the animation with a generic show and hide instead

111678
getter-setter	setter
if it has getters setter i ll usually put a _ in front of the private member variables and the getter-setter will have the same name without the _

111681
version-control	sync
the simplest way to share sync source code is to use some sort of vcs version-control system - this gives you plenty of benefits over being able to keep things synced

111692
fireworks	photoshop
you can open the file in paint.net if you need a free editor or something more fully featured like photoshop or fireworks and extract the exact size you want

111697

113158
pure-virtual	subclassing
sounds like you should make callfoo a pure-virtual function and create some subclassing of a

basically there is a selected box with the id selectedbox which contains just one option any

113218
contains	any
the user see s a closed selected box contains any

113218
contains	set
i know that i can load the list before the box is even clicked but the real form i m developing contains many such selected boxes which are all interrelated so it will be much better for both the client and server if i can load each set of options only when needed

113226
tokenize	parsing
basically instead of storing your source as raw text it would store it in a parsing and tokenize form where things like variables were detected as being variables functions were stored as functions etc

113228
unsigned	integer

113229
unsigned	short
the largest port number is an unsigned short 2 16-1 65535

113232
perl	php
i generally work in perl rather than php but so long as you have a command-line interface to your firewall rules engine like say sbin iptables you should be able to do this fairly easily from any language which has the ability to execute system commands

113301
hosts-file	hosts
however the mapping of the name localhost to that address is generally dependent on the systemd hosts

113304

113314
host	dns
if the host dns settings are misconfigured localhost will not resolve

113316
put	get
this can become a fairly lengthy compile just to support some legacy communication channel and since there is a large tendency to put wrappers around corba to make it simpler well things just get worse

113636
python	java
paul graham posted an article several years ago about why python programmers made better java programmers

113814
python	php
that s why it s far better to check it on the server side with a php python whatever script

113823
put	get
queue size - if too many items get put in the queue and aren t removed in a timely manner the server can stall

113832
push	pull
if you want lazy evaluation not to reduce latency but to avoid calculations my approach won t help because it relies on a push model not a pull model

113832
arrays	map
while pondering this problem i also investigated tie-ing an arrays to the thread results to make the perl program flow more like map but so far i like my api of introducing the parallel keyword an object constructor in disguise and then calling methods on the result

113849
function-call	inline
also when you use a virtual function the compiler cannot inline the function-call

113856
contains	any
as for any class that contains a virtual function a vtable is used

113873
invalidoperationexception	nullreferenceexception
so i did that but then it gives invalidoperationexception with an innerexception message of nullreferenceexception

113879
getter	setter
alternatively you could do something similar but use the metadata to drive a code generator that fills in the getter and setter for the persistence layer

113879
getter-setter	initializer
encapsulate this with an api in one of the base classes of your domain classes and provide a generic getter-setter api for initializer or persisting

113879
python	c++
edit i can t think of a c++ library with the type of pluggable persistence mechanism you re describing but i did something in python that could have had this type of facility added

113879
python	c++
the particular implementation used facilities in python with no direct c++ equivalent although the basic principle could probably be adapted to work with c++

113892
ftp	scp
if you can use scp instead of ftp the -r option will do this for you

113895
scp	ssh
but using scp or rsync over ssh is probably better than ftp if you can

113898
order	join
for programmer time as it is on the order of 1000 s of times more expensive than a cpu cycle i d usually just throw it into a join if it wasn t going to be run 10 0000+ times per second

113903
contains	elements
obviously the business logic does not have to contains presentation elements

113904
gzip	zip
if you can i strongly suggest you tar and bzip or gzip whatever floats your boat the directory on the remote machineâ for a directory of any significant size the bandwidth savings will probably be worth the time to zip unzip

113906
keyboard	mouse
i know plenty of gui toolkits intended at keyboard mouse interfaces but can you advise something suited for touchscreens

113908
display	height
if you call getimage too early your component will not have been display yet and will still have a 0 width and height

113912
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
a result of 0 indicates you are in a case-sensitive collation mode 8 indicates it is case-insensitive

113914
buildpath	libs
in the properties of the two application projects add the libs project src directory to the flex buildpath

113940
versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade to a bigger versioning when you go with a paid versioning

113948
value	field
after you commit your object into the db the object receives a value in its id field

113953
strict	let
long answer only let users browse your site by visiting your office and using a machine located there - under strict supervision of course

113980
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
you will see that codeigniter specodeigniterfies case-insensitive and cs specodeigniterfies case-sensitive

113983
selected	cell
example when i selected a b2 and then selected the object shape in the b17 and i query on the cell.address it shows b2 - how do i get the cell address as b17

113992
order	add
i ve just seen this code in our application and i hate it i want to add some brackets to just clarify the order

114010
reflection	runtime
is there any way to create c# 3.0 anonymous object via reflection at runtime in .net 3.5

114024
button	popup
i have a menu on the right visual-studio style when the user wants to add an element should i expand the menu down and let them select something from it there and then have to press the ok button or display a modal popup forcing them to select

114031
constructor	object
however i do give an object with a generic method to the constructor of this object

114057
in-place	heapsort
sorting a heap in-place kind of sounds like a job for heapsort

114060
configuration	environment
another solution is maintaing all the configuration files for every environment in svn

114069
button	popup
i have a menu on the right visual-studio style when the user wants to add an element should i expand the menu down and let them select something from it there and then have to press the ok button or display a modal popup forcing them to select

114086
lighttpd	apache
it s written in perl and easy to set up with apache lighttpd the only web servers i ve tried it with

114111
apache-fop	docbook
use docbook + apache-fop and other tools to produce other kinds of documentation in pdf rtf html etc.

114128
put	get
then your various wizard instances just need to be given the underlying character object as a place to put and get values

114145
getter	setter
vlookward not writing getter setter makes no sense at all

114145
constructor	private
the only options for setting private fields is to have explicit setters to set them in your constructor or to set the indirectly via other methods functionally deferring the setter to another place

114145
getter	setter
often we write our software as it was a library and we encapsulate our fields our business logic fields with unnecessary getter setter

114145
getter	setter
then they sould be tested but they aren t real getter setter

114164
required	checked
so the fact that the bank required your ssn to open a checked account your isp asks for it for high speed internet access airlines demand it before allowing you on a plane your local grocery pub keeps a tab stored by your ssn - that is all illegal

114165
installation	building
at work we use wix for building installation packages

114165
installation	uninstall
we want that installation of product x would result in uninstall of the previous version of that product on that machine

114176
ubuntu	linux
although i m currently not a gentoo user on ubuntu now i used to be one for years and had learned that it s a good thing to search for linux answers on forums.gentoo.org

114181
value	field
i think that basically double click or scrolling the mousewheel changes values from the value collection while selected from the drop down is like editing the field value as a string

114185
multiplication	addition
a good mnemonic rule is to remember that and is like multiplication and or is like addition

114193
value	field
since the getter is called before the new value is put in the field the old value is returned

114209
pascal	delphi
something like the following written in delphi virtual pascal so it will result in a win32 executable but any compiled language should do

114212
implements	abstract
quite well its easy to implements a new renderinging mechanism all you do is subclass the abstract engine and rendering the output which passes required references to you

114224
deployment	install
if you are looking for small footprint up to a few mb and easy deployment end-user should only install your application to get it working then your options are sqlite and firebird embedded

114231
environment	restart
just changing the value there and then restart a process will not updates the environment

114231
logout	login
logout login then start apache

114257
sql-server	firebird
firebird sql-server will be thing of choice

114257
solaris	linux
it is available for windows linux solaris os x hp-ux

114260
vbscript	basic
the classic asp page communicates with the ihttphandler through basic http requests using serverxmlhttp in vbscript or ajax calls in javascript

114268
virtualenv	fabric
mod_wsgi in combination with a virtualenv for all the dependencies a mercurial checkout into the virtualenv and a fabric recipe to check out the changes on the server

114278
constructor	private
if it were me i d probably find a way to conceptualize the data as a model and then just make it a singleton with a factory method and a private constructor

114285
python	java
there s much less need for class methods in python than static methods in languages like java or c#

114291
document	element
firebug is a very good firefox extension that allows you to examine which css declarations are active for which dom element in your document tree

114320
scheme	lisp
i don t know the intricacies of scheme but i do know the basic of lisp based on tinkering with emacs

114326
sql-server	ms-access
background we have an old but business-critical sql-server database with an ms-access adp front-end

114326
put	get
these images are inserted from ms-access and get put into the database as ole objects

114327
children	nodes
this has the advantage of not having to worry about when a nodes has consumed all its children

114333
click	mouse
for instance send a message to the server if the user presses the tab key or click with a mouse on a field

114372
png	gif
loadpicturegdip loads pic in stdpicture object bmp gif jp e g tif png wmf emf and ico

114372
png	gif
savepicgdiplus saves picture objekt in file as bmp gif png or jpg jpg with given quality

114413
synchronous	.when
in a perverse sense you have absolute control over .when a synchronous signals is delivered - it happens as you execute your defective code and at no other time

114448
value	field
my vote would be for the field value

114474
subtract	add
when you change lines add the current line count to the buffer count count the words in the current line and a set the current line count and b subtract it from the buffer count

114477
sql-server	oracle
oracle s connect by is somewhat more flexible as it doesn t impose nearly as many limitations on the query structure as cte s do but if you re using sql-server this won t be an option

114506
button	popup
monitor the timeout and post a popup to notify the user that their current session will expire and present ok or cancel button

114528
derived-class	inherited
the shortest solution i think will be to inherited the tag class and change the tld to your new derived-class

114538
python	php
is there thus a free program for me to use it it ll have to work on a mac but feel free to suggest pc apps for others with the same q or script preferably in php or python that allows you to design database structure and will then output either a basic diagram or the code as chosen by the user

114544
postgresql	mysql
these databases are very different - mysql is speed and simplicity postgresql is robustness and concurrency

114549
contains	any
any width less than the contains will work

114554
configuration-files	app-config
and my next favorite shorter article about sections in .net configuration-files is understanding section handler - app-config file

114555
configuration	installation
what i m looking for are some starting points to get me up and running such as installation configuration guides for red hat

114567
binary-compatibility	compatibility
in terms of the binary-compatibility of the java class files the java se 6 compatibility page has the following to say

114578
web-config	app-config
in windows forms you have an app-config which is very similar to web-config

114587
solaris	unix
most of the proprietary unix variants such as solaris have numa support as well

114594
serialization	unmarshalling
first if you are using web-services it means you are serializing to xml and not your regular java serialization but some other library for marshaling and unmarshalling

114594
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
second if you have control over your inputstream outputstream try extending objectoutputstream and objectinputstream and override replaceobject and resolveobject and then you can implement serialization for java.sql.date

114607
web-config	app-config
you should create an app-config file very similar to web-config

114627
constructor	object
during deserialization constructor is not called but attributes of object set directly to values from serialized data and you can use the object as it is since it deserialized

114633
selected	button
currently it s a text field but i want it to be a grouping of radio button and it should work in both insert and edit mode the correct current value should be selected in edit mode

114648
put	get
i settled on httplib2 because it allowed me to send put and delete in addition to get and post

114653
margins	padding
background images only appear within padding not margins

114659
erlang	ada
99 bottles of beers made me realize that ada erlang and smalltalk were not so odd languages after all

114662
binaries	install
setting up subversion in general is very easy you just have to install the binaries and run svnserve or adapt the apache configuration

114666
raw-sockets	packets
also note that access to raw-sockets is normally only available to root processes since otherwise any user could both a sniff all traffic and b generate spoofed packets

114666
packet-capture	tcp
rather than write your whole program so that it needs to run as root you might consider having the packet-capture and generation done in a standalone program with some sort of ipc rmi named pipe tcp socket etc to exchange the data with your java app

114713
32-bit	64bit
the latter could be iis 6.0 configured for iis 5.0 compatibility mode or the application-pool configured for 32-bit worker processes on a 64bit system

114737
databound	gridview
you could handle the gridview s databound event and hide the dummy row

114741
revision	svn
right click document tortoise svn show log selected revision right click for compare with working copy

114759
highlight	cells
if the sheets are similar this spreadsheet will be empty except for a few cells with x in them highlight the difference

114761
oracle	mysql
if you have a nice database mysql sql server oracle or db2 there are nice tools to do this replication for you

114811
order	join
the query still has a lot of loop joins but the join order is different and it runs in 2-3 seconds

114830
data-structures	dictionary
one of the basic data-structures in python is the dictionary which allows one to record keys for looking up values of any type

114843
nested	assign
if for example you have a complex nested hash you want to save assign the following to your data text field

114864
linked-list	queue
like learning how to build a linked-list stack or queue in c++ before learning how to use the stl standard template libraries

114889
macports	fink
there s fink and macports if you want an easy install updater

114915
expression	evaluation
however you can use expression templates as described here to minimise them and do fancy lazy evaluation of the templates

114939
lookup	any
the service then has access to the credentials and can do any role lookup authentication check it needs to and return the appropriate response

114941
perl	tcl
extensions for tcl perl and python are available

114968
web-services	security
for our business we implemented a security web service that other web-services connect to in order to validate the consumer that is calling them

114969
linux	unix
to recode the video on the server i prefer to use ffmpeg or mencoder both have windows and linux unix versions

114980
google-chrome	firefox
there s a reason that google have made such a big fuss about the v8 javascript engine for google-chrome why mozilla are working on tracemonkey for firefox and why webkit have been working on squirrelfish for a while now squirrelfish extreme

115005
linked-list	nodes
i d had it in the matrix class because you can rely on the private methods and properties that could be usefull for your function in case the implementation of the matrix change linked-list of non empty nodes instead of a big double arrays for example

115010
player	movie
it is possible to embed the player in another flash movie but most often you will control the playlist from html links

115040
triggers	insert
if you want to constrain the values getting into the table you can add on insert and on update triggers that check the values

115041
getter	setter
in this article jeroen explains an example of using an xml file to remap java bean getter and setter to .net properties

115045
wxwidgets	mfc
mfc wxwidgets qt were started a long time ago and they don t use modern c++ features and standard-library

115058
stdin	pipe
instead you want to have the mailbox be a pipe to the application and have the application simply read in the message from stdin parsing out the body and mime parsing the body to get the attachments

115071
hide	show
bc will show the comparison in a nice table layout and you can hide rows and columns you re not interested in

115083
javascript	dom
w3 s reference of dom for html in most web applications today the javascript code manipulates the dom which is an internal keeping track of the objects displayed on screen but you already knew that right

115083
scheme	lisp
because javascript has closures and first-class-functions he believes it is closer to lisp and scheme than to other languages

115094
order	add
you should then add another spike to your next iteration to complete the necessary work you need to complete in order to accurately estimate the task resulting from the spike

115107
java.util.date	date-format
- an thus java.util.date too as it extends java.util.date serialization it to a string in some common date-format so the type information is lost and deserialization it back to a calendar object on the receiving end

115108
vba	vb6
is vba going to go away any time soon like vb6 has

115123
revision	updates
if you issue a label command together with a pre-existing label name and an itemspec that includes files that are already marked by the same label the value of the child option determines whether the marked files are updates with new revision information

115132
macros	vba
i actually don t think that deprecating vba would be feasible since a fair amount of office programming takes place at the macros level by business users and i don t think that s going to go away any time soon

115135
string.format	stringbuilder
stringbuilder and string.format although potentially slower are more memory efficient

115148
freebsd	linux
cross-platform linux gcc freebsd gcc netbsd gcc solaris gcc forte win32 gcc msvc++.net 2003 macos x gcc others

115160
tcp-ip	udp
we have been successful in developing a external serial protocol either rs232 or udp or tcp-ip messages with basic commands for exercising the hw with debugging logging in the low level drivers looking for erroneous conditions or even slightly abnormal conditions espcially for limit checking

115162
environment	execution
wrote a boot code generator that took these compiled tests and orchestrated them into an execution environment

115169
solaris	bsd
linux and bsd use similar apis but solaris requires dlpi and windows uses something else

115184
websphere	ibm
if i m deploying to servers with websphere 6.1 java 1.5 should i use ibm s jdk on my build box

115185
32-bit	64bit
the latest mac version of ms office don t support vba and 64bit windows runs it in a virtual 32-bit out-of-process mode

115194
carbon	cocoa
if you are planning to do cocoa or carbon developing i strongly suggest installing the entire package because you will need all the documentation and headers

115210
perl	ruby
i d be happy with either a tool i can drop in and use ideally cross-platform or a ruby perl script i can make part of my data loading process

115211
json	xml
ruby-on-rails handles the 99 case it s fairly unlikely you d ever need to do any xml or json translations in your edit action because non-visually the edit action is pretty much just like the show action

115243
websphere	ibm
i can t tell you where to get ibm s jdk but if you ve got a license to websphere at your company you should have a contact at ibm to get you a link to that jdk

115247
.net	wcf
however even though there s no direct correspondence between ice and wcf if you need your .net app to communicate remotely then they re both contenders

115247
.net	wcf
alternatively .net remoting can provide very good performance and whatever the ms-sponsored benchmarks say i ve seen it outperform wcf by 10

115249
logout	login
i am trying to have a logout page where is displays a messages and then redirects to the login page

115280
webserver	security
if your webserver is publicly accessible this is a very bad idea from a security perspective

115290
any	set
this is configurable and p4 can be set up to ignore changelist items without any actual diffs

115319
handler	service
i also added an unhandled exception handler in the web service and a breakpoint there wasn t hit

115320
lookup	any
this way the engine only has to read the index entry and doesn t have to also do the corresponding row lookup to get any requested columns not include in the index

115320
sql-server	oracle
i ve used this technique with great success in oracle and ms sql-server

115323
required	checked
java arrayss support covariant subtyping and this required java to do a runtime type checked every time you store a value in an arrays

115416
background-color	transparency
you can set the background-color and transparency key properties to the same color and that will make the background transparent

115459
png	gif
i m looking for an online tool that will let me create a gif or png like this one

115460
logout	login
the most common pattern for what you are trying to do is to have one instance of a privileged service which registers to login logout events and creates children processes accordingly each one of them impersonating the logged in user

115472
any	set
if i set a breakpoint in any of the .js files i get a warning that says

115530
perforce	cvs
my company just imported our cvs repository into perforce

115555
cobertura	emma
use a code coverage tool - for example in java i use emma or cobertura

115573
object-reference	instances
i m sure we all have received the wonderfully vague object-reference not set to instances of an object exception-handling at some time or another

115601
perl	tcl
it is the defacto gui toolkit for python and tcl and is also available for use with perl

115620
google-chrome	firefox
until people have more experience with google-chrome i would think firefox is a better choice

115631
revision	svn
unlike sourcesafe tfs and svn both work fine against servers on the inter.net tfs just ok svn excellently and svn works well offline - if you have a laptop on a plane or train and no .net you can still work and compare to previous revision or even revert since the data to do that is held locally

115638
swing	awt
qt gtk wxwindows java awt java swing xul -- they all suffer from the same problem the resulting gui doesn t look native on every platform

115644
textmate	vim
i have found some in the cappuccino website vim textmate and subethaedit but not for jedit and unfortunately i m just starting on objective-j so can t make my own

115679
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade the project type it simply updates the .csproj .vbproj files to work with the new versioning

115696
numeric	nan
nan n ot a n umber is a value of the numeric data type representing an undefined or unrepresentable value especially in floating-point calculations

115696
numerical	nan
in addition to these apparent edge cases are the standard numerical reasons for returning nan like 0 0

115744
python	java
since java web services are a nightmare xml code generation etc. compared with what is possible in python i would like to learn from your experience using jython instead of java for offerring consuming web services

115766
selected	cell
most notably i can t selected a single cell within a row and all rows have the same height

115766
swing	swt
swt the various solutions for including swing in swt aren t very nice

115770
carbon	cocoa
i haven t had this problem in galileo for os x neither in cocoa nor carbon but i have not used that for as long

115815
perl	c++
this is like python perl javascript but different from c++ java c# etc

115818
png	gif
it may just be the tools i m using but gif files usually seem to be a bit smaller than a comparible png but using them just seems so 1987

115819
gnome	kde
i know that my gnome environment seems to underperform compared to my coworkers kde setups

115825
gnome	kde
they are faster than fully fledged windows managers like kde or gnome and trim down on most visual distractions

115834
png	gif
the main reason to use png over gif from a legal standpoint is covered here

115834
png	gif
the patents have apparently expired as of 2004 but the idea that you can use png as open-source over gif is appealing to many people

115838
png	gif
as a general rule png is never worse and often better than gif because of superior compression

115838
png	gif
there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry

115838
png	gif
it may just be the tools i m using but gif files usually seem to be a bit smaller than a comparible png

115853
json	xml
encoding as strings xml json yaml is subject to a great deal of more-or-less random change

115855
png	gif
the w3c mention 3 advantages of png over gif

115855
png	gif
png v s gif w3c guidance

115860
gnome	kde
i used fluxbox for a long time which is great for people used to having windows floating around like in kde gnome etc

115870
png	gif
for icons and the like you have a choice between png and gif

115873
any	set
any tips on getting dtc set up properly to talk to datadirect s formerly neon systems shadow odbc driver

115878
temporary	copy
on the downside it s slower since you re making an extra temporary copy and the compiler will assign each member to 0 individually instead of one memset

115887
htmlspecialchars	echo
if typing echo htmlspecialchars ... all the time is too wordy you can always make a function with a short name like h that does the same.

115906
order	join
by hand-tweaking the sql namely by placing where -type arguments in join s in order to minimize the data intensity of the join i was able to drastically improve performance

115926
radio-button	selected
to fix the display issue instead of setting the datafield on the column you can bind the radio-button s selected property to the itemrenderer s data.left or right value

115944
getter	setter
therefore if there is no business logic for example when a getter simply returns a value or a setter sets it then there is no point in writing a test

115944
contains	any
as a general rule i believe one should not write tests for beans that do not contains any business logic

115948
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
a bit vague short of time but look into manualresetevent and autoresetevent

115968
methods	extend
you can extend the methods further to grouping by month

115994
tunnel	vpn
is it doable to set up a non-domain-based standalone windows-server 2008 as an sstp vpn secure socket layer tunnel protocols vpn

116003
least-squares	regression
whereas least-squares techniques try to minimize vertical distance between the fit line and each f x orthogonal regression minimizes the perpendicular distances

116004
buildpath	libs
if you right click on your project and choose build buildpath and then choose the libs tab

116010
deployment	install
1 on projects where svn is install on the server i also use it for deployment

116010
deployment	install
2 on projects where svn is not install my deployment script is more complex it creates the version.php file locally zips the code uploads and extracts it

116032
sql-server	oracle
a field called percent may work for a oracle but on a ms sql-server it must be treated as a reserved word

116037
value	field
i put a summary of the errors at the top of the form that gives details as to why a field value is incorrect such as field1 is required and must be an integer

116038
ostringstream	std
a fully correct standard-compliant and portable solutions could be constructed using std ifstream s rdbuf into a std ostringstream and from there into a std string

116045
decrement	increment
a vector of shared pointerss will do a lot of extraneous copying that involves creating a new smart pointers increment a reference decrement a reference etc on a resize

116053
hide	show
i d like to show hide a column at runtime based on a particular conditional

116053
hide	show
i m using print when expression to conditional show hide this column and it s header in my report

116063
mathml	latex
it uses texvc which validates ams latex mathematical expressions and converts them to html mathml or png graphics. sounds like what you are looking for

116063
mathml	latex
they also have an extensive reference on latex and pros cons of the different rendering types png mathml html

116063
mathml	tex
tex can be converted to mathml for browsers which support it thus

116068
innodb	myisam
some are innodb specific while others are for myisam

116068
innodb	myisam
you didnt mention which engine you were using which might be relevant in this case count is much faster in myisam than in innodb for example

116073
markup	mathml
here s an online converter that will emit mathml from tex markup which you can then embed in your webpage

116073
firefox	opera
i know gecko-based browsers like firefox and camino play nice with mathml as does opera

116074
directory	folder
how can i ignore the whole directory folder with svn

116084
virtual-machine	vmware
haven t seen this myself but depending on which version of vmware you re running and your type of processor the virtual-machine clock may run significantly faster or slower than real-time which can of course impact the interval garbage collection runs at

116093
gnome	kde
enlightenment v16 is actually very lightweight compared to gnome kde these days and it is very configurable although nothing seems to be as configurable as fvwm florian s suggestions are all good but if you re used to gnome kde then you probably won t like ratpoison xmonad

116096
user-controls	ascx
the custom control gets added to the toolbar while the user-controls ascx can not

116121
version-control	cvs
should i keep project filesm like eclipse s .project .classpath .settings under version-control subversion github cvs mercurial etc

116135
user-controls	ascx
the difference between a web control and a user-controls is that a user-controls has the ascx file with the html definition while the web control does not

116142
any	set
i would like to know if there is any way to add custom behaviour to the auto property get set methods

116142
any	set
an obvious case i can think of is wanting every set property methods to call on any propertychanged event handler as part of a system.componentmodel.inotifypropertychanged implementation

116148
user-controls	ascx
a user-controls has to be hosted by a web site and is associated with an ascx file using the codebehind model

116148
user-controls	ascx
therefore with a user-controls you can define the basic markup for the control in the ascx file and put all the code into the ascx.cs file

116154
getter	setter
i don t like ddx because it s old and it s not flexible and i cannot use getter and setter

116163
pascal	delphi
delphi v7 - object pascal standard tquery object name query1

116170
put	get
if you want to put custom logic you must write get and set explicitly

116177
istream	std
there were some reports that this methods is slower than preallocating the string and using std istream read

116203
export	report
report services allows you to query the data define the layout and export to pdf without any intervention

116210
png	gif
indexed png less than 256 colors is actually always smaller than gif so i use that most of the time

116226
switching	router
berkowitz s designing addressing architectures for router and switching

116231
versioning	packaging
depend on specific package versioning for all dependencies affects control file while packaging for deb example libcommons-io-java 1.3.1 instead of just libcommons-io-java

116233
debugging	trace
more importantly the comment by 1800 information who pointed out that you simply throw and not throw ex in order to capture the entire stack trace which is how you ultimately debugging these issues

116235
hl7	x12
interface languages like x12 and hl7 existed for sure but with xml people could tailor it to their individual aix or as 400 systemd

116240
any	set
for any values that are specific to the user the default value is set like this

116254
debugging	trace
my advice as you write these t-sql instructions keep also trace of their counterparts so that you can at any time debugging time for example downgrade your database structure to previous version

116261
put	get
preferably it should be able to run on windows without to much hassle ever tried to put up apache+python+svn+trac on the same windows 2003 server and get them all to run together

116279
configuration-management	mks
okay outright disclaimer i m a developer for a company called mks which makes a version-control system for enterprise companies as part of a software configuration-management platform called integrity

116290
postgresql	mysql
written in php works with mysql or postgresql

116294
revision	updates
in coordination with new revision of binaries databases are updates usually by adding stored-procedures views and adding adjusting table schema

116301
cvs	git
it supports ftp sftp synchronization integrates well with subversion cvs mercurial and even with git with plugin

116326
opensolaris	solaris
i think it is hard to quantify software compatibility but i d say code written for solaris is quite forward compatible with opensolaris kernel

116326
opensolaris	solaris
opensolaris source code evolves into what will be solaris 11 and sun s commitment to backwards compatibility is quite a fact

116337
sftp	ftp
it does syntax highlighting ftp sftp support super fast macros etc

116340
derived-class	base-class
if you have a base-class base and a derived-class derived then have test classes basetests and derived from that derivedtests

116342
manualresetevent	autoresetevent
if you want one thread to wait till another thread reach a point in execution you might want to use waitevents autoresetevent or manualresetevent

116347
csv	xml
you really can t compare xml to csv because csv is an extremely limited way of representing data

116374
export	report
there is a client control that displays report and can export to formats such as pdf and excel

116391
attributes	properties
attributes properties

116396
internet-explorer	firefox
i don t think you can undervalue the integration between their debugger and their firefox and internet-explorer toolbars

116406
version-control	git
use git or another decentralized version-control system

116433
triggers	insert
then for the relevant tables you can make an insert triggers

116448
put	get
you need to put any proprietary code in your back-end where client machines can t get at it

116450
constructor	object
an example of this is an object interface i worked with that instead of exporting constructors and properties for particular objects required me to author xml programmatically and pass in the resulting xml to the single constructor

116461
png	gif
png is a 100 replacement for gif files and is supported by all web browsers you are likely to encounter

116461
png	gif
virtually all browsers support single-bit transparency in png files the type of transparency offered by the gif format

116461
png	gif
if your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors

116461
png	gif
gif files are indexed to a maximum palette of 256 colors while png files in most graphics programs are saved by default in a 24-bit lossless format

116461
png	gif
if file size is more important than accurate colors save the file as an 8-bit indexed png and it should be equivalent to gif or better

116461
png	gif
it is possible to hack a gif file to have more than 256 colors using a combination of animation frames with do-not-replace flags and multiple palettes but this approach has been virtually forgotten about since the advent of png

116469
punctuation	words
for each words in the file we are to clear any punctuation in the words ex can t would end up as can and that--to would end up as that obviously with out the quotes quotes were used just to specify what the example was

116481
linux	bsd
however the only platform where it looks nice is linux bsd running gnome

116484
oracle	mysql
i haven t done them in mysql but i ve done them on other databases oracle sql server etc

116490
opensolaris	solaris
kernel modules in particular will be very compatible between solaris and opensolaris

116511
triggers	insert
to do that you need to create two datetime columns in your table createdon updatedon and then in an insert triggers set the createdon getdate and in the update triggers set the updatedon getdate

116517
sql-server	oracle
it will show you the differences between two databases sql-server oracle i believe and generate all the change scripts necessary to migrate a- b

116517
delta	diff
sql delta shows the rows in the database just like they would look in a diff tool - changed added deleted

116518
triggers	insert
create another column and give it a default of getdate that will take care of insert date for updated date you will need to write an update triggers

116525
required	checked
i have writtent some oracle stored-procedures in these there are more then 20 input parameters and from them morethen 10 parameters are required i want all with some value and do not want to accept null value for that is there anything that i can declare in the procedure defination itself which can restrict null input parameter or will i have to checked for each value and raise the exception-handling if the required value is null

116558
32-bit	16-bit
if the two 32-bit values are not the same then you will have to test them separately and out the top and bottom 16-bit values

116569
opensolaris	solaris
kernel modules written for solaris should function in opensolaris following a simple recompile providing you are using the exposed kernel apis that are compatible between the releases that you are using in solaris and opensolaris

116571
xsd	xml
i need to take any given valid xml schema xsd and denormalize it to a simple form containing no refs no includes etc

116571
lookup	any
all simple type definitions should be inline such that when looking at any given element all declarations are visible without performing another lookup

116578
autotools	scons
scons has a configuring mechanism that will do a lot of what autotools do without as much complexity and is pretty darn portable although not as portable as autotools

116582
arrays	loops
the below code demonstrates with using 4-byte integers but if you are running on a simd architecture any modern intel or amd chip you could compare both arrays in one instruction before falling back to an integer-based loops

116600
32-bit	64bit
instead if you stored your 16 bytes in 4 integers 32-bit or 2 longs 64bit you would only need to perform 4 or 2 comparisons respectively

116611
python	perl
you could then write a chunk of perl python groovy that would slurp up your procedure declaration and crank out these calls to your null check procedure

116626
python	ruby
i m trying to polish up my ruby by re writing kent beck s xunit python example from test driven development by example

116627
ruby	php
my personal preference is eclipse with various plug-ins as i am developing in several languages php java and ruby and this way i am always used to interface and keyboard shortcuts

116627
notepad++	jedit
for others ides i have used jedit for little java notepad++ still for some scripting and short test code runs

116627
zend-debugger	xdebug
zend-debugger xdebug for debugging

116630
any	set
is there a setting i can use set to get the subreport to either not show or not take up any space if there is no logo to be displayed

116632
firefox	safari
i used to use opera and firefox as my standards compliant browsers but i ve recently become much enamored with safari

116632
google-chrome	safari
edited to add google-chrome is coming close to taking safari s place but that print screen thing is still the deciding factor

116636
value	field
this then becomes a bit field where you can count all the 1 s to determine how many true value you had

116636
arrays	loops
if you run this code on a machine that does not support either sse2 or popcnt you must then iterate through the arrays and count the differences with your unrolled loops approach

116639
sql-server	mysql
also how fast do online backups work with blobs work in sql-server and mysql

116664
autotools	scons
the autotools uses a multi-stage process that s relatively easy to break and scons just feels weird to me

116697
any	set
is there any way to force active-directory to authentication against our user store or can we set up a kerberos authentication server that isn t active-directory

116701
command-line	cmd
what s the best way for a running c or c++ program that s been launched from the cmd-line to put itself into the background equivalent to if the user had launched from the unix shell with at the end of the cmd

116705
salt	md5
md5 or sha in combinations with a randomly generated salt value for every entry

116707
hash	md5
use a strong crytographic hash function like md5 or sha1 but make sure you use a good salt otherwise you ll be susceptible to rainbow table attacks

116715
postgresql	mysql
that said i use temporary tables in postgresql for a number of purposes and most will translate to mysql

116730
safari	opera
don t get me wrong here - i m not trying to dismiss the users of opera safari or any other browser

116738
build-system	bjam
they build on quite a few platforms without autoconf although they do have their own build-system - bjam - that probably handles some of the same situations

116739
pbkdf2	hash
sha all variants is now trivially breakable and best practice is now as of jan 2013 to use a key-stretching hash like pbkdf2 or ideally a ram intensive one like bcrypt and to add a per-user salt too

116739
hash	md5
sha-256 uses 64 characters in the database but with an index on the column that isn t a problem and it is a proven hash and more reliable than md5 and sha-1

116741
defined	declare
you declare and defined at the same time

116753
salt	md5
when a unique salt is used the benefit of using a more secure algorithm than sha1 or md5 is not really necessary at that point it s an incremental improvement whereas using a salt is a monumental improvement

116759
instances	private
module methods that are declared as module_function will create copies of themselves as private instances methods in the class that include the module

116767
hash	md5
the ready availability of cloud computing and powerful parallel-processor graphics cards means that passwords up to 8 or 9 characters hash as md5 or sha1 are now trivially breakable

116767
communication	messages
however all sha variant hash are designed for communication encryption - messages back and forth where every message is encrypted and for this reason they are designed to be fast

116767
pbkdf2	hash
a key-stretching algorithm like pbkdf2 applies a quicker hash like sha512 thousands of times typically causing the hash generation to take 1 5 of a second or so

116773
show	next
the most user friendly way i ve seen to do validation is to have an indicator that show up next to the input-field to indicate the value is invalid

116796
value	field
for the new field value

116819
any	set
the goal would be to take this expression and be able to construct for any set of keywords

116850
execution	exit
the shell is blocked because it is execution one of the variants of a wait call waiting for the child process to exit

116860
pbkdf2	hash
pbkdf2 for example uses salt large number of iterations and a good hash function

116864
contains	any
taken from regexbuddy s library will match any line that does not contains boon.ini and or http

116873
dialog	pop-up
by noninasive i mean don t pop-up an alert or modal dialog box thereby forcing the user to click something

116876
installation	building
i m trying to building a windows installer using nullsoft install system that requires installation by an administrator

116891
linux	unix
here is some pseudocode for linux unix

116905
python	php
i would like to use my laptop as a web development php python etc. machine but i m hesitant to do this unless i can ensure that it can not be accessed by the outside world

116918
scala	java
my advice is that if you really want to have access to modern language features like closures but wish to stay within the java ecosysteym you should take a look at scala

116933
ports	dmz
you can forwarding ports to your main machine or just put the main machine in the dmz if you need it to be available to incoming connections

116940
attributes	properties
also spring.net seems to have a stringarrayconverter - section 6.4 which if you can feed it to asp.net by decorating the properties with a typeconverter attributes might work

116948
strong-typing	types
in certain cases one may need create a methods that can operate on data-structures containing any types as opposed to those that contain a specific types a methods to print all the objects in a data structure while still taking advantage of the benefits of strong-typing in generics

117000
reflection	runtime
this is useful when you want to use for some t through reflection and won t know t until runtime

117009
groovy	java
you code it with groovy a dynamic language based upon java and runs smoothly together with java code classes and libraries

117010
automake	scons
automake or scons are quite complex and are worth your time only if you intend to release your code to a wide audience

117034
rhino-mocks	typemock
check out typemock or rhino-mocks

117038
reference-type	generics
if you compare a generics list to a list of objects then there is significant benefits to the generics list - no boxing unboxing for value types and no type checks for reference-type

117091
groovy	java
groovy is the best java alternative i ve seen that includes features of dynamic languages including closures run-time class extension etc

117091
groovy	java
while ruby has a slight design advantage imho i d have to say the fact that groovy compiles into java byte-code and interacts with java without any interface code is a huge plus that can t be ignored

117095
python	java
in my previous work we had real genius guy on deployment duties he deployed application python sql perl and java code as set of deb files built for ubuntu

117095
configuration	environment
we are deploying apps manually to virtualenv-ed environment with separate nginx configuration for fastcgi

117097
haskell	ocaml
you can look at haskell ml ocaml etc

117112
lgpl	gpl
take care not to use any gpl library code however lgpl is ok

117121
border-layout	gridbaglayout
i also like to combine border-layout with gridbaglayout panels for great customizability

117140
backwards-compatibility	deprecated
i plan to only deprecated but never remove v1 members which should nicely support backwards-compatibility in the future

117148
toolchain	gnu
in fact you could even for example use the gnu toolchain the linux kernel and then have your own system on top of that or just a de that is closed source

117154
export	report
otherwise i would recommend a third-party report generator that fits your report needs and create an app that uses it to create export the reports

117163
lgpl	gpl
on a normals linux systemd between the gpl kernel and a non-gpl compatible application there is always the gnu libc which is lgpl and thus allows derived works that are non-free

117169
duplicates	lookup
compute a hash of the to-be-logged text and store that in the database for subsequent lookup as another poster suggested store all of the rows and filtering out duplicates in the query or with a nightly batch whatever don t check for duplicates

117186
selected	button
click the selected all button and click next then finish and send the script to your choice of a query windows or file don t use the clipboard since it might be a big script

117211
button	popup
when i click the button it popup a message box with the value of the combo box

117211
value	field
let s say the combo box text field currently has the value thing1

117211
button	popup
if i type new into the box and then click on the button with my mouse it will popup the message thing1

117211
button	popup
if i type new in the box and then tab focus away from the combo box and then click the button the popup message says new

117217
xsd	xml
id say validating xml with a xsd schema is a good idea

117226
ruby	php
something like ruby s god for php

117253
arrays	loops
caching the property lookup might help some but c aching the length of the arrays before starting loops has proven to be faster

117265
sql-server	oracle
i am an oracle person not a sql-server person but it seems to me you should be either -

117267
revision	svn
keep using ftp for that and just use svn for revision history

117274
gnome	kde
customizing the root menu is also easy much easier than doing so in kde or gnome which i never did figure out adequately

117278
configuration	environment
using chiron you can then integrate the xap file creation into your automated build using a different configuration file for each of your environment

117279
groovy	java
grails is written for groovy not java

117282
gitosis	repo
if you want to manage rights to an internet facing git repo i suggest you look at gitosis rather than whipping up your own

117299
pyflakes	pylint
i resigned from using pylint pychecker in favor of using pyflakes with django code - it just tries to import module and reports any problem it finds like unused imports or uninitialized local names

117321
reference-type	generics
they also claim generics provide better performance than casting between reference-type which seems to be untrue no one can quite prove it

117321
reference-type	generics
i haven t been able to reproduce such performance benefits with generics compared to casting between reference-type - so i d say the performance gain is supposed more than significant

117332
boolean	int
c++ is pass-by-value by default so the function gets copies of those int and boolean

117340
heuristics	a-star
be mindful that with the a-star algorithm at least you will need to figure out a admissible heuristics to determine whether a possible next step is closer to the finished route than another step

117343
.when	ready
.when everything is tested and ready to go i commit the changes then i ssh into the remote-server and svn updates

117343
contains	any
i also keep a folder in this repository which contains sql files of any changes i ve made to the database structure labelled according to their revision number

117349
exception-handling	try-catch
either you expect exception-handling in certain situations in which case you write a try-catch block around that code and handle them or there is an unexpected error in which case you should prefer your application to abort or retry or fail

117367
enumerator	any
to expand on how why this works any determines if any of the components of an ienumerator match a given function if none is given then any component will succeed meaning the function will return true if an element exists in the enumerator

117370
instrumentation	trace
the logging application block has a instrumentation event that can be used to trace events you can find more info on the ms enterprise library docs

117378
git-repo	repo
i have a git-repo and an svn repo that both hold the same source code but different commit histories

117440
configuration	environment
i use a custom xml configurationuration file where a different configuration file is used for each environment dev qa prod

117440
configuration	environment
the configuration files are templatess that are dynamically instantiated with things like host port configurationurations for services - this makes multi environment and failover very easy as it can be handled by the templates instantiation code

117440
configuration	environment
of course if you have very little configuration and are not concerned with multiple environment then app.configuration is more standard and is probably the best way to go

117444
configuration	environment
i try to put the absolute minimum configurationuration in configuration files with most of it being configurationured in code with an application that is self-aware of its deployment environment such as by machine name or ip address if known

117451
directory	folder
i believe that to do it the way you are hoping to you d have to have each version of the file in a separate directory in the repository and check it out into your source folder

117471
triggers	insert
iâ ve considered using a triggers on the insert to clean up in a post processed table but i canâ t think of an easy solution to do this set based

117475
constructor	object
the object has a parameterless constructor

117475
getter	setter
the properties to read write have public getter and setter

117477
restructuredtext	textile
a while ago i came across a python library that formats regular text to html similar to markdown restructuredtext and textile just that it had no syntax at all

117481
versioning	upgrade
so i d like to upgrade to a more recent versioning but the new one must not break any existing scripting

117481
updating	updates
what s the most reliable and easiest way to updates my current versioning ensuring that everything i ve done with the nmake dance with will still be there after updating

117482
32-bit	16-bit
considering that an â œintâ is different in some languages depending on 16-bit 32-bit system a string could in the future evolve to not be the same as system.string

117489
search-engine	web-crawler
dataparksearch is a web-crawler and search-engine released under the gnu general public license

117503
callback	methods
problems are relayed from the jms provider to the app either via an exception-handling on a jms methods call or through the onexception-handling callback

117533
export	report
i strongly recommend working with a report tool that provides native support for export to pdf it is much easier for management purposes if you can start with a single format and report to handle both the printing and archiving of information

117547
droppable	draggable
called whenever a draggable is released over the droppable and the droppable is accepts it

117547
droppable	draggable
the callback gets three parameters the draggable element the droppable element and the event

117547
droppable	draggable
my question is does anyone have a good example on how to reference the draggable element and the droppable element in this callback javascript function

117556
directory	folder
that will make a copy of your repository on another directory without the .svn folder

117560
enumerator	iteration
ienumerable only supports iteration and doesn t guarantee that the enumerator is repeatable

117560
contains	elements
you can t find out if an enumeration contains elements without calling movenext at least once and once you ve done so you can t guarantee to be able to reuse the enumeration it is allowable for ienumerable.reset to throw a notsupportedexception

117564
processor	cpu
it will tell you the number of cpu cycles executed since the processor was booted

117575
triggers	insert
have a before insert triggers that selected the row with the max timestamp value

117575
triggers	insert
now if you need both sets of states stored the triggers can always insert on the all-inclusive table but do the lookup and insert on the filtering table only when the value changes

117577
contains	any
if you moved to 5.10 then you would have to recompile any modules that contains xs components

117593
git-repo	repo
you could just recreate your svn repo from scratch based on your git-repo

117620
python	php
they will all be web applications written in php or python

117625
.net	wcf
wcf windows communication foundation is the way to go - much more scalable easily swappable to other technologies if you need in the future and builtin to .net 3.0

117637
sql-server	oracle
access provides the ability to link to external data in other mdbs in excel files even in sql-server or oracle and then you can perform your joins against the links

117658
ms-project	visio
i would look into mindjet s mindmapper program www.mindjet.com - it s basically a virtual white board that is very intuitive to interact with and can export to multiple file formats including ms-project visio word powerpoint in case you have to pass the design along for oohs and aahs from the sales team

117674
emacs	vim
use the ide you like best emacs vim vc++ express code blocks bloodshed - again whatever

117678
ubuntu	linux
this is with ubuntu linux 1gb ram

117693
glib	gtk
having downloaded pango and glib from the gtk project s win32 downloads page and having created and configured a win32 project under visual-studio 2005 so it points to the proper lib and include directory how do you initialize pango for rendering to a win32 windows

117695
contains	elements
is an inline elements that cannot legally contains a block elements

117708
derived-class	base-class
this is an elegant idiom and i like to use it but how does it work if the derived-class is a base-class in itself

117720
managed-code	unmanaged
there are 3rd party drivers out there see eldos or logicnp that do the unmanaged side for you allowing you to write managed-code that talks to the native driver thus preventing shell-related clr version conflicts

117723
linked-list	arrays
store the ranges to a dynamic arrays or a linked-list

117741
boost	stl
become familiar with the stl and boost and use their facilities whenever possible rolling your own

any	set
for a there is some set of data that must be in memory to perform the work at any given time and if that working set size heap size performance will obviously suffer

117760
derived-class	base-class
it works because the derived-class can override a private virtual function of a base-class even if the base-class function overrides its base-class function

117769
cursor	row
the cursor s header data structure will let you get the column names - a bit of introspection will let you make a dictionary with col-name value pairs for the row

117771
duplicates	contains
also you want to filtering out duplicates in case previous perl versions contains the same modules

117774
entity-relationship	diagram
thentity-relationshipe was also some configuration to get used to since i don t work with java much but the end result was what i was looking for on open-source replacement for visio s entity-relationship diagram

117777
selenium-ide	selenium
the best open source automation tool i have used are selenium-ide and selenium remote control

117810
webserver	upload
how can i setup an asp.net upload page so the file the user uploaded will go straight to amazon s3 without using my webserver s storage and bandwidth

117811

if the arrays is sorted as in your example i would define buckets contains a min and a max

117819
python	perl
markdown in python is a python implementation of the perl based markdown utility

117834
safari	opera
safari 1.3+ opera 9.2+ konquerer and ie8 all support it at least to some degree

117849
dictionary	map
you would also be surprised how many people struggle to implement a map dictionary type data-structure

117857
webserver	upload
how can i setup an asp.net upload page so the file the user uploaded will go straight to amazon s3 without using my webserver s storage and bandwidth

117891

return distinct-values from a list including duplicates 1 3 5 3 7 3 1 1 5 - 1 3 5 7

117897
msbuild	nant
for example i myself haven t taken the time with msbuild because i ve been using nant for this task since before msbuild existed .

117920
dialog	pop-up
after i dismiss the the dialog by canceling i get another pop-up like the one below

117935
filesystems	symlink
when a new version comes along it is just added to the filesystems and you can swing your symlink to it

117936
selection	highlight
highlight the file activate qs current selection tab mail to

117938

cpan.pm will get the right installation paths from that perl s configuration

117947
continuous-integration	nant
are you using a continuous-integration codeigniter tool like nant to do your builds

117962
target-platform	platform
target-platform is sql-server 2005 but solutions from other platform may be of interest also

117972
linux	unix
many programs and utilities on unix linux use epoch values to represent time so this has proved invaluable for me

117978
contains	elements
this ends up with mode contains the mode and path contains an arrays of elements that are the rest of your path so

118019
buffering	capture
you could employ output buffering capture + the last modified time of related data on the page and use the apc cached version

118027
debugging	trace
as long as you have a debugging build of the code that is throwing the exception you should get a nice stack trace

118043
hide	show
i know you can just use css to hide the div or silverlight plugins but is there a way to instantiate a silverlight component app using javascript that doesn t show any user-interface element at all

118050
any	set
if you do the detailed requirements prior to the high level set the users will never grasp any concepts in the design and get bogged down in the tiniest detail specifications

118068
primitive	int
systems demand that certain primitive be aligned to certain point within the memory int to bytes that are multiples of 4 shorts to bytes that are multiples of 2 etc.

118071
shell	bash
the backslash is being eaten by cygwin s bash shell

118089
32-bit	x86
accesses not on word boundaries 32-bit on most cpus carry heavy penalty on x86 and cause fatal traps on risc architectures

118107
contains	set
you should have a set of rules each rule stating something like if the bnumber is 1792 and the message text contains the keyword video then the message should be directed to the video providing service

118126
webforms	asp.net
although asp.net mvc seems to have all the hype these days webforms are still quite pervasive

118128
type-safety	generics
generics promote type-safety forcing a more homogeneous collection

118128
type-safety	generics
i think you can see how these last two points tie in with the type-safety and code readability of generics collections

118137
hide	show
then to show the whole multi-part query you can either show five circles with some combination of union and intersection or else combine each parentheses and then hide the detail making the results into a new circle to combine with other elements

118143
python	php
essentially i am trying to work out why it works in php but not python

118144
contains	any
the table contains millions of rows and at any given time i don t know how large the table is it is constantly growing

118175
zipfile	archive
basically you just open the docx file which is a zip archive using zipfile and find the content in the document.xml file in the word folder

118180
python	php
php uses 3 different flavors of regex while python uses only one

118182
python	php
both php and python s regex objects take strings as arguments

118185
postgresql	oracle
i have been interested in database developing for some time now and decided that ms sql has a lot to offer in terms of t-sql and generally much more functionality not saying that oracle or postgresql don t have that

118192
debugging	trace
this is the stack trace i have from windbg when try to debugging the server

118197
perl	ruby
you seem to be working mostly with java and or ruby so forgive me that this answer is based on perl -

118219
perl	ruby
for instance once it can compile ruby perl and python it should be easy to cross those boundaries to let me use a ruby library in python a perl library from python so whatever combination that i like

118222
host	root
another option would be to enable scriptings to default to the php.ini in the folder with the scripting then go to the user host s root folder then to the server s root or something similar

118235
wordpress	phpbb
anyway iâ m sure other people have tackled this and the solution is probably applicable to many apps similar to wordpress drupal phpbb phpmyadmin etc.

118251
font-size	height
in your javascript set the font-size and attributes that you are trying to measure put your string in the div then read the current width and height of the div

118269
execute	declare
it doesn t really show in your specific example because there aren t any other instructions around your assignment but imagine functions declare after your bool assign execute before the assignment

118325
google-chrome	firefox
i use firefox with ie tab and google-chrome

118325
google-chrome	firefox
firefox with ie tab because those are the two browsers with the most market share and google-chrome because it is one of the few windows browsers that use webkit meaning it should display similarly to safari

118328
data-access	nhibernate
for our application i plan on using linq to entities but as it s new to me there is the possiblity that i will want to replace this in the future if it doesn t perform as i would like and use something else like linq to sql or nhibernate so i ll be abstracting the data-access objects into an abstract factory so that the implementation is hidden from the applicaiton

118336
silverlight	wpf
i know that the author just added support for wcf wpf and silverlight

118340
google-chrome	firefox
i find that if you stick to standards compliant markup and don t use anything too unusual it will render fine in firefox 2 3 and safari google-chrome and usually fine in ie7 8

118351
.when	ready
.when a slave is ready to build it just starts polling the taskmaster telling it what it s got install

118360
linux	unix
my advice don t do this at least not under linux unix

118360
linux	unix
gui programs under linux unix traditionally do not auto-background themselves

118372
cvs	git
this might be way overkill but you could use git-cvsimport to import the cvs history to a git repository and search it using git s tools

118373
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
depending on what other attributes you put on a checkboxlist or radiobuttonlist or whatever asp.net will render the output using different structures

118375
pyflakes	pylint
i myself only use pyflakes primarily due to some dumb default in pylint and laziness on my part not wanting to lookup how to change the default

118377
getter	setter
from my understanding you should use synchronized on both the getter and the setter methods and that is sufficient

118388
getter	setter
if you have 20 getter and setter and they re all synchronized you may be creating a synchronized bottleneck

118388
value	field
in this specific instance with a single int variables then eliminating the synchronized and marking the int field volatile will also ensure visibility each thread will see the latest value of val when calling the getter but it may not be synchronized enough for your needs

118389
ruby-on-rails	rspec
rspec on ruby-on-rails

118397
perl	awk
to that end i would use awk or perl to process the output line-by-line setting an echo variable when you find a section of interest

118403
sql-server	mysql
details using linked servers from sql-server to mysql to do the actual data migration

118422
proxy-server	squid
look into using varnish - it s a caching reverse proxy-server like squid but much more single purpose

118436
versioning	upgrade
it ended up that we had so many workarounds while using the development versioning of modules that it was a pain every time we upgrade modules or core itself

118460
wamp	php
for php you have several high-quality packages for deploying apache+mysql+php such as wamp and xampp

118460
binaries	install
personally i download the latest binaries of each and install manually to have more fine grained control

118465
.when	ready
if you do a checkout be sure to only updates .when you are ready to deploy

118469
logout	login
log of login logout activity by each user

118469
perl	php
in the server side it should use php 5 perl or python with php5 perl preferred

118480
duplicates	elements
here are some samples of how to remove duplicates based on elements name and id field

118486
javascript	dom
i also second the idea of using a css reset file and definitely use a library like jquery instead of reinventing the wheel on javascript event and dom differences

118490
formatting	printing
it needs to be able to do printing preview and some basic text formatting fonts etc but nothing too advanced

118492
perl	ruby
in some languages like ruby or perl this technique is straightforward

118499
perl	ruby
in some languages like ruby or perl this technique is straightforward

118503
aes	des
yes purely asymmetric encryption is much slower than symmetric cyphers like des or aes which is why real applications use hybrid cryptography the expensive public-key operations are performed only to encrypt and exchange an encryption key for the symmetric algorithm that is going to be used for encrypting the real message

118504
formatting	printing
it s arcane but one can learn enough rtf to create simple formatting and printing print previewing can both be implemented using native classes as well

118507
ubuntu	debian
if you install in debian ubuntu package name python-zsi the documentation is in usr share doc python-zsi in a pair of pdfs you can find in there

118528
reflection	runtime
not wanting to explicitly add the .net 3 3.5 dependency to my app i make a methods to create this control at runtime if it can using reflection

118539
optimistic-concurrency	nhibernate
nhibernate by default supports optimistic-concurrency

118564
optimistic-concurrency	nhibernate
nhibernate supports 2 types of optimistic-concurrency

118609
baud-rate	parity
depending on the device you are trying to communication with there may be more parameters than the baud-rate number of data bits type of parity checking and number of stop bits to consider

118610
firefox	safari
there s support for firefox safari firewatir project

118610
firefox	safari
question to watin guys does it support firefox safari

118614
environment	building
the __rtp__ macros is defined if the building is for a rtp environment

118614
environment	building
the _wrs_kernel macros is defined if the building is for a kernel environment

118616
host	dns
but if you want to have each project be served on a different port try setting up your virtual host configuration exactly like kelly s above minus the dns stuff except instead of 80 give each virtualhost its own port number assuming that you ve added this port to your ports.conf file

118617
json	xml
json xml etc.

118637
contains	elements
another point is that the elements used should have a logical relationship to the data contains within them

118655
google-chrome	firefox
i m far from being a css expert but this works for me in ie firefox safari and google-chrome

118669
constructor	object
if it s not satic then your inner object efectivelly points to the outer object that created it it has an implicit reference in fact if you use reflection over its constructor you ll see an extra parameter for receiving the outer instance

118680
ironpython	cpython
if beautifulsoup doesn t work on ironpython it s because ironpython doesn t implement the whole python language the same way cpython does

118680
ironpython	cpython
beautifulsoup is pure-python no c-extensions so the only problem is the compatibility of ironpython with cpython in terms of python source code.there shouldn t be one but if there is the error will be obvious no module named ... no methods named ... etc.

118682
hosts-file	hosts
edit your etc hosts and add the following lines

118703
javascript	dom
better solution is to construct actual html of future control and then assign it like innerhtml to some placeholder - it allows browser to render it itself which is much faster than any javascript dom manipulations

118716
dictionary	arrays
would you use an arrays to store a dictionary when you have a hashmap

118726
debian	linux
it shows virt res and shr by default on debian linux

118730
32-bit	x86
code is x86 32-bit

118740
coding-style	indentation
it seems to have learnt my coding-style or have the options in it for all coding-styles and it picks up what you re using and automatically indentation everything correctly

118740
notepad++	komodo
edit as you ve noted in your reply the issue is with trailing whitespace - i don t know notepad++ too well but most modern editors designed for coding have a stripes trailing whitespace on save option i know komodo does

118744
linux	osx
pindent.py it s located in the tools scripts directory in a windows install my path to it is c python25 tools scripts it looks like you d have grab it from svn.python.org if you are running on linux or osx

118752
variables	boolean
if you do wind up finding that an extra boolean test is going to be too expensive you can set a variables to the name of a function and call it

118769
xml-serialization	xml
msdn site on xml serialisation xml-serialization in the .net

118806
pascal	basic
if you want to teach them programming start with some simple procedural language like basic or pascal

118863
basic	vba
when is it appropriate to use a class in visual basic for applications vba

118884
firefox	opera
i have noticed that some browsers in particular firefox and opera are very zealous in using cached copies of .css and .js files even between browser sessions

118886
rewrite	rule
first we use the following rewrite rule in .htaccess

118887
forwarding	port
if you have a linux box at the remote end and you can forwarding ssh port 22 from the firewall to it then you might consider nx from nomachine

118931
asp.net-mvc	wcf
that web service wcf depends on the model layer from my asp.net-mvc project to communicate with the back-end so it looks to me like it needs to be part of the asp.net-mvc solution

118933
click	mouse
easy mouse events catching to implement any action on rollovers mouseins mouseouts click drag and drops clipboard management etc

118933
any	set
i don t want to set a datasource that establishes a fixed connection between some column in my sql query and some displayable element at design time i want to perform any query that i want and show elements tied to any query field anytime in run time

118937
compact-framework	.net
if you truly need realtime processing you would either use an embedded realtime language that isn t based on .net or use the .net compact-framework running on a windows ce device

118942
http	ssl
if your application can live with this type of login is works great for ajax and all other accesses to your site because the browser handles re-submitting requests with appropriate credentials and it is safe if you use ssl but only if you use ssl -- don t use basic auth with plain http

118958
perl	ruby
this regex should work in ruby 1.9 and in perl and many other places

118968
linux	bsd
facil.io c with optional http and websockets linux bsd macos

118976
selected	checkbox
in eclipse go to windows preferences java compiler errors warnings and under generic type selected the checkbox

118993
export	report
you could install the microsoft sql-server 2005 express edition toolkit to get the cool toys like the import export wizard and the report

119004
facade	dto
as said your business should not be exposed to anything but your dto and facade

119011
sql-server	oracle
can anyone suggest a good way of detecting if a database is empty from java needs to support at least microsoft sql-server derby and oracle

119031
gnome	kde
is there a standard format for kde gnome etc

119062
gnome	kde
for gnome and kde you would probably want to include a desktop file with your app that defines how it will be launched

119101
factors	primes
examples of this include factors primes finding the log or really any other np-complete problem

119101
factors	primes
ie multiply two numbers vs find the primes factors of the product

119102
compact-framework	.net
with that explained is there a way i can go into a simulator of sorts to run code on the .net compact-framework for 360 before actually deploying to the 360

119103
any	set
on those rare occasions when your algorithm really is most comprehensible in terms of a path through a sequence of nodes states connected by a limited set of permissible transitions gotos rather than by any more specific control flow loops conditionals whatnot then that should be explicit in the code

119128
64bit	x86
here s an example using typical settings for an x86 processor all used 32 and 64bit modes

119132
32-bit	64bit
also a library may be compiled under x86 with 32-bit ints and you may be comparing its components on a 64bit process would would give you a different result if you were doing this by hand

119149
perl	ruby
consider lisp s format python s printf-style formatting or php bash perl ruby and their string intrapolation

119152
any	set
this will disallow the user to create any site under the site where these permissions are set

119194
required	checked
thus assignment to an object explicitly checked the type at compiler time of the object being assign too generating an compile time error if required

119194
printf	scanf
scanf printf and family on the other hand rely on the programmer getting the format string correct and there was no type checking i believe gcc has an extension that helps

119209
tunnel	vpn
the clincher for us was the speed the lack thereof of vss over vpn and low bandwidth hotel networks on the road and the problems of trying to tunnel through firewalls so that two teams at two different sites could quickly securely and reliably work from the same code repository

119210
fwrite	fread
for binary io i tend to use stdio s fread and fwrite

119241
sql-server	ms-access
ms-access to sql-server migrations docs

119249
arrays	map
map is a function that works on ranges and arrays and returns an array

119276
versioning	migrate
the first step is to decide if you need to migrate everything or just certain key versioning

119276
versioning	migrate
if you only migrate the important versioning releases and major milestones you ll end up with a much simpler history in perforce without losing anything important

119280
value	field
serialization data is very space-inefficient in php and many dbs like mysql will silently truncate field value that are too long

119283
firefox	safari
interesting feature it can emulate safari ie or firefox browsers when rendering

119284
click	mouse
the default is to place the caret where the mouse was click the masked textbox already contains characters due to the mask

119295
single-sign-on	shibboleth
clarification we don t have a single-sign-on server shibboleth setup yet

119296
export	report
i was looking for that but using the web reportviewer and found examples export the report to several pdfs then concatenating the pdfs into 1 using pdftk free

119326
firefox	safari
according to though ie and firefox ignore this opera and safari don t

119336
http	ssl
i googled on the problem and the main source seems to be that the ssl port is speaking in http

119351
iostream	boost
the boost format library provides a type-safe object-oriented alternative for printf-style string formatting and is a complement to iostream that does not suffer from the usual verbosity issues due to the clever use of operator

119365
16-bit	x86
32-bit x86 processors are generally slow at manipulating 16-bit data in general purpose registers

119388
controllers	routes
how do i manage routes to those controllers

119414
realloc	malloc
however how would you unit-test for example a memory allocator think malloc realloc free

119414
unit-testing	assertions
my experience is that assertions even if complex and time-consuming traversing the whole free list to check invariants are much less work and are more reliable than unit-testing esp

119461
cppunit	cunit
my unit tests usually don t use tools like cunit cppunit and similar software

119468
controller	routes
routes do not depend on where a controller is stored

119478
inherited	subclass
we ve inherited a wcf web service that has a custom messageformatter that constructs a custom message subclass in the serializereply methods

119478
put	get
every way we tried we managed to get the ws-addressing headers into the actual response but could never get the ws-security header in actually we were just trying to put in a security header with timestampid and created expires elements

119506
constructor	object
i m getting a warning from resharper about a call to a virtual member from my object constructor

119508
keyboard	mouse
i want to create a keyboard and mouse hook which will be started as a windows service

119516
constructor	object
because until the constructor has completed executing the object is not fully instantiated

119516
constructor	object
in c++ when you are in a constructor this only refers to the static type of the constructor you are in and not the actual dynamic type of the object that is being created

119531
constructor	object
an object s base constructor is called before its own constructor

119531
constructor	object
by having a virtual call in an object s constructor you are introducing the possibility that inheriting objects will execute code before they have been fully initialized

119534
getter	setter
to me that excludes auto-generated getter and setter but include hand-written ones that contains some logic

119536
constructor	object
in c++ the object is not initialized and therefore it is unsafe to call a virutal function inside a constructor

119538
32-bit	64bit
the lua version posted above is faster but relies on the truncation of double to a 32-bit result therefore it requires the x87 unit to be set to double precision and cannot be adapted for double to 64bit int conversion

119541
derived-class	base-class
in c# a base-class constructor runs before the derived-class constructor so any instance fields that a derived-class might use in the possibly-overridden virtual member are not initialized yet

119543
constructor	object
when an object written in c# is constructed what happens is that the initializers run in order from the most derived class to the base class and then constructor run in order from the base class to the most derived class see eric lippert s blog for details as to why this is

119557
base-class	subclass
now not the subclass s implementation of the function but the implementation of the base-class will be called

119613
constructor	object
when you are in the constructor for some object in c# that object exists in a fully initialized just not constructed form as its fully derived type

119632
python	ruby
i want to run javascript python ruby inside my application

119657
version-control	bazaar
i have recently started to love the simplicity of bazaar to solve the problem of starting version-control after already having hacked on an application for a while

119680
ironpython	ironruby
look into ironpython and ironruby -- these will allow you to easily interoperate with c#

119706
contains	any
is there any way to determine the module handle of the module that contains the currently running code

119721
ironpython	ironruby
i think this is possible with ironpython and ironruby as well

119722
look-and-feel	swt
if you use swt it has a native vista look-and-feel built in

119724
continuous-integration	teamcity
in using our teamcity continuous-integration server we have uncovered some issues that we are unsure as to the best way to handle

119730
contains	sorted
when it does contains numbers i want it to be sorted numerically as 1 2 10 instead of 1 10 2

119730
contains	sorted
fields contains just letters or letters and numbers such as a1 can be sorted alphabetically as normal

119733
postgresql	mysql
this does not happen with mysql or postgresql

119744
python	ruby
basically you have two problems how to define point of injections in your generated code and how to run python ruby whatev scripts from there

119744
ironpython	ironruby
the function would check whether the user has associated any scriptings with given points and if so runs the scripting by invoking ironpython ironruby with optionally given parameters

119751
surf	sift
when using feature descriptors like sift surf - is approximate nearest neighbour the fastest methods to do matching between images

119753
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
and - you guessed it - visual-studio is not to be considered at that moment i guess for my investigations i ll stick with sharpdevelop and the .net sdk for the time being

119788
shell	bash
so what is a good way to write a shell script bash to recursively compare files with the same name in two different directories

119798
svnadmin	dump
i would suggest that at your earliest convenience you dump that repository svnadmin dump and reload it into a new one backed by fsfs svnadmin load

119800
triggers	insert
either that or put a triggers on the table to populate the second column whenever data is insert or updated

119801
sql-server	mysql
this does not happen with mysql or sql-server 2008

119809
sql-server	oracle
this does not happen with sql-server 2008 or oracle

119813
windows-xp	windows
this issue occurs if you install windows-xp service pack 2 sp2 or windows server 2003 service pack 1 sp1

119813
windows-xp	windows
windows-xp sp2 and windows server 2003 sp1 include a loopback check security feature that is designed to help prevent reflection attacks on your computer

119818
selected	checkbox
this is supposed to validate if the checkbox is selected in the page or not

119834
contains	elements
alternatively you can create a contains elements and cycle with javascript on every child input elements of type checkbox

119842
string-length	numeric
one possible solution is to pad the numeric values with a character in front so that all are of the same string-length

119852
environment	building
