internet-explorer	safari
when i use a percentage-based width on the child div it collapses to 0 width on internet-explorer 7 but not on firefox or safari

19
32-bit	64bit
apart from testing between various compiler flags i ve compared 32-bit against 64bit too because the optimisations are different i ve also tried switching the order of the tests around

30
linux	bsd
i ve had no trouble using the bsd sockets api in c++ in gnu linux

76
joomla	drupal
try looking at wordpress drupal joomla and other well known php-based cms s to see how their api hooks look and feel

79
subclipse	aptana
the versioning of subclipse 1.2.4 currently available through aptana s automatic plugins manager does not work with the newest versioning of subversioning

79
versioning	upgrade
does anyone know if there is a way to upgrade the versioning of eclipse aptana that is built against to 3.3.0

89
subclipse	svnkit
i m not sure how aptana is different but try either upgrading javahl or switching to the pure-java svnkit implementation within the subclipse configuration

111
configuration	installation
is it possible the problem could lie within the configuration of tortoisesvn or even the installation of vista

113
versioning	upgrade
i did upgrade directly from an older versioning to 1.5.2 though and never used 1.5.1

123
csv	xml
is there an existing application or library in java which will allow me to convert a csv data file to xml file

126
getter	setter
when i learned oo i was taught to use getter setter for every single property even if it was public and actually i was told never to make any variables property public

126
getter	setter
it appears that people answering this question are maybe saying that you should have public properties and that those don t need getter and setter which goes against what i was taught and what i was talking about although maybe that needs to be discussed as well

127
getter-setter	setter
this has religious .war potential but it seems to me that if you re using a getter-setter you should use it internally as well - using both will lead to maintenance problems down the road somebody adds code to a setter that needs to run every time that property is set and the property is being set internally w o that setter being called

129
sql-server	mysql
what would be better is if there was some tool that could connect to both sql-server and mysql then do a copy

133
arrays	loops
this may be too basic or limited of a solution but couldn t you do a string.split on each line of the file remembering the result arrays of the first line to generate the xml and just spit each line s arrays data out with the proper xml elements padding each iteration of a loops

139
protected	public
another approach would be to utilize a private protected methods to actually do the getting caching db etc and a public wrapper for it that increment the count

143
getter-setter	setter
the opposite case could be made that if you use the getter-setter and somebody changes the getter-setter they have to analyze all the places the getter and setter is used internally to see if it messes something up

161
out-of-memory	memory-leaks
i personally have suffered out-of-memory exceptions which can be caused but are not exclusive to memory-leaks in dot .net applications

163
revision	svn
svn revision 679

164
internet-explorer	firefox
this works quite well on internet-explorer but not on firefox

164
internet-explorer	firefox
i ve found ways to make it work in firefox but then it stops working in internet-explorer

164
windows-xp	windows
we do not want to use silverlight just yet especially since we cannot be sure that all clients will be running windows-xp with windows media player installed

164
internet-explorer	firefox
is there some sort of universal code that embeds wmp into both internet-explorer and firefox or do we need to implement some user-agent-detection and deliver different html for different browsers

169
getter	setter
if you have getter and setter use them

183
csv	xml
you can read csv file with this tool and serialize it to xml

190
csv	xml
converting a csv file to xml doesn t add any value

190
csv	xml
your program is already reading the csv file so arguing that you need xml doesn t work

190
csv	xml
on the other hand reading the csv file doing something with the values and then serializing to xml does make sense well as much as using xml can make sense.

263
gtk	sdl
the app using sdl opengl so this isn t a gtk app

264
puts	gets
my application is pretty simple i ll be doing gets and puts of recording that are about 1kb each

307
ironpython	ironruby
a different approach would be to consider a language that is specifically built for scripting such as ironruby ironpython or lua

307
ironpython	ironruby
ironpython and ironruby are both available today

332
implements	abstract
the front-end class could take a pointers reference to an implements driver class for the appropriate media type and situation and perform the abstract operations on the workhorse structure

344
reflection	runtime
then you could have a reference in the db to the assembly and class and use reflection to load the proper assemblies at runtime

344
reflection	runtime
if you really want to compile at runtime you could use the codedom then you could use reflection to load the dynamic assembly

360
versioning	downgrade
you generate a migration file which has rules to increase the db versioning such as adding a column and rules to downgrade the versioning such as removing a column

360
versioning	migrate
to migrate up you run a command called db migrate which looks at your versioning and applies the needed scripting

362
dynamic-programming	memoization
common methods use recursion memoization or dynamic-programming

367
processor	cpu
it will tell you the number of cpu cycles executed since the processor was booted

375
order	add
you can tell your users to add your from address to their contacts when they complete their order which if they do so will help a lot

388
any	set
the resulting set for any moderately large values of x and y will be huge and will grow exponentially as x and or y get bigger

396
email	dkim
use email authentication methods such as spf and dkim to prove that your email and your domain name belong together and to prevent spoofing of your domain name

430
difference	factors
the difference between 12.345 in french and english is a factors of 1000

471
libxml2	lxml
it s in pure python and as i say pretty nice but if you wind up needing more performance then lxml exposes the same api and uses libxml2 under the hood

516
versioning	upgrade
a sequences database upgrade scripting that contains the ddl necessary to move the schema from versioning n to n+1

516
versioning	upgrade
gets a new entry every time an upgrade scripting runs which corresponds to the new versioning

516
versioning	upgrade
this ensures that it s easy to see what versioning of the database schema exists and that database upgrade scripting are run only once

518
directory	folder
i think you ll have to iterate through the various font folder on the system system library fonts library fonts and there can probably be a user-level directory as well library fonts

535
continuous-integration	teamcity
i am starting work on a hobby project with a python codebase and would like to set up some form of continuous-integration running a battery of test-cases each time a check-in is made and sending nag email to responsible persons when the tests fail similar to cruisecontrol or teamcity

538
python	java
it s written in java but there s integration with python projects

539
hashtable	set
once you have a set of vectors that are maximized a part you can save them in a hashtable or something for later and just perform random rotations on them to get all the colors you desire that are maximally apart from each other

540
csv	xml
as far as i know there s no ready-made library to do this for you but producing a tool capable of translating from csv to xml should only require you to write a crude csv parser and hook up jdom or your xml java library of choice with some glue code

541
linux	osx
but we run the tests on different environments osx linux win and it sends emails --and it s written in python

549
http	ssl
ssl http encryption

549
protected	public
secret urls public url protected by digest

561
tuples	set
i would like to test a function with a tuples from a set of fringe cases and normal values

566
primitive	int
in java the int type is a primitive whereas the integer type is an object

568
primitive	int
well in java an int is a primitive while an integer is an object

568
primitive	int
int is one of the few primitive in java along with char and some others

568
primitive	int
int primitive comparison

576
hotmail	gmail
sign up for an account on as many major email providers as possible gmail yahoo hotmail aol etc

583
double	int
in c# int is just an alias for system.int32 string for system.string double for system.double etc.

583
double	int
personally i prefer int string double etc

591
versioning	upgrade
on all subsequent versioning i do two things i make a new text file to hold the upgrade sql scripting that contains just the alters for that version

591
versioning	upgrade
then rather than make any human decisions about which scripting to run whatever code i have running the create upgrade scripting uses the versioning to determine what to run

599
version-control	cvs
the files can get huge fast in version-control and cause your entire source control system to become slow i m recalling a cvs horror story at the moment

633
managed-code	unmanaged
i have been unaware of the issues until now on using managed-code to interface to mapi although the c++ code in the component should be unaffected by this error as it is unmanaged

635
key-value	key
then since my data structure is a possibly nested dictionary i create a string that turns this dictionary into key-value key items

650
default	reset
i m also using a settings file and in earlier attempts when the assembly versioning changed my settings got reset to the default since the application looked for the settings file in another directory

650
versioning	upgrade
i would like to be able to display a versioning number in the form of 1.1.38 so when a user finds a problem i can log the versioning they are using as well as tell them to upgrade if they have an old release

651
authentication	login
i ve got windows authentication mode set in the web.config disabled anonymous access and configured the correct default domain in iis but it s still asking the user to login and more annoyingly the user is required to provide the domain too domain auser which is causing problems with non-technical visitors

669
hash	md5
md5 sha1 and des are weak password hash

684
updating	updates
an alternative since you asked to updating the unique index value with different value would be to updates all of the other value in the rows to that of the other row

699
internet-explorer	firefox
the following works for me in firefox and internet-explorer

717
windows-server	windows
the problem is this use to run fine in windows-server 2003 32-bits but the client recently moved to windows 2003 64-bits and now the service won t work

742
methods	extend
one way would be to point views to class methods and then extend that class

766
postgresql	mysql
i can get python to work with postgresql but i cannot get it to work with mysql

794
combinations	permutation
absolutely especially dealing with lots of these permutation combinations i can definitely see that the first pass would be an issue

798
mbunit	nunit
mbunit is worth alook it has a set of features comparable to nunit it has its own gui or can be integrated into vs if you have resharper

871
version-control	git
yet there s a growing number of developers claiming that subversion has problems and that we should be moving to the new breed of distributed version-control systems such as git

875
cvs	git
subversion has problems but so does git mercurial cvs tfs or whatever

877
32-bit	x86
you ll need to compile with the target cpu set to x86 to force your code to use the 32-bit version of the vfp ole db provider

885
arguments	default
by default function argumentss are passed by value so that if the value of the arguments within the function is changed it does not get changed outside of the function

886
push	pull
if you need a change from someone else though she has to commit to her local repo and then she must push that changeset to you or you must pull it from her

886
push	pull
someone has to be responsible for doing that push pull from everyone else s repository resolving any conflicts that would have been resolved at initial commit time before then doing the build and then having all the other developers re-sync their repos

893
push	pull
if it were just 2 people i d say git is also easier because you can just push and pull from eachother

894
sftp	scp
obviously this is less then ideal but it will get the job done and let you use scp sftp in classic asp

906
localization	translation
if you get lazy and don t notify the people in charge of translation or you embed strings without going through your localization system it will be a nightmare to try and fix it later

939
xml-serialization	xml
the xml-serialization framework should be something that can scale in case you want to transform large or huge csv file to xml my recommendation is the sun java streaming xml parser framework see here which allows pull-parsing and serialization

943
any	set
it is your responsibility that the byte sequences you create are valid characters in the server character set encoding. any other character following a backslash is taken literally

981
rollback	commit
it will give you a write lock on the selected rows which you can then commit or rollback

1043
binary	hex
w2k edit binary selected data format hex click at the end of the hex string enter 0000 four zeros ok

1043
binary	hex
wxp right-click the value choose modify binary data click at the end of the hex string enter 0000 four zeros ok

1061
punctuation	words
the # char is indexed as punctuation and therefore ignored so it looks like we ll remove the letter c from our words indexing ignore lists

1070
solaris	aix
what is the correct way to get the process size on solaris hp-ux and aix

1104
exception-handling	try-catch
is there a way one can ensure that the exception-handling thrown are always caught using try-catch by the calling function

1130
duplicates	sorted
also since the data is sorted given a non-key field the rest of the table doesnâ t need to be searched for duplicates values once a higher value is found

1130
value	field
creating an index on a field in a table creates another data structure which holds the field value and pointers to the record it relates to

1130
value	field
a linear search on the id field would require an average of block accesses to find a value given that the id field is a key field

1130
value	field
now the firstname field is neither sorted nor a key field so a binary search is impossible nor are the value unique and thus the table will require searching to the end for an exact block accesses

1130
spaces	output
since indexes are only used to speed up the searching for a matching field within the records it stands to reason that indexing fields used only for output would be simply a waste of disk spaces and processing time when doing an insert or delete operation and thus should be avoided

1145
realloc	free
if i try to use realloc i get an error that tells me i am doing a double free - which i don t see how i am since i am only using realloc

1149
realloc	malloc
just a shot in the dark because i haven t tried it yet but when you realloc it returns the pointers much like malloc

1154
realloc	free
as a general rule you should never do a free or realloc on a user provided buffer

1154
space	input
then you could create another function to do the multiple replacements but you will have to allocate the whole space for the resulting string and copy the user input string

1160
msbuild	nant
edit i m not using nant - only msbuild

1169
revision	svn
svn revision labeller is a plugin for

1189
firefox	opera
firefox ie and opera all load successfully in the same scenario

1216
assemblyinfo	csproj
customizing csproj files to autogenerate assemblyinfo

1232
apache	vhosts
with apache you can set up a similar catch-all for your vhosts

1235
revision	svn
i use this target combined with the svn revision labeller mentioned by lubos hasko with great results

1236
order	add
you may need to add it to your application s browscap in order to make use of some asp.net features

1241
any	set
as i currently have it set up so the client is only in receive mode after it sends data to the server this doesn t allow for the server to send a request at any time

1272
revision	svn
cvs only tracks modification on a file-by-file basis while svn tracks a whole commit as a new revision which means that it is easier to follow the history of your project

1272
revision	svn
add the fact that all modern source control software use the concept of revision so it is far easier to migrate from svn than it is from cvs

1275
.when	ready
.when i needed to write an application with a client-server where the clients could leave and enter .whenever they want i assume that s also the case for your application as you use mobile-devices i made sure that the clients send an online message to the server indicating they were connect and ready to do whatever they needed doing

1300
msbuild	nant
now ccnet refers nant a lot but it looks as if ccnet can do most of the stuff nant could do through the project configuration and msbuild

1300
msbuild	nant
in short i am actually quite happy with msbuild especially since it s the official compiler front end and a bit uncomfortable with nant but i do not want to judge prematurely

1300
msbuild	nant
what would be reasons to use nant over msbuild

1306
progress-bar	progress
i m already aware of using a separate thread to monitor the progress of a given job i m just not sure how to proceed with drawing a progress-bar

1318
progress-bar	progress
you might be able to get some implementation ideas from the ruby progress-bar library which generates text progress bars

1320
msbuild	nant
nant is a great framework and msbuild is almost as capable

1348
difference	zero
also a shift in saturation from a small amount to zero is the difference between grey and pink elsewhere the shift would be the difference between two shades of red

1364
msbuild	nant
if you ve already got a bunch of custom tasks you use with nant stick with it - you don t gain much with msbuild

1364
msbuild	nant
that said there doesn t seem to be anything that nant can do that msbuild can t at its core

1380
linux	osx
here is a solution that works in xp vista but is definitely expandable to osx linux i d still be interested in another way

1413
any	set
you can set apache to serve pages from anywhere with any restrictions but it s normally distributed in a more secure form

1413
any	set
editing your apache files http.conf is one of the more common names will allow you to set any folder so it appears in your webroot

1415
imap	nntp
imap pop3 and nntp

1421
hosts-file	hosts
open your hosts-file c windows system32 drivers etc hosts

1421
hosts-file	hosts
save you might have to save it to the desktop change the permissions on the old hosts right click properties and copy the new one into the directory over the old one or rename the old one if you are using vista and have trouble

1430
python	ruby
i learned python by writing lots of web spiders and little toys and for ruby i d take exactly the same path

1453
put	get
i don t want to put a magic number in there for weight since the object i am using has a defaultweight parameter that all new shipments get if you don t specify a weight

1464
command-line	cmd
this way you can run large scripts with go cmd in it from a command-line or in a batch script

1488
subtract	addition
in addition to john downey and jdecuyper s solutions i ve also added an explicit deny bit at the end beginning of the bitfield so that you can perform additive permissions by grouping role membership and then subtract permissions based upon explicit deny entries much like ntfs works permission-wise

1496
emacs	vim
for those of us that like to use the graphical version of vim or emacs instead of the console version which version do you recommend

1496
macvim	vim
for vim there s mac os x vim macvim vim-cocoa

1496
aquamacs	emacs
for emacs carbonemacs xemacs and aquamacs

1517
textmate	macvim
macvim works well and certainly looks more mature than vim-cocoa moreover there is a cocoa plugin architecture in the pipeline for macvim and someone is already working on a textmate style file browser tray plugin which is a huge ++ imho

1525
git-repo	repo
looks like you can use vss2svn to pipe the source safe repo into a subversion repository then use the very nice git-svn to pull into a local git-repo

1528
silverlight	wpf
these classes are all controls that are written to be compiled for either wpf or silverlight 2.0

1535
exception-handling	try-catch
i ve never been completely happy with the way exception-handling handling works there s a lot exception-handlings and try-catch brings to the table stack unwinding etc. but it seems to break a lot of the oo model in the process

1594
ip-address	hostname
assuming your server has a static ip-address or a hostname you can access from the internet remote desktop is a simple and relatively secure solution

1644
groovy	java
java groovy

1644
linux	unix
unix linux mac iphone

1656
required	checked
when you need to change the schema along with the code the scripting can be checked in along with the code that required the changed schema

1673
msbuild	nant
i started with nant and can t quite get used to msbuild

1678
python	java
adding the quora link as it have the links to all the various ports of slang in c++ java and javascript also interpreters in python and java originally written using c# and the .net platform

1718
simpletest	phpunit
this started with junit in the java world and has become a best practice in php as well with simpletest and phpunit

1762
hide	show
i am trying to set a flag to show or hide a page element but it always display even when the expression is false

1793
credentials	security
you have to be careful between servers as security credentials don t come with the restored database

1820
testdriven.net	xunit.net
i like testdriven.net even though i use resharper and i m pretty happy with xunit.net

1821
mstest	nunit
for the microsoft-types mstest is adequate but slow and clunky compared to nunit

1821
mbunit	nunit
oh and testdriven.net will give you ide integration for both nunit and mbunit

1894
downgrade	upgrade
i create folder named after the build versions and put upgrade and downgrade scripting in there

1894
downgrade	upgrade
each one contains the scripting that allows you to upgrade or downgrade your database between versions

1894
downgrade	upgrade
then writing a program that can upgrade or downgrade your database for you is easy

1905
linked-list	arrays
a good simple way to do it is to open the file and read each line into an arrays linked-list data-structure-of-your-choice

1909
exception-handling	try-catch
if the user should always wrap the call in a try-catch block should the user-called function really be throwing exception-handling in the first place

1909
exception-handling	try-catch
shooting from the hip i think the best answer here is to wrap the function up such that the recommended if not only depending on the overall exception-handling style of the code public interface does the try-catch for the user

1912
parsing	comma
just make sure you can t have comma in the data otherwise you will need to parsing it better

1971
python	perl
when i wrote my first trigger it was in perl because that was the language used in the example i found but the last triggers i wrote where in python because i m more comfortable with that

1971
python	perl
i think programmer comfort is my main reason to choose python but i think perl is still better supported

1988
parentheses	macros
especially is it possible to get rid of the parentheses hell using macros

1992
python	ruby
it s possible to use ruby and python in a very lisp like way which is one of the main reasons they have gained acceptance so quickly

1995
double	int
i have values stored as strings in a datatable where each value could really represent an int double or string they were all converted to strings during an import process from an external data source

1995
double	int
try to convert to int and then double

1995
double	int
regular expressions designed to match the pattern of an int or double

2120
hash	md5
i want to get the md5 hash of a string value in sql-server 2005

2155
configuration	environment
the web-applications i develop often require co-dependant configuration settings and there are also settings that have to change as we move between each of our environment

2155
configuration	environment
all our settings are currently simple key value pairs but it would be useful to create custom configuration sections so that it is obvious when two values need to change together or when the settings need to change for an environment

2178
web-config	app-config
there is a basic overview of how to write one at however it refers to app-config which would be pretty much the same as writing one for use in web-config

2196
contains	elements
besides the key elements here are the dialog boxes that contains forms with validation controls on them and i can t imagine how i would move the controls and their required scripting

2210
any	set
the bind element there specifies what to map to in this example it will apply that styling to any button whose name property has been set to dirt

2277
tuples	any
you would choose a tuples for small collections of completely different pieces of data in which a full-blown class would be too heavyweight and a list for collections of any reasonable size where you have a homogeneous set of data

2308
revision	svn
i see in the stack overflow footer that the svn revision number is displayed

2328
callback	methods
so again i need a way for the page viewstate to be updated on callback after the ajax methods is fired

2349
checkbox	textbox
it will stop on textbox radiobuttons checkbox dropdown menus etc

2360
keyboard	mouse
go to system preferences keyboard and mouse then choose keyboard shortcuts

2361
keyboard	mouse
apple menu system preferences keyboard mouse keyboard shortcuts

2361
radio-button	textbox
change the radio-button at the bottom from textbox and lists only to all controls.

2400
shell	bash
first note that when ruby calls out to a shell it typically calls bin sh not bash

2400
perl	php
this is like many other languages including bash php and perl

2462
order	join
then find your primary table say the order table in your example above and pull that data plus a bit of supplementary data that is only say one join away customer name product name

2471
hosts-file	hosts
hosts-file c windows system32 drivers etc hosts usually

2540
data-structures	hashmap
what are good libraries for c with data-structures like vectors deques stacks hashmap treemaps sets etc

2546
click	mouse
you can add a mouse click event to the treeview then selected the correct node using getnodeat given the mouse coordinates provided by the mouseeventargs

2554
arguments	default
c# passes its arguments by value by default

2554
ref	out
c# also has a out keyword and the difference between ref and out is a subtle one

2560
windows-media-player	embed
other alternatives are quicktime windows-media-player or even silverlight microsoft s flash competitor which can be used to embed several video formats

2562
wmv	flv
i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv

2658
version-control	git
i have read about how great subversion is for the past couple years and was about to dedicate myself to learning this on the side until i heard about git being the up and coming version-control system

2665
revision	svn
any future revision system will have an import from svn feature so it isn t like you can t change down the road if your needs grow

2668
cvs	git
git has some nice features but you won t be able to appreciate them unless you ve already used something more standard like cvs or subversion

2668
version-control	git
using git is pointless if you don t know what version-control can do for you

2672
cvs	git
git has some nice features but you won t be able to appreciate them unless you ve already used something more standard like cvs or subversion

2688
perl	php
i d like to see graceful solutions in perl java and php

2702
aggregate-functions	sum
i know i need to have although i don t know why a grouping by clause on the end of a sql query that uses any aggregate-functions like count sum avg etc

2732
shell	bash
i tried the same code with both the dash and bash shell and got the same behavior from both of them

2750
getter	setter
i m wondering if it s a good idea to make verifications in getter and setter or elsewhere in the code

2750
getter	setter
this might surprise you be when it comes to optimizations and speeding up the code i think you should not make verifications in getter and setter but in the code where you re updating your files or database

2754
getter	setter
validation should be captured separately from getter or setter in a validation methods

2761
getter	setter
well one of the reaons why classes usually contains private-members with public getter setter is exactly because they can verify data

2767
plugins	add-on
can anyone recommend any good add-on plugins for microsoft visual-studio

2785
.when	ready
i also know that .when an object goes out of scope it is then marked for collection ready for the next pass of the garbage collector although this may take time

2798
data-structures	map
update i m primarily looking for pointers as to how a map system is implemented data-structures algorithms etc

2804
contains	set
the sizemode of the control is set to zoom so that the image contains in the picturebox will be displayed in an aspect-correct way regardless of the dimensions of the picturebox

2804
click	mouse
unfortunately i also need to handle mouse click events on the picture box and need to be able to translate from screen-space coordinates to image-space coordinates

2810
value	field
you can add a timestamp field to that table and update that timestamp value with an update triggers

2818
python	perl
might help a little but it might be easier to use something like mechanize in perl or python to mimic a browser more fully to get a good spider

2862
ruby	php
syntax highlighting for a boatload of languages including c++ and php i m using it for ruby python and php myself

2862
sftp	ftp
ability to remote save via ftp sftp or scp

2867
command-line	cmd
the way i have done this is to create a cmd script file and pass this on the cmd-line via the b cmd to psftp.exe

2883
configuration	upgrade
i m not sure if the same change is necessary in 8.04 as i m an upgrade and didn t change any of my domu configuration after the upgrade

2884
ubuntu	linux
if you do feel like using linux then you could try ubuntu

2884
solaris	unix
modesty mono provides the necessary software to develop and run .net client and server applications on linux solaris mac os x windows and unix

2890
populate	row
if you also need to track when a record has been deleted then you ll want to use an audit table and populate it from triggers with a row when a record has been added edited or deleted

2898
python	ruby
i ll mostly use it for coding python ruby

2905
keyboard	mouse
if you keep at it you can use exclusively the keyboard and never touch the mouse which increases your editing speed by a significant margin

2905
gedit	emacs
update i think gedit is exclusively gui based though so it would be useful to learn emacs in case you are stuck with just a shell it is fully featured in both shell and graphical mode

2905
emacs	vim
further update just fyi i am not trying to push emacs over vim it s just what i use and it s a great editor as i m sure vim is too

2905
gedit	emacs
emacs seems the logical choice to me but gedit is a great simple text editor with some nice features if that s all you are looking for

2911
required	checked
if however the apache user doesn t required a password a double-check of the permissions may be a good idea which you mentioned you already checked

2913
any	set
do people usually make a separate development system with a frozen database so that any given function should always return the exact same result set

2915
having	select
if indeed you are able to insert using the same connection calls your problem most likely lies in the user apache not having select permissions on the database

2941
python	tcl
as for a gui library that works cross platform python tk tcl widget library works very well and i believe is sufficiently cross platform

2941
python	tcl
tkinter is the python interface to tk tcl

2967
sieve-of-eratosthenes	sieve
i recommend a sieve either the sieve-of-eratosthenes or the sieve of atkin

2976
versioning	upgrade
revert your site back to a known good status and if need be upgrade to the latest versioning

2979
solaris	linux
i use pico or nano as my casual text editor in linux solaris etc

2992
click	mouse
also look into different ways of bringing the windows to the front setforegroundwindows setactivewindows even simulating a mouse click can do this

3010
hotmail	gmail
personally i ran mine through a freshly installed spam assassin a trained spam assassin and multiple hotmail gmail and aol account

3019
getter	setter
if i remember well there was an option through which you could ask vs to create the setter and getter automatically for you

3026
getter	setter
if you are using visual-studio 2005 and up you can create a setter getter real fast using the insert snippet command

3030
checkbox	button
for example if i have a treeview with checkbox think installation of a new program choose features to install page i might want a check all button which would be something like this pseudocode

3030
children	nodes
so you can see that the checkrecursively first checks the nodes which it is passed then calls itself for each of that nodes s children

3032
getter	setter
i m not too big a fan of this technique as it is a little bit awkward to use if you have to create a lot of getter setter and it puts the property directly below the private field which bugs me because i usually have all of my private fields grouping together and this visual-studio feature breaks my class formatting

3033
key-value	key
if i have a perl hash with a bunch of key-value pairs what is the preferred methods of iterating through all the key

3054
linux	unix
in unix linux you can get ahold of minicom to play with the serial port directly

3060
any	set
just create a serial-port object set its baudrate port and any other odd settings call open on it and write out your byte s

3061
function-call	eval
i figured out how to do it by using eval to define a temp function that returns the result of that function-call but i m hoping that there is a more elegant way to do this

3075
scriptmanager	updatepanel
i have a simple page with my scriptmanager and my updatepanel and my contenttemplate has one listbox and one label

3090
hardware	monitor
also we have a hardware splitter with a switching so we can monitor traffic to our application via a cable back to another port

3093
python	ruby
in the majority of major imperative language implementations every major implementation of c c++ basic python ruby java and c# iteration is vastly preferable to recursion

3095
variables	boolean
after hello world move on to creating some basic variables arithmetic then onto boolean logic and if else statements

3106
ubuntu	linux
i m developing some cross platform software targeting mono under visual-studio and would like to be able to build the installers for windows and linux ubuntu specifically with a single button click

3112
contains	set
however when the arrays has only one item in it will be set to that value and not a referenced arrays that contains that one item

3112
arrays	loops
i want to do a foreach loops on the expected arrays

3117
arrays	loops
loops arrays timers and random if you make the interval random

3120
python	ruby
personally i think python and ruby would make great first languages

3136
any	set
how can i set up my crontab to execute x scripting at 11 59pm every day without emailing me or creating any logs

3143
teamcity	nant
i m compiling a nant project on linux with teamcity continuous integration server

3143
teamcity	nant
update take a look at mbunittask its a nant task that uses sends messages that teamcity expects from nunit so it lets you use all of teamcity s features for tests

3162
any	set
also the example tutorial is now more agnostic - doesn t go into any configuration or project set up at all

3213
lookup	any
is there any way of doing this that doesn t involve a massive lookup table

3217
kate	kde
kate the kde advanced text editor is quite good

3224
revision	svn
could use the svn revision number to automate this for you asp.net display svn revision number

3233
revision	svn
you could use the svn revision number to automate this for you by including the word lastchangedrevision in your html file after where v1 appears above

3234
png	gif
i am able to display images of type gif jpeg png all i have tested so far bit trying to display .swf or .ico files gives me a nice little error

3281
python	ruby
i m wondering if there s a way to do what i can do below with python in ruby

3281
arrays	map
i have two arrays of equal sizes with the weights and data but i can t seem to find a function similar to map in ruby reduce i have working

3285
primitive-types	reference-type
1 primitive-types and 2 reference-type

3285
primitive	int
int is a primitive type and integer is a class type which is kind of reference-type

3285
primitive	int
the variables two is passed as the primitive int type 2

3290
value	field
you could add some ajax-y goodness that reads a hidden form field value requests a verification key from the server and sends that back along with the response but that will never be populate if javascript is blocked disabled

3294
abstract-methods	static-methods
a call to a static-methods is done through the class name not through an object reference and the il code to call it will call the abstract-methods through the name of the class that defined it not necessarily the name of the class you used

3294
constructor	object
if you had class types like in delphi where you can make a variables referring to a type and not an object you would have more use for virtual and thus abstract static-methods and also constructor but they aren t available and thus static calls are non-virtual in .net

3315
ienumerator	ienumerable
but of course the compiler spits its dummy because foreach expects an ienumerable rather than an ienumerator

3318
enumerator	any
the collect methods which can be applied to any enumerator object

3345
enumerator	iteration
if you return ienumerator it will be a different enumerator object each time call that methods acting as though you reset the enumerator on each iteration

3368
time-complexity	big-o
big-o gives the upper bound for time-complexity of an algorithm

3437
http	ssl
will the maps api work over ssl http

3445
updating	updates
edit if the value you are updating aren t coming from somewhere else in the database you ll need to issue multiple updates queries

3448
markup	xhtml
i ve noticed a lot of sites so include use xhtml as their markup language and then fail to adhere to the spec

3448
markup	xhtml
so should tools and developers use the xhtml doctype if they are going to produce invalid markup

3454
python	perl
longer term i would probably use pl perl or pl python as i use perl for quick scripting and have been looking at python for a while now

3455
parallels	vmware
another option is vmware fusion which is much better than parallels in my opinion + windows-xp + sql-server management studio

3457
firefox	safari
so long as it works in ie firefox safari insert other browser here you should be okay

3464
double	int
in java the primitive wrappers classes like int double float boolean.

3464
getter	setter
so that this classes only has getter methods no setter besides the constructor

3485
getter	setter
i can be wrong because i m autodidact but i never user public properties in my java clases they are allways private or protected so that outside code must access by getter setter

3485
getter	setter
if getter methods is trivial i use the property directly but i allways use the setter methodss because i could easily add code to fire events if i wish

3486
rewrite	rule
i implements a rewrite rule in the .htaccess file that says

3492
markup	xhtml
all of that said to answer your specific question it s probably not worthwhile to use one of the xhtml doctypes unless you plan to produce valid or at least well-formed markup

3511
multiplication	addition
according to bodmas multiplication should always be done before addition therefore 17 is actually the correct answer according to bodmas and will also be the answer which your calculator will give if you type in 2 + 3 x 5

3513
sql-server	mysql
i m not sure of the sql-server syntax for this but in mysql i would do

3530
rake-task	rakefile
i have a rakefile with a rake-task that i would normally call from the command-line

3544
installation	building
you have to building it again for cd installation for when the end user dosn t have internet

3546
sql-server	oracle
the java-based oracle sql developer has a plugin module that supports sql-server

3546
sql-server	mysql
it will have pointers to the jar files for mysql sql-server etc

3548
required	checked
another option is to checked the user-agent string for known bots this may required code modification

3580
deployment	install
you can skirt this to some extent by creating install for the components however with clickonce deployment you have to create the logic to update said component install

3603
mbunit	nunit
we use nunit and mbunit here

3610
selected	checkbox
i also selected the checkbox to wait for the script to finish.

3611
webserver	upload
i m trying to write some php to upload a file to a folder on my webserver

3611
dump	temp
warning move_uploaded_file function.move-uploaded-file unable to move c windows temp phpa30e.tmp to . test.txt in e inetpub vhosts mywebsite.com httpdocs dump upload.php on line 3

3617
dump	temp
warning move_uploaded_file function.move-uploaded-file unable to move c windows temp phpa30e.tmp to . people.xml in e inetpub vhosts mywebsite.com httpdocs dump upload.php on line 3

3739
administration	account
i can get the windows privileges by simply configuring the timer service to use an account which is a member of local administration

3739
credentials	account
the only possible solution here seems to be to run the timer service under its usual networkservice windows account and to run stsadm as a local administrator by storing the administrator credentials somewhere and passing them to system.diagnostics.process.run trough the starinfo s username domain and password

3739
administration	account
the local administration user is my account and when i just run stsadm interactive under this account everything is ok

3776
hide	show
once they are added they could be flipped through using hide show or bringtofront sendtoback methods

3777
postback	ajax
well if you don t want to do it using ajax or any other way and just want a normal asp.net postback to happen here is how you do it without using any other libraries

3790
put	get
what i want to know is if there s some kind of redistributable that can be packaged with our software to allow 64-bit users to get the wmi installer provider put onto their machines

3793
contains	elements
the elements might contains either xhtml or text but i just want its contents in string form

3795
hide	show
why not just show hide the proper containers when a node is selected in the grid

3799
contains	elements
so if the body elements contains only text it works but if it contains xhtml i get all the text concatenated together but none of the tags

3829
xcopy	cmd
powershell scripts might be useful too and surely more flexible than xcopy and other dos cmd

3831
internet-explorer	firefox
this seems to work well for internet-explorer but seems to fail with firefox

3862
push	pull
distributed vcs let everyone have their own server where you can pull changes from other people and push changes to a server

3869
perforce	git
my recommendation you re safest with either git svn or perforce since a lot of people use them they are cross platform have good guis you can buy books about them etc

3881
illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception
i have always been torn in this situation should i throw an illegalargumentexception or a nullpointerexception

3886
illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception
it seems like an illegalargumentexception is called for if you don t want null to be an allowed value and the nullpointerexception would be thrown if you were trying to use a variables that turns out to be null

3895
bazaar	git
please do not use git or hg or bazaar because of the hype

3895
bazaar	git
use git or hg or bazaar because they are better tools for managing source code than svn

3902
select	union
does it apply only to the last select in the union

3902
aggregate	grouping
does mysql actually allow you to grouping by a column and still not do aggregate on the other columns

3911
32-bit	64bit
ask yourself the questions 1 - is the registry entry concerned properly documented by ms 2 - if it is do they provide a definitive list of possible values that is guaranteed to permit you as a developer to make the informed decision between whether you are running 32-bit or 64bit

3979
mbunit	nunit
i used to use nunit but i switched to mbunit since it has more features

4004
httplistener	http
created a working httplistener in c# that works for http connections

4004
any	set
debugging in visual-studio shows that the listener callback that receives the requests never gets hit when the http connection starts - i don t see any place that i could set a breakpoint to catch anything else earlier

4052
having	select
the problem i am having is that when i have my table open in design view and select manage fulltext index

4080
static-code-analysis	pmd
static-code-analysis tools findbugs pmd and any others

4080
cobertura	emma
code coverage tools cobertura emma and any others

4098
textmate	emacs
you can try emacs with ruby-mode rinari for ruby-on-rails and yasnippet which provides automatic snippets like textmate

4104
directory	folder
will merge any files changed in the revision 67212 in the folder trunk on the repository and merge them into your current working directory

4157
checkbox	button
as the user changes settings using the app s user-interface clicking checkbox choosing radio button etc. i plan to be writing those changes out to the appsettings

4164
joomla	drupal
i don t need anything as feature-rich or fancy as drupal or joomla

4192
double-pointer	pointers
you can still use the double-pointer because you probably want to do manipulations on the data structure not the pointer to pointers of data structures

4221
gridview	listview
i m going to use the linqdatasource with the listview control not a gridview or repeater

4231
linqdatasource	gridview
i know that if you use a paging repeater or gridview with the linqdatasource it will automatically optimize the number of results returned but i m also pretty sure in the datasource wizard you can go to advanced options and limit it to

4249
perl	ruby
there s no point in recommending a perl or php framework if your language of choice is ruby

4249
joomla	drupal
what s wrong with joomla or drupal

4299
command-line	cmd
another option would be to write a command-line app that read the database for cmd to run

4305
shared-hosting	mediatemple
something like mediatemple - which won t host the worlds fastest websites but for the price is far better than shared-hosting

4306
short	zero
in short i need to keep tracking of a relatively small number of value usually a value of 1 and in rare cases more than 1 in a sea of zero in the matrix multidimensional arrays

4312
simpletest	phpunit
i like php so phpunit or simpletest work well

4318
constructor	object
you don t really need a mock object framework just extend the class of the functionality you don t want to worry about in your test and make sure the class you are testing can use your mock instead of the real thing pass it in via a constructor or setter or something

4347
wxwidgets	mfc
i have experience writing console and network client-server applications in c and c++ but i know next to nothing about using the win32 visual api mfc qt wxwidgets etc

4389
python	java
from the site doxygen is a documentation system for c++ c java objective-c python idl corba and microsoft flavors fortran vhdl php c# and to some extent d.

4390
python	java
it works for c++ c java objective-c python idl corba and microsoft flavors fortran vhdl php c# and to some extent d.

4391
python	ruby
in a dynamically-typed language such as python ruby or javascript you can generally just attach the methods onto arbitrary object or class and pass that as the parameter -- so a framework would add much less value

4404
select	union
i added a union to the select and wiped out some views as well

4408
httpd.conf	.htaccess
another solution would be to set an include path in your httpd.conf or an .htaccess file

4422
bug-tracking	workitem
keep in mind that tfs include bug-tracking workitem tracking and other features beyond source control

4444
32-bit	64bit
whatever you do don t go 32-bit there are no advantages to 32-bit over 64bit

4455
put	get
i get that you re mocking the ianimals seeing as apparently you don t yet have any concrete animals to play with but why not just make them stubs because obviously you re not expecting anything else to happen to them apart from being put into the list

4505
pascal	basic
in my case i d done computer science at uni learned pascal and cobol there and learned basic at home before that but i never really got anywhere with it until i became a self-employed web designer back in the 90s and my clients needed functionality on their web sites and were willing to pay about 10x more for functionality than for design

4505
perl	php
so i learned perl then asp vbscript then javascript then flash actionscript then php - all in order to make the stuff i wanted to happen

4519
windows-xp	windows
i have the xming x windows server installed on a laptop running windowss-xp to connect to some unix development servers

4586
pentaho	olap
i m not completely familiar with the implications of step 2 in your approach above but if you re looking for a more robust olap solution it might be worth your while to check out mondrian the open-source olap analysis services module of pentaho

4592
value	field
just a thought but remember to handle comma s and quotation marks in the field value otherwise your csv file may break the consumers reader

4597
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is not the same as wpf

4597
silverlight	wpf
silverlight is web-specific and only has a subset of wpf s features

4627
versioning	upgrade
is it possible to upgrade my asp.net webserver to versioning 3.x of the .net

4634
value	field
obviously the second form is cleaner when you are just checking one field against a list of possible value

4670
bazaar	git
so i want to get a project on a distributed version control system such as mercurial git or bazaar

4678
hash	md5
md5 and sha1 are typical hash algorithms

4684
virtual-machine	vmware
i have never tried automating a virtual-machine but i saw that both vmware and virtual server offer automation facilities

4691
tunnel	vpn
another option that is often useful as it works over a vpn or simple ssh connect is ssh tunnel or x11 forwarding over ssh

4692
folder	dir
it lets me cd to a drive called feed and navigate around folder and feeds using cd and dir

4703
revision	updates
we have checkout folders from our repo as the staging and live sites so once you ve committed the changes from your working copy you can be 100 sure that the files you test push to staging and then live are the same because you just run svn updates on each box and check the revision number

4703
revision	updates
oh and if you need to roll back in a hurry it happens to us all sometime or another you just run svn updates again with the -r switch and go back to a previous revision virtually instantly

4706
virtual-machine	vmware
with vmware there is the virtual-machine automation apis vix api

4706
vmware	esx
it works with vmware server and workstation but afaik it s not available for esx server

4706
vbscript	basic
com visual basic vbscript c#

4725
python	ruby
also i want to add even if you find places where lisp will make sense you will probably not convince anyone else that it should be used over java c++ c# python ruby etc

4744
common-lisp	lisp
okay i might be weird but i really don t like paul graham s essays that much on lisp is a really rough going book if you don t have some grasp of common-lisp already

4755
scheme	lisp
two semesters ago i used scheme a language based on lisp to write an interactive program that simulated abbott and costello s who s on first routine

4755
scheme	lisp
in summary learning lisp or scheme may not yield many practical applications beyond ai but it is an extremely valuable learning experience as many others have stated

4768
tunnel	vpn
x11 forwarding with ssh is secure and uses the existing ssh connection to tunnel so working through a vpn should be no problem

4768
x11-forwarding	xming
if you open your connection from within xming the plink option i believe it sets up x11-forwarding by default

4897
keydown	keyup
each time keyup or keydown is fired updates the reference to the active selected item in the data structure

4897
highlight	selected
to provide highlight information on the user-interface add or remove a class name that is styled via css based on if the item is active selected or not

4908
sql-server	oracle
you need more scalability or better performance - say from sqlite to sql-server or oracle

4911
authentication	login
one option i like is to use the email address of the user as login but how to i make asp.net authentication system use an email address instead of a user name

4924
checkbox	button
one method you can used to obtain this option is by placing a checkbox object and changing its appearance from normal to button this will give you the same functionality that i believe you are looking for

4932
primitive	int
further edit the reason the second option would print int is because there is no widening into a larger primitive as an option so it must box it up thus int is the only option

4937
emacs	vim
vim or emacs varying on religion will always be my first answer to this question over any point-and-click ide

4942
ruby	php
when asked to create system xyz and you ask to do it in python over php or ruby what are the main features you can mention when they require you to explain it

5014
ruby	php
i m only talking about web development because it appears that s what you are going to be working on seeing ruby python and php in the same list

5025
sql-server	mysql
previous we had a sql-server and a mysql database running to run our site

5030
scalability	high-load
however if you find your application isn t scaling or you are designing an application that has high-load or scalability requirements and your research tells you your current database platform is weak in that area or as was already mentioned you need some spatial analysis or feature that a particular database has well there you go

5036
emacs	vim
if you are taking your time switching to linux i d switch to emacs or vim at some point as well

5036
emacs	vim
the key with either vim or emacs is knowing it could probably take you the better part of the day just to figure out what you want them to do let alone how to get them to do that

5071
cvs	git
do you guys know any way to recursively add everything in a given directory to the current cvs project or if svn or git makes this notably easier

5078
ruby	php
i d like to set up a cheap linux box as a web server to host a variety of web technologies php java ee come to mind but i d like to experiment with ruby or python in the future as well

5087
ruby-on-rails	grails
now that my company is jumping into grails i bought the agile web development with rails 3rd ed - beta and i m starting to get into ruby-on-rails

5087
ruby-on-rails	grails
should i be learning ruby-on-rails and have a more versatile language in my portfolio knowing that my ruby-on-rails knowledge will be useful for my grails needs as well

5087
python	ruby
should i just skip ror and focus on learning grails that i ll be needing for work soon and work on learning ror django ruby python later

5087
python	ruby
and this while trying to avoid the centennial discussion of python vs ruby on rails

5090
ubuntu-server	ubuntu
on that note albeit this thread will potentially dwindle down to just flaming my suggestion for your personal server is to stick to anything ubuntu get ubuntu-server here

5091
primitive	int
so you see the compiler has created the instruction integer.valueof int to box the primitive inside the wrapper

5095
ruby-on-rails	grails
you should just skip ruby-on-rails and focus on learning grails that you ll be needing for work

5103
background-image	height
the best way is to put the left and right cols inside a wrapper div float the left and right cols and then float the wrapper - this makes it stretch to the height of the inner containers - then set background-image on the outer wrapper

5110
authentication	login
if you do make sure to disable root login you can always su or sudo once you get in and consider more aggressive authentication methods within reason

5125
ruby-on-rails	grails
comparing just only views taglibs in grails rhtml in ruby-on-rails and the persistence stuff gorm vs activerecord is just too different in the core to invest time learning the nitty gritty details of ruby-on-rails

5129
pylons	django
the simplest would be to use cgi and write normal python scripts while the second is using a web framework like django or pylons

5132
groovy	java
just a bit of a question is the reason they are choosing grails because groovy is closer in syntax to java than ruby or because they want access to java

5301
perl	ruby
i am specifically thinking of ruby but i m sure they borrowed it from elsewhere probably perl

5320
perl	ruby
there s a particularly good port for python wxpython as well as versions for different languages -- c# c++ perl and ruby come to mind -- and for various guis win32 mac os x gtk+ x11 motif wince

5336
versioning	migrate
the benefit there is that you can easily migrate up or down to any specific versioning

5343
perl	ruby
bindings exist for ada qtada 4 c # qyoto kimono 5 java qt jambi 6 pascal perl php php-qt ruby rubyqt and python pyqt

5357
implements	extends
i don t know how java is implements internally but if the constructor of the superclass throws an exception-handling then there isn t a instances of the class you extends

5357
tostring	equals
it would be impossible to call the tostring or equals methods for example since they are inherited in most cases

5360
derived-class	subclass
i can t presume to have a deep understanding of java internals but it is my understanding that when a compiler needs to instantiate a derived-class it has to first create the base and its base before that ... and then slap on the extensions made in the subclass

5360
constructor	object
when you try to do something in the subclass constructor before the base class constructor you are basically asking the compiler to extend a base object instance that doesn t exist yet

5382
boolean	int
they re called bitwise but they are defined for both int and boolean data types in c#

5428
maintainability	conventions
is it worth learning the conventions or is it a bane to reliability and maintainability

5445
double	int
it is pointless and distracting but is in relatively heavy use at my company at least for types like int strings booleans and double

5462
versioning	upgrade
the times i ve run into headaches using cs is when the client wants functionality cs does not provide but also insists on keeping the ability to upgrade to the latest versioning whenever telligent releases an update

5474
search-engine	seo
latimes.com keeps getting better at seo search-engine optimization which means our stories are ranking higher in google and other search-engines

5488
button	popup
if you are using a button or hyperlink or something to trigger the popup to show could you also add an additional handler to the onclick event of the trigger which should still fire the modal popup and run the javascript at the same time

5494
external	host
external incoming requests will be using the host header portal.mycompany.com and be forced to use ssl

5494
any	set
any recommendations for how to set this up

5513
low-level	hardware
i think it benefits to learn low-level as in c as you gain a better understanding of the hardware architecture and how all that stuff works

5600
lookup	any
i ve seen some people suggest that tables should have an auto-incrementing identity int as a clustered primary key even if it doesn t have any meaning as it means that the database engine itself can use that value to quickly lookup a row instead of having to use a bookmark

5605
web-services	api
i know that rtm has its api exposed as web-services

5607
any	set
with identity page fill factors is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to 100 - rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one

5617
background-color	height
fake the equal height by setting the background-color for the column on the container instead with repeat-y

5621
rad-controls	telerik
rad-controls by telerik is pretty good

5635
moss	wss
if by wss application you mean a sharepoint or moss site there are no free full-featured ajax libraries that are specifically designed for moss

5635
rad-controls	telerik
telerik s rad-controls are far from free 1000usd per developer seat but their richtext editor has a moss-specific version

5703
enumerator	any
will not execute any of the code you wrote in the enumerator

5712
silverlight	wpf
the disadvantage is that you can t leverage things like databinding which is really powerful in frameworks like wpf and silverlight

5721
textbox	button
i use hungarian naming for user-interface elements like button textbox and lables

5721
silverlight	wpf
however after doing more and more silverlight and wpf stuff leveraging data binding i don t even name all my controls anymore since i don t have to reference them from code-behind since there really isn t any codebehind anymore

5724
command-line	cmd
is there a better windows command-line shell other than cmd which has better copy paste between windows windows and console windows

5726
command-line	cmd
windows powershell is the obvious choice when it comes to better windows command-line shell other than cmd

5726
click	mouse
its clipboard handling isn t that much of an improvement - mark with the mouse enter to copy or right mouse click to paste

5736
any	set
a drill is to ask them to implement a simple bytecode based virtual-machine in any language they chose python works great for this with an instruction set focussed on pointer operations load store direct indirect addressing

5754
constructor	object
when you initialize the house object the name given to the constructor is copied into the private field fname

5756
linux	bsd
another thing to keep in mind is that the system call interface on mac os x is different from what you might be used to on dos windows linux or the other bsd flavors

5810
visualsvn-server	fogbugz
if you download visualsvn-server which is free you get a httpserver for your source code and can thus use the fogbugz scripting for integration the two

5820
linux	bsd
another if you re on linux bsd etc

5823
keyboard	mouse
take command does support copy cut paste from the keyboard and the mouse

5837
expression	evaluation
when you use isnothing it actually makes a call to that methods as opposed to just evaluation the expression

5842
ms-access	mysql
i moved the tables from a simple ms-access database to mysql using its migration toolkit which works well by the way and set up access to link to those tables via odbc

5842
ms-access	mysql
autonumber fields in ms-access must be the primary key or they ll just end up as integer columns in mysql natch why wouldn t it be the pk

5847
sql-server	mysql
i ve never used the tool but it might be worth using with sql-server 2005 express edition to see if there are the same issues as you had with mysql

5863
.net	wcf
i m just getting into creating some wcf services but i have a requirement to make them backward compatible for legacy .net 1.1 and 2.0 client applications

5872
directory	folder
i m getting tired of making a branch and then going through the branch and deleting all of the .svn folder the docs directory and my prototyping files

5887
directory	folder
right click the root project folder tortoisesvn export and tell it where you want the .svn free directory

5903
communication	messages
the error messages indicates that the communication exception-handling class was an instances of #2 above -- perhaps it s used somewhere that windows.h hasn t been loaded

5912
hosts-file	hosts
what does your hosts look like

5923
code-folding	textmate
i use textmate mac only which has code-folding and i find it really useful for folding functions i know what my getget function does i don t need it taking up 10 lines of oh so valuable screen spaces

5923
if-statement	for-loop
i never use it to hide a for-loop if-statement or similar unless showing the code to someone else where i will hide code they have seen to avoid showing the same code twice

5943
for-loop	loops
the reasoning is that you have n iterations in the for-loop and o 1 work in side loops

5958
having	select
sometimes there is a need to do bulk inserts and having a uuid makes this very difficult usually requiring writing a cursor instead of a simple select into statement

5974
revision	updates
gradonmantank because he wants that file to be updates with the latest revision number

5997
getter	setter
in my form class i wouldn t think twice about using getter and maybe setter around this even if they didn t do anything other than provide direct access to the variables

5997
getter	setter
however the vs designer doesn t seem to implements such getter setter for those public objects that are components on a form and therefore does not comply with good programming practice

5997
getter	setter
in order to do the right thing should i wrap such vs designer components or objects in a getter and or setter

6003
getter	setter
i always do that and if you are following an mvp design creating getter setter for your view components would be a design requirement

6003
getter	setter
microsoft violates a lot of good programming practices to make it easier to create stuff on visual-studio for the sake of rapid app development and i do not see the lack of getter setter for controls as evidence of violating any such best practices

6005
getter	setter
the reason for not implements getters and setter for components on a form i believe is cause they wouldn t be thread safe .net objects are suppose to be only modified by the form thread that created them if you put on getter and setter you are potentially opening it up for any thread

6014
revision	svn
the general idea i have in mind is create one that before the commit will put the new revision number in the file get it using svnlook or maybe change a bogus property on the file it has to change or svn will ignore it

6018
getter	setter
however the vs designer doesn t seem to implements such getter setter for those public objects that are components on a form and therefore does not comply with good programming practice

6018
instances	private
if you mean the controls you re dragging and dropping onto the form these are marked as private instances members and are added to the form s controls collection

6018
getter	setter
the designer leaves it up to you to provide delegated access to specific controls via public getter setter

6020
required	checked
if you required a specific set of settings for dev test production settings checked in separate files with those settings as gatekiller stated with some sort of naming convention though i usually go with web.prod.config as not to change the file-extension

6076
object-reference	instances
if i do it in firefox i get an alert box saying object-reference not set to an instances of an a object

6079
cvs	git
all the source control systems i ve used cvs subversion git will handle binary files as well as text

6086
configuration	environment
my team keeps separate versions of the configuration files for each environment web.configuration.dev web.configuration.test web.configuration.prod

6086
configuration	environment
this way we have full version-control on the configuration files for each environment can easily perform a diff etc

6095
hide	show
public methods or properties are behavior show hide positioning or data-oriented set data get data update data

6099
required	checked
the source control tool s diff algorithm probably won t handle it efficiently but it s likely to required less spaces than checked in an opaque binary database file

6100
ruby	php
languages like python ruby and php make it easier to work with rest

6109
silverlight	wpf
in wpf and silverlight the binding infrastructure takes care of the switching to the ui thread

6113
webforms	asp.net
the data dll is used by both asp.net webforms and vb.net winforms

6113
authentication	impersonation
i don t think impersonation will work because we can t authentication the user through the firewall

6120
any	set
set a threshold score such that any matchscore threshold will not be considered a match for a given companyname

6125
dictionary	arrays
if you don t want to use sqlite you could do an arrays of dictionary

6135
variables	boolean
i ll often split these up into component boolean variables

6151
tfs-workitem	workitem
i m trying to customize some tfs-workitem via the vs2008 xml editor but every time i open a workitem xml file it jumps to the graphical designer

6159
variables	boolean
if you happen to be programming in python it s a cinch with the built-in all function applied over the list of your variables i ll just use boolean literals here

6174
textbox	button
call me crazy but why not put plus and minus button at either side of the textbox control and simply prevent the textbox from receiving cursor focus thereby creating your own cheap numericupdown control

6184
callback	methods
when you subscribe to an event on an object from within a form you are essentially handing over control of your callback methods to the event source

6188
firefox	safari
standards based and works in ie6 safari firefox opera etc

6189
callback	methods
just use this simple coding model in all your callback methods and you can be sure that things are going to be okay

6192
malloc	free
the inefficient malloc free backend

6193
expression	evaluation
the second expression will typically stop being evaluated as soon as one of the conditions is false which can be a big performance improvement if evaluation the conditions is expensive

6199
command-line	cmd
use the export cmd to export to a folder called export in the same directory as a file called deploy.bat then i run the deploy script v1 stands for version 1 which is what version i am currently on in this project this script utilizes 7-zip which i have placed on my system path so i can use it as a cmd-line utility

6208
background-color	display
the background-color isn t display it s set in the stylesheet

6222
32-bit	64bit
currently i run the normal eclipse 3.4 distribution on a 32-bit jdk and launch compile my apps with a 64bit jdk

6223
concatenation	comma
alternatively split them on the comma then post-parse the resulting arrays into another arrays checking for leading quotes on each arrays entry and concatenation the entries until i reached a terminating quote

6285
firefox	safari
if safari and firefox support is good enough for you there is a css solution

6309
unsigned	integer
typically integer values are signed unless you explicitly need an unsigned value

6371
versioning	upgrade
a follow-up question how do you track database versioning so you know which scripting to run to upgrade a given database instance

6378
put	get
i m starting to get the feeling that each of these client implement different parts of the standard and i m unsure of what pieces of information we should be trying to export from the application so that someone can put it on their calendar especially around recurrence

6382
versioning	upgrade
these scripting will upgrade the current production database to the new versioning in development

6405
malloc	free
just malloc a new buffer return that and let the caller decide whether or not to free the old text

6424
constructor	object
method will be slower due to the need to create the this object for the constructor

6441
firefox	safari
the following code works great in ie but not in firefox or safari

6441
selected	button
the code is supposed to disable radio button if you selected the disable 2 radio button option

6441
selected	button
it should enable the radio button if you selected the enable both radio button option

6441
click	mouse
however if you don t use your mouse to move between the 2 options enable... and disable... then the radio button do not appear to be disabled or enabled correctly until you click anywhere else on the page not on the radio button themselves

6441
firefox	safari
it works great in ie but the problem manifests itself in firefox 3 in my case and safari all on windows-xp

6456
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari document.frm in your code evaluates to undefined

6463
directory	folder
flubba does this allow me to have folder inside my include directory

6467
decrement	increment
i m using a function to increment a day and another to decrement

6471
solaris	aix
at least it didn t worked in aix and solaris

6474
python	perl
why not write your scripts using a language like perl or python instead which more naturally supports complex date processing

6474
python	perl
sure you can do it all in bash but i think you will also get more consistency across platforms using python for example so long as you can ensure that perl or python is installed

6474
python	perl
i should add that it is quite easy to wire in python and perl scripts into a containing shell script

6531
constructor	private
however this latter technique is useful if you want each copy to have it s own copy the main use of that being to do private privileges methods which have access to private variables declared inside the constructor and inherited via the closure mechanism

6543
implements	sealed
is there a way to implements a sealed class from an interface.

6566
interpreter	runtime
maybe it should be a tunable runtime parameter in the interpreter

6573
flotr	flot
i noticed that a few people mentioned flot but nobody mentioned flotr

6578
malloc	free
i m reasonably comfortable with c s malloc and free concept but cocoa s references counting scheme has me rather confused

6606
exception-handling	error-handling
beyond that most changes were improvements to things like error-handling to take advantage of exception-handling and php classes

6614
malloc	free
the basic way this differs from malloc and free is that any given object doesn t need to worry about other parts of the system crashing because you ve freed memory they were using

6646
integer	digits
i ve done some more tests and found that if an arrays index or key is made up of only digits it s always converted to an integer otherwise it s a string

6651
bazaar	git
there s a nice comparison between git hg and bazaar in this infoq article

6658
testng	junit
we have been considering switching over to junit 4 for new tests being written but i have been keeping an eye on testng for a while now

6658
testng	junit
what experiences have you all had with either junit 4 or testng and which seems to work better for very large numbers of tests

6659
testng	junit
but i would recommend unitils a great wrapper for junit testng dbunit easymock regardless of which route you take

6660
flotr	flot
if you re looking for client-side check out flotr which is based on prototype javascript library or flot which is based on jquery

6661
onmousedown	onchange
i m aware of things like onchange onmousedown and onmouseup but is there a good reference somewhere that lists all of them complete with possibly a list of the elements that they cover

6662
javascript	dom
w3schools seems to have a good javascript events reference html dom events

6671
testng	junit
testng strives to be much more configurable than junit but in the end they both work equally well

6683
jfreechart	visualize
i ve used jfreechart in a rather complex application that needed to visualize data streams and calculations based on the data

6693
arguments	default
i don t think there is any need for a meta tag unless you want to manually override the default favicon but i was unable to find any research to support my arguments

6720
webforms	asp.net
i m pretty sure i ve only used master pages in the context of asp.net mvc so i m not sure if it differs from webforms but in my experience they are not only excellent but i couldn t imagine not using them

6726
parsing	comma
however the code does very simple parsing not taking into account quoted or escaped comma and it does not account for possible absent data

6735
environment	building
they are extremely useful especially in a cms environment and for large sites and as mattmitchell says it s inconceivable that you would building a large site without them

6765
wicket	spring
i am really fond of technologies that java offers - particularly spring and wicket and i am quite familiar with java from others projects and assignments before

6778
firefox	safari
the background renders correctly in firefox and safari however as soon as you use the browser s scroll bar then mouse over the flash control you must click once to activate the control

6813
duplicates	contains
if your data file contains all your records it includes records that do not have dupicate ids within the file you could pre-process it and produce a file that only contains records that have duplicates ids

6824
string.format	stringbuilder
string.format uses a stringbuilder internally

6824
benchmarking	profiling
but it s a guess try benchmarking and or profiling the two to get a proper comparison

6854
png	ico
i like the free silk icons at famfamfam but they re png s and when i convert them to ico format they look pretty crappy

6866
attributes	properties
it s much easier to go back later and introduce methods attributes and properties for which are asked versus anticipating something that may never come

6884
string.format	stringbuilder
i ran some quick performance benchmarking and for 100 000 operations averaged over 10 runs the first methods stringbuilder takes almost half the time of the second string.format

6906
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
pure .net in visual-studio is better than win32 obviously but developing against the mono libraries perhaps using the sharpdevelop ide is probably an even better approach

6916
debugging	trace
it is much better to have readable code with easy debugging capabilities ie not hiding the stack trace rather than make something run a nanosecond faster

6932
flv	mp3
i d like to do something like youtube or google video where users can upload whatever format they want and i encode it to flv mp3 and or mp4

6940
any	set
basically i can right-click on any windows and set always on top

6943
primitive	int
furthermore as matt acknowledges he uses an int as a lock rather than an os primitive

6943
compare-and-swap	atomicity
if your operating system offers appropriate primitive and if you absolutely need it for performance instead of doing this type of locking initialization you can use an atomicity compare-and-swap operation to initialize a shared global-variables

6947
erlang	scala
jvm has scala which has actors very much like erlang and is functional hybrid language

6950
keyboard	mouse
the left monitor is actually a separate computer running linux and keyboard mouse shared with synergy so i have multiple ebooks or documentation pages open one on each virtual desktop.

6955
compare-and-swap	atomicity
edit chris s suggestion to use an atomicity compare-and-swap would certainly work

6969
libavcodec	ffmpeg
ffmpeg can do it its a command-line tool that uses the libavcodec

7031
hide	show
using javascript to show and hide button and php to check to see which button to show

7035
ubuntu	linux
i m writing a few little bash scripts under ubuntu linux

7035
gksudo	sudo
so far the only input required is a password for sudo - and gksudo handles that fine

7039
.when	ready
.when you re able to do that and you understand what you ve written you re ready to go onto the more fun stuff

7076
code-coverage	emma
unwinding that assumption can be tedious. emma is a classloader that does byte-code re-writing for code-coverage collection in java

7080
stderr	stdout
the following will silence both stdout and stderr

7080
stderr	stdout
the following silences stdout but stderr will still appear via stdout

7087
required	checked
the security feature is checked on the server that the visitor is logged in before each action that required it

7087
hide	show
if you don t intend to show the button it s not useful to send the html and images to the browser and then hide them with javascript

7090
ghostscript	imagemagick
imagemagick delegates the pdf- bitmap conversion to ghostscript anyway so here s a command you can use it s based on the actual command listed by the ps alpha delegate in imagemagick just adjusted to use jpeg as output

7097
getter	setter
in the book he talks about how to handle mutable objects that callers pass to your code in setter and mutable objects that you pass to callers in getter

7098
google-chrome	safari
if you are using a browser that doesn t implement border-radius google-chrome pre-v4 firefox pre-v4 ie8 opera pre-v10.5 safari pre-v5 then the links below detail a whole bunch of different approaches

7099
firefox	safari
although this works ok in the latest versions of safari and firefox but not at all in ie7 and i don t think in ie8 or opera

7101
order	join
if you just need all of the work started in the loop to finish before the code continues but you don t care about the order the work within the loop finishes then calling join is the answer

7118
internet-explorer	safari
currently i don t really have a good method of debugging javascript in internet-explorer and safari

7138
any	set
i am not any sort of networking expert so the solution would need to be really easy to set up maintain and use

7147
click	mouse
if you ve got an osx server lying around somewhere the very same openvpn can be set up with about four mouse click tho

7151
redirecttoaction	actionlink
unlike ruby-on-rails url_for anchor urlhelper.generateurl and actionlink redirecttoaction and so on which use it don t have a magic property name that lets you encode an anchor

7156
openvpn	ipsec
watchguards use a fairly standard ipsec vpn so there s a number of ways of getting linux mac to connect to them - openswan is one you can also use openvpn or racoon iirc although i wouldn t promise that any of these will be entirely straightforward

7190
ncover	nant
we are currently looking at configuring cruisecontrol.net to work with nant nunit ncover and trac as a test case

7192
coalesce	isnull
using coalesce or isnull for that matter as show in the link in lance s post uses a similar methods but doesn t leave you with an extra comma to remove

7206
internet-explorer	safari
there is now a firebug lite that works on other browsers such as internet-explorer safari and opera built

7212
methods	extend
which is to say i d like to extend a generated class with a single methods not via inheritance but via the prototype

7217
codedom	.net
using .net s codedom we compile the scripts from the database using the vb codedomprovider annoyingly it defaults to .net 2 if you want to support 3.5 features you need to pass a dictionary with compilerversion v3.5 to its constructor

7221
ncover	fxcop
we use cruisecontrol.net with nunit ncover fxcop svn and some custom tools we wrote ourselves to produce the reports

7222
safari	opera
this is the firebug lite that john was referring to that works on ie safari and opera

7225
display	width
you can adjust the scrollbar width in display properties and it will affect all windows on the terminal

7257
double	int
as you have a string i d look at whether you need to know that it s an int rather than a double

7257
double	int
if int.tryparse passes then so will double.tryparse so you could half the number of checks - return either double or string and floor the doubles when you expect an int

7281
integer	zero
if the remainder is zero for any number in the list then the integer is not prime

7292
spaces	output
the real problem is that most applications that output your xml into a readable format consider all whitespaces in an xml interchangable and might collapse those linebreaks into a single spaces

7343
directory	folder
i m not in a position to modify the permissions on folders especially outside of the virtual directory home folder and don t already have an app_data folder so am a bit hesitant to go with that

7345
directory	folder
i m not in a position to modify the permissions on folders especially outside of the virtual directory home folder and don t already have an app_data folder so am a bit hesitant to go with that

7348
compact-framework	.net
support .net compact-framework 2.0 and windows mobile 6.0 devices

7367
attributes	properties
the problem is that the base class properties dropdownitems has a default attributes set on it that is a different value not 50

7367
attributes	properties
obviously if i were creating my own custom properties in the subclass i could give it its own designer default attributes of whatever i wanted

7385
boolean	int
darren that would work if the types were specific enumerations - for general enumerations to work you have to cast them to int or more likely uint to do the boolean math

7398
automake	gnu
i haven t seen any questions relating to gnu autoconf automake builds but i m hoping at least some of you out there are familiar with it

7399
attributes	properties
in your derived class you need to either override or shadow using new the properties in question and then re-apply the default value attributes

7455
contains	any
it does not contains any information about the layout intent of those primitive

7489
textbox	button
i ve made many different seperate parts of a gui system for the nintendo ds like button and textbox and select boxes but i need a way of containing these classes in one gui class so that i can draw everything to the screen all at once and check all the button at once to check if any are being pressed

7489
textbox	button
my question is what is the best way organize all the classes such as button and textbox into one gui class

7540
processor	cpu
i would like to be able to see what tabs are using what percent of my processor via the javascript on that page or anything in the page that is causing cpu memory usage

7550
decimal-point	digits
if i m understanding you correctly it sounds like you re expecting the mathcontext to control how many digits should be kept after the decimal-point

7551
.net	wcf
if it matters we would be using wcf with pox json serialized messages for our rest api s services built using v3.5 of the .net

7561
output	mode
you can see that both the precision and the rounding mode affect the output

7562
http	ssl
the simpler approach is http basic auth over ssl

7566
pointers	stack
make sure you aren t returning any references or pointers to objects on the stack

7642
constructor	private
in c# you could call the private field foo the property foo and refer to the private field as this.foo in the constructor

7644
any	set
at the end of the day being consistent will make your code much more readable and maintainable than using any set of right conventions

7665
shell	bash
unfortunately shell have a tendency to try to hide the existence of symlinks from the user this is bash on os x

7669
stdout	stdio
it opens a console then shoves the right handles into stdout and stdin so the debugging function which was designed as a stdio interactive function can interact with the newly created console

7678
any	set
i don t think there s one set of absolute guidelines on any of these

7682
stderr	stdout
msvcrt tries to emulate the unix handle numbers where stdin 0 stdout 1 stderr 2 and so on

7687
attributes	properties
the attributes is a representation of singular properties of an entity

7707
contains	elements
i have an elements which may contains very big amounts of data but i don t want it to ruin the page layout so i set max-height 100px and overflow auto hoping for scrollbar to appear when the content does not fit

7715
naming-conventions	maintainability
naming-conventions allow the development team to design discovereability and maintainability at the heart of the project

7715
organization	naming
naming is hard but in every organization there is someone who can name things and in every software team there should be someone who takes responsibility for namings standards and ensures that naming issues like sec_id sec_value and security_id get resolved early before they get baked into the project

7715
convention	standards
so what are the basic tenets of a good naming convention and standards -

7719
click	mouse
a click or move on the screen is still considered a mouse event

7719
windows-mobile	windows-ce
edit and on a side note...as windows-mobile is built of the windows-ce core which is often used for embedded desktop systems and slim terminal services clients or winterms it has support for a hardware mouse and has for a long time

7724
organization	naming
the adventureworks sample uses a very clear and consistent naming convention that uses schema names for the organization of database objects

7729
lighttpd	apache
the server-side part of this http pseudo-streaming method is fairly simple to implement for example in php as an apache module or a lighttpd module

7729
flash-media-server	wowza
streamed via rtmp to the flash player using the flash-media-server formerly called flash communication server vcs electroserver wowza pro or the open source red5 server

7748
arrays	loops
my favourite start learning to code project is the game snakes or tron because it allows you to start slow variables to store the current worm position arrays to store the worm positions if the worm is longer than one piece loops to make the worm move if switch to allow the user to change the worm s direction ...

7756
solaris	unix
the problem is that the op s data seems to be comma delimited and solaris 8 s uniq doesn t allow you any way specify the record separator so there wasn t a super clean way to do the preprocessing using standard unix tools

7756
lookup	any
i don t think it would be any faster so i m not going to lookup the exact options but you could do something like

7756
duplicates	contains
that s not very good because it executes grep for every line contains a duplicates key

7756
uniq	grep
you could probably massage the uniq output into a single regexp to feed to grep but the benefit would only be known if the op posts expected ratio of lines containing suspected duplicate keys to total lines in the file

7758
attributes	properties
xamlparseexception invalid attributes value for properties height

7829
duplicates	elements
how can i remove duplicates elements from a list or arrays

7829
unique	words
when you think the words unique or duplicates think

7829
arrays	map
my hash map _ 1 arrays

7829
iteration	elements
next skips that iteration and the loop goes to the next elements

7833
firefox	safari
however in firefox 3.0.1 and safari 3.1.2 you must click the play button twice to see the animation

7842
iteration	set
for the iteration and s log s for the sorting where s is the size of the set

7844
silverlight	wpf
hmm there might be a substantial difference between wpf en silverlight on this point

7846
ruby	php
i would like to use a language that i am familiar with - java c# ruby php c c++ although examples in any language or pseudocode are more than welcome

7856
javascript	dom
when writing your code use the javascript shell and the live xul editor from the extension developer s extension along with the dom inspector for prototyping

7856
profiling	debugging
set up a profiling for development then debugging by tweaking the source code adding logging and alert s and reloading the affected windows

7873
contentplaceholder	loginview
is there a way to hide this on the loginview as the contentplaceholder does an excellent job for this

7875
pixels	line
uses pixels height instead of line height more accurate handling of line wrap if a proportional font is used

7875
internet-explorer	firefox
tested on firefox 3 and internet-explorer 6

7886
ofstream	fopen
you could use the old-school c way and call fopen fread fclose or you could use the c++ fstream facilities ifstream ofstream or if you re using mfc use the cfile class which provides functions to accomplish actual file operations

7888
ifstream	fstream
you need to use an ifstream if you just want to read use an ofstream to write or an fstream for both

7937
selected	textbox
fogbugz actually had a pretty smart solution before v6 of turning every selected into textbox when a popup was displayed

7949
bbedit	gedit
classic menubar-based editors like winedit gedit or bbedit

7949
aquamacs	emacs
emacs and its brethren xemacs aquamacs etc

7949
textmate	emacs
emacs and textmate are also easily extensible by user-created scripts in lisp emacs or any other command-line-language textmate

7957
versioning	upgrade
when restoring backup sets from an earlier versioning of sql-server a database upgrade may be required

7958
hide	show
you can use javascript to hide the elements just before display an overlay then show them again once you re done

7958
selected	textbox
the trick of using labels or textbox instead of selected boxes during overlays is neat

8004
progress-bar	progress
what methods are available to send the progress of rsync to the parent process for display in a gui progress-bar

8004
logfile	tail
1 watch stdout 2 watch rsync.exe logfile similar to unix tail 3 watch rsync console output in memory

8042
implements	abstract
i m trying to avoid lots of levels of abstract base classes - the classes implements these models mostly already have base classes

8086
contains	set
my understanding is that you are breaking a page down into set of composite user-controls that contains other controls and you want to decide whether to use properties for setting values

8087
jdbctemplate	jdbc
in java for example common usages are jdbc calls of raw sql object relational mappers jdbctemplate spring stored-procedures etc

8092
constructor	private
using this pattern you won t have any naming conflicts with the private field and your constructor parameter in c# or vb.net

8099
oracle	mysql
i ve used this pattern for sql server mysql and oracle

8109
python	java
you can define the ui in xul+js and use back-end components written in c++ though there are python and java bridges available too

8127
continuous-integration	build-process
so my questions are is deleting the working copy a valid part of a continuous-integration build-process and how do i go about it

8135
value	field
foreach of these rows you want to do the following regex substitution s d+ d+ 1 2 and then update the field with the new value

8155
base-class	inherited
you could also make a base-class the writer must inherited

8189
environment	building
this means that there is no chance of your building environment picking up an out of date file

8189
rmdir	cmd
take a look at the rmdir cmd

8196
python	lua
both python and lua are excellent languages that are used to script a large number of applications civ4 and blender use python supreme commander uses lua etc

8196
python	c++
if you are using c++ check out the boost python library

8216
populate	row
well if it s a csv and it this is a one time process open up the file in excel and then write formulas to populate your data in any way you desire and then write a simple concat formula to construct your sql and then copy that formula for every row

8249
fseek	ftell
change the definition to int so that error messages can be transmitted and then use fseek and ftell to determine the file size

8250
fseek	ftell
a quick search in google found a methods using fseek and ftell and a thread with this question with answers that it can t be done in just c in another way

8273
unsigned	integer
iirc the standard-library defines off_t as an unsigned 64 bit integer which is what everyone should be using

8355
rewrite	rule
how do i set it up so that the rewrite rule will rewrite dbadmin.example.com to secure.example.com dbadmin but without display the rewrite on the client s address bar the client will still just see dbadmin.example.com all over http

8356
exception-handling	try-catch
also i am assuming the indexer is throwing the exception-handling if it is returning null you could of course just check for null and not use the try-catch

8371
http	ssl
i have a server on http for which i paid an ssl certification for and a mirror for which i haven t and keep around for just for emergencies so it doesn t merit getting a certification for

8371
internet-explorer	firefox
these users are very computer illiterate and are very likely to freak out from seeing https insecurity errors especially the way firefox 3 and internet-explorer 7 handle it nowadays full stop kind of thankfully but not helping me here lol

8381
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu works well the only caveat is that you have to install rubygems manually as it does not adhere to the great debian filesystem naming ideology -

8480
any	set
however you can perform a logical not a bitwise comparison between the numeric value and the none enumerated constant to determine whether any bits in the numeric value are set

8532
boolean	int
and why does increasing the boolean query s static max clauses int actually make this error go away when i m definitely only using a prefix query

8564
extends	sealed
extends sealed 3rd party apis

8574
hide	show
you can use this public property to hide or show the control or to ask the control current visibility property

8584
oracle	mysql
i have been informed that similar support are being planned or have been implemented in oracle and mysql out of interest

8591
any	set
for example to have a short cut you can use at any time say f1 to open help that input binding must be set on the windows object since that always has focus when your app is active

8602
put	get
you could get visual-c++ express and put together the startup program pretty easily

8625
abstract-class	subclassing
this class subclassing an abstract-class which basically stores the name and value as string

8625
base-class	subclass
the idea being that this subclass will add some type-safety to the base-class as well as saving me on some conversion

8636
double	int
for many types int double datetime etc there is a static parsing methods

8704
implements	final
i have an mfc application compiled with clr and i m trying to implements a final handler for otherwise un-caught managed exception-handling

8727
command-line	cmd
although i haven t learned how to fully use it yet i m a fan because it supports most if not all of the unix cmd i m familiar with for navigating using a command-line

8730
postgresql	mysql
if a query is more then just a simple select on a single table i always run it through explain if i am on mysql or postgresql

8748
python	c++
based on the brief information provided would a language such as python provide the required functionality and performance as well as addressing the memory allocation and various other c++ related problems which arise

8756
licensing	gpl
edit to avoid people reading only the question and answering before reading my other reply i ll add my clarification for gpl licensing and similar issues here

8760
python	c++
your only problem would be the performance part as python will likely never be as fast as a compiled c++ program

8771
python	c++
you could try to use python and extending it with your current c++ modules for the performance heavy parts

8780
perl	ruby
of the imperative languages perl is an obvious option python is popular and ruby has a high profile and probably cleaner oo features than the first two

8783
sql-server	mysql
in the command line client you run attach database path to other.db as otherdb and then you can refer to tables in that database as otherdb.tablename just as in mysql or sql-server

8818
type-safety	generics
so it s just as easy both ways but hashtable uses object for both key and value which means you will box all value types and you don t have type-safety and dictionary uses generics types and is thus better

8832
apache-config	.htaccess
i figure i might have to change my apache-config rather than use .htaccess

8864
case-insensitive	case-sensitive
edit for some reason when i read the documentation linked to in the answer before posting this question i read it as case-sensitive instead of case-insensitive which was the whole reason i posted this question in the first place.

8891
python	c++
another alternative is to embed python in your c++ program

8891
python	c++
in python rather than c or c++

8894
any	set
the instructions describe how to set it up but do not really give any indication of what its purpose is and the phppgadmin site was not very helpful either

8896
32-bit	64bit
i know that this could spill over into a debate regarding 32-bit vs 64bit on servers but let s just say that my preference is 64bit and that i have some very good reasons

8896
reliability	scalability
maybe when stackoverflow is live then more people will respond and let me know if this is something being looked into and although i can try and compile it myself - i simply can t trust with my c++ experience level that it would provide enterprise level reliability in such a crucial component of large scalability solutions

8912
32-bit	64bit
are you sure that the 32-bit version doesn t just run on 64bit windows without modification

8912
32-bit	64bit
i think you re probably overestimating the difference between 32-bit and 64bit windows at least as far as compiling a native application goes

8918
python	perl
i am trying to make it my single scripting language replacing the things i did in perl python vbscript .bat .cmd and one off little utility conversion programs that i would create

8920
installation	uninstall
to move the installation you will need to uninstall all editions of 2008 you have installed including any express editions and then the choose installation location option should enable

8941
reference-type	generics
i m sure there is a generics method that can be used to determine if the type is of a value or reference-type

8941
implements	extends
plus if you then need to later extends to any lightweight custom types they can also implements the same interface with no changes required to the base code

8950
firefox	safari
edit browsing a sharepoint wss site on a mac whether using firefox or safari has a very similar look and feel as it does on windows ie

9011
conditional	operators
operators produces an assignable result 3 is assigned to the result of the conditional

9030
http	ssl
enabling ssl http for iis in windows-xp

9033
conditional	operators
i mean declarations conditional loops operators etc

9033
conditional	operators
conditional ternary operators

9040
put	get
even if you do get it to switch drives it still is going to put a lot of stuff on the system drive

9045
xhtml	tidy
as part of that buffer class i actually run the html through html tidy and a few scrub-n-replace bits to get valid xhtml

9067
filtering	sorting
with this property in my baseclass i can automate handling of paging setting filtering values to filtering a gridview make sorting really easy etc

9102
postgresql	mysql
if you re using mysql or postgresql there s various tools for seeing query activity in real time but i haven t found a tool as good as the sql profiler for measuring query performance over time

9142
mp3	wma
i ve been looking at the ntag project as well which handles mp3 wma ogg

9144
python	c++
honestly i doubt that you ve got a lot of incoming developers who suck with c++ but would be awesome with python anyway

9160
bug-tracking	fogbugz
but we really haven t had any problems integration fogbugz into a team that was totally unfamiliar with any bug-tracking software

9191
ifstream	fstream
the behaviour is repeatable across various bog-standard apis such as win32 s createfile c s fopen c++ s std ifstream java s fstream etc

9191
windows-xp	windows
the dramatic difference between one-thread and two-thread performance is repeatable across windows 2000 windows-xp 32-bit and 64-bit windows server 2003 and also with and without hardware raid5

9193
freebsd	linux
linux freebsd and mac os x this final one on different hardware all degrade much more gracefully in terms of aggregate bandwidth when moving from one thread to two

9193
windows-xp	windows
several dell workstations intel xeon of various ages running windows 2000 windows-xp 32-bit and windows-xp 64-bit with single drive

9193
windows-xp	windows
an hp workstation amd opteron with windows-xp 64-bit and windows server 2003 and hardware raid 5

9193
freebsd	linux
my home unbranded pc amd athlon64 running windows xp 32-bit freebsd 64-bit and linux 64-bit with single drive

9196
directory	folder
delete the bin and obj folder in your solution directory

9200
ms-access	mysql
i had an application that worked likewise an ms-access frontend to a mysql backend

9214
environment	building
this is tolerable in our building environment but i d be interested in a cleaner way

9218
debian	linux
let the nice package maintainers from linux distros such as debian or ubuntu do the work for you

9222
contains	any
i d like to add the caveat that i ll assume the column that you don t want contains hardly any data

9240
getter	setter
in your business logic layer you have described your business-objects getter setter accessors and so on.

9279
linux	osx
i basically just need a tool that works in osx or linux and keeps a remote directory in sync mirrored with a local directory while i make changes to the local directory

9289
arrays	map
i would like to filter an arrays of items by using the map function

9297
arrays	map
you should use the filter method rather than map unless you want to mutate the items in the arrays in addition to filtering

9308
getter	setter
if you want to do stuff in getter or setter there s no problem to convert them to normal properties later on

9308
getter	setter
also the properties allow you to set different access levels for the getter and setter which you can t do with a field

9309
attributes	properties
there are some attributes that you can add to a properties that you can t add to a field

9340
textbox	button
is the addition of the extra textbox possibly changing the tab order of your elements perhaps making the button the default control in that case

9341
selected	button
if they then click the back button the second drop-down will no longer be enabled although it should be since there s something selected in the first drop-down

9345
contains	any
the assembly that contains myapp.controls.sortablelistview isn t installed in the gac by any chance is it

9361
input-field	selected
i d like to utilize an ice faces fileinput control to fill in the file path file name for the input to an input-field on a web page based on file that the user selected

9391
revision	svn
the number on the webpage is most likely i m assuming here the svn revision number for the whole project

9391
any	set
any codeigniter solution should be able to do this set this up myself with ccnet and teamcodeigniterty although not webpages but automatic versioning of deployment assembly versions

9391
build-process	nant
in order for you to do this use a codeigniter solution that supports it or use your build-process msbuild nant to store that version and write it to the files before deploying it

9417
32-bit	64bit
john sibly dannysmurf given the nature of memcached and what it aims to achieve surely you wouldn t want to run a 32-bit version on a 64bit machine

9433
instances	private
for instances i like _blah for private variables and at least in windows forms controls are by default private member variables but i can t remember ever seeing them named that way

9472
.net	wcf
i have a wcf service that i have to reference from a .net 2.0 project

9472
.net	wcf
so i was wondering if anyone has any pointers or resources on how i can setup a .net 2.0 project to reference a wcf service

9497
highlight	selected
this scripting will selected your file and highlight the next two files below it when you hit f12

9502
entity-framework	nhibernate
however as a word of warning before going down the path of writing your own mappers i d strongly recommend looking at using a 3rd-party object relational mapper orm tool such as nhibernate or microsoft s entity-framework

9615
svg	vml
ie handles vml though and there are even javascript libraries that do some canvas-like drawing depending on a browser svg vs

9615
javascript	dom
are there any cross-browser javascript libraries that display vector graphics from given markup not obligatory svg and offer availability to attach to dom events

9615
mouseover	mouseout
the level of interactivity i need is ability to detect dom events on the vector image being displayed - mouseover mouseout click etc

9615
background-color	display
- and ability to react on them like changing background-color display dialog etc

9639
boolean	int
results in a null if t is a reference-type and 0 if it is an int false if it is a boolean

9641
.net	wcf
it certainly helped me test out the webservice but it didn t much help with using the wcf service in my .net 2.0 application

9650
python	perl
just like i can run perl or python

9654
firefox	safari
safari opera and firefox all support svg natively eg

9654
svg	vml
unfortunately any standards based approach is kind of destroyed by ie s willful disregard of what is happening outside its own ecosystem however there are a number of libraries that try to convert canvas svg into vml ie s proprietary vector language such as iecanvas

9687
any	set
if i really try to support the requested ability to query any combination of any field in any table this is going to be one massive set of if-statement

9698
drools	jbpm
we re looking at drools guvnor possibly integrated with jbpm as in this presentation to add a workflow engine to our spring java ee app but we re still in the very early phases of trying it out

9711
32-bit	64bit
i m not sure what the case is for assignment to 64bit variables it depends on the processor i would assume that it is not atomic but it probably is on modern 32-bit processors and certainly on all 64bit processors

9715
value	field
torn reads can occur on any value whose field add up to more than the size of a pointers

9749
vmware	esx
vmware esx vmware server xen installations..

9767
virtual-machine	vmware
our build machine running finalbuilder runs on a windows-xp virtual-machine running in vmware server on linux

9769
profiling	debugging
i d like to script flexbuilder so that i can run debugging or profiling without having to switch to flexbuilder and manually clicking the button or using the key combo

9783
sql-server	oracle
i ve used sql-server express on the past projects but time and time again i hear people saying that the product from oracle is faster and more powerful

9788
subtraction	addition
additionally while reads and writes are atomic there is a race condition with addition subtraction and incrementing and decrementing primitive-types since they must be read operated on and rewritten

9798
sql-server	oracle
because we support oracle and sql-server i know that getting fixes for the normal oracle is not something what i call fun

9801
postgresql	mysql
if you really want a free alternative that is similar to ms sql and supports growth should you need it you could have a look at mysql or postgresql

9810
globalization	localization
take into consideration the fact that for globalization localization purposes some parts of the world use different calendar methods of organization of the year

9814
.when	ready
note that frameworks like jquery will provide a way to execute code .when the dom is ready and not .when the page loads

9826
queue	fifo
while linux and others can choose between different policies before vista windows was locked in a single policy a fifo queue where all requests where splitted in 64 kb blocks

9835
virtualization	vmware
the server itself is running centos 5.1 with vmware 1.0.6 loaded as the virtualization provider

9835
windows-server	windows
on top of this we have 4 windows-server 2003 machines running making up the active directory exchange isa database and windows av updates component

9844
order	add
then from here you can use the number of days in the month datetime.daysinmonth in order to determine how many weeks when you divide by seven and then add the number of days from 1 that your first day falls on

9860
sql-server	oracle
i would go for the sql-server express solution unless you absolutely have to use a feature in oracle that sql-server does not have and you have no usable workaround

9860
sql-server	oracle
but i think that oracle express is a commercial reaction to sql-server express and i don t think oracle really deep deep down likes it

9870
export	report
the cool thing about doing it this way is that i also have an export link that allows you to get all rows from the report returned as csv above every grid in my application

9932
sql-server	oracle
i have heard some things about blobs in oracle and store binary in ms sql-server 2005 and then perhaps copying the database to other zones

9950
configuration	logging
my experience is with the .net platform and my favoured logging tool would be log4net since it s free has extensive configuration options and if you re sensible in how you implement your logging it won t noticeably hinder your application s performance

9950
system.diagnostics	.net
alternatively there is .net s built in debug or trace class in the system.diagnostics namespace

9958
prototype	strict
assuming strict mode the default compiler mode it is not possible to modify the prototype of non-dynamic class types in actionscript 3

9974
profiling	trace
the problem is that you have one of your pages in a web application timing out when it gets to a stored procedure call so you use sql profiling or your application trace logs to find the query and you paste it into management studio to figure our why it s running slow
