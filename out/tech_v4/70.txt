postgresql	mysql
the translation from mysql to postgresql is not simple unless your schema is trivial

701814

702110
httpwebrequest	webrequest
first cast the webrequest to an httpwebrequest like this

702111
constructor	object
but the implicitly created copy constructor copy assignment operator looks like - that is it requires a non-const object to be copied from

702148
ontouch	ondraw
at a minimum you would need to write a custom subclassing of view and implements two methods ondraw canvas c and ontouch motionevent e

702166
ftpwebrequest	ftp
for http and ftp resources the httpwebrequest ftpwebrequest and httpwebresponse ftpwebresponse classes will work fine as will webclient but if you have other scheme that you have to support you will have to find specific providers for that scheme

702179
turbogears	django
but with turbogears 2 coming out which brings wsgi support and after reading up on the religious debates between the django and wsgi camps i m really torn between doing it the right way learning wsgi spending valuable time writing functionality that already exists in django and other full-stack frameworks as opposed to using django or some high-level framework that does everything for me

702179
turbogears	django
if the latter i would appreciate a suggestion as to whether i should give django another try stick with turbogears 1.x or venture into some other framework

702187
url-rewriting	query-string
then uses url-rewriting to remap everything to a single web service that will provide the correct resource based on the rewritten query-string

702188
arrays	loops
i have some image processing code that loops through 2 multi-dimensional byte arrays of the same size

702188
arrays	loops
the loops currently takes 11ms which i assume is mostly due to accessing the byte arrays values as the calculation is pretty simple 2 multiplications and 1 addition

702196
contentcontrol	textblock
something i ve done in the past is to use a contentcontrol with the content property bound to the string with a valueconverter that returns a dynamically created textblock

702210
widget	button
if the widget have a natural order a toolbar where you want to be able to drag button around you can stack an absolute layout on top of the toolbar and when the drag starts you add it to the absolute layout and when it finishes you add it back to the original layout in the new position

702212
constructor	object
for an int it doesn t matter much either way but for a more complex member object you d end up with the default constructor of the object being called followed by an assignment to that object which is likely to end up being slower

702213
constructor	private
if there are no constructors of you members that directly take one of the parameters to your constructor it may be worthwhile to add private static functions that can do the conversion for you

702230
hide	show
i can show and hide the keyboard when the user chooses to

702232
document	element
for example para is short for descendant-or-self node child para and so will selected any para element in the document even a para element that is a document element will be selecteded by para since the document element node is a child of the root node

702232
children	nodes
div para is short for div descendant-or-self nodes child para and so will selected all para descendants of div children

702238
.net	wcf
in fact you re pretty much stuck with using only basichttpbinding on the wcf service if you want to be consumed by a default install of .net 2.0

702238
.net	wcf
again your wcf service must accommodate your .net 2.0 client but your .net 2.0 client will also need to take advantage of an external library

702238
.net	wcf
bottom line there s a lot of work to get a .net 2.0 client to talk to a wcf service for anything other than basichttpbinding

702249
contains	elements
identifies the xaml markup file that contains the application definition a xaml markup file whose root elements is application

702264

702267
highlight	cell
format data accoringly if x is less than y then highlight the cell yellow

702343
inline-code	code-behind
i personally prefer the code-behind methods because it keeps my aspx pages clean and i don t have all this inline-code all over the place and the next guy just knows to always look in the .cs files for code changes

702343
inline-code	code-behind
where do you draw the line and move it to the code-behind if you are using inline-code

702343
databound	gridview
edit note i am not talking about assigning a value to a control that is just on the page but one that is being databound to because it exists in a repeater templates or gridview item templates etc.

702344
markup	xhtml
xml is a markup particularly suitable for textual documents xhtml docbook various kinds of office docs

702344
json	xml
json is not a perfect fit -- it s still data not objects no identity can t do full graphs -- but it is more natural than xml

702344
json	xml
for what it is worth since writing my original answer i have seen json absolutely annihilate xml for data-oriented data-interchange use cases for companies i have worked for

702356
value	field
you could have your code add value to hidden form field along with adding the rows on screen

702358
any	set
the silverlight clr can not use the oracleclient dll so i can t use any of the typical oracle result set data-structures dataset

702360
web-frameworks	turbogears
some personal experience i spent years on and off messing around with twisted nevow turbogears and a few other python web-frameworks

702367
any	set
so reader will call parseddatahandler.beginblock to let it set up any state at the beginning of a block and is committed to leaving a designated portion probably all of the blockinfo constant until it makes a matching call to parseddatahandler.endblock -- afterwards it might reuse the data buffer for the next block

702374
nested	order
in order for me to find the nested gridview i have to do a findcontrol on the parent gridview but i was under the impression that you only need to do this if the parent control implements inamingcontainer and according to this link gridview does not implement from inamingcontainer

702384
product	invoice
with very little explicit nhibernate configuration assuming you have customer invoice and product tables in your db of course

702393
children	nodes
to merge the tree maybe a templates that looks for all children of the current nodes in any sheet and recurses on itself for each of them

702393
children	nodes
search all sheets for children of nodes with this title discarding duplicates

702395
versioning	downgrade
edit i guess i could downgrade the program to an older versioning of python to make it work with py2exe

702419
perl	php
use something like php or perl to keep yourself sane

702441
gridview	listview
actually i prefer to use the aspx for controls that you would expect to bind like listview gridview repeater and other similar controls

702449
32-bit	64bit
how do i develop a 64bit app on a 32-bit pc

702457
any	set
seems especially stupid given that any half decent website does not store plaintext passwords in their database they store a one way hash of that password which will always be a set length depending on the algorithm used for example sha1 is a 160 bit digest and then rehash that password on login to make sure that the newly hash password matches the stored one

702459
32-bit	64bit
even in 64bit windows the dlls still have their 32-bit names which imho was a bad choice since it obviously confuses people

702459
32-bit	64bit
32-bit applications will by default have systemroot system32 redirected to systemroot syswow64 where the 32-bit dlls reside whereas 64bit applications won t get redirected

702459
32-bit	64bit
both can be disabled per-thread with wow64disablewow64fsredirection but obviously doesn t let 32-bit applications load 64bit dlls

702460
implements	extends
and then each of your threads will extends notifyingthread and instead of implements run it will implement dorun

703126
checkbox	textarea
i have a series of checkbox and input type textareas wherein i need to have the state of the checkbox set to true when the value in the textarea changes

it s very hard to produce a friendly-looking rdbms schema to fit this kind of dynamic data model and jira tries as best it can

703900
host	dns
if you always get this exception-handling and you can otherwise access this host by name then i don t know what this could be but odds are that this was a temporary dns failure

703903
domcontentloaded	onload
they ll then activate as soon as possible rather than waiting until the page is â readyâ which can take a long time especially on ie which doesn t support the domcontentloaded event so jquery has to wait for onload which only fires after all the images and everything are loaded

703910
contains	set
the callback passes an argument contains the index of the current element in the set

703917
environment	building
consider documenting the building environment within the building-system and making it so easy a monkey could boot strap an extract building package advertise test package sign and deploy

703935
postback	ajax
if you don t want to mess with ajax the more traditional way to do this sort of thing with webforms is to use a panel control for each page form of the wizard and then hide or reveal the various panels on postback

703941
command-prompt	cmd
i finally found the answer myself just open the visual-studio cmd-prompt and run this cmd

703945
onmousedown	onmouseup
if you display a picture in a timage control that s the obvious first choice after all you can detect mouse clicks with the onmousedown and onmouseup events

703984
javascript	dom
i would like to be able to use a similar function on the contents of a javascript string variable instead of the contents of a dom element

703995
project-management	project
i person known coderer on the community stack overflow agree to thoroughly consider switching to a sane project-management methodology that allows extra classes to be added to project in the executing phase

704017
benchmarking	profiling
profiling and or benchmarking algorithms and implementations in code

704038
json	xml
the xml is just the transport today its xml and tomorrow it might be some other format json

704045
click	mouse
within visual-studio right mouse click on the project contains the client code and selected add service or web reference

704057
document	element
the templates matching node has a parameter named pother which is the corresponding element named node from the other document

704066
32-bit	64bit
when you run a 64bit application that was built by using the .net you may notice that the application uses more memory than a similar 32-bit application

704080
children	nodes
some will have text nodes with the newline and whitespace as children of div#foo before and after the link element

704104
msdeploy	nant
i can try calling msdeploy from nant but i don t think msdeploy was written for such deployment

704105
xsd	xml
sql-server 2005 and up have a datatype called xml which you can store xml in - untyped or typed with a xsd schema

704106
xsd	xml
you can associate an xsd schema with xml variables and insert directly into columns of type xml

704117
32-bit	64bit
every application when built for a 64bit processor takes more memory than when built for a 32-bit processor

704117
32-bit	64bit
if you can think of a way to squeeze 64bit of information into a 32-bit register i m sure we d all love to hear how

704127
sql-server	oracle
i ve always been a sql-server guy so first time with oracle

704127
sql-server	oracle
any recommendations for a sql-server management studio type app for oracle

704132
order	add
i need to add javascript calls in some controls attributes i am using master pages but in order to obtain the contentplaceholder client id i am iterating over the forms controls

704145
contains	any
this searches for any control that contains divfullwarning in their id so you could name your contentplaceholder contentplaceholder and then no matter how much asp.net muck s with your id you ll still be able to grab it client side

704154
autodesk	3ds
in production environments animators use specialized tools such as autodesk s 3ds max to generate keyframed animation of 3d models

704166
subtract	time
get the current time then subtract the previous current time

704168
authentication	login
with username authentication to login user we do the following

704196
platform	lgpl
also if you re still using 4.1 you can now use 4.5 under the lgpl on all platform making it almost a no-brainer to upgrade

704198
salt	md5
i will say though that md5 isn t a very good level of encryption and you should consider something stronger such as encrypt with a custom salt

704199
constructor	private
this does not seem to be possible since no instance of adapter exist yet and it has a private constructor

704209
enumerate	next
as you enumerate over that result each spweb will be disposed when the enumerator moves to the next item

704228
sql-server	oracle
so the database store would be something like some tables in an oracle or microsoft sql-server and would on your server

704229
python	perl
this is in perl but you should be able to translate it to python

704234
data-structures	tree
i don t have a ton of time to implement lots of different data-structures but other structures i m thinking about include cover tree and vp-tree

704258
gridview	formview
does the textbox sit within a bound control such as a formview gridview datalist etc

704269
installation	building
just to note when you building your setup project you will get two installation options setup.exe and mysetupproject.msi

704281
printf	strcat
say do you catch return codes for the c standard lib functions snprintf printf strncat strcat and so on.. .. of c standard-library

704303
flex	jsf
do you think it s worth it to use flex or we should use some frameworks ex. jsf instead

704321
jar	war
get to know something about the way java packages things jar war ear

704334
revision	svn
have to remove the logs and schema.rb from the svn as that is machine dependent.my schema is not migrating after the update as the schema revision on different machine is of different order

704378
order	add
i also would add some registration mechanism in order to be flexible for future additions if you want to implement another separate behaviour for new component types

704378
inherited	subclass
it doesn t work with inherited classes if you have a subclass from jlabel you must register it separately

704380
callback	methods
under title retrieving data from threads msdn here introduces a way to get data from a child thread by using callback methods which is encapsulated by a delegate passed from main thread to the child thread - who has the data

704380
callback	methods
my q is since we are taking about retrieving data from child threads to main thread the callback methods should be executed by the main thread and not by the child thread.

704390
actionscript	mxml
flex has a markup piece mxml and a programming language piece actionscript

704419
value	field
it seems that you have to set the value of a textbox to get the focus in the field instead of the selection

704435
value	field
when i map an enum and this enum has a backing value of type int i just map my enum property to an int field in the database

704435
attributes	properties
where the oncalltype column is of type int in my db and the oncalltype properties is an enumerated type that has the flags attributes

704464
constructor	object
i ve solved this problem in the past using a static class and putting a lock on a static object created within the constructor of that class thus funneling all the work through one static method which forces other calls to wait in line

704468
sigkill	sigsegv
if you want to make sure your function won t be interrupted by signals use sigprocmask to mask and unmask signalss although some signalss cannot be blocked like sigkill and behaviour for blocking some signalss like sigsegv is undefined

704488
order	add
then i would add a methods to my order repository which has the following signature

704514
double	int
now in form a there are two fields required that allow data input one is for quantity int and the other is price double

704523
double	int
you can t cast a string to an int or a double you need to use int.parse or double.parse

704528
double	int
it s a string and you can t cast from string to int or double

704546
cocoa	uikit
apple don t say anything about thread safety on iphone but cocoa as opposed to uikit is generally thread safe for drawing

704548
put	get
it provides an eventually consistent guarantee so if you put something there is no guarantee that you will see the item on your next get

704569
hash	md5
there are a lot more hash functions than md5 to use for storing passwords in you mysql database

704572
excel-vba	vba
i am hoping that such a short vba example should not be too difficult to grasp for someone who has never written a line of code before and hopefully make a case for trying to learn a bit of excel-vba

704572
basic	vba
achievable with short basic vba code

704589
spring	seam
spring seam etc

704602
put	get
i m trying to take user input store it into the string get a character arrays from the string dont ask why i just have to put this into a character arrays then get the reversed order of the phrase that the user entered

i ve seen many different error-handling methods in the absence of exception-handling

704649
compact-framework	.net
the problem comes here i am will be developing an application for a windows ce device with .net compact-framework which has hardware-accelerated opengl es 2.0 and openvg 1.0.1 based on ti omap35x if you re interested

704663
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the good answer but hard to achieve - throw away webforms and use asp.net-mvc

704663
jquery	.post
the compromise workaround- i did a small plugin myself which converts a div into an ajax submit with the div abused with method .post and action url dress up then utilize jquery form plugin to serialize submit with a plugin pattern

704670
oracle	mysql
although it uses a mysql database as an example that doesn t really matter as you can just replace any mysql specific information with oracle

704676
logging	trace
if you can t get a full stack trace after the exception has been thrown you might want to add more logging into list and the methods it calls to show you where the recursion is occurring

704679
put	get
i would like to get some attributes from an object image in this string before i put the html into the document

704690
boolean	int
otherwise having a single boolean isadmin field or an int enum in a role field is probably ok

704705
entity-framework	data-access
the data-access layer - i don t see anyway of sharing this as there are 2 different db s with entity-framework hence its got the edm in there so its not dynamic - and the tables differ slightly

704709
integer	zero
otherwise it performs integer division and 3 8 is zero then

704715
integer	zero
3 and 8 in your division are integer literals so integer division is performed and 3 8 evaluates to zero

704741
web-services	api
it s perfect for deploying micro web-services eg json api s to use in other apps

704743
put	get
in the message sink before the call is put through to methods is there someway to get hold of the test type so i can query the custom attributes timeout

704745
graphviz	doxygen
we use doxygen with graphviz support

704775
digits	zero
generally speaking 0 is a zero placeholder and # is a digits placeholder

704775
decimal-point	digits
where 1 stands for one digits after the decimal-point

704804
elisp	lisp
the latter is a shell implementation written in elisp you can use the common shell commands as well as evaluating lisp code

704890
markup	tidy
in order to parsing the html data you ll either need a specialized html parsingr that can handle poorly formed markup or tidy it first before parsing using a xml parsingr

704897
tga	bmp
i am thinking about package that weight something like 10 giga with a lot of bmp and tga files

704906
for-loop	loops
after that use a for-loops with -1 and increment inside the loops

704931
development-environment	publishing
publishing where do you store your delivery and how to you link it to the initial development-environment that produced it

704933
json	xml
if you insist to do it manually i suggest json instead of xml

704936
linux	unix
some suggest that a mac is a nice platform for developing for mac os x windows unix and linux

704948
updating	updates
for the modification it s how would you write updates to the file without reading it completely into memory updating it there and then writing it again completely back to the file

704955
value	field
if this is because you have a null value you could get the data adapter to return an empty string when the field is null if that is the problem

704963
json	xml
and one might still debat which one is simpler - json or xml

704966
defined	declare
as mitch pointed out vb6 only declare the last variables in a comma delimited list as explicit of the type defined

705022
value	field
i do it exactly the way aleris does except i use a enum field on my model for the sort value this way it will fall back on the default if they enter a sort paremeter that doesn t exist

705051
implements	extends
you d have a class that extends thread or implements runnable and a constructor with the parameters you d like to pass

705057
selected	listbox
now my problem is suppose use has navigated in some listbox in windows and if he presses ctrl+a then selected all functionality takes places for the list box and save as dialog box does not get called as i have done the command binding for this input gesture

705063
base-class	inherited
the problem is that i do not see a way to inherited the implementation of the constructor of the abstract base-class

705070
cassini	iis
i am trying to use such a beast to update the database schema admin function obviously and it works perfectly in cassini but when i deploy to iis 7 the thread gets about one line of code in and silently ends

705073
derived-class	base-class
if you want the logic of the base-class constructor to run in the derived-class you d normally just call up to it

705073
derived-class	base-class
the base-class can call abstract virtual methods during the constructor but it s generally frowned upon as the derived-class s constructor body will not have been executed yet

705101
put	get
you have to download that put it where your build tool can get to it and then before the msbuild task use the loadtask

705112
logout	login
run profiling on the server audit login logout you should be able to see the client connect

705120
double	int
just make sure that your parameters are somehow contracted #1 will be int #2 will be a double etc

705128
simpledateformat	date-format
the correct way is to use the simpledate-format or rather a date-format object

sqldatasource	gridview
i have a sqldatasource that is supplying data to my gridview

705134
.when	ready
and still for some ready .when i place a breakpoints in my selected event it does not even get to it

705143
cassini	iis
this way it doesn t matter where your page is in your site structure whether you re using cassini a web site in iis or a virtual directory in iis - the url will always resolve to the correct address

705172
selected	listbox
it should be done from the listbox as only it knows about what item is currently selected

705181
gnome	kde
it s cross platform fairly efficient and will let you work with gnome kde windows or just generating image files fairly simply

705195
sqldatasource	gridview
looking at your code i don t think you re ever binding your gridview so your sqldatasource is never trying to selected the data from your database

705199
push	pull
integrated with livecycle lcds you could have server push data to flex clients rather than pull based mechanism

705210
sqlcmd	ssms
then connecting with ssms or sqlcmd and run a restore

705232
event-viewer	perfmon
if event-viewer doesn t indicate that any kind of loggable hardware error is causing the slowdown then try perfmon -- add counters for system objects to track file read exception-handling context switches etc

705246
decimal	hex
it gets harder if a preceding 0x means hex number and omitted means decimal number

705254
click	mouse
in this very simple asp.net application visual web developer 2008 express can debugging the javascript code fine but the full version of visual-studio 2005 cannot debugging it namely when i click on a line in the main.js file it gives me a red circle with a question mark on it the mouse hover revealing this break point will not be reached no symbols were loaded for this document.

705257
freebsd	linux
for emulation of the network you can use open source products such as freebsd with its dummynet or linux with its netem module

i would like to do to the mdi children something similar to treenodes.ensurevisible which moves the treeview scrollbars until the nodes is fully visible

705280
getter	setter
i have a vo class which has the getter and setter of another vo class too

705283
attributes	properties
this is perhaps best solved with custom attributes on members properties fields

705291
any	set
if you still want to do it you could try to view the file .settings org.eclipse.core.resources.prefs in your project that file may or may not exist dependin on wether you ve manually set any encoding in the project or not

705316
display	height
then set the anchor tags to display block and set the height and line-height to be the same as the td s height

705319
constructor	object
how about this i am referring to c++ if an object throws within its constructor the object may be left at an undefined state

705321
any	set
edit you can add custom installer actions to a clickonce project just like any other to set up additional components and whatnot

705322

705434
windows-xp	dos
i have a python 2.5.4 script which i run in cygwin in a dos box on windows-xp

705447
windows-xp	windows
edit i just ran the following python program in a native windowss-xp terminal windows thought it was slightly interesting

705459
rendering	redraw
each function used in this way must take proper care to maintain the attributes structure as it is propagated down the list and this is a frequent cause of rendering bugs usually things not realising they should be redraw because they are part of a grouping of entries for example

705459
contains	any
the desired behaviour is that modifying a feature will alter the attributes of that feature and any sub-features it contains and modifying a sub-feature will only modify that feature

705463
http	ssl
there seems to be a bug in the ssl implementation of an http server i m connecting to

705486
boost	stl
1 use boost function and stl algorithms like for_each count_if

705514
button	popup
i have popup windows that is opened through a button click

705514
google-chrome	safari

google-chrome	safari
here is the weird thing in safari it never works but in google-chrome it works if

705534
nyromodal	jquery
i have been using the jquery nyromodal plugin for a little bit of time and frankly its one of the best modal plugins i ve used to date

705543
defined	declare
since you don t declare or defined an assignment operators an implicit one will be provided that uses the auto_ptr s assignment operators which definitely makes t not equivalent to u not to mention that it won t work at all for const t u value which is what earwicker s answer points out - i m just pointing out the exact portion s of the standard

705547
show	next
next he show you how to grab the data for the dropdown lists from web-services

705548
linux	unix
it is customary in linux and unix systems to change important files by reading the old one writing out the new one with a different name and renaming the new one to the old one

705552
contains	any
make sure you aren t adding parameters to sql or other scripting executions that were passed into the code from the browser without making sure the strings don t contains any scripting language

705582
pivot-table	crosstab
the matrix is for crosstab or pivot-table style reports

705596
if-statement	loops
meaning the code is passing the first two if-statement and then leaves the loops and the function

705609
spaces	output
i am aware that i can grep the lines and output it into another file but this is too tedious and creates more disk spaces consumption

705615
put	get
when the dropdownlist get changed i want in a label to put the telephone of that person

705615
put	get
however i thought that doing a full postback was not really the best alternative so i decided to get the telephone with a pagemethod passing the id of the item selected in the dropdownlist to retrieve the telephone and the put it in the label

705618
latex	tex
i like generating nice pdf documents to distribute so i find latex or any other tex distribution to be perfect for that

705628
filesystems	xfs
filesystems like xfs and ext4 have delayed allocation which might support this feature if it is implement

705653
windows-mobile	windows-ce
i started with roundrect but the result had jagged corners since windows-ce uses gdi and doesn t support gdi+ as windows-mobile 5+ does

705669
populate	row
note some row s catagory values are not populate

705688
vbscript	jscript
vbscript or jscript with windows scripting host should be able to do it

mbunit	nunit
next there d be unit-testing tools like nunit or my personal favorite mbunit or pex and finally some tool to ensure you ve handled all exception-handling-handling appropriately - again pex or exception-handling hunter

705696
expression	brackets
or if you need a regular expression that matches valid input simply add a caret to the front of the brackets like so

705701
contains	any
the desired behaviour is that modifying a feature will alter the attributes of that feature and any sub-features it contains and modifying a sub-feature will only modify that feature

705701
linked-list	tree
this class would traverse your linked-list or tree and call the above mentioned draw method on each class

705703
actionscript	mxml
it s not hard to learn mxml and actionscript

705716
submitchanges	datacontext

705729
ruby	php
i don t know what is the ruby extension like index.php for php

705743
selected	button
case in point i was looking at one of our internal interfaces that had been converted and none of the button click events of drop-down selected index changed events were firing

705746
nonblocking	epoll
if however you use nonblocking sockets whatever buffering size you use will not block and you will need to do the waiting yourself with selected poll epoll whatever-works-on-your-platform selected is the most portable though

705770
checkbox	button
within it i have a div that contains a checkbox list and a button

705782
put	get
however if a client were to come up to me today and say i don t care what the right way to do things is it s easier for us to use your api if we can just use call urls and get some xml back - we don t want to have to build http requests and post put xml what business-conducive reasons could i give to convince them otherwise

705784
cisco	ipsec
cisco vpn devices generally all support ipsec

705797
python	java
some related code analysis tools are yasca analysis tool for javascript java php etc. and asdox as3 parser written in python which might be decent starts for writing your own

705806
scrollbar	z-index
it s as if they have a higher z-index that that of the scrollbar

705812
environment	building
i ve used annotations processing in a continuous build environment building the annotationss processor then using it in the rest of the build

705812
environment	building
the only eclipse-specific thing i did was to cast the processing environment object so i could check if it was bring run as a building or for editor reconciliation

selected	cells
what i want to be able to do is selected a cell or row in any of my worksheet and then call my shell sub while passing the values from a couple cells to the sub

705834
any	set
it would be best to try and match any character that is not allowed by negating the allowed set

705846
target-platform	platform

host	root
don t create any alias or scriptalias directives for this directory because it s under the document root already but you ll need to put something like this in your virtual host file

706094
entity-framework	ado.net
yups correct sl on the client side no way it s running in a sandbox you can just communicatio with a service in the server and from there return the query result you can run the query just using plain ado.net or fnacy stuff like ado.net entity-framework

706100
defined	declare
when determining which function is being declare defined or called

706110
highlight	selected
basically is there a way to make the option selected highlight based on the provided _get t value on the address bar

706115
for-loop	arrays
is there an easy way to get the iteration number or arrays index without going back to a for-loop

706119
ruby	php
blaze is also a java-only solution and there are lots of other types of backend technologies being used with flex php .net python ruby coldfusion etc

706119
silverlight	wpf
we are also seeing significant growth with silverlight and wpf as microsoft rolls out these solutions to their huge developer community

706125
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade my application from ruby-on-rails versioning 2.1.2 to versioning 2.2.2

706129
constructor	object
you ve got the right idea about starting threads in the fib function and about passing x to the object through the constructor

706137
triggers	insert
i thought i could simply make a triggers but apparently mysql doesn t allow the modification of the table on which we are actually insert

706149
triggers	insert
if you do many insert that triggers will do that work and effectively half the performance not to mention the lock contention that will arise as other processes try to access the same table

706154
callback	methods
you didn t mention why starting a new asynchronous receive operation fails in your callback methods - what error are you seeing

706167
queue	fifo
a simple example certainly not the only or necessarily the best example is a fifo queue

706187
sql-server	mysql
depends on your database server but in sql-server i normally use this in mysql query

706192
required	checked
all that is required for this is you must have the web references folder checked in

706237
webserver	security
as 20 redirects are quite alot there could be some error in the filename itself causing the webserver on the other end to do some spellcheck-redirects or the other server is misconfigured or there are some security measures in place or.

706239
gethashcode	tostring
as every type derives from object you have only the members of object availiable - tostring gettype gethashcode and equals

706239
reflection	runtime
you could also try to use reflection or check the actual type at runtime an perform a cast

706269
decrement	increment
it sounds like you re trying to build a numericupdown control and you probably have some class in code behind that s actually doing the increment and decrement

706269
decrement	increment
if that s the case you can simply subscribe to the click handler and call a methods on your model like increment or decrement

706279
svnadmin	dump
you want to perform an svnadmin dump

706279
svnadmin	dump
you can get help on this command via svnadmin help dump or reading the docs

706279
svnadmin	dump
you can then load the dump file into your new server using svnadmin load

706280
svnadmin	dump
if you re using bdb you should do an svnadmin dump instead

706296
expression	brackets
as you followed up you need parens rather than square brackets around the expression that you wanted to

706296
expression	brackets
the square brackets define a character class here as in most regular expression languages

706299
click	mouse
there s also a plugins for jquery that lets you detect right mouse click

706312
required	checked
no checked are required in methodss that you do not expose because only your code calls them and its logic should handle all cases you accepted in the exposed methods called

706330
authentication	login
i have some authentication code see below that runs when the user clicks the login button

706347
authentication	login
the issue is the login control will itself do a redirect setting a cookie or an encrypted authentication ticket in the url cookieless

706393
firefox	opera
it works fine in opera firefox safari ie7 and ie8

706401
dictionary	map
that way you can access the dictionary map directly by key

706402
checkbox	textbox
i want to add a checkbox in between these fields that the user can check if the end date is the same as the start date so when they check it the start date input value 04 01 09 will automagically appear in the end date textbox so they don t have to type in the same date twice

706421
solaris	aix
not sure what is the correct option for linux aix and solaris boxes

706426
binary	hex
note i donâ t have experience writing assembler for any platform but do understand binary hex and have a theoretical understanding of registers

706428
bazaar	git
i hear all this stuff about bazaar being slower than git

706428
version-control	bazaar
i haven t used too much distributed version-control yet but in bazaar vs

706428
bazaar	git
git on the bazaar site they say that most complaints about performance aren t true anymore

706428
bazaar	git
what specific cases does performance currently affect workflow in bazaar vs other systems especially git and how

706429
textchanged	textbox
use an ajax updatepanel set data entry controls to autopostback and handle the changed event for the control textchanged for textbox

706445
shell	bash
it is -h on linux systems also at least bash is my shell

706449
contains	any
you need e because the argument to like is a regex and regex escape char is already e.g e w would match any string contains a printable char

706455
command-line	cmd
i m not very familiar with plesk but you could get arough idea of what is happening by just running the top cmd and looking for processes that are using a lot of ram or cpu i m assuming you have a linux server and cmd-line access

706457
bazaar	git
the python developers recently decided to switch to mercurial and as part of the process did some basic benchmarking of git mercurial and bazaar which is documented in pep-374

706457
bazaar	git
an incredibly rough eye balling of the numbers they posted showed bazaar to be 2-4x slower than either git or mercurial in the use cases tested

706457
bazaar	git
that being said the message conveyed on python-dev was that all of them git mercurial bazaar are better than subversion for the most part they are fast enough and the choice of mercurial over git bazaar was mostly based on the gut feelings of the bfdl and the attendees of pycon2009

706471
any	set
the instruction set will be no more complex than a 386 family so learning assembler on this system is probably as good as any

706477
display	width
the spaces are present because the characters will be display with a fixed width font and i d like to keep them from moving around

706511
virtual-machine	virtualization
use virtualization with an xe instace by virtual-machine

706521
click	mouse
i d like to try and reduce the number of click of the mouse and page hits it takes to perform specific actions

706523
json	xml
with object databases in general sometimes it s convenient to define a model using for example a class in the language and use json or xml or some other untyped document language to be a serialized representation of the class

706530
repository	entity
or does the repository retrieve these populated entity models

706534
pivot-table	crosstab
if you have a reporting tool handy use your current query and make a martix crosstab or pivot-table report

706535
selected	textbox
in the _onfocus handler i want to be able to determine which textbox fired the event and call selected for that textbox

706540
ftp	ssh
as others point out you might want to concentrate instead on usability ease of use how it fits to your workflow if renaming is important for you if various ways of accessing remote repositories including ssh and ftp for example are important etc

706569
postback	ajax
as you seem to have ajax you could just do a partial postback write the number to the label and into the viewstate and in page_load write the value from the viewstate to the label

706569
postback	ajax
if you don t want to use ajax you can define a hiddeninputfield in your aspx file fill the content with javascript and on postback fill the label with the content

706590
google-chrome	firefox
the feature#basicstructure alternative is suggested in the comments to and gives me the answers i expected on firefox opera safari google-chrome true and ie false

706596
build-process	release
put the time in to configure an automated build-process that is driven from a release or build state of your source control system

706610
nsmutablestring	nsstring
of course you won t be able to use the mutating methods of the nsmutablestring without a runtime error just because you assign the address of bar an nsstring instance to a variables of type

706642
subtraction	addition
ideally i would like to be able to do date addition subtraction like this

706653
javascript	dom
others are head first javascript on o reilly and dom scripting on friends of ed if manipulating browser ui is what you re looking for

706660
persistence	hibernate
i am using hibernate for persistence so the relationship is represent as a hashset inside the bundle pojo

706663
select	union
i can corral the ids together using select union select but the query seems relatively slow even when each table has its pk field indexed

706677
methods	extend
in this pattern you define changestatus in the abstract class making it final if you don t trust people to extend properly and have it call the required methods

706686
triggers	insert
this triggers should try to insert the new id to master and silently fail on primary key violation

706699
order	add
i can make sure that every element even if naturally a tab-stop has an xtabindex somehow in the proper order even though i ll be dropping in other people s widget and so using jquery to add these after the fact rather than being able to specify it right in the html or other initial building code

706705
kdevelop	cdt
after trying all the ides netbeans kdevelop eclipse cdt etc i found netbeans to be the least crappy

706736
onmousedown	mouseevent
i would use onmousedown or onclick then grab the mouseevent s button property to determine which button was pressed 0 left 1 middle 2 right

706748
value	field
i can t understand why the field email isn t getting the value from the textbox

706750
terminal	prompt
i got it working for the most part some odd exit statuses will change the color to something else but i m ok with it but when typing a command which is more than one line and causes the terminal to scroll the prompt disappears

706751
handler	service
wrote handler for each annotation which contained static-methods to implement the setup and teardown of the service

706753
button	popup
i have a button that loads a modal popup with a silverlight video and i would like the audio to stop by execuding the soundmixer.stop

706760
margins	padding
first of all make sure you use a remove the padding margins of the list element using css so you will have a clean slate for all browsers

706764
stateless	stateful
the application typically maintains a stateful connection s to the db while requests to a webservice are via http which is stateless relatively higher overhead and slower

706765
constructor	private
then you would add a hudupdatehandler parameter to the constructor of the child form and store it in a private field for example

706765
.when	ready
.when your child form is ready to send its data back you would invoke the child form s private field this.handler.invoke firstnametextbox.text lastnametextbox.text for example

706773
contains	set
i have a page that contains multiple inputs - i m using ajax.beginform to build a form for each set of inputs

706779
instances	private
another use is when you are using string objects as locks not recommended and want a private instances to avoid deadlock

706794
deployment	install
my additional strong suggestion to you would be that you do not mix-and-match between windows install setup packages what vs deployment projects produce and so-called xcopy deployment copying assemblies where they need to go

706819
value	field
you are going to have to cycle through the sys.tables and sys.columns info views and construct multiple queries a single one for each table which will look in all the fields for your value in a very long or construct one for each field

706820
firefox	opera
one option is to use the html5 tag supported in firefox safari and opera with javascript then uploading the image in form data

706823
type-safety	generics
a word of warning though you end up with a non-generics iqueryable rather than a generics iqueryable so you are a little bit limited on what you can do with the result and you give up a bit of type-safety but that may be ok in your application.

706859
put	get
if you solved that it should become relativly simple to get all table names with all column names from the system tables and join every together or put it into a stored procedutre

706865
vbscript	jscript
do i call other c# code from jscript vbscript

706871
attributes	properties
what i want is to only show to the user the calcul category but i don t want to use the browsable attributes because i want all these properties to be visible in visual-studio

706875
selected	listbox
assuming that you have two windowss where one windows has a listbox and the other windows should have the detail information for an item currently selected in the listbox

706886
user-roles	userid
so storing something like a userid shopping-cart items prices password user-roles etc

706921
sendmessage	message
i ve cleared the error code immediately before calling sendmessage so it has to be set somewhere in the processing of the message

706924
value	field
thus one of â stringbytesâ field should contains a decimal value 67 which represents ascii character c .but that doesnâ t seem to be the case

706933
any	set
even on a single server the machine key should be configured because any recycle of the app domain will generate a new key when it is set to auto

706935
winpcap	libpcap
unix like system implement this interface with libpcap and winpcap on windows

706936
value	field
when searching a non-clustered index sql-server will find the value in the index do a bookmark lookup to the table and retrieve the other row field from there

706979
terminal	prompt
-- i have a fancy prompt with colors and now bash doesn t seem to know how wide my terminal is

706982
subtraction	addition
however incr does not work with non-integer values and it can t do anything but addition or subtraction if you negate the increment as in incr value -1

706983
defined	declare
the main advantage of the common-table-expression when not using it for recursive queries is encapsulation instead of having to declare the sub-query in every place you wish to use it you are able to defined it once but have multiple references to it

706998
lookup	any
note that this assumes that the lookup of facebook users will always find a user for any real facebook uid

706999
selected	checkbox
from the visual-studio 2005 menu selected crystal reports design printer setup then selected the no printer checkbox

707004
attributes	properties
i need to filtering products where certain attributes are stored in a joined table that match all the required properties users need to be able to gradually narrow down their search by adding requirements

707004
attributes	properties
i forgot to mention that i have 2 of these properties tables joined to products that i need to filtering on one with regular attributes of a product another with available configurable options a bit like variants

707057
hide	show
visibility show or hide text using the attributes in the above reply and display allows you to actually remove that block from the dom by using block and none as the attributes

707117
where-clause	sql
i am trying to run some sql statements where the where-clause is pretty simple but then i am trying an order by on a varchar 50 indexed column

707118
.when	ready
.when ready to deploy svn updates will updates only the things that have changed

707130
directory	folder
if not just make sure everything is checked in fetch to a new temporary location move the old directory out of the way as a backup and move the temporary folder to where the old one was

707152
default-value	arguments
where default is the default-value for the first arguments

707152

707219
administration	account
i used to be able to go to and after i supplied my local account information which was a member of administration i would get the home page of sql-server reporting services along with the site settings link at the top right

707219
administration	account
my local account is already part of local administration so i would think i should get the complete menu but i m not

707219
administration	account
is there another back-door administration account that i can log in as and then get my first administration account back up and running

707224
double	int
one way to fix this would leave the int2vec out completely although this means all int would be first implicitly converted into double

707251
floating	margins
i have tried floating the logo in the central header and then applying a negative margins of margins-left -10px

707275
margins	padding
so if in your design you don t have a parent element with the css positioning style on it it s going to take its positioning from the body element which may have some margins padding on it depending on your browser

707290
integrated-security	active-directory
let s say you are using active-directory integrated-security

707306
multiplication	multiplying
there is only one multiplication operators and in some cases there s more than one way to multiplying with 3d vectors for example there s at least the dot and cross product

707306
conditional	operators
as far as teaching students tell them not to overload operatorss themselves except under defined conditional such as functors and the assignment operators but point out how the library uses overloaded operatorss

707320
submitchanges	datacontext
i always found useful to know exactly what changes are being sent to the datacontext in the submitchanges methods

707320
submitchanges	datacontext
where ctx is the current instances of your datacontext and then you ll be able to tracking all the changes that will be effective on the submitchanges call

707332
boost	stl
no boost just stl please

707345
space	input
this means that there are inevitably multiple different input which will give the same output but they re incredibly thinly spread across an incredibly large space

silverlight	wpf
if anyone has already implemented the taligent pattern in .net i would like to know if it is applies to both silverlight and wpf

707387
versioning	migrate

707407
selected	button
you will need to search the directory on all possible places and show the user radio button each bounded to a search results to selected where to install the the new prodcut

707408
binary-tree	nodes
for example think about a class that wants to walk a binary-tree inorder and do something at each nodes

707427
button	popup
then if you double click on the button after creating it in design view it should popup a function in the code behind page

707439
nested	order
the order of disposal in this case is still the same as the nested blocks ie the streamreader will still dispose before the filestream in this case

707464
credentials	security
there you can choose what security mode none transport message transportwithmessagecredentials do you want to use and then for each particular mode you can customize security settings things like credentials type - username windows certificate etc.

707466
any	set
that is you can set classes on any element not just so just name the element you want to change

707470
value	field
if you are interested only in years and not in days then you could build a custom field with custom editor and store the year value as integer value

707471
dictionary	arrays
you can use associative arrays instead because i don t think it s possible to check the length of a dictionary object

707471
methods	extend
you could however extend the dictionary class and add that functionality and override the corresponding methods

707473
csv	xml
i m also aware of the -h and -x options to format output in html and xml respectively but is there no way to output csv format directly to the screen

707476
esapi	owasp
owasp antisamy and owasp esapi

707476
esapi	xss
of these i would vote for esapi since i ve used the java version of esapi to prevent xss attacks

707491
order	add
just to add sortable columns involved several code-intensive steps one to create and maintain a shadow-data-structure that provided the actual sort order another to make it possible to show graphic-sort-direction-triangles in the column header and there were a couple more i don t remember

707491
sharpdevelop	monodevelop
it looks to me like that definitely is the case with sharpdevelop and monodevelop i.e ironpython can t be used to do design-time gui building

707496
configuration	environment
is it possible to use different configuration files with the different configuration info on them for each environment

707502
python	java
the article contains a 20-line implementation in python as well as links to several reimplementations in c c++ c# and java

707504
perl	php
the only other solution i would suggest is to write a script in perl or php to fetch data from mysql and output it in csv format or any other format you want

707526
ubuntu	debian
it s available in debian ubuntu repositories

707527
.net	wcf
.net and it s set of functionality remoting in the early versions of framework and wcf nowadays are replacement for com com+

707555
python	java
you may want to look at jython python on the java vm

707556
authentication	login
public browser consumable web-services are often protected by session cookies -- i.e requires a valid login to the web site then the standard session authentication mechanism is used for requests via ajax to web-services

707560
web-services	security
there is a protocol specifically for web-services security ws-security

707562
ip-address	hostname
why don t you try using the ip-address instead of the dynamic hostname

707570
esapi	owasp
owasp esapi

707600
perl	php
assuming you want to concentrate on writing web apps then perl php python and ruby are all fine choices i myself use perl predominantly and i d suggest doing some research into the popular web frameworks available for each language

707609
eclipse-tptp	hprof
i know the eclipse-tptp and other tools can monitor jvmti data on the fly but i need a solution that can process the generated hprof files after the fact since the deployed machine only has a jre not a jdk install

following evilpenguin s comment of course if you are embedding a swf you cannot recompile you will have to set this value external from within the html embed

707702
javascript	dom
ie pre-8 doesn t know the difference between a dom attribute and a javascript property which can easily result in many really weird problems

707702
attributes	properties
the full list of boolean attributes in html 4.01 and hence xhtml 1.0 is with properties names where they differ in case

707706
any	set

707757
perl	lua
php is supported by swig as are perl and lua the targets i ve personally used

707793
type-safety	generics
it would be a difficult feature to implement given that the default type for a parameter would have to adhere to the generics constraints and would most likely create headaches when the clr tried to ensure type-safety

707796
short	zero
the only way to encrypt data that falls short of eight bytes or a multiple of eight is to pad it out in this case with zero

707800

2 in php i m thinking i can get these orphaned id s from mysql into an arrays then run a foreach loops and delete each

707875
.when	ready
you can easily create a workflow to get information from each supplier then merge the results .when ready

707909
ref	out
updates i realized that the returned func will go out of scope at the end of the methods so i don t need a weakref at all and a normals ref will work just fine

707910
oracle	mysql
unfortunately mysql does not have native support for hierarchical queries unlike for example oracle where you could use connect by to achieve what you want

707916
fckeditor	nicedit
i have looked at tinymce fckeditor yui rich text-editor nicedit and some others but i was wondering if there is one out there that utilises jquery

707922
entity-framework	ado.net
perhaps the ado.net entity-framework is a better choice

707952
value	field
there are about 100 entries with a known value field which need to be removed

java provides binary object serialization using the objectoutputstream and objectinputstream

708023
hosts-file	hosts
edit solution i had to add the internal 192.168.204.xxx ip into the hosts so that resolved correctly

708032
hosts-file	hosts
and mentions that a possible fix is by modifying your hosts to explicitly include the ip dns of the server you re accessing

708033
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
i have a uiviewcontroller that is pushed onto a uinavigationcontroller and is currently displayed

708040
hide	show
i understand the point of a javascript library how many times have i written animation getelementsbyclass and hide show functions

perl	lua
php is supported by swig as are perl and lua the targets i ve personally used

708080
cos	sin
the true north vector at latitude lat longitude lng is given by -sin lat cos lng -sin lat sin lng cos lat

cos	sin
- sin lat cos lng cos th + sin lng sin th

708080
cos	sin
- sin lat sin lng cos th - cos lng sin th

708080
cos	sin
to find a vector perpendicular to that motion vector you can just take the cross product of the radius vector that is the vector pointing from the centering of the earth to your point cos lat cos lng cos lat sin lng sin lat with the motion vector

708082
chain-of-responsibility	strategy-pattern
strategy-pattern chain-of-responsibility interpreter etc.

708082
primitive	int
java isn t trying to make everything act like a primitive int value class

708100
put	get
introducing unit tests into development process is like investment you have to put some money up front to get profit later

708106
using-declaration	typedef
in this way a using-declaration is a lot like a typedef int ourint

708129
contains	elements
the above converts the elements inside a list of users to just the text contains therein

708131
firefox	safari
one thing i don t see mentioned is that the library is written to work cross browser on a wide range of popular browsers and platforms ie6+ firefox 2+ safari 3+

708133
return-type	arguments
if the dlls are valid dlls and the functions exported use well-known calling conventions then there should be no problem as long as you get the methods signature in .net right i.e correct arguments types and return-type

708138
unmanaged	c++-cli
you can also create a c++-cli dll clr option when compiling which will allow you to write both in managed and unmanaged code

708172
contains	elements
at this point these objects are contains very few data elements

708200
freebsd	ubuntu
i just tested your sample code on two different unix systems ubuntu and a freebsd box for the record

remote-debugging	debugging
winpdb is a platform independent graphical gpl python debugger with support for remote-debugging over a network multiple threads namespace modification embedded debugging encrypted communication and is up to 20 times faster than pdb

708202
format-patch	repo
is there any way to get a patch created with git format-patch to be svn compatible so that i can submit it to an svn repo

708219
contains	elements
map is a high-order function that enables you to apply certain function to a given sequence generating a new resulting sequence contains the values of each original elements with the value of the applied function

708249
vbscript	basic
i have a asp.net background but clearquest is very wizard like and the only code that i ve seen is called basic and it looks a lot like vbscript

708265
getter	setter
refactorit also has code-generation tools like encapsulate field where you selected multiple fields in the package view wherever and it automatically creates getter and or setter also same thing for constructors..

708269
vbscript	perl
you can use perl or vbscript to write cc cq hooks

708271
boost	stl
stl existed before boost showed up

708279
value	field
you just split it up into three field and check the individual value

708283
message	alert
when you say it works in those other browsers do you mean you get the alert popup message or do you just mean the tag makes it into the dom tree

708297
32-bit	64bit
remember that you re not compiling your application for vista or windows-xp rather you re compiling for a 32-bit or 64bit operating system

708297
32-bit	64bit
if your application needs to support other versions of windows than 64bit vista then specify in your build options to be 32-bit

708317
environment	execution
as you know each activity is also a context which is information about its execution environment in the broadest sense

708324
rewrite	rule
i think normally the request_uri would be in your rewrite rule

abstract-class	subclassing
in this program both mainmode and testmode are subclassing of the abstract-class game

708336
constructor	object
now i want to replace this line with a factory pattern although i am unsure as my testmode constructor requires an extra object and i am unsure where i would need to pass this value

708340
cassini	iis
1. ensure that the web application is fully running in iis and not cassini addresses

708351
constructor	private
you could modify it to use final and then create a private constructor

708352
default	reset
what s the best way to reset the properties back to their initial hard-coded default

708360
value	field
you d probably need to save the value off in private field so that they can be restored later

708381
python	java
one thing that takes a lot of work to remember when getting started is that python is not java

708381
static-class	inherited
if your example is getting more complicated or you want to do fancy things like inheritedance you can inherited static-class methods

708384
derived-class	base-class
is there a shortcut of some kind in c# vs 2008 to automatically implement the virtual and abstract base-class methods in a derived-class

708387
ip-address	hostname
in order to notify all computers within the same lan about my existence i want to broadcast my hostname and ip-address

708419
contains	lookup
secondly the big compound clustered index you re trying to create will significantly increase the size of all your non-clustered indices since they contains the whole clustered index value on each leaf node for the bookmark lookup

708422
strategy-pattern	factory-pattern
so now you know about the factory-pattern and strategy-pattern and how they re similar in shape but different in how they re used factory-pattern is object creational and returns an object to be used

708431
.when	ready
add an onload handler to it that will get called .when the image is ready - you can then inspect it s size and attach it where needed

708441
show	next
next time that user tries to place a purchase the pad is sent to the server and if the server can properly decode its encrypted data it show the credit card information as already being filled

708441
scheme	let
let me know where you think this scheme is horribly failing

708449
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and safari i get an error that myvalue is undefined

708449
javascript	dom
the settimeout delays enough for the dom to be updated and the javascript to be loaded in most cases

708449
google-chrome	firefox
firefox tends to load this improved code correctly all the time while google-chrome and safari manage to get the value about 50 of the time

708473
spaces	output
as best as i can tell you can t get exactly that output with the commas and no spaces

708476
payment	billing
use a payment processor that will securely store the cc and handle billing paypal

708483
hashtable	set
now i want that when the user-controls is called its header is also set dynamically by searching that hashtable

708514
google-chrome	firefox
use firebug in firefox or inspect element in google-chrome

708525
linked-list	arrays
now you can convert an arrays into a linked-list in o n and you can copy the data back into the arrays in o n

708530
contains	elements
if i compare the string containsing the html i want to insert with the destination page source after injection the mshtml s source will literally contains everything except for the elements and its underlying source

708548
getter	setter
just make a class similar to your xml structure put in the setter and getter for the fields and a xmlrootelement annotations to the top of the class

708562
triggers	insert
so what i do is when a new record is insert updated i update the the parent record s down_qty so this would triggers the update triggers recursively

708562
decrement	increment
for example i insert a new account category it needs to increment the down_qty of its parent account_category likewise when i change the account category s parent account_category i need to decrement the down_qty of account_category s previous parent account_category

708590
http-get	get
you can certainly get a single file with nothing more than a simple http-get request to the url but checking back in changes will be more difficult

708593
installation	upgrade
generally you shouldn t be modifying database or table structure at run time - only during installation or upgrade

708593
value	field
what you would do is have a separate table contains all of the custom fields and a table contains all of the value along with the field id and the user id

708596
value	field
the value in the to subject and link field are set with the value entered in the user-interface

708612
webforms	asp.net
i got a problem with a button control in asp.net webforms

708612
asp.net-mvc	webforms
after using asp.net-mvc a bit i started using foreach in the aspx files in webforms too instead of repeaters mostly cause of all the junk viewstate a repeater creates

708621
postgresql	mysql
whether you want to support that or you are happy selling only to for instance oracle customers or only to mysql postgresql customers for example is up to you and what you think your market is

708632
any	set
a property setter is solely there to set the value of a private field not to have any side effects like returning result codes

708639
json	xml
if you decide on xml json or any other more complex formats just forget it and use a library

708639
ostream	std
for using this approach the std istream and std ostream must be opened in binary mode

708648
thread-sleep	synchronized
note that there is one key difference in using object.wait and thread-sleep inside a synchronized block thread-sleep does not release the locked monitor so no-one else can become the owner of the monitor

708655
interpreter	runtime
any other string literals you place in the code will at the worst mean the interpreter will build the string value at runtime and then just throw it away

708657
callback	methods
this makes use of the methods_added callback and compares the new methods name with a list of methodss that you wish to make final

708665
sql-server	mysql
i also like to use certain other server-specific functionality such as query notification in sql-server which mysql doesn t offer

708671
mstest	nunit
here s how attributes map from nunit to mstest

708683
mstest	nunit
i ve used both and in many ways nunit has a lead on mstest

708683
mstest	nunit
the biggest advantage of mstest is imo with the team-coverage integration in the ide - but you can get this with your existing nunit tests via testdriven.net test with - team coverage

708707
variables	boolean
treating it in boolean context tells you if an error occurred - this will also cover things like it being unable to read in a valid integer variables

708719
triggers	insert
same table causing the insert triggers

708775
methodology	waterfall
the frustrations are compounded because of agile methodology and the interpretation of it that says not to do up-front design as against big up-front design in waterfall product owner can change requirements at any time and so son

708779
fflush	gets
you can output and fflush it gets to client before you end the scripting thus it s streaming

708780
xsd	xml
i ve already used a custom xsd to provide intellisense for the xml

708785
hide	show
here s an example of the actual show hide layer

708786
getter	setter
please note that the getter and setter have been omitted from the classes for the sake of clarity

708791
drools	rule
i m thinking of doing a drools pacman game to start to explore about how best to use rule engines for games

708799
postgresql	mysql
i have a site based on python django mysql postgresql

708810
attributes	properties
you can also use the allowhtml attributes on model properties

708814
object-reference	instances
i run the code and i get an error that reads nullreferenceexception was unhandled object-reference not set to an instances of an object

708828
implements	extends
if you add a class to extends the options currently you d add an enum item but don t implements mymethod you ll get a compiler error

708828
having	select
having lots of place s in code where you provide different behaviour in select statements is a smell that you may need to use polymorphism

708851
callback	methods
you can even pass in a delegate as the second parameter to the sendasync methods which will act as a callback and be invoked when the sendasync methods completes

708861
32-bit	64bit
also i note that a 64bit sbcl appears to use literally twice as much memory as 32-bit

708881
google-chrome	firefox
what garry said if youre using google-chrome or firebug plugin for firefox you can right click and inspect element and see a visual representation of how your elemenent is being sized really helps in these situations

708884
margins	padding
the affects of adding padding or margins to an element depend entirely on the browser you re viewing the page in

708884
margins	padding
padding and margins should be additive as garry says but that s not the case with ie6 so you ll need to do some research around browser difference and how you can accommodate them in your style rules

708905
contains	set
see if the manifest.mf in the jar contains the main-class attributes set correctly to the class that is supposed to be invoked if not try setting it

708915
any	set
which doesn t seem to contain any useful indication of the character set

708915
any	set
basically is there any way of telling the character set if i don t know the character set the html originally presented was

708923
any	set
i ve yet to find a solution where i needed any code in the view other than to fetch initial data or set datacontexts

708937
handler	service
is the best approach to write a web service which returns the required xml or to write an ashx handler that outputs the xml

708945
environment	execution
f independed from execution environment memory cpu global-variables member variables as in your case etc

708945
environment	execution
not produce side effect mean - don t changing execution environment

708970
32-bit	64bit
can i create two directories one for the 32-bit dlls and one for the 64bit dlls and the executable picks the right dlls

708980
binaries	install
then you just have two non-intersecting sets of binaries and install one set needed for the target system and never have problems detecting what to load at runtime

708984
json	xml
leading on from ch00k s answer the following blog no it s not mine - has his findings on using asp.net-mvc and making a restful web service to return xml json etc

708988
directory	folder
if you use a folder instead of a grouping then the directory structure is preserved

709002
having	select
in photoshop s save for web and devices dialog how can i choose the file format that all the slices will in without having to go through and select the format for each slice

709014
suffix-tree	skip-lists
i like suffix-tree and arrays for string processing skip-lists for balanced lists and splay tree for automatic balancing tree

709019
switching	screens
if i switching my application to full screens all the input from the keyboard is not handled

709019
keydown	keyup
no textbox input no keydown keyup event and probably much more

709019
switching	screens
is there another way to switching full screens so this will not happen

709024
instances	self
now if bah has to be instances methods have access to self you can still directly access the class-variables

709036
python	java
i just ran across a python package that uses the java-like convention and i wasn t sure what the arguments for and against it are or whether they apply to python in the same way as java

709041
32-bit	64bit
i would not be surprised by a 64bit sbcl using twice the meory as it will probably use a 64bit cell rather than a 32-bit one but couldn t say for sure without actually checking

709041
hashtable	set
typical things that keep memory hanging around for longer than expected are no-longer-useful references that still have a path to the root allocation set hashtable are i find a good way of letting these things linger

709041
global-variables	call
you could try interspersing explicit call to gc in your code and make sure to as far as possible not store things in global-variables

709056
duplicates	sorted
an experienced programmer looks at and instantly knows this is a sorted collection of strings without duplicates and i can be sure that this is true at every moment

709085
logout	login
a sensible way to do this appears to be to have a secure cookie for the real session and a non-secure cookie which is just a flag to say if the user is logged in or not to display different things in the header like a logout link instead of a login link

709085
contains	any
this cookie wouldn t contains any real session information and is just so that the site can show pages slightly differently for logged-in users compared to logged-out ones on http portions of the site

709097
exception-handling	try-catch
if you are expecting the possibility of an exception-handling inside the catch statement simply nest another try-catch in there so that it falls over graciously

709102
reliability	scalability
obviously you don t have all the versatility on app engine that you have with a vps but you also have better scalability and reliability

709120
contains	any
to find that out i d like to list all tables and there columns that contains a certain value in any row

709136
execution	restart
if restart xamp didn t stop it then you will have to give more info on what is happeing since restart xamp should stop the execution of all php scripting

709146
job-queue	queue
i am using std queue for implementing job-queue class

709158
silverlight	wpf
these two 1-hour videos show step-by-step how to use the mvvm pattern to build simple quiz applications in both silverlight and wpf

709184
contentcontrol	itemscontrol
then you just stick your view model instance into a contentcontrol itemscontrol or whatever and wpf will render it with the appropriate datatemplate

709192
.net	wcf
we re building some core services in .net 3.5 and exposing the services via wcf

709201
while-loop	loops
to complete this i ended up creating a while-loops to loops through the form items and then query my data source to hydrate my objects

709207
onfocus	onclick
it s some kind of conflict between onfocus there s no problems if i implement it onclick and setting the size attributes

709209
contains	any
the solution you propose seems like it would work as long as you don t mind non-authorized people being able to view the non-secure http part of the site as if they are logged in - ie as long as the http part of the site does not contains any sensitive information and the only difference between logged in and not-logged-in users is something harmless in the header

709218
keyboard	mouse
you should note that afterselect occurs only once after node selection changed whether via keyboard or by mouse

709292
windows-xp	windows
the msstdfmt.dll appears to be available on windows-xp and windows 2003 servers

709295
administration	account
this requires that your local account matches an account w administration privileges on the remote server as well

709299
windows-xp	windows
it seems the wmic command is only available on the professional versions of windows-xp windows vista and windows 7

709312
video-encoding	wmv
real-time wmv video-encoding in c#

709317
perl	php
it has bindings for perl php and python

709331
mstest	nunit
how can i configure a .net solution c# .net 2.0 to to allow other developers to make use of the same unit tests for the solution using either nunit or mstest

709333
contains	any
the execution plan does not contains any sort anymore and the number of steps in the execution plan is less than half of original which i hope is also faster.

709334
mstest	nunit
also you need to replace all instances of the nunit s test attributes on your methods to make use of the mstest testmethod attributes or vice versa

709365
instances	destroy
i have a class instances that attempts to load an xml file and if the file is not found i want to destroy the instances preferably from inside itself

709385
function-calls	main
my main issue is that this is actually adding a lot more function-calls to the program

709394
environment	building
in particular if the building environment takes a while to set up

709407
dependency-management	build-process
in my opinion the code repository should only contains source code as well as third party libraries required to compile this source code also the third party libraries might be retrieved with some dependency-management tool during the build-process

709414
png	gif
i need to read one image file jpg png gif and i need add one line text to it

709436
repository	entity
my take on this is that model binders should be constructing presentation models not entity types from your repository

709436
repository	entity
having to materialize entity instances from a repository adds a lot of complication as you have found

709436
repository	entity
if they re happy you can then build the repository entity model and write a linq query to map that to your presentation model

709452
savepoints	rollback
you could also use savepoints to save try an insert except integrityerror then rollback and do an updates instead

709465
mstest	nunit
i strongly prefer nunit over mstest

709472
constructor	object
usually you ll want to validate in a constructor if only because that means your object will always be in a valid state

709484
environment	building
in five years from now you ll certainly be using different compilers and different building environment that may happen to not be able to compile today s versioning of your project for whatever reason

709484
environment	building
this way you give your users the option to checkout either projectname trunk to get the full building environment or projectname trunk source to get the source of the application

709488
progress-bar	progress
my progress-bar properly displays the progress whilst it is reading from the database

709494
selected	checkbox
have the following jquery that makes the header checkbox selected all

709498
mstest	nunit
we started out with mstest but converted to nunit

709507
shutdown	restart
i have a vague idea that you might need to save shutdown and restart after he first replace but try it first to be sure

709519
filtering	sorting
if you need a good visualization then go for excel where you can apply sorting and filtering and also have the possibility to create graphs

709536
highlight	selected
to set the highlight the tree component s selected property must point to the object in the arraycollection that has been selected

709562
selected	listbox
how to remove selected items from listbox when a datasource is assigned to it in c#

709566
rad-controls	telerik
telerik has rad-controls for silverlight the contextmenu control can be attached to tree views

709580
credentials	security
i have an http service connfigured to use transport security and i hope windows credentials

709586
value	field
we must have something like a servergetrecord controllers function which returns to the clientgetrecord function a simple string contains the current record field value separated by comma and using classic ado database handling

709617
contains	any
the thought behind this is that innermost contains the functionality and outer contains any special modifications needed to make innermost -controls work in a particular framework

709621
return-value	arguments
using a non-deterministic function in a deterministic manner i assume means that you ensure that the range of arguments you will pass to the function is such that the return-value will be deterministic ie

709632
environment	building
it also enables testers to easily switching between tags without needing a full building environment

709639
arrays	loops
i then loops through each of the ext.data.record objects placing the data i need into an arrays this_column push that arrays onto the end of another arrays columns and eventually pass this to an ext.grid.columnmodel object

709639
arrays	loops
this behavior continues until the loops reaches the end of the ext.data.store object when the entire arrays consists of the same value

709644
virtualization	vmware
vmware virtualization or other similar products are ideal for this type of thing

709644
environment	building
building an entire development building or test environment and leave it setup just for that purpose

709658
registration	login
then ensure that your login registration and possibly forgotten password pages are accessable to all users using the location element

709673
arrays	loops
after a bit more toying with it i moved altered the code to reset the this_column arrays on each iteration of the loops - seems to have fixed the issue.

709683
value	field
the text field will change to correctly reflect the value of somefield whenever propertychanged this new propertychangedeventargs somefield is called from the source

709686
binary-data	chunks
this should give you most of the information you would need to be able to process an arbitrary chunks of binary-data into the aforementioned packets storage schema

709704
webforms	asp.net
replacement for asp.net webforms

709712
value	field
when i create a view do a validation if i left that field blank it will consider it as 0 so i can not compare it with 0 because if someone insert a value 0 then it will be considered as error

709715
vbscript	vb6
if you re using vbscript vb6 just move the ampersand and pound sign up to the top of this list and don t rely on this function to protect you against sql injection

709720
google-chrome	firefox
they do drop down in ie6 firefox and google-chrome

709724
webforms	asp.net
in a nutshell asp.net mvc offers better modularity and testability than asp.net webforms

709746
highlight	selected
say you needed to show the tab s selected via something like highlight

709752
put	get
also if you are encoding the text before you put it in the database you may get problems with it later

709776
command-pattern	mvvm
how should i handle multiple events per control w command-pattern using mvvm in silverlight

709793
stderr	stdout
foo runs for a long time without stdin or stdout stderr activity

709793
stderr	stdout
bar is a client of foo and runs with stdout stderr but no stdin activity

709800
quirks-mode	doctype
the doctype tag has to be the first tag in the source otherwise ie will render the page in quirks-mode

709801
python	java
implementations in languages like perl java or python are acceptable

709801
python	java
while this would make dual maintenance an issue it would mean i wouldn t have to install perl java python etc.

709848
perl	tcl
note that if you re not a tcl fan there are expect modules for perl python java

709864
space	input
unfortunately whenever the textbox receiving the scanned characters is focused the input panel appears at the bottom of the screen blocking almost a third of the screen space

709906
compact-framework	.net
have also seen links to libraries in perl and .net among others and have started work myself on a simple .net compact-framework 3.5 library for interacting with the bunny from my mobile phone

709918
pylons	django
lots of people use it with django but as the above example shows it will work fine with pylons and can be used with turbogears2 just as easily

709919
firefox	opera
this seems to be a cross site scripting security restriction that webkit and opera impliment and ie and firefox ignore

709945
bugzilla	trac
every code change you do everything from a small quick fix to a big new feature will be an issue in jira or rally or bugzilla trac mantis the one you like

709947
ruby-on-rails	grails
originally i planned on using grails spring mvc ruby-on-rails or one of the web frameworks to handle the back end of my application

709950
getlasterror	createfile
to see if there is a permissions problem accessing that file the createfile call will also fail but with a different getlasterror

709962
.net-assembly	ildasm
you can use either reflector or ildasm msil disassembler to get the il of any member in any .net-assembly

709979
primitive	int
int is not a primitive class.isprimitive is not lying

709988
revision	svn
once you ve committed that change the file will not be part of the head revision in svn

710008
void	main
public static void main string arguments

710008
void	main
public static void main java.lang.string

710016
authentication	login
the only thing i think i would miss from webforms is the masterpages the session management authentication based on windows login and possibly validators although they have some quirks too

710016
selected	button
when you press the save button the data from the grouping row must be updated just data from a selected no modification in database as

710016
updating	updates
trying to updates a record from code behind is really quirky and still have no clue about updating the display

710019
double	int
you could create a utility methods to check whether the object s class is int double etc

710020
value	field
so what i did in my page is if i didn t want them to be able to edit a field like your book name above i would use a hidden-field to wrap the value up in a control that asp.net-mvc can get at via magic and then also display that value to the user

710021
exception-handling	try-catch
i was reading a couple of articles a while back which i think described a behaviour where you can in a .net application specifically vb.net allow an exception-handling to occur and then handle it in some kind of application-level exception-handling handler as opposed to within a try-catch block

710047
ruby-on-rails	grails
grails ruby-on-rails springmvc my use ajax and aid in exposing rest services but the bulk of what they provide is an easy way to make an application that must generate html on the server deal with form submissions and handle sessions in a request response cycle

710065
attributes	properties
i have a generic class that i am using reflection to pull out the properties of the type of the generic and looking for an attributes

710076
required	checked
i could use subversion to share the files between the projects but i believe that this would required me to checked the files in and out again all the time if i am developing a user-controls that i have to test through one of the webapps

710085
blacklist	whitelist
another suggestion is for you to look into the built-in .net libraries for encoding specifically the microsoft.security.application.antixss library which i find it to be better than system.web.httputility.htmlencode because it uses a whitelist approach rather than a blacklist approach

710096
google-chrome	firefox
the above works on windows in ie6 7 8 firefox 2 3 opera 9.6 and google-chrome 1

710101
required	checked
if the user tries to submit such a form you can checked on the client to disallow it and on the server you don t have to do anything the user will get a a value is required message back

710109
google-chrome	firefox
it s available natively in safari google-chrome firefox and opera and available by using explorercanvas in ie which is a simple wrapper that makes ie s vml language accessible from a canvas compatible interface

710140
directory	folder
in order to share controls between web apps the only way i found was to either rewrite them into server controls or to use virtual directory to make the user-controls actually in folder be in each project

710144
cassini	iis
this requires you to use iis for development not cassini and visual-studio won t believe that the controls really exist but it will work at runtime and you can build just fine with only warnings about blahblah.ascx or blahblah.master path invalid

710150
richtextbox	textblock
make richtextbox look like textblock focusable false borderthinkness 0 borderbrush white ....etc

710153
triggers	insert
are there triggers on the table you re insert into

710166
compression	streaming
you do want compression since it 1 makes cryptanalysis harder 2 uses less bandwidth and 3 takes less cpu to compress + encrypt than to encrypt the raw data streaming

710167
contains	elements
also because your form does not contains an input elements for the id that is not being sent to the server even with a regular form submission

710182
value	field
datareader request the query executes fine however when trying to access a datetime field i m getting mysqlconversionexception unable to convert mysql date time value to system.datetime

710188
arrays	loops
i m building a linq query using a loops that appends predicates using an arrays

710215
apache-config	.htaccess
you can either configure it in your apache-config file or within a .htaccess file in the directory s root

710222
order	add
if you need to break ties you can add as many columns as necessary to the order by

710239
positioning	sidebar
so as you can see from the sidebar i set a fixed width make it positioning fixed and then set a background

710249
methods	extend
therefore create an interface it doesn t event have to have any methods in it and when you re dynamically building up the type extend that interface using the overload i linked you to

710253
c++	lua
i m interested in both c++ and lua

710255
any	set
i have data that is timestamped with a datetime column and i want to filtering it down to the set of records where the datetime is between 9 30am and 5 30pm for any day

710259
json	xml
through django you produce your xml responses although i suggest you to use json which is easier to handle on the web browser side

710259
javascript	dom
once you have something that generates your reply on server side you have to code the javascript code that invokes it through the asynchronous call gets the result in json and uses it to do something clever on the dom tree of the page

710259
scriptaculous	dojo
scriptaculous is cool and dojo as well but my absolute favourite is mochikit because they focus on a syntax which is very pythonic so it will hide you quite well the differences between javascript and python

710280
rollback	commit
just rollback untill i m at the place where i want edit then commit

710286
c++	lua
this is true of c++ and lua which implements only ansi c functionality

710307
javascript	dom
for your own custom javascript attributes the dom is naturally extensible aka expando true the simple upshot of which is that you can do and subsequently read it without issue

710311
postgresql	rdbms
oracle postgresql sql server and many more rdbms engines have analytic functions called lag and lead that do this very thing

710319
protected	public
you can set the option to only generate documentation for public protected classes but i do not know if that will fit your scenario

710321
erlang	python
for others c# or python or erlang

710322
ngen	aot
c# can be natively compiled using tool such as ngen and the mono open source .net team has developed full aot ahead of time compilation which allows c# to run on the iphone

710341
selected	cell
how can i add arrow key navigation and cell editing when the user selected the cell

710361
contains	any
you can then do your changes in the newly-cloned repository which will not contains any of the history that came after the revision number you specified and then merge those changes back into the original later if you wish

710379
httplistener	http.sys
using httplistener will wrap http.sys which will give us some of the performance statistics we require out of the box

710379
httplistener	http
so why is httplistener a bad candidate for http proxy work

710386
implements	extends
does object specify methods that classes extends it must implements in order to be useful

710396
constructor	object
i have found its better to just use setters for any properties i want the control to have versus trying to use the passed in object arrays for my constructor

710430
cvs	git
i d recommend running git locally while continuing to use your cvs server when you have a connection to it

710438
activerecord	datamapper
lastly if you have the freedom to choose your language you could try ruby s activerecord a ruby-on-rails package or datamapper or sequel

710448
contains	set
i have a set of .net assemblies all under the same directory and some of those contains classes which implement an abstract class

710456
db2-connect	ibm
ibm s db2-connect supports distributed transactions managed by windows dtc

710489
hosts-file	hosts
will an entry in the hosts suffice or if not is there any other way that i can go this

710493
double	int
this prints derived.foo double - even though the compiler knows there is a matching methods with a parameter of type int and the argument is type int and the conversion from int to int is better than the conversion from int to double the fact that only the foo double methods is originally declared in derived means the compiler ignores foo int

710530
any	set
in the great majority of cases you will only be returning a single result set with any given call so it would not make sense for the designers to have required a nextresultset every time you use a reader

710544
iteration	elements
on the first iteration it passes in the value you provided as the starting value and the first elements of the list and it saves the value that your block returned in this case result + elements

710544
iteration	elements
it then runs the block again passing in the result from the first iteration as the first argument and the second elements from the list as the second argument again saving the result

710545
value	field
if you wanted a long-term solution you would want to index your widget field in the widget_ids table and you would want to make sure that a value was entered for each new widget

710546
value	field
the formatting code when the row gets the focus changes the value field to a dropdown combobox if the testcode is of type systemlist

710546
value	field
when the user chooses a value in the list it translates into a number which goes into the value field

710546
value	field
there are issues if you are putting integer decimal value into a string field

710546
value	field
the users now want to put strings into the value field as well as numbers values from a list and i m wondering what the best way of doing that would be

710546
value	field
another option would be to create a 1-1 relationship to another table and if the user types in a string into the value field it adds it into the new table with a key of a number

710558
ironpython	ironruby
the dlr does sound cool and interesting but i m not sure i d end up using it much at least in terms of interoperating with ironruby ironpython

710559
arguments	default
a default ctor is one that can be called with no arguments

710559
arguments	default
or every arguments must have a default

710575
integer	numeric
yes this ruins the ability to do numeric sorting and you won t be able to do a cast or convert on the column any longer since text will be intermingled with integer values but i think any other methods would be too complex to maintain properly

710576
wamp	php
can iis supporting asp.net and wamp supporting php coexist on the same server

710576
wamp	php
we already have a wamp stack setup on a windows server 2003 box to support some internal php applications and i want to also setup ci factory on that box which will try to configure iis to support it s asp.net based dashboard

710584
configuration	environment
i have turned activerecord off in my ruby-on-rails app in the environment configuration

710597
superclass	subclass
my superclass does not handle any jaxb annotations it doesn t have to and i would like my subclass not to include superclass properties while marshalling

710602
value	field
i d convert the value field to string and add a column indicating what the datatype should be treated as for post processing and reporting

710603
any	set
for any reasonable large set of code if you you will likely be cementing it into the module unable to be removed

710605
sql-server	mysql
i have a couple smf forums that are php mysql based and i have a web application that is .net 3.5 sql-server 2005 based and they run just fine

710609
libxml2	libxslt
particular examples of such modules are libxslt and libxml2

710617
put	get
i am unable to find a place to put this code such that i do not get the dreaded datagridviewcomboboxcell value is not valid.

710620
any	set
use the session_key as set in the cookie to make any api calls

710626
constructor	object
1 this check is to ensure that the super constructor returned a new object

710638
ubuntu	linux
something like blat but it would also support ssl connections and can be used in both windows xp and 2003 and linux ubuntu 6.06 and 8.04

710648
python	java
i do not want to go through 500+ pages of books because i know c# java ruby python and even x86 assembly as well

710650
recording	playing
i wrote a winmm library wrapper library that exposes waveout and wavein classes for the purpose of recording and playing raw audio streams

710664
derived-class	base-class
second is you should not assign derived-class object to base-class object

710666
keyboard	mouse
try to hook a second keyboard monitor mouse up to your existing laptops if possible or use screen sharing software and standardize on an ide

710667
selected	listbox
my requirement is when user clicks on reference link referenced word is selected in listbox control and shown in flowdocumentscrollviewer

710671
boost	stl
start learn boost boost.org it will be good way to refresh c++ and stl

710674
textbox	button
if the user is going to be required to click a button to confirm a single entry then i don t think you should continue to store the information in the same textbox provide a visual separation with a bunch of dashes rather move the text entered from the input to a more formatted display set of controls

710684
httplistener	http
httplistener is in .net to provide a major building block for a simple http server

710698
double	int
the problem is that the 3 implementation work fine on int or double data that are not as long but when i tried anyone of these 3 implementations on my data representing the graph i got different result each time and not even the good ones

710700
void	main
with some c compilers it s possible to have main return void even though the standard requires main to return int

710710
arrays	loops
if you pass a string that doesn t match any of the ap_zero through ap_hash your program will likely crash as the loops starts dereferencing garbage beyond the end of your arrays

710716
contains	elements
the base case is foo mylist.count mylist which returns a list contains one elements the empty string

710725
contains	any
and most page contains very few if any server controls

710737
assign	add
when assign to the currdict pointers the compiler checks that the types are compatible which in this case means that you can only add top-level const qualifiers not remove as you do

710774
base-class	inherited
you could create a base-class that all your models inherited from

710780
show	next
if you go to the dataset it show keys next to both columns and says that there is a constraint with both columns being checked

710804
actionscript	mxml
then in the actionscript part or you could set this in the mxml too if you d like

710811
while-loop	infinite
to my understanding only the first list should output something because the dictionary pointer is being changed in the list function and will eventually point to null otherwise we would be in an infinite while-loop in the list call

710820
vbscript	basic
understand the basic of vbscript it s relatively tiny

710821
environment	building
upgrading the flex sdk to building 4852 alleviates the symptoms and i can building projects successfully in a number of environment

710846
messagebox	alert
i put the messagebox hello call into my scripting block directly and the alert showed so it s possible

710863
log4net	nlog
edit we have no existing dependencies to either nlog or log4net

710871
delphi	c++
you should be aware that the vcl used by c++ builder is written entirely in delphi objectpascal

710872
document	editing
i wrote a blog on how to get an external link for editing a sharepoint document

710882
digits	base
the base 64 digits in ascending order

710885
highlight	cell
in case it helps anyone else here s what i used to highlight a particular cell in a table with a highlight that decays to nothing

710898
selected	button
when you use the selected all option for this report parameter and press the view report button the parameter is reset to blank and your report is not generated

710933
directory	folder
it is an odd behaviour seen only on solaris that when i try to copy a symbolic link with the cp -r -p command to some other folder with a different name it copies the entire directory file it s pointing to

710945
bitwise-operators	operators
note that this is not using logical operators but actually bitwise-operators

710959
jruby	mri
mri has pretty lousy threading concurrency support so if that s what your aiming for jruby is probably a better place to go

710978
pivot-table	crosstab
what you are looking for is a pivot-table or crosstab report

710985
reflection	runtime
enums are not meant to change at runtime so this is a reflection hack

710985
value	field
sorry i don t have the spring implementation part but you could just build a bean to take in the enum class or object and another field that would be the new value or values

710996
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox 3.0.8 google-chrome 1.0.154.53 ie6

711000
python	ruby
for example see differences in code using closures lambdas in lisp python ruby etc

711011
right-to-left	hebrew
all of them are written in hebrew a right-to-left language but mixed with english words

711014
configuration	logging
check for multiple logging configuration

711042
windows-server	windows
you can configure windows error reporting which showed you the problem needs to close ui on windows-server 2008 to always collect a dump file that you can then debug

711044
nsxmlparser	nsurl
i m not sure if you re doing iphone programming or not but for the record in the nsxmlparser class reference in the iphone 3.0 beta 2 sdk initwithcontentsofurl nsurl url does not appear to be deprecated

711052
implements	extends
in other words because bar only implements ifoo by virtue of extends foo you cannot use explicit implementation

711052
implements	abstract
a bigger problem that you ll probably face is that since foo is not abstract it must implements doa and dob

711058
postgresql	mysql
you can t expect everyone that runs firefox to have mysql or postgresql installed on their machine

711065
instance-variables	class-variables
if the value of s is set once and not reinitialized - you could make it a class-variables as opposed to an instance-variables of testserver and then have the handler retrieve it via a class methods of testserver in the handler s constructor

711079
postgresql	mysql
rather than bundling a huge db engine like mysql or postgresql with your deliverable sqlite is very lightweight and easy to include with your finished app

711091
oracle	mysql
i also find that using sqlite is good for getting a prototype application together pretty quickly without the overhead of having a seperate db server or bogging a development environment with an instance of mysql oracle whatever

711100
udp	tcp
i m trying to find a simple tcp udp debugging tool

711116
bugzilla	fogbugz
for issue tracking we ve looked at bugzilla fogbugz bugtracker.net sourcegear fortres and bugnet

711128
any	set
given that your database is at baseline any result set is deterministic as long as your sp is deterministic less so if it does a selected random

711129
dataadapter	oledb
suppose i have my typed dataset defind in the xsd file and now i m ready to create a dataadapter in code against that schema... by the way i am using oledb to access free-standing .dbf files in a folder.

711145
reportbuilder	fastreport
there are lots of other reporting solutions for delphi most of them commercial fastreport reportbuilder rave reports quick reports etc.

711145
report-designer	reportmanager
the good news i think the open source reportmanager has a stand-alone visual report-designer that lets you design and save report definitions

711147
python	java
smalltalk lacks the vendor support that java and c# have think of that in terms of the companies selling their wares and the coolness factor that ruby python etc have

711159
default-value	default
i thought about doing this with a default constraint but i don t think that will work if the default-value has a dependency

711165
iteration	elements
when no argument is passed to inject the first two elements are passed into the first iteration

711166
value	field
for example the field value would be

711178
triggers	insert
i would use a triggers on insert

711190
value	field
if you imagine xy trend then data field will be y coordinates category field will be x coordinates and series field will be value for grouping data in different lines

711190
value	field
talking about chart usually data field are for value category field are for dates and series field may be products or departments

711190
value	field
category and series field may be switched but usually field with a lesser amount of descent value are chosen for series field

711198
installation	upgrade
this was mainly done to facilitate easier upgrade but it also has the side-effect of making it very easy to backup a nexus installation

711198
archive	backup
if you need to create a complete backup just archive the contents of the sonatype-work nexus

711199
grouping	sorting
sorting in gridview will result in effectively a grouping

711210
calayer	uiview
so as gold thumb says you can do this by accessing the uiview s calayer

711243
instances	self
in objective-c it s possible to return an instances other than self from -init

711243
instances	self
which reassigns self to the value of so that self points to the actual instances that returned

711243
instances	self
note that you must return self or nil or an other instances from the init methods

711269
truncation	formatting
trying to get clobs and longs from command-line utilities like sql plus always seems to give me formatting truncation problems

711324
value	field
but when they submit and the page reloads i ve made the form field sticky based on the _post value the reset doesn t work

711348
subtract	add
will work because newvalues is going to be static when i need to add or subtract from the current value of the field

711363
selected	checkbox
just noticed i get these errors if i don t selected a checkbox and submit

711367
javascript	dom
to me it makes available the css view of the dom while writing javascript - which makes traversal and manipulation much more intuitive

711371
contains	any
.trx files don t actually contains any information on the project that they are for

711380
installation	packaging
now you could get away with this if every python package ever distributed required an installation process that searched for the com folder and then the domain and so on and so on but this makes packaging considerably harder destroys drag-and-drop capability and makes packaging and all-out nuisance

711385
linux	osx
i would definitely say it looks blurry - kind of like as if you were viewing this on osx or linux

711385
silverlight	wpf
if you are working with silverlight you can wait until some future release until this is fixed same for wpf

711385
silverlight	wpf
i guess what i m trying to say is this there is a solution for wpf winforms yes winforms cleartypegridfit isn t the best algorithm either but there isn t a solution for silverlight

711397
having	select
after running lots of queries yesterday on multiple tables having a clob type i came to the conclusion that as soon as there is a clob in the select clause even if the value if null empty the query takes a huge performance hit

711398
handler	service
write a custom axis2 handler that backward-converts the newer ws-addressing stuff that comes out of axis2 into the older stuff expected by the service

711411
nskeyedarchiver	plist
because nskeyedarchiver gives you the memento-stored-by-key behaviour without actually being an nsdictionary - and has the added bonus that it can archive many objects which plist serialization doesn t automatically support

711413
literals	hardcode
i want to populate a dropdown with value from database and constant hardcode literals using linq

711414
invokerequired	begininvoke
that s the interface that control implements with invoke begininvoke endinvoke invokerequired

711417
triggers	insert
be sure to write the triggers so it will handle multi-row insert

711417
triggers	insert
do not process one row at a time in a triggers or assume only one row will be in the insert table

711427
postgresql	mysql
consider using copy at least on postgresql - unsure about mysql

711428
margins	padding
play with padding margins settings if

711435
firefox	safari
if you don t want any text this works in safari and firefox didn t test ie

711436
32-bit	64bit
if you don t have any type declarations i would expect 64bit lisp to take twice the space of a 32-bit one

711447
recording	playing
c++ doesn t come with any kind of support for recording processing or playing audio loading or saving audio files or anything else

711459
version-control	git
if you use their version-control hosting svn and git options with their issue tracker you get some good integration stuff going on

711462
c++	lua
edit incidentally the lua solution might also be a sensible c or c++ solution

711467
constructor	object
one of the constructor of a stringwriter object is stringbuilder

711510
overwrite	copying
i m using synctoy 1.4 as my sync tool and it seems to work fine when it s copying new documents from clearcase to sharepoint but it s throwing an error when i try to overwrite a file with a new version or try to delete an existing file in sharepoint because it s deleted in clearcase

711516
value	field
form fields have a way to get the default-value the value the field had when it was loaded and you can compare that against the current value

711535
debugging	trace
if you debugging the application at any moment and examine the call stack you will see it will trace back to that run method

711590
itextsharp	itext
itextsharp c# port of itext

711606
winmerge	ignore
i prefer winmerge which can recursively run though two folders of files has options to ignore whitespace differences and blank lines and even runs well under linux using wine.

711624
arrays	map
write a basic map implementation no need to worry about efficiency there if you need to traverse a whole arrays to find something do it

711625
bimap	map
a bimap or bidirectional map is a map that preserves the uniqueness of its values as well as that of its keys

711627
constructor	private
by the time the constructor on b completes both players will have a theoretical value of 100 in their private members

711627
primitive	int
however because of the superior internals of c# the cli generally considers int and other primitive values values compiled from that language to be higher and those from vb.net to be lower even when they contain the same bits

711647
derived-class	base-class
the constructor of the derived-class implicitly calls the constructor for the base-class

711647
derived-class	base-class
thus the constructor for the base-class is executed before the constructor of the derived-class

711648
value	field
the issue here is that vb is calling the base constructor before setting its field value

711648
base	zero
so the base player class stores zero

711649
assign	add
what happens if you just assign the value to a local-variables on set and then add it to the viewstate from the get on page init load

711668
triggers	insert
i would also think about a database triggers on insert or update to record change details who when what value before value after to a separate audit table

711674
google-chrome	safari
strangely enough this happens in google-chrome but not in safari

711674
background-image	height
i tried making the background-image taller to try and figure out whether i was getting limited by the height of the element or the number of times the background got repeated

711676
facebook	linkedin
social networks like linkedin livejournal tribe and facebook all have the concept that you have friends connections etc

711678
value	field
which according to the msdn means â initialize each field of the value type at a specified address to a null reference or a 0 of the appropriate primitive type.â

711682
system.web	.net
to use the methods that are in the .net framework you must use the system.web namespace to get the htmldecode method

711683
checkbox	button
normally just a couple checkbox in the project properties i think under an advanced button in assembly tab

711687
subtract	add
but arithmetic methods are coded to handle over under-flows such that if you add one to smallinteger maxval you get 2 30 + 1 as an instance of largepositiveinteger and if you subtract one back from it you get back 2 30 as a smallinteger

711704
internet-explorer	firefox
it works in safari and internet-explorer but i haven t seen it work with firefox

711707
google-chrome	safari
i checked your page in safari which uses same engine as google-chrome webkit and the page works fine

711720
firefox	safari
when i use innerhtml from javascript the browser safari and firefox at least seem to replace certain characters and numeric entities with their named entities

711723
attributes	properties
if one of the properties in the object is null then native serialization ignores to add this as the attributes

711734
default	reset
the reset button undoes changes to the form made by the user it doesn t erase default value

711740
gnu-smalltalk	squeak
there are both commercial offerings cincom being the largest player there and open source squeak and pharo which are mostly under the mit license and gnu-smalltalk which is gpl

711745
haskell	lisp
in this case languages like smalltalk and lisp and haskell excel

711771
instrumentation	debugging
well i think some of this should be a design consideration what some might call an enterprise concern - the inclusion of half decent logging tracing and instrumentation will help immensely in debugging especially with a configurable verbosity

711803
arrays	map
once the match is made we can examine what s captured then use a java map also an associative arrays to find the obfuscated token for the matched unobfuscated one

711819
any	set
anyone know of any osx leopard software i can use to set the hotspot

711830
ubuntu	debian
there was a recent update to debian ubuntu which caused this error for me

711867
value	field
i found that contains hello but inside there is a field named value which has the value

711867
value	field
it contains get but the field value contains

711876
value	field
don t worry about the value field - that s just saying that there s a single char arrays contains the text of get hello and both args 0 and args 1 refer to that char arrays but they ll have different offsets and counts

711888
overlapping	z-index
the there is no direct support for overlapping z-index a div either in the api or dom

711904
emacs	nano
and enter the name of the file into the editor that comes up depending on the editor environment variables this will most likely be emacs vi or nano by default

711906
required	checked
this is more efficient than using is and then casting each time as both the is and the cast required execution-time checked

711910
python	c++
when an extension module written in c or c++ has an accompanying python

711913
groovy	scala
on the surface groovy and scala look pretty similar aside from scala being statically typed and groovy dynamic

711915
firefox	safari
it s working fine for both ie and firefox users but safari users are seeing intermittent problems

711916
integer	short
but we can also use a short integer or even a char

711920
object-reference	instances
why do i get object-reference not set to instances of an object

711932
implements	final
the basis rationale and mathematical proof for the prolog language should help you understand most of the concepts you will need to address if not provide the final language you need to use to implements it

711949
uinavigationcontroller	uitableview
switching uitableview sounds like job for uinavigationcontroller to me

711949
switching	screens
you create complete screens in code or as .nib via interface-builder switching between them using uinavigationcontroller or a uitabbar

711967
groovy	scala
there are a handful of syntactic differences between the two as well but functionally i don t see a huge difference between groovy and scala

711967
groovy	scala
in groovy pretty much everything is an instance of java.util.list whereas scala uses both lists and primitive arrays

711967
groovy	scala
scala is faster it seems but the groovy folks are really pushing performance for the 2.0 release

711967
scala	java
scala is a high-performance language that is very java-like without having quite the same level of boilerplate as java

711969
private-key	rsa
in any case most rsa key pairs use 65537 as the public exponent and the modulus is always carried as part of the private-key

711976
directory	folder
as this is presumably the admin screens of your application you probably don t want to make the directory an application in it s own right - if you do you d lose access to the main application below it which isn t what you d want and you ll possibly also have to have a seperate bin folder under there with the admin .dll in

712002
value	field
you can ignore the value field for your purposes

712026
updatepanel	formview
the problem i m having is that as the formview control is in an updatepanel the partial postback does not trigger the page load event when the control goes back to read-only mode and the edit button is not made visible

712054
scala	java
scala is a static language in that it is statically typed and has virtually no dynamic meta-programming beyond the awkward stuff you can do in java

712054
scala	java
note scala s static type system is substantially more uniform and sophisticated than java s

712054
groovy	java
groovy is syntactically influenced by java but semantically influenced more by languages like ruby

712054
scala	java
scala is syntactically influenced by both ruby and java

712054
haskell	sml
it is semantically influenced more by java sml haskell and a very obscure oo language called gbeta

712054
groovy	java
groovy has accidental multiple dispatch due to the way it handles java overloading

712054
groovy	scala
both scala and groovy support a form of multiple inheritance with mixins though scala calls them traits

712054
groovy	scala
scala supports both partial function application and currying at the language level groovy has an awkward curry method for doing partial function application

712054
functional-programming	imperative-programming
that s important in functional-programming but less important in imperative-programming

712054
groovy	scala
both scala and groovy are eagerly evaluated by default

712054
haskell	scala
scala has for comprehensions a generalization of list comprehensions found in other languages technically they re monad comprehensions plus a bit - somewhere between haskell s do and c# s linq

712054
groovy	scala
scala does not have built in selection of arithmetic operators in quite the way that groovy does

712054
groovy	scala
the computer language benchmarks game ranks scala as being between substantially faster than groovy ranging from twice to 93 times as fast while retaining roughly the same source size

712062
decrement	increment
but you can always loop in forwarding order and then use to convert the increment number into a decrement number

712071
random-access	sorted
if you do not need to make random-access modifications a sorted arrays or vector or whatever

712081
double-quotes	spaces
tldr versioning of the specifications spaces angle brackets ampersands equals signs and double-quotes are the only chars that get escaped when innerhtml is called

712098
highlight	selected
i need to write a word-vba macros which will prompt the user to selected some text by highlight it after the macros has started running and then to process the new selectedion

712098
macros	vba
the only problem i have is figuring out how to get the vba macros to pause and allow the user to make this selection

712130
value	field
as a bonus i also learned about what the value field is

712137
default-value	arguments
make an optional arguments with a default-value of null

712145
contains	set
another solution is to have text html modules set up to contains the email contents

712148
swt	rcp
every time eclipse revs their libs you ll find yourself re-writing a bunch of pom files for that newest rcp widget or swt lib

712153
contains	elements
i need to be able to positioning a button or other input elements for that matter to the right of a header elements which also contains text

712154
libxml2	lxml
see a href rel nofollow noreferrer lxml a which is based on a href rel nofollow noreferrer libxml2 a

712162
pascal	basic
microsoft s 4k basic for the altair which you can try out on peter schorn s simh based altair emulator began a period of popularity for basic followed by one for pascal and c c++ and java

712162
smalltalk	lisp
trying to run a smalltalk or lisp system in 4k or 32k or 64k on a 1mhz processor just wasn t particularly practical

712169
traversal	parent
if your data is linearly hierarchical only one parent relation per node and high-read low-write you might consider migrating it to a modified preorder tree traversal structure

712169
children	tree
not only is retrieving data from such a structure extremely efficient single selected and you get all the children you ll be able to delete a whole branch of the tree in a single delete statement as well

712172
getter	setter
if you use getter setter you can perform logic upon changes or access

712187
groovy	java
would anyone care to recommend some and hopefully free or very low-cost tools for troubleshooting this sort of memory consumption in groovy and or java

712190
udp	tcp
the number of locations time as well as the way the location information is transmitted is it tcp udp etc will help determine the optimal approach

712195
attributes	properties
i m assuming you mean exposing properties that would otherwise use getters setters - obviously there s a big difference if you leave all your attributes public

712207
callback	methods
because of that we created an on_file_received callback methods that s triggers on completion of an upload see issue #79 on our issue tracker for details

712207
callback	methods
if you re comfortable in python then it might work out well for you to run pyftpdlib as your ftp server and run your processing code from the callback methods

712207
callback	methods
note that pyftpdlib is asynchronous and not multithreading so your callback methods can t be blocking

712208
google-chrome	firefox
it s 100 ajax -- supported in ie firefox safari and google-chrome

712211
digits	short
or may be 44 44 because of the precision of decimal of 28 to 29 digits plus some room for other characters characters were just to short to generate a small enough number

712220
asp.net-mvc	webforms
would you chose webforms or asp.net-mvc and why

712222
authentication	login
if the authentication mode is windows auth you won t know until you try to connect whether the identity of the current user has login rights

712228
httpresponse	httprequest
these include httpcontext httpresponse httprequest and httpcookie

712244
spring	grails
permgen memory issues are attributed to many of the frameworks on which grails is built including spring hibernate and even sun s own jvm

712246
environment	building
looks like there might be something fishy in your building environment as locale.getisocountries should work just fine

712248
synchronous	.when
i seem to remember getting this error .when a timer event started a query while the ado connection was being used for another synchronous query

712264
put	get
definitely try to boil this down to a minimum three-line program or so compile from the command-line then put that class into your ide and see if you still get the error and if not then change add one line at a time until you have the original failing program looking for what causes the problem

712274
required	checked
i am not sure if the checked for length greater than zero is required nut it is easily integrated

712282
subscript	zero
i m having a hard time trying to implements this methods since arrays subscript in c++ start with zero

712286
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i think more than 90 people will choose asp.net-mvc rather than webforms

712293
circular-buffer	queue
wrapping your data elements is called using a circular-buffer and is common for queue and audio buffers

712295
authentication	login
only users authentication by an asp.net login page can download

712297
put	get
edit to get the rendering time on the page would be relatively hard because by definition the page can t be done rendering until your time is put on the page and you can t have the time until the page is done rendering

712300
32-bit	64bit
change from 32-bit to 64bit system or vice versa affects php internal integer handling bit calculations returns weird results suddenly

712302
stderr	stdout
try just sending stdout to the log file instead of both stderr and stout

712309
tuples	any
we ll do that as a linear transform such that it sorts the same as y m and such that for any y m tuples there is one and only value and all values are consecutive

712332
silverlight	wpf
wpf silverlight

712347
contains	elements
it will depend on what elements are contains within the location tag as to how it will affect each individual request

712364
any	set
i need to be able to get on-hand inventory value for a given set of products at any point in time as fast as possible

712374
asp.net-mvc	webforms
scroll through pass questions and you ll see that there a lots of questions issues with asp.net-mvc compared to good o webforms that is

712376
triggers	insert
the easiest way to manage this would be to put a triggers on the live table so that whenever a record is inserted deleted updated it automagically insert a new record into the audit table

712391
authentication	login
failed authentication delays are there to reduce the rate of login attempt

712393
abstract-class	base-class
i have an existing reporting system with a reportbase abstract-class and multiple reports deriving from the base-class

712418
floating	margins
if the block-level non-replaced elements in normal flow when overflow does not compute to visible element has any floating descendants whose bottom margins edge is below the bottom then the height is increased to include those edges

712418
contains	elements
which basically says that floats only expand contains elements

712420
noscript	meta
adding a refresh in meta inside noscript is not a good idea

712425
linux	unix
under most linux unix shells to delete files and folders you can run

712431
repository	entity
if the entity is going to be accessed through a different repository i think it deserves its own class

712433
url-rewriting	rewrite
it looks like helicon isapi rewrite 3.0 supports proxying as well as url-rewriting

712433
apache	squid
free options include apache on windows or you can also run squid as a proxy server

712446
linked-list	nodes
recap a linked-list is made up of nodess and each nodes stores the item as well as the reference to the next nodes

712447
business-objects	data-access
the problem is is that i m trying to keep my business-objects pure in the sense they are not aware of data-access or persistence

712459
margins	padding
edit though it doesn t show i am actually clearing the padding and margins

712467
margins	padding
are you clearing the default browser margins and padding

712467
margins	padding
most people use css reset styles to normalize margins and padding across browsers

712470
restart	exit
so if you exit and restart the ide you get a form load error because 60 of the code is now missing

712479
temporary	copy
once the copy is done - it deletes the temporary new file and starts the application again before shutting down

712480
credentials	ntlm
firefox will only present credentials when prompted and will generally ask you by popping up a box unless you ve configured a list of sites for it to always present ntlm credentials to

712485
initializer	getter
i think you would getter milage out of an mdi application that uses a plugins model to load modules that get initializer and enroll themselves in the mdi containers menu

712490
tokenize	parsing
this way the parsing tokenize could be written once

712500
decrement	increment
when step is given it specifies the increment or decrement

712500
parsing	comma
then split the string on comma and for each bit parsing it enough to figure out what function to call catenating the lists returned

712506
logout	login
the windows live id spec indicates that i have to look for request headers login logout and clearcookie

712506
response	timeout
as a result the response doesn t recognize it and the windows live logout feature timeout whether doing it via my logout button logout action or the windows live site s logout feature clearcookie action

712510
python	php
while i can use mysql with php i can t use it with the python backend of my program because of install issues with the host

712510
python	php
i can t use sqlite with php because of more install issues but can use it as it s a python builtin

712521
csv	xml
at the very least i d recommend an xml data store rather than a csv

712523
radio-button	selected
you can get all the radio-button selected doing something like this

712532
installation	upgrade
oh and make sure you factors in patching scenarios upgrade installs with or without administrative permissions if applicable unattended installation multiple language support in the ui.

712535
superclass	subclass
if you have a superclass and a subclass you can hide the methods in the superclass from the subclass by making them private

712535
superclass	subclass
if you cast the subclass to the superclass then the public methods on the subclass are no longer visible

712556
folder	dir
for example i am at folder abc and i want to output the dir list so that the final text file will be named abc.txt instead of file_list.txt

712557
attributes	properties
if you want a gridview that takes into account some attributes you placed on the properties of your bound class i believe you ll need to create your own gridview

712572
authentication	login
people should login as themselves authentication with their own user ids passwords

712589
any	set
any single character within the specified range a-f or set abcdef

712589
any	set
any single character not within the specified range a-f or set abcdef

712591
silverlight	wpf
its a good solution for silverlight and wpf to create commands in the viewmodel or presenter and bind directly to it

712606
json	xml
the issue seems to stem from the fact that asp.net is returning the json object as xml

712618
directory	folder
this will get rid of all folders and their contents in the current working directory leaving only the files not inside a folder

712626
innodb	myisam
right now we re using mysql 5.0 myisam tables innodb was killing on spaces usage alone and suffering greatly on #6 and #4

712626
postgresql	mysql
we re definitely moving to at least mysql 5.1 if we stay with mysql for the next release but strongly considering postgresql

712626
postgresql	mysql
indexing is really our main beef with mysql and it seems like postgresql may help us out through partial indexes and indexes based on functions

712626
postgresql	mysql
postgresql has long been labeled more advanced but slower - is that still generally the case comparing mysql 5.1 to postgresql 8.3 or is it more balanced now

712626
innodb	myisam
note on myisam vs innodb for us

712636
double	int
the problem is that your code has an int as the first argument and c++ doesn t know whether to promote it to a double or long double

712644
innodb	myisam
myisam is probably even faster than innodb for retrieval but perhaps slower for indexing index repair

712646
any	set
is there any flags that i can set

712648
32-bit	64bit
i am running 64bit vista home premium iis7 but i enabled 32-bit apps in iis created a separate apppool just for this web service and have forced all of my assemblies to x86

712649
constructor	object
you have a parameterized constructor of the pointer that initializes this pointer with the adress of object

712649
pointers	stack
you allocate a pointers on stack

712664
output	mode
removed awkward echo statements and changed to html mode for large output strings instead

712687
baud-rate	parity
a device could have a range of possible configuration baud-rate data bits parity bits stop bits that must be detected at runtime

712693
authentication	login
that is if you are using apache and .htaccess files to set up http authentication any rules you apply to a directory will also apply to its child directories and it will be treated by the browser as all one login

712693
authentication	logout
the thing about http authentication is that there is no way to logout at least not unless the browser provides that feature

712695
selected	button
if the file they have selected passes then i want the label to say file accepted and store the file upload information for a later button click

712701
checkbox	textbox
these scripts that i have in place now will populate my textbox from the values in the database so for someone like myself who has no idea what is happening with jquery and its innerworkings it is only natural for me to assume that the checkbox will also be filled with the on off values

712701
checkbox	button
i also have radio button in addition to the checkbox that i need to show the values for as well

712701
put	get
i put an alert inside of the condition and i do not get an alert

712714
constructor	object
basically it means that when a constructor finishes the execution the constructed object is fully initialized and ready to use

712716
spring	jsf
what is the best way of getting some of the stack trace info perhaps the exeception.message onto my custom error 500 page with tomcat spring jsf

712720
ubuntu	debian
to get all the dependencies required to build an app on debian and presumably ubuntu use apt-get build-dep

712740
perl	c++
i really like that mapreduce jobs can be written in my choice of perl python ruby php c++ r or java

712747
value	field
if i understand correctly you have a form that is updated asynchronously via an ajax call when you change the value in the #admempid field first javascript file

712747
selected	checkbox
are the checkbox and radiobuttons not selected when they should be

712748
jquery	.post
and i think the reason it works with the datatype set to json is that jquery adds an empty .post body for you in that case

712756
exception-handling	try-catch
you have to try-catch the exception-handling inside the loop - right now your code exits the loop when an exception is thrown

712762
input-field	checkbox
checkbox behave a little differently than other input-field

712762
checkbox	textbox
as such it s very possible your script that populates your textbox are putting in the correct value for the checkbox but are not setting the checked attribute

712768
oracle	mysql
are they supported my oracle and mysql

712774
sql-server	ms-access
i m upsizing a backend ms-access database to sql-server

712774
digits	base
each digits would be in base 34 composed of letters from a-z and 2-9 avoiding o 0 1 i because of their similitude in case we need to manually handle these pk for instances during debugging

712781
attributes	properties
you can write a custom action that will detect that the shortcut exits and will supply a new name via properties in the wxs create the shortcut but provide shortcutname for the name attributes

712809
checkbox	listbox
how can i add checkbox in listbox

712817
dictionary	arrays
for more examples about binding forms to arrays lists collections dictionary take a look at here

712821
installation	uninstall
i would uninstall the latest installation as described above and try again

712833
exception-handling	try-catch
i rarely write try-catch blocks - most exception-handling get thrown up to near the top of the stack

712834
exception-handling	try-catch
you can use the using statement outside or inside a try-catch block it really would depend on what you are trying to achieve whether you reasonably expect something to throw an exception-handling whilst using a particular object which you plan to recover from for example

712847
communication	messages
if you think of the handshake process like a modem negotiating a link layer protocols it uses a standard set of messages to describe the type of communication it would like to have and wait for an ack from the other end

712881
virtual-machine	vmware
the easiest way to achieve what you want is to use a virtual-machine like vmware

712894
show	next
i am looking for the best way to hold them in my app so that my app is able to loop over them and show them to the user as he click next image

712914
json	xml
for example a getperson action could be able to return person data as xml json or html and possibly other representations

712916
constructor	object
it is called resource acquisition is initialization because the resource is acquired when the object controlling the resource is constructed if the constructor failed ie due to an exception the resource is not acquired

712916
constructor	object
c++ guarantees that all object on the stack that have been successfully constructed will be destructed this includes constructors of base classes and members even if the super class constructor fails

712921
oracle	mysql
not sure about oracle and mysql but if corresponding implementations of idatareader have nextresult not throwing notsupportedexception this should work for them

712945
png	gif
is there a way to put text on a png and then merge it wit a jpg gif image

712961
data-access	nhibernate
don t rule out other options such as nhibernate or using codesmith templates to generate data-access classes unless you ve already decided on l2s or ef

712966
sqlcompare	redgate
you could also use tools like redgate sqlcompare and sqldatacompare to easily move data and objects between databases

712974
python	php
if i understand you correctly you need to access the same database from both python and php and you re screwed because you can only use mysql from php and only sqlite from python

712974
json	xml
maybe you could use xml-rpc or plain http requests with xml json .

712974
python	php
to get the php program to communicate with the python program or the other way around

712999
parallels	vmware
and it is phenomenal because with vmware fusion or parallels i think parallels is better in the most up-to-date versioning the mac is an excellent machine for doing windows development on

713034
double	int
matrixvariable const qstring name int rows int cols double fill_real 0 double fill_complex 0 bool isreal true

713046
32-bit	64bit
i know jet can run on 64bit if iis is run in 32-bit mode but that is in my opinion not an option

713053
nsstring	nsobject
nsstring firstname will store aaa of a nsobject subclass

713085
communication	messages
in complex applications i may have dozens of views on a screens at one time yet i understand that in mvvm each view has one and only one viewmodel assign to it to provide it with data and behavior so how is it that the views can interact with each other in the above validation example what if back in the customer model we want to inform a particular messagesareaview to display the messages last name may only contains 50 characters. how to we communication that up the stack to that particular view

713099
hosts-file	hosts
i tried the idea i suggested above of adding the incorrect entry into the hosts with the correct ip-address

713104
python	lua
i d recommend you switching to python ruby lua or java

713104
python	lua
for example there are bindings for libusb for python ruby lua and java

713110
contains	set
the difference is that the value of a static readonly field is set at run time and can thus be modified by the contains class whereas the value of a const field is set to a compile time constant

713110
value	field
static readonly is typically used if the type of the field is not allowed in a const declaration or when the value is not known at compile time

713111
contains	elements
given a bit of xml in which i know a particular elements appears only once is it possible using a single xpath query to selected a node-set that contains that elements twice

713125
order	join
there s any number of ways to solve that programatically but since we had billions of possibilities it turned out matching arrays of simple string keys with a cross join was order of magnitude faster than anything else

713134
arrays	loops
untested but i believe the query is returned as an associative arrays where the column name is the key and so you can loops through the first record and pick up the column names

713145
http	ssl
use http or tcp over ssl depends on your communication channel

713145
http	ssl
i d say stick with http tcp + ssl

713148
base-class	inherited
the trouble with inherited is that if you use it you will be stuck with the collection base-class s behaviour forever more or face a complex refactoring

713148
filtering	sorting
for example you may want to add filtering searching and sorting operations at which point you will need to switch to list from collection

713150
expression	evaluation
when executing the second program won t the interpeter spark a new process to evaluate nf2 while evaluation nf1 of the nf1+nf2+1 expression in parallel

713153
passthru	exec
if you find a command-line tool that does this then you can control it using exec system passthru or shell_exec based on what output the program gives you back

713155
hash-collision	key
therefore unless you are performing a lot of key based operations on huge dictionary with many hash-collision the speed of key to key comparisons will not be a major factors

713156
textarea	textbox
i think you should give a try to the it will turn any textarea or textbox to a nice editor just like the one used in so

713159
g++	gcc
afaik all of the code in classic text the c programming language second edition can be compiled using a standard c++ compilers like gcc g++

713169
postgresql	mysql
you need for example partitioned tables which are in stable postgresql releases since at least 2005 - in mysql it is a novelty

713180
csv	tsv
because it is diffculties to understand the csv tsv

713180
csv	tsv
marc will u give us a sample for doing it .v now ony heard the terms csv tsv

713182
contains	any
these contains the same values you can compare them directly you don t need any specific code

713199
httphandler	httpmodule
maybe you should use httpmodule instead of httphandler

713202
required	checked
if your webpages that call the webservice required the user to be logged in then you can checked the that they re logged in when they call the webservice

713215
csv	tsv
probably the easiest route is to export individual tables as csv tsv

713223
decimal	octal
the hexadecimal or decimal or octal is just the representation of that value in the source code

713224
export	csv
if you meant something else by 2003 maybe you could clarify and people could give a better answer although the previous answer export as csv is a pretty good one

713249
expression-blend	wpf
it is easier to have an advanced wpf designer build your ui with a tool like expression-blend and yourself as a programmer focus more on the back-end

713257
double	int
char short int and long are of different size each just like float double and long double

713308
websphere	ibm
once we had a project that suffered major gc problems websphere and ibm jdk due to heap fragmentation

713315
put	get
to put it shortly use decimal 25 13 and you ll be fine with all calculations - you ll get precision right as declared 12 digits before decimal dot and 13 decimal digits after

713318
arguments	default
this technique is very much unique to c++ because of their support for both constructor destructors almost automatically the constructor that are matching that arguments being passed in or the worst case the default constructor is called destructors if explicity provided is called otherwise the default one that is added by the c++ compiler is called if you didn t write an destructor explicitly for a c++ class

713318
constructor	object
hence when auto-managed object s constructor is run the wrapped object is created on the heap free-store memory when the auto-managed object s handle goes out of scope destructor of that auto-managed object is called automatically in which the wrapped object is destroyed using delete

713326
any	set
the gridview populates fine the first time around showing the first 10 records and the number of pages as hyperlink at the bottom but when i try to click on any of the page numbers to view them a message box pops up saying object reference not set to an instance of an object

713334
low-level	hardware
are they representatives of that new breed of programmers who have no understanding of hardware low-level programming and all that magic behind

713335
xsd	xml
i d like to explore and possibly use reuse open xml formats schemes dtd xsd for drug medication prescription documents rx issued by medical doctors and later processed by licenced pharmacists and health insurance companies

713361
implements	extends
so you can implements several interfaces and interfaces can extends several other interfaces

713388
codeigniter	cakephp
i am a fan of codeigniter but other options include cakephp and zend

713389
service-layer	crud
on the server we have a service-layer exposed to the client that offers crud operations amongst some other service methods

713396
python	php
if both php and python are writing the file you ll need to use os-level locking to assure that they don t overwrite each other

713396
python	php
this means that php and python must load the entire file into memory before rewriting it

713398
put	get
this technique is very used in web application for example in google when you put the first word you will get a droped down list containing the suggestions

713415
value	field
i ve been researching to find out how and what to use to get say the name s of the fields in a class then to invoke that class and get the properties of the class as in the field value

713418
put	get
then when you do get to hasspaceavailable don t separately send the length because you ve put it into the data object

713418
subtract	add
after you check that the number of bytes sent was not 0 or -1 see the documentation add it to the pointer and subtract it from the length remaining

713422
postgresql	oracle
the only way i think this is achievable is through something similar to multiversion concurrency protocol used in databases such as oracle postgresql etc

713440
constructor	object
if you have a list of class object obtained through class literals you might as well statically reference the constructor rather than slipping into reflection evilness

713448
mechanize	hpricot
note that mechanize no longer uses hpricot it uses nokogiri by default in the later versions 0.9.0 and you have to explicitly specify hpricot to continue using with

713454
backwards-compatibility	compatibility
instead of using arrays and then worrying about passing them to stl functions what one might call forwarding compatibility and is therefore fragile imo you should use std vector and use its stable and dependable backwards-compatibility with functions that take arrays should you ever need to use them

713479
subtract	add
you may add subtract an arbitrary integer and you may read and write

713492
web-inf	taglib
spring-dm extends the jsp convention of placing the taglib either packed as a jar under web-inf lib or unpacked under web-inf classes by detecting any taglib defined in the bundle classpath imported packages or required bundles

713493
pointers	stack
and this is also the idea behind smart pointers - they reside on stack and essentially wraps a heap based object

713494
number-formatting	localization
you should probably be using currentculture as opposed to currentuiculture for localization date number-formatting

713507
type-safety	generics
generics are a way of ensuring type-safety at compile time in c#

713514
associations	model
comments can be associated to many other model so i use a polymorphic associations

713516
dependency-injection	factory-pattern
perhaps a factory-pattern or dependency-injection

713530
strong-typing	types
however this defeats the strong-typing of the anonymous types

713538
subproject	libs
the project consists of several 5-10 subproject which are release separately but which share some common source files and external libs imported from other projects

713543
attributes	properties
basically what i need is to read in serialization instances of a class which contained the datamemeber attributes on two properties at the time of serialization but the current version does not longer have them but i need to migrate the old data set in these properties over to the new handling.

713548
scala	java
these days i develop in java groovy and scala on the jvm

713558
restrict	shared
if you ve got a shared resource i would restrict access to it using a re-entrant lock

713560
.when	ready
developers are encouraged to checkout code only .when ready to work on it and to check it back in as soon as they have finished making and testing their changes

713575
gethashcode	tostring
anonymouse types only contains properties with public get modifiers and overrides of the gethashcode equals and tostring

713583
variables	boolean
if the 2 threads you are talking about are in the same jvm then you could have a boolean variables somewhere that is accessed by both threads

713607
drools	jess
depending on what exactly you mean by business logic a rules engine such as drools or jess might be a more efficient way to implement them

713623
reflection	runtime
using reflection to transform your dictionary to a runtime generated class with the properties taken from the dictionary itself the properties name will be taken for examle from key-value

713626
cassini	iis
vs2008 is configured to go through iis for a variety of reasons cassini is not an option

713642
order	add
i add a little stabilizer so that the early orders don t cause huge jumps i.e the first order doubling the price

713660
queue	fifo
i would like to read write from a named pipe fifo queue under linux

713666
contains	set
in fact in this case nhibernate will first insert the entity that is contains in the collection if necessary insert the entity that owns the collection and afterwards updates the collection entity so that the foreign key is set and the associations is made

713675
python	java
i wonder if it possible to not have jython automagicaly transform java objects to python types when you put them in a java arraylist

713675
boolean	int
the object is transformed into a python-like boolean an int and.

713675
python	java
i guess what really want to achieve is to get rid of the implicit conversion from java-types to python-types when passing objects from java to python

713683
keyword	term
matches any keyword - single term or phrase capturing single terms into and phrase contents into

713687
value	field
i have a gridview wich has some programmatically templates field added to it on page_load and on every postback because for some reason these field loose their value on postback

713687
value	field
i think that the problem is related with the fact that the templates field loose their value on each postback

713698
nested	order
am i right in thinking that in order to declare some nested namespaces i have to do the following

713702
any	set
note that the first day of the first week of a year night be in the previous calendar year because by definition a week starts on sunday or monday or whatever you ve set it to be but a year can start on any day of the week

713703
boost	stl
the introduction to boost arrays a simple templates wrapper for conventional arrayss which also defines stl-compatible iterator types and begin end etc contains some interesting discussion of their degree of compatability with stl

713721
haskell	lisp
take a look at haskell prolog lisp and an assembler variant at least

713728
hash	md5
add an offensive link and store the md5 or other hash of the offending image so that it can automatically tagged in the future

713734
while-loop	infinite
let the main method be an empty infinite while-loop to ensure that no os specific or standard library calls are used

713801
postgresql	firebird
an alternative would be firebird which is not so flexible but in my experience it is in some cases performing much better than mysql and postgresql

713835
constructor	object
one of the most important things of oop is that object should be in a defined state thus you can be safe that the constructor is always run

713844
versioning	downgrade
is it possible to downgrade a crystal report to an older versioning

713869
required	checked
it seems like having a class heirarchy where subclassing introduces new methods signatures will required instanceof checked in callers

713912
selected	button
using the below style i change the background color if the toggle button is selected and also on mouse over

713912
selected	cells
unfortunately if i have virtualization enable when i make a selected of a toggle button in a cell and scroll down in the grid i will find other cells that have also had their background changed

713914
selected	button
if i selected a particular child folder and click on the remove folder button the folder will be removed

713928
execute	prepare
the following code from show a mysqli query being prepare and execute

713932
python	java
in current jython versions the python bool type corresponds to a java boolean

713932
python	java
jython is not transforming the java type to a python type on the way into the arraylist - on the contrary it will transform a primitive python type to a primitive or wrapper java type when passing it to a java method and a java type to a python type on the way out

713938
python	php
i need a server-side script php python to capture a webpage to a png jpg tiff gif image and resize them to a thumbnail

713960
identity-column	sql-server
i want to be able to insert data from a table with an identity-column into a temporary table in sql-server 2005

713965
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object.

713965
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

714008
arrays	loops
you can insert line into your arrays as well withthe loops

714012
eazfuscator	dotfuscator
deepsea obfuscator has a nicely integrated experience dotfuscator also work and soon the free eazfuscator will also support it

714023
dreamweaver	notepad++
i had the same problem with dreamweaver cs4 but i fixed it with notepad++ free

714026
any	set
any node can participate in a node-set only once due to the definition of set

714029
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you re familiar with html and javascript or other asp.net-mvc frameworks like ruby-on-rails asp.net-mvc makes much more sense than the old webforms

714030
32-bit	64bit
it appears that perhaps the behavior i m seeing regarding win32 win64 subkeys reflects the fact that some type libraries can be used in 64bit and 32-bit programs because there they contain no bit-constrained read pointer parameters

714034
administration	account
this account is auto created so its not as simple as asking your network administration

714047
entity-framework	ado.net
on a previous job we used ado.net entity-framework while it was still in beta

714058
primitive-types	generics
the usage of minvalue for various primitive-types which since they are value types cannot be assigned null dates back to the dark days before c# 2.0 which introduced generics

714066
order	join
if the join is always one-to-one and each box s resultset has the same key you can pull them both with the same order and trivially connect them in the client

714078
value	field
often the value type s minvalue constant field is used for this

714081
decimal-point	digits
another is that floating point only uses a fixed number of significant digits which float relative to the decimal-point hence the name

714085
double	int
.net also has value types int double datetime etc

714092
mapping	unique
you have to set the unique attributes equal to true in the mapping file in order to make this a unique column

714100
solaris	linux
i routinely work on several different computers and several different operating systems which are mac os x linux or solaris

714101
directory	folder
so looking at the above the structure is always the same - a root folder then two subfolders then an xml directory and then the xml file

714108
contains	set
i want to generate one set contains all possible triples person-gift-giftextension

714122
automake	gnu
that s the job that gnu s automake autoconf are designed to solve

714130
configuration	upgrade
now i d like to upgrade some to ruby-on-rails 2.x and i m wondering if the same slice 256 can take an apache2 + passenger configuration since it worked great on my local development linux box

714131
value	field
now i want to set the value of the datemodified field to the current date every time the record changes in tablea and everytime a child record is created updated deleted in tableb

714136
json	xml
i am trying to generate some json from an xml file but not a straightforward conversion

714137
directory	folder
are there additional directory at the same level as the xml folder

714141
hide	show
the other thing worth mentioning about the sstab is the way it show hide controls

714147
directory	folder
rather than doing getfiles and doing a brute force search you could most likely use getdirectory first to get a list of the first sub folder loop through those directory then repeat the process for the sub folder looping through them lastly look for the xml folder and finally searching for .xml files

714147
directory	folder
the following code snippet will search a directory structure and find all xml folder inside the entire directory tree

714150
populate	row
i use this totals data to populate a second advanceddatagrid with no headers that sits directly below the first adg so that it appears to be the last row of the first adg

714160
triggers	insert
either do insert update deletes on tableb via a storedprocedure which allows you to perform the update on tablea or have insert update delete triggers on tableb which updates tablea

714170
json	xml
load the xml into a set of classes use xmlserializer then implement json generator methods on those classes

714175
any	set
it has a database of types that lets you get set parameter values of any type

714209
synchronous	.when
.when using a synchronous i o such as fread which is buffering the read operations are

714234
variables	boolean
therefore a boolean function will return false if you exit function early without making other changes because that is the default value in the implied variables used with the function

714247
identity-column	sql-server
this runs fine on my sql-server 2005 where mytable.mykey is an identity-column

714257
synchronous	.when
synchronous io is the normal kind where you call a routine and flow of control continues .when the routine has read into your local-variables ignoring writes

714261
synchronous	.when
synchronous i o works on a polling basis you poll data is returned .when available---if not available then for blocking i o your program blocks until data is available

714275
json	xml
anything like json xml caching of structured data

714278
value	field
think about it for a second you have one arrays that is a bunch of 64bit value with field layed out like this

714286
windows-mobile	windows-ce
i ve been designing and developing software for windows-mobile and windows-ce in c c++ and c# for quite a few years now

714286
windows-mobile	windows-ce
while you need that specific sdk as each device is different the sdk i linked to earlier will not work on that intermec device all of the non-hardware related os stuff is pretty much standard across the board which is where the windows-mobile or windows-ce sdk from microsoft comes in

714302
administration	account
use a separate personal administration account

714302
administration	account
provide the developer with a separate personal administrator account to his her machine domain account preferably that is also a valid administrator on other dev test servers and boxes that person needs administration access to

714302
administration	credentials
utilize run as and in vista+ uac to prompt or request prompt and enter the administration credentials for tasks and processes only when needed

714324
instrumentation	debugging
it needs to instrumentation your code using the debugging symbols but it will exclude at the end the overhead that it put on the system

714332
solaris	linux
few replied with iptables solution however this one loaded on solaris it doesn t have builtin firewall to os as linux

714338
administration	account
no one on windows-xp should be using an administration account for day-to-day use and in vista if you must be an administration at least have uac enabled

714338
administration	account
what you can do is have developers use their regular user account but give them a second account that is an administration on their pc so they can use it as needed run as

714338
administration	account
i know they said web development but for windows development your software should be tested using a regular user account not as an administration

714340
row	col
most of the algorithms for eigen value computations scale to big-oh n 3 where n is the row col dimension of the symmetric and square matrix

714347
cvs	git
cvs svn git etc

714347
revision	updates
would be appropriate something else s but a revision control system may not be the optimal choice if you don t need an updates history.

714357
any	set
solution was to set lang environmental variables to in my case en_us.utf-8 or probably any other utf-8 locale

714360
python	ruby
executing python scripts is easy but some users are more comfortable with languages like ruby

714360
variables	boolean
however i need to provide the script with multiple variables say a chunk of text along with some simple boolean information about the text the script is modifying and i m having trouble figuring out the best way to do this

714361
postgresql	mysql
which i found useful because it s a little more portable mysql postgresql etc taking into account the differences of course

714369
www-mechanize	lwp
although i ve generally done this with lwp lwp simple the current preferred module for any sort of webpage scraping in perl is www-mechanize

714375
selected	checkbox
selected the checkbox is almost 10x as slow as inserting the entire parent row

714383
ironpython	cpython
it shouldn t do things that are impossible for ironpython and jython to copy. i ve seen reports that this is what kept the cool parts of stackless from being merged into cpython

714403
nsmutablearray	nsarray
this arrays should be of a certain size - so i suppose it would be better to use nsarray instead of nsmutablearray

714410
sql-server	oracle
from the ibm side there is ibm federation server which can combine data from disparate sources such as db2 oracle and sql-server into a single virtual view. i imagine there is also one from oracle but i m less familiar with their products

714417
javascript	dom
an alternative and one i ve seen done many times before is through javascript and the dom

714424
bufferedwriter	printwriter
printwriter and bufferedwriter by default both use the writer they are constructed with as the lock

714439
hide	show
and the following jquery function that triggers hide show on click for an element that is either video or text

714452
defined	declare
and without ever even knowing what fp points to i can call virtual methodss declare in foo and have the compiler make sure that the methods defined in he dynamic type pointed to is what s called

714452
subclassing	base-class
and then there would be a relationship between paramvectors they d all be sibling subclassing of that base-class

714482
user-defined-functions	udf
yes this is called user-defined-functions udf

714485
constructor	object
also if you pass a templates instance to a function that requires not an object but a reference the compiler won t call the conversion constructor automatically you have to do an explicit call

714493
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have worked with asp.net-mvc and have a vast amount of webforms experience

714497
python	c++
i programmed c++ for quite a long time but when i started learning scheme python and subsequently haskell a whole new world of thinking opened up to me

714503
click	mouse
i hate having to grab the mouse for a right click menu there - would rather just type cls or something

714514
nsinteger	int
if the arrays is a specific size and all regular int nsinteger in your example why not just use a simple integer pointer

714561
attributes	properties
in mapping xml the actual column name on the database is the name attributes of the column element whereas the class properties is the member

714574
hash	md5
i am thinking that md5 hash would be a good way to tell

714585
macros	vba
tip test things out in vba macros first to get the idea then implement the .net code once you ve worked out what s necessary

714602
derived-class	subclassing
i need to subclassing it but the derived-class is only used in one place and is coupled to the class that uses it

714606
json	xml
i would probably use linq to xml xelement and friends to generate the new object and then pass that object to the json serializer

714620
authentication	impersonation
at the web application level we use basic authentication which authenticates against our active directory and have identity impersonation turned on

714620
integrated-security	connection-string
the connection-string to the database uses integrated-security

714621
digits	zero
this assumes you want a leading zero if it s 2 digits

714631
ports	dmz
i understand the need for putting a webserver in a dmz and blocking inbound traffic to all ports except 80 and 443

714631
web-applications	web-services
a lot of web-applications these days rely on sending retrieving data from external web-services and apis so blocking outbound traffic over port 80 would prevent this capability

714633
command-prompt	command-line
i like to think i m more experienced with computers than the average person i use the command-prompt every day and i know how to access the command-line in the command-prompt but i have no idea what programs i should start with and what language to use

714639
ports	ddos
the only reason i can think of is if your machine is somehow compromomised remotely then it won t be able to ddos another website on ports 80

714641
lookup	any
if it s a deep directory tree is there any way you can abstract this to a separate lookup table instead of storing the path information each time

714646
put	get
i also cannot figure out how to put a bounty on this question but i would really really love to get this issue solved

714675
dwarf	elf
it s usually in coff or elf dwarf i get those two mixed up format

714682
.when	ready
now .when you re ready to do your bulk thing instead join the mirror table o the real table on tag

714703
png	gif
according to this tiff is supported by adobe flash player and adobe air together with bmp gif jpg and png

714710
linux	bsd
that s a tool works on linux os x windows bsd ... has cli tools gui tools and can be scheduled nicely in cron which will keep your home directory or any other directory nicely in sync and is made to be able to deal with almost any type of conflict or problem

714739
.when	ready
the ideal point at which to run most scripting is .when the document is ready and not necessarily .when it is loaded

714742
javascript	dom
you can of course to this without a javascript framework it does require a function you can create for example document ready now for the most part putting script at the end of the page sure ensure the rest of the page is there but making sure the dom is ready is never a bad thing

714765
multiple-processes	filelock
if multiple-processes which can be a mix of java and non-java might be using the file use a filelock

714779
pointers	stack
your routine would have to manipulate stack such that when it returned everything was cleaned but stack pointers remained in such a positioning that the block of memory remained in that place

714779
pointers	stack
the problem is that unless you can inform the compiler that stack pointers is has been modified across your function call it may well decide that it can continue to refer to other locals or whatever through stack pointers - but the offsets will be incorrect

714795
javascript	dom
so i would be interested to know if anyone has a way to make ie7 s file-input element behave like a single control or alternatively to allow javascript to access both controls of the element something the dom was not designed for

714796
priority-queue	heap
does java have an easy way to reevaluate a heap once the priority of an object in a priority-queue has changed

714798
grouping	sorting
maybe let a couple users learn basic crystal principals grouping sorting summing etc and you write the stored procedure and they format it with crystal

714801
active-directory	adam
about only administrators having access to the user grouping in the machine consider looking at adam active-directory application mode

714803
shell	bash
if you re using bash then the shell variable

714807
approximation	integral
for an arbitrary real number either an integral type or a floating point type is only going to provide an approximation

714807
approximation	integral
the integral approximation will never be off by more than 0.5 in one directions or the other assuming that the real number fits within the range of that integral type

714807
approximation	integral
however for very large value the integral type s approximation will actually be better than the floating point type s consider the value 9223372036854775806.7 which is only off by 0.3 when represented as 9223372036854775807 as a long but which is represented by 9223372036854780000.000000 when stored as a float

714807
arbitrary-precision	rational-numbers
note also that f# include arbitrary-precision rational-numbers with the bignum type which may also be appropriate depending on your input

714813
comma	words
so if it contains a colon comma number bracket etc then remove it from the line not just the character but the words

714814
protected	public
package-private is stricter than protected and public scopes but more permissive than private scope

714840
export	report
it s wound up being quite a bit faster than crystal-reports particularly for development and i can typically have them just give me a word document of whatever the hell they want the report to look like export it as html clean it up and then use that as a templates for what the xsl generates

714844
authentication	login
for a real life website to handle login and authentication rather than the traditional way using session cookies

714849
python	ruby
then when you want to go to more popular languages there is ruby python javascript and the web languages like html and css

714866
http	ssl
http basic authentication is perfectly safe when used with a ssl website since all http traffic including the credentials will be encrypted

714866
authentication	login
one subjective drawback though is when using this method your users will need to interact with their browser s authentication popup in order to login to your site

714889
subtract	add
now you can reference calculate add and subtract just by their names

714889
overwrite	import
if you import two modules who contain definitions for the same function name one function will overwrite the other with you none the wiser

714893
derived-class	base-class
which is also expected as overriding event hide the private backing field in the base-class and therefore events fired by the base-class are not visible to clients of the derived-class

714905
order	add
the point i want to make is this i m currently implementing a compiler for a university project and one of the extra features i wanted to add is the support for multithreading code in order to enhance the performance of the compiled program

714908
python	perl
the popular scripting languages shell perl python etc. and the ml-based languages require only a single pass.

714914
command-prompt	cmd
easy way i have found is to open the cmd-prompt and browse through the folder you mention until you find the dll you want - you can then user the copy cmd to get it out

714933
derived-class	accessor
a rule of thumb if derived-class overrides event accessor it must also override the function that invokes the event

714934
shell	bash
if you use a shell other than bash echo might not be a builtin command

714937
visitor-pattern	visitor
so assuming you have written a spirit parsing for your dsl domain specific language - your idl you will get an ast abstract syntax tree after parsing your idl file s that you can walk with the visitor-pattern and by creating appropriate visitor you can generate whatever output you need generating code

714944
contains	set
that is if the xaml file contains an image tag with the source set to a path that doesn t exist can i tell at runtime that an image is not being displayed correctly

714945
pointers	stack
this code copies source arrays to stack and sets eax to the address of the first element address stored in stack pointers after last push

714945
contains	elements
stack grows down so the code starts with the last elements edx contains high data when incarray1 is called and repeats read elements

714952
interop	tlbimp
or to put it another way is there a way to generate the same interop class as visual-studio does by using tlbimp

714955
vb.net	vb6
majority of time is spent debugging enhancing legacy apps c++ vb6 with vb.net applications this is why i m applying for a junior level posision and would be willing to take a slight paycut just to be able to do new development with guidance from a good lead developer

714967
contains	any
if resultset before sorting converted to fixed-width format is greater than the sort buffer or if it contains any text fields it will have to use the slower on-disk filesort algorithm the second condition is satisfied since your query has a text field

714981
hide	show
it will now control a div tag in the .aspx page to show or hide the records - because the onclick points to a client side javascript function

714981
hide	show
the result is show hide functionality of data with out doing a postback

714981
postback	ajax
if you use the linkbutton or simlar controls - the postback and page reload is unavoidable - unless you want to get into some ajax stuff

714986
filtering	sorting
note that you have a range filtering condition over user_offtopic_count that s why you cannot use an index over this field both in filtering and in sorting by other field

714993
flash-cs3	swc
i am using a swc that was published from flash-cs3 in an actionscript project in flexbuider

714993
order	add
in order to have newly published swc recognized i have to remove the reference to the swc from the library path and then add it back again

714997
show	next
for some reason this does not work and have to attach to the dllhost.exe that show scripting next to it

715003
internet-explorer	google-chrome
google uses svg in firefox opera google-chrome and other browsers that support it and vml in internet-explorer so you don t need third-party plug-ins

715009
authentication	login
i want the admin login view form_for to call controller restful_authentication action authentication

715022
quirks-mode	doctype
make sure you use a proper doctype that doesn t get the browser into quirks-mode and learn css

715024
google-chrome	firefox
your site will work better when the change to ie7 comes or a change to even something better like safari google-chrome firefox opera or basicly anything other than ie

715035
internet-explorer	firefox
in firefox and internet-explorer it looks nice i have a drop-down with the us in the first place canada in the second place france in the third place etc

715041
linux	unix
this will scortch the eyes of any unix linux user with a clue

715043
http	ssl
firstly http auth is secure over ssl other than the fact that you can t implement a true logout functionality

715050
priority-queue	heap
priority-queue has the heapify methods which re-sorts the entire heap the fixup methods which promotes an element of higher priority up the heap and the fixdown methods which pushes an element of lower priority down the heap

715050
contains	elements
i d consider using the observer pattern so that a contains elements can tell the queue that its priority has changed and the queue can then do something like fixup or fixdown depending on if the priority increased or decreased respectively

715060
apache-fop	batik
once in the batik transcoder and once in apache-fop

715060
apache-fop	batik
since the libs are loaded alphabetically in tomcat apache-fop include crimson first but then batik also did the same

715068
order	join
you don t need to join the table you just need to use a count operation to return the sum and then order by that sum to see who does best

715075
sql-server	oracle
if i were using sql-server or oracle i would definietly avoid having client apps connect directly to the db this has many potential problems the first being security

715095
httpwebrequest	webclient
there are plenty of samples on how to use httpwebrequest or webclient for screen scraping including simulating logins and such

715097
rewrite	rule
one although pretty dumb idea would be to do the rewrite in two steps that is chain two rewriterule s with the first rule rewriting it into some intermediate format

715102
pointers	stack
i would like to dynamically control code execution using a pointers basically a function pointers without stack frame

715110
packets	ping
i have seen some hyperactive windows firewall products go into nuclear .war mode and scream bloody murder just by intercepting one icmp echo ping packets

715122
perl	ruby
either ruby perl or python would be great for it

715124
onchange	onclick
i removed the onchange triggers and attached a onclick triggers to the label but now the triggers fires twice when the label is clicked once does enyone know why

715131
client-server	security
the old-fashioned client-server or 2-tier application does have each client connect to the database directly - i would advise against this for various reasons number one being security

715132
sql-server	oracle
genome o rm uses linq to generate data access layers connecting relational database systems such as microsoft sql-server oracle and ibm db2 to your .net enterprise applications

715145
integer	numeric
for instance if it s supposed to be an integer check to make sure it converts to a numeric value without issue

715168
pythonmagick	imagemagick
however if you really don t like it you could check out pythonmagick or pythonmagickwand which are wrappers around imagemagick which may be more to your taste

715170
show	next
after i click on a prodinfo span and close the frame overlay the next mouseover on a prodinfo actually invokes both mouseover and also a click which show back the overlay frame

715197
put	get
the best way i ve thought of to get around this is to put the candidate rpms in a completely separate rpm repository but this also gets complicated because we have multiple rpms coming from the same repository that are on different release cycles so we ll be trying to pull the release candidate version of rpm a from the new repository while still wanting to get development snapshots of rpm b from the development repository

715215
document	element
keep the top level element out of the document create but not append then append it to the document when it s ready instead of append every element into the dom as you create it

715221
order	add
i receive this long arrays and i add it to an arrays where the key are the countryid are the id of the country record in the database and roughly this id seems to have almost the same order as the alphabetical order

715221
arrays	loops
the issue happens when i browse the arrays with a loops

715221
firefox	safari
safari seems to browse each item in a sorted order instead of firefox where it s browse each item in the order of the added elements

715232
stackframe	inlining
you can use the stackframe class but it s pretty expensive iirc and may be slightly incorrect due to inlining

715243
button	popup
click the add... button then click the file category in the dialogue that popup

715256
put	get
i have my team review the project specs requirements and put together a basic preliminary structure to get them already thinking through the application and working out specific questions

715259
fortran	pascal
i see of the top 50 only 6 others logo pascal rpg cobol lisp and fortran

715272
callback	methods
about the only time i ve ever had mildly tricky moments is when i wanted to pass an objective-c instance methods as a callback to a c function

715272
callback	methods
this can be done with funky function wrapping and some other creative methodss i ve seen and if you ever need to do it googling objective-c methods for c callback or something like that will give you the goods

715284
silverlight	wpf
i m not sure about silverlight but wpf will translate these literals automagically

715294
cryptography	security
that has the disadvantage of being easy to reverse engineer - it s security is because the algorithm is secret rather than due to any cryptography properties

715306
value	field
then i change value in scheme_id field to 1025 and submit the form

715306
value	field
i tried to recode value on text fields on the form - hence the agent- field .

715313
versioning	upgrade
per the debian policy manual my postinst scripting is getting called at upgrade and configure time as postinst configure old-versioning where old-versioning is the previously install versioning possibly null

715313
versioning	upgrade
i want to determine new-versioning the versioning that is currently being configured upgrade to

715318
compact-framework	.net
i have a .net compact-framework 3.5 program that is used as a occasionally connected line of business lob application

git-status	git-add
i tried git-status directory but it seems this does something completely different lists all changed files as they would be if i wrote git-add directory first

715332
any	set
but as soon as a transferhandler is set for the table i can t drag any rows

715346
textbox	button
i also created a simple form with 1 textbox and 1 button

715355
put	get
other comments have links to rest which generally maps c r u d to post or put create get read put update delete delete

715358
relational-model	datamodel
in some domains those that would be better rendering with a fully object-oriented datamodel and that map poorly on the relational-model you ll find that the two diverge quite significantly

715375
command-line	cmd
i run the cmd mvn -dmyprofile clean generate-sources package from the cmd-line and i have created a src.xml file that details where which file should go on top of declaring the use of zip format for the output

715398
put	get
if i don t put a namespace in my classes vs.net 2008 which namespace do my classes get built under

715426
abstract	extends
but -- if you re extends object but adding nothing what is the value in the class other than allowing object to be abstract

715429
exception-handling	try-catch
my question is how come funcb does not need to do a try-catch block around this java api methods that throws an exception-handling

715449
any	set
using msbuild we have targets set up for each of the compiles and for pushing any and all parts out to both servers or combinations of servers depending on which environment

715449
build-server	msbuild
so each project on cc.net on the build-server corresponds to a target or tragets in the msbuild plus the over all continuous builds

715478
rmdir	cmd
using cmd rmdir s c recycler

715484
value	field
the best options i ve seen are to store the value in custom number field and rebuild it every time you fetch the value or to store it as a string of a known format

715485
json	xml
the results can be returned as a raw string json html xml etc

715500
highlight	selected
sure make two variants of each image normal and highlight and use javascript to remember which one is selected and switch the images

715522
attributes	properties
looks like you probably need a bindable attributes on your myname properties and follow frederik s suggestion as well

715530
googletest	gmock
i have chosen gmock which include googletest

715538
python	perl
i tried the perl one and it seems to work so the problem is my python attempts

715542

then use javascript to hide the radio button and change the hidden selected radio when an image is clicked

715549
order	join
put join in the correct order in a linq to objects query

715552
firefox	safari
you could use the html5 workers api but that will only work on firefox 3.1 and safari 4 betas atm

715553
adobe-illustrator	photoshop
i have found that although a physical sketch can get you started on the right track for a design you can make far better looking layouts within adobe-illustrator which is much easier to move elements around in than photoshop

715557
internet-explorer	firefox
i had the opposite problem worked in internet-explorer but not in firefox

715557
internet-explorer	firefox
for internet-explorer you need to add left padding and for firefox you need to add transparent color

715571
perl	ruby
your best bet is to write a small program to do what you need -- shouldn t be more than a few lines of perl ruby or python

715573
methods	extend
in the roman example you provide it illustrates how you can extend the functionality of a class without explicitly defining methods

715590
hide	show
you ll want to hide the click event item on mouseover so it doesn t show as well

715592
selected	cells
selected the cells ahead of time and mark the formatting as text

715592
selected	cells
format- cells selected text from categories and click ok

715600
configuration	logging
to smoke out the real culprit you can try adding diagnostic logging to your service configuration

715604
python	ruby
to my surprise as i am developing more interest towards dynamic languages like ruby and python

715604
python	ruby
edit based on some answers i see that overloading is available in both python and ruby is it the case in ruby 1.8.6 and python 2.5.2

715609
instances	self
in this instances i would recommend making each application self contains in either a single .jar file including all its libraries or a single folder of .jar files

715611
handler	service
do you have any events and event handler within the service

715611
handler	service
service often have static variables and if you are creating event handler from the static instances connected to a non-static instance object the static will hold a reference to the instance forever which will stop it from releasing

715617
python	ruby
python does in fact support operator overloading as does ruby

715617
python	ruby
the main focus is on concepts like encapsulation inheritance and polymorphism which are 100 supported in python and ruby

715626
document	element
is it possible to validate an element rather than the whole document

715630
directory	folder
the service account being used to run access the website directory security settings in iis has full control permissions on the folder and the xml file

715652
teamcity	nant
i then commit everything to svn and let teamcity run the nant script that executes msbuild.exe to compile the project and zip the output but the output is created in bin release and the zip file is empty because it looks in bin x86 release

715661
google-chrome	safari
on webkit based browsers safari google-chrome and others you can use the web inspector

715662
jsonp	ajax
jquery has built in support for jsonp in their ajax calls

715663
www-mechanize	lwp
make sure your lwp and www-mechanize modules are fully up to date

715667
versioning	packaging
why can t you hard-code the versioning into the postinst scripting at packaging time

715670
boost	stl
it s just the right mix of close-to-the-hardware low-level grunt work to help you learn what s really going on with memory pointers and streams on one end combined with object design using high-level constructs like stl collections and garbage collection boost shared pointers etc on the other

715694
http	ssl
http via ssl is a tested method of doing this and it s a pretty easy fix

715725
value	field
is the field duration going to be assigned an undefined assigned value since statustime is getting used and assigned in the same statement

715735
credentials	account
aspnet is a local account when the request travels over a network it will use the computer s credentials ad maxim

715743
updating	updates
updates the signature signs everything in the signedinfo element so if you go updating that element after the fact then the signature is no longer valid

715755
rollback	commit
-use stored procedure with begin transaction rollback commit transaction

715757
grizzly	netty
it s minimalistic compared to grizzly mina and netty

715777
text-editor	editor
e text-editor is win port of the programming editor for macos textmate

715787
postback	ajax
but when the email is entered there is an ajax postback and the link disappears

715805
difference	count
cycle count should only ever be done when it will actually make a difference - usually in cpu limited code or code with very specific timing needs

715836
emacs	vim
i would recommend trying out vim or emacs

715842
triggers	insert
then i d setup a triggers that insert value into the historical table every time the islast is updated

715858
external	embed
you can embed attachments in the mail like images style sheets and so on or reference them from an external source

715893
communication	messages
we use a messages bus to do all of our other communication and i d like to shift to using this to navigate between screens

715914
value	field
code looks for mapping information and reads field name associated value and field type

715915
duplicates	lookup
my approach to prioritizing which phone number of the duplicates to choose is to make multiple queries based on other criteria main store vs branch for example inserting the first entry found into the ani lookup table and skipping subsequent duplicates

715959
sql-server	oracle
if you call different transacted sources sql-server and oracle in one transaction - than there is no choice other than do transaction in code

715967
credentials	account
i am looking to have an post-commit hook update the remote staging server but the only options seem to involve hard coding a user credentials in the hook for ssh or creating a network mount with a user account

715977
factory-pattern	singleton
tracer is built around the singleton design pattern yet utilizes the factory-pattern to instantiate instances of trace when the trace methods of tracer is called

715980
numeric	digits
for non secure stuff you can try base64_encode you can also base_convert each numeric id from 10 to 36 digits or so

715990
spring	guice
my question is what s the best approach for injecting dependencies if spring or guice are not used

715998
put	get
when following this methods you have to consider all the available design elements that you can use to implement your mock up and make sure that you put them together in a well designed and semantic nature not just something that will get the job done

716021
versioning	downgrade
in a perfect world one could install a newer versioning of the svn client but when this is not possible or convenient it would be nice to be able to downgrade the working copy to the versioning of the client installed--especially when you know that none of the features of the later versioning are being used

716021
directory	folder
the scenario to imagine would be something like joe sends you a large working copy with lots of nested directory and associated versioned .svn folder

716026
any	set
if you set environment variables within a python scripting or any other scripting or program it won t affect the parent shell

716027
callback	methods
i can do 1 or 2 but can t figure out how to callback into the page methods from javascript

716046
shell	bash
when you set an environment variable in your shell bash like this

716046
shell	bash
you can put that alias command inside the .bashrc or .bash_profile files in your home directory to have that command available in any new bash shell you start

716053
updating	updates
but you have to include the updates column in the cte and the table you re updating is the cte name not the original tablename

716067
httphandler	httpmodule
in this mode asp.net httpmodule s basically have nearly as much power as an isapi filtering would have had and asp.net httphandler s can have nearly equivalent capability as an isapi extension could have

716070
configuration	installation
i actually decided to read the outlook addins registry for the installed location and have configuration file copied there during installation

716073
value	field
the value field as well as

716073
value	field
the problems you may have had with your decimal as strings probably have to do with the floating point data types in which the server essentially estimates the value of the field and only retains accuracy to a certain number of digits

716104
ubuntu	debian
i would say that the easier to use and more complete free distros are fedora debian and ubuntu

716105
innodb	myisam
although if you want to maintain the contents of your databases at all you re better off just using one of the disk-based storage engines innodb or myisam and just giving your server a lot of ram to use as a cache

716119
click	mouse
if you are running some code during a mouse click event or any other event then all the drawing you are doing is queued up and will be drawn to the screen on the next paint event

716124
constructor	object
you could create a qtimer object in your eye class s constructor set a time-out of 5 seconds and connect its timeout signal to a slot in your eye class which updates the index into the set of slides and calls presentslide

716131
value	field
for example if you permit people to alter or delete their wall entries the auto-incrementing field is ideal as it gives you a way to easily look up each record each record will be assigned its own unique value

716141
contains	elements
expanding each elements to contains it s children even it it s floating elementss

716165
treeview	splitter
i have been using the grid treeview splitter and dialog for a year now

716174
listboxitem	textbox
since the preview events bubble down the listboxitem will process the event as soon as the user clicks the textbox combobox or any other control you set the event on

716174
selected	listbox
also setting isselected instead of setting the selecteditem will cause multiple items to be selected when you set the selectionmode of the listbox to extended which could or could not be what you re looking for

716175
selected	button
so i put one button on main windows so when user clicks the button the datagrid on selected tabitem get processed

716183
spring	guice
what s the best approach for injecting dependencies if spring or guice are not used

716188
shell	bash
..and the bash alias the same can be done in most shell

716217
perl	lua
if you don t like lua then the de-facto standard perl python and ruby interpreters are all written in c and can be embedded in a c program

716226
firefox	safari
the above code seems to work correctly in safari 4 and firefox 3 i m not sure how it would work in ie

716235
document	element
in dir rtl document of ie7 when javascript tries to set focus to a div element with oelement.focus methods the rendering turns to mess

716236
javafx	swing
while the site hasn t been updated to reflect the final version shipped with javafx 1.x you can still use the jar that comes with the javafx sdk and mix scenegraph and swing nodes inside your swing application

716243
enumerator	iteration
enumerator deals with objects while iteration deals with values only

716243
for-loop	loops
enumeration is used when we use vector hashtable etc while iteration are used in while loops for-loops etc

716249
subtraction	addition
if the b operator models subtraction it really shouldn t be ambiguous but if it was addition it might be ok

716249
arguments	undefined
that is if the parsing is executing some possibly undefined behavior for example order-of-evaluation of a function s arguments in an eager language make the grammar look ambiguous

716252
value	field
in the database you only need a field that can store a guid value either a guid data type if available or just a text field large enough to hold the text representation of the guid

716252
put	get
you can use the tostring methods to get the string representation of a guid value so that you can put it in the form

716270
ienumerator	ienumerable
the .net provides two important interfaces relating to enumerators ienumerator and ienumerable

716290
javascript	dom
selection is slow in comparison because javascript code needs to loop through the dom repeatedly

716290
selected	checkbox
by this i mean that instead of looping through the rows and searching for the checkbox in every one leave them alone until after the loop and then selected them all at a time

716331
application-pool	was
i ve also had this happen when an application-pool account was changed

716333
punctuation	words
as such you have to be aware that funky punctuation and stuff can make it in--it s not just words

716358
silverlight	wpf
i would suggest dabble with it but don t throw all the eggs in the proverbial wpf or even silverlight basket

716360
constructor	object
about constructor destructors and new delete operators in c++ for custom object

716360
malloc	free
what is the difference between new delete and malloc free

716375
silverlight	wpf
don t forget - you ll also be learning the core of silverlight if you adopt wpf - these are two technologies that in my humble opinion are going nowhere

716388
python	php
i can t compare it to php but compared to other python applications it is pretty clear that you are following style conventions from other languages

716388
for-loop	loops
a python for-loops has an unusual else clause which is executed if the loops goes through all of the elements without a break

716398
protected	public
to make this work you would have a public or protected property on your page called showlabel which returns a boolean

716401
linked-list	arrays
even if you keep a pointer to your last accessed linked-list item an arrays will still be more efficient

716414
google-chrome	firefox
contenteditable works tested in firefox and google-chrome on elements which are foreign to html xhtml if i use this doctype

716432
content-management-system	opencms
what about a content-management-system like opencms

716438
implements	extends
the second example here has some premisses that is that all car classes will either extends an abstract-class or implements an interface

716438
implements	extends
both allow you to force extends or implements classes to define a specific function such as drive

716438
implements	extends
that is because they re extends an abstract-class contains the drive methods or implements an interface forcing the drive methods to be defined

methods	extend
so as long as you make sure that all your specific cars either extend the abstract class car or implement an interface such as canbedriven both of which must declare the drive methods you can just call the drive methods on an object which you know is a car but not what type of car without fear of it not being defined as php will throw fatal errors at you until you define those methodss in your specific car classes

716452
duplicates	elements
seq.windowed almost does it but i don t want duplicates elements

716453
createfile	drive
becuase it is a drive letter the usual way of reading and writing to a usb drive is to use filesystems functions such as fopen or the windows createfile

716457
administration	account
keep a very close eye on activity on the site and have some systematic rules for flagging that tips site administration to take a closer look at account or activity

716463
tuples	any
is there any more convenient way to compare a tuples of data in t-sql than doing something like this

716478
javascript	dom
today i added a javascript patch to a page where i had to move a div out of its original place in the dom tree and make it a child of the body so that it could be positioned properly

716497
arrays	loops
the while loops is iterating across each line in the file. an arrays reference containing tmp is then pushed onto aoa

716505
contains	elements
this pushes a reference to an anonymous arrays contains the elements that were in tmp into aoa which is an arrays of arrayss as you probably already knew

716516
emacs	vim
i use vim and emacs mostly because i can t stand using ides

716516
python	ruby
for dynamic languages like groovy ruby and python though i don t think ides really introduce any real benefit as there isn t really any place for code generation or a need to compile

716520
contains	elements
note that this requires sq to have a number of elements which is evenly divisible by n because seq.take and seq.skip unlike linq s take and skip extension methods require that the sequence contains at least n elements

716524
python	ruby
are there any good options other than the jvm for packaging python or ruby applications for distribution to end-users

716524
python	ruby
specifically i m looking for ways to be able to write and test a web-based application written in either ruby or python complete with a back-end database that i can then wrap up in a convenient set of platform-independent packages of some type for deployment on windows linux os x and freebsd

716543
jruby	mri
also something i m not clear about besides mri and jruby how many different implementations are there and why do i as a ruby programmer need any implementation except the mri

716543
jruby	mri
are there any other times i might need to look into an implementation besides the mri or jruby

716555
external	root
root and stage are no longer global so you need to expose them via your document root class if you wish to use them in external classes

716567
contains	any
each time you need to add one more rectangle choose one of remaining free rectangles generate new rectangle with top-left coordinate and size such that it will be fully contains and split that rectangle as well as any other overlapping free rectangle such that children express remaining free space

716572
cvs	git
i m not positive this use case is even relevant in git but noting a file s path and or revision numbers in the patch header included with cvs svn give me a warm fuzzy that the patch that i have received or created is diffing against the correct source or revision

716572
cvs	git
i understand that revisions aren t as meaningful in git as they are in cvs svn due to the distributed nature but am i the only one who wouldn t mind seeing at least the abbreviated commit signature of the files in the header

716584
webforms	asp.net
if you are using asp.net webforms you can consider the load event of the page or control to check whether the session has expired

716606
webforms	asp.net
i am adding functionality to an asp.net webforms application and we ve decided that new development will be done mvc with a view to move all functionality over eventually

716606
asp.net-mvc	webforms
obviously asp.net-mvc and webforms play together rather nicely when it comes to accessing an asp.net-mvc action via a url

716606
asp.net-mvc	webforms
however i d like to display the asp.net-mvc view within an existing tab telerik control on a webforms page

716620
stream	send
if the client fist send an i m ready for the streaming please message over udp would the nat router keep the port open so that the server can respond with its stream of udp data

716633
hosts-file	hosts
apparently the problem was in the hosts

716641
implements	abstract
an arrayslist implements the list abstract data type using an arrays as its underlying implementation

716641
subtract	add
access speed is virtually identical to an arrays with the additional advantages of being able to add and subtract elements to a list although this is an o n operation with an arrayslist and that if you decide to change the underlying implementation later on you can

716643
intermediate-language	cil
msil isn t called msil any more as a public standard it s cil common intermediate-language part of the cli common language infrastructure standard

716648
boolean	int
don t forget that java has a fixed data types boolean char int long float and object this include all objects even an arrays is an object

716649
value	field
are you looking to get the field name from the value of the field

716649
value	field
you can now freely rename _city field of person to something else and your calling code will still work since the code using reflection is trying to identify the field using the reflectionfields enum value set as part of initialization of the attributes set on the field

716655
contains	elements
given a table of elementss called elementss with a column called name contains funnily enough the elements name and another column called atomic_number this query produces this result

716669
click	mouse
the rectangle appears when the mouse button is click

716669
click	mouse
while the button is held the dimension of the rectangle will change as the mouse moves with the top-left point at the positioning where the button was click and the bottom-right following the mouse as it moves

716674
version-control	sync
because the database itself is not in sync with version-control

716674
downgrade	upgrade
the migrations allow you to upgrade or downgrade the database schema from any version and to any version incrementally

716681
bcel	jvm
if you want to compile to msil or jvm bytecode you can use mono.cecil or bcel to make that easier to do

716699
arrays	map
and use a local associative arrays to map from attid s to column indexes

716700
windows-vista	windows
snd_system is new for windows-vista and causes the sound to be played as a windows sound - it s up to you if that s the experience you want to have

716753
reverse-dns	dns
for best results you should use the reverse-dns lookup here as well as to use the passive dns replication

716763
scheme	lisp
a usual programming exercise for students learning scheme a lisp dialect is to write a simple object system using closures

716765
.when	ready
you could work with delegation to know .when the destination view is ready loading the data you needed so you can switching to that view then

716770
json	xml
after switching to ef i realized my xml json serialization output has extra cruft

716787
double	int
if you know in advance the number of elements and don t need flexibility an arrays of millions of int or double will be more efficient in memory and marginally in speed than a list because indeed they will be stored contiguously and accessed instantly

716794
udp	tcp
generally the nat in front of the client at the tcp level will be able to determine that the connection at the udp was create

716794
forwarding	port
having said that the nat on the client side will have to be configured to accept udp packets from the src server port and then forwarding them to the internal destination ip client

716794
udp	tcp
if the udp connection is created after the tcp connection by the server opening a socket to the client to a known udp port then upnp might be worth looking into it will allow you to automatically set up your port forwards on your nat that is only if your nat supports upnp as is the case of dsl routers

716794
udp	tcp
a work-a-round would be to client to open both tcp and udp sockets to the server

716794
udp	tcp
since the client behind the nat initiated the connection the states of both tcp and udp connections will be added to the nat s connection table

716815
stl-algorithm	std
update added stl-algorithm std generate which seems to run the fastest because of special iterator-optimizing vc++2008

716818
methods	extend
is there a way to extend test methods so to easy choose if i want tests with or without time measuring choosing the mode of test execution

716819
keyboard	mouse
synergy doesn t allow you to move windows between machines that would require a silly amount of work behind the scenes but it does allow you to share a keyboard and mouse between two machines so they appear to be all one machine but actually run separately

716821
keyboard	mouse
it only forwards mouse keyboard events from one set of physical devices to different computers

716822
rtsp	sip
if you re talking about streaming protocols like sip or rtsp then the way it works is that the udp port the client wants the server to send to is specified in the call set up request

716830
any	set
the build-server may also be changing the clientleft and clienttop if you have any forms with startupposition set to manual

716836
postback	ajax
after reading your comments on other answers it sounds like you need to bind the onclick event handler inside of asp.net ajax s pageload so that it is bound on every postback including asynchronous postbacks

716857
contains	any
now if we are in any node and filtering with the date 1st of april we must see not only the items directly containsed in the node that match the date but we must see the items that contains items matching the date as well

716891
sql-server	mysql
you test it by running the sql inside pl sql developer sql-server management studio navicat for mysql or whatever

716891
put	get
with sql it s easy because you can write a single query or a small number of queries to get all that data in one hit and put it in a custom value object just for that purpose

716910
put	get
put 74.50.106.245 into yougetsignal and you ll get a list of hostname that previously resolved to the dailywtf server when people queried them not anything to do with the reverse-dns ptr entry

716916
debugging	trace
something like the django debugging trace that lists everything being passed

716920
access-control	authentication
zend-framework is designed as far as i know from the founder of this project to decouple all the models and indeed they are deploying a lot of ready to use models for different kind of project from the zend_acl access-control list for authentication to zend _search _lucene zend _service _twitter zend _service _flickr etc

716926
ubuntu	debian
same problem with debian unstable ubuntu jaunty both ship zsh 4.3.9

716934
contains	any
in any case create a uiview contains the anchor view and the table view

716942
primitive	int
the pretty much the only time it makes sense to prefer an arrays to an arrayslist is when you are storing primitive byte int etc and you need the particular space-efficiency you get by using primitive arrayss

716949
32-bit	64bit
that is less than the entire 16 eb space addressable by 64bit but it is still a whole lot more than what we re used to with 32-bit

716950
any	set
i created a uitextfield of type rounded textfield using interface builder so in order to set the height of a textfield its windows was disabled not to set any height manually in sizeinspector.so if we want to set height manually what procedure should we follow

716962
python	java
i am sorry i don t provide python interfaces but my experience is java

716968
jar	war
if you have a war file not yet deployed you can extract it using the command-line tool jar or get a file listing from it

716968
jar	war
don t forget to copy the mysql jar file into web-inf lib before creating the war file

716970
google-chrome	safari
it goes wrong in a bizarre way in safari google-chrome and fx - the cell s size is calculated before the text is rotated

716973
contains	any
you may have to check whether the user is directly in the local administrators grouping or whether the local administrators grouping contains any of the authentication groupinging that the user is in if getauthenticationgroupinging doesn t include machine-local groupinging

716974
google-chrome	safari
the new css transforms in the latest safari google-chrome and fx don t quite work either includes example

716975
host	dns
to able to identify other websites in a host you need to build a massive database and store as much as dns record as you can then correlate ip addresses

716986
relational-database	schema
whereas current orms can create update or verify relational-database schema when the application gets started

716993
json	xml
it is especially useful when working with structured data such as json or xml that has been saved to the database

717026
internet-explorer	firefox
on my machine i have internet-explorer 7 and firefox 3.01 and my webpage looks the same on these two browsers

717036
contains	set
a delta being the set of masks contains the modified pixels prior to the operation

717044
margins	padding
the purpose of it is that html edit the browsers have predefined properties for the elements.ty zack has some predefined properties for its elements like the built-in padding margins for the paragraph element

717044
margins	padding
the point of using the reset cheat sheet is to start with default value that are equal for all elements size margins padding etc

717044
google-chrome	opera
my advice is to use mozilla as your 1st choice testing browser and every now and then test the page on other browsers ie6 ie7 ie8 opera google-chrome and safari at least

717052
jquery	.post
being relatively new to javascript ajax and jquery i want to .post 3 values to the database 2 of which are results of a mysql query

717062
linux	unix
unix linux etc comes with native support for syslog

717076
instances	self
self reminds me of python but could be good for a consistent naming convention as it s clear that it s referring to the instances in use while not requiring some nasty syntactic trickery

717077
selected	button
selected your button in designer go to it s properties and change modifiers property from private to public

717088
default	reset
a reset css--of which yui s is only one example--aim to remove browser difference in default css properties for html elements like some browsers will have a default 8 pixels padding on the html element it was a surprise to me to find the html element was even styled when i first found out

717092
32-bit	64bit
in 64bit it will be a 64bit process and in 32-bit it will be a 32-bit process

717092
32-bit	64bit
you can force a .net process though to target a particular cpu and say make it run as a 32-bit process on a 64bit machine

717101
reflection	runtime
reflection is primarily aimed at providing meta data inspector information at runtime

717106
linux	bsd
it s free and provides screenshots of your site in various browsers on linux windows mac os bsd

717112
data-structures	linked-list
well firstly it s worth clarifying do you mean list in the classical comp sci data-structures sense ie a linked-list or do you mean java.util.list

717112
linked-list	arrays
if you mean an arrays vs a linked-list it s a slightly different argument for which we go back to big o here is a plain english explanation if this is an unfamiliar term

717135
postgresql	oracle
afaik postgresql and oracle supports it

717139
arrays	loops
i got a piece of code that loops through the arrays and looks for the similar and same strings in it - marking it whether it s unique or not

717140
python	ruby
web development is a different skillset than embedded although you might find a way to leverage your ability to concentrate on detail and troubleshooting if you work in python or ruby

717140
python	java
there are far more java and c# positions than python though so pick you misery poison carefully

717159
python	ruby
i can t speak to python but you could use shoes to create and package a custom gui for ruby cross-platform

717174
checkbox	button
i am coming from a qt background and in qt i would use a stretch element between the button and the checkbox to push them apart dynamically

717182
duplicates	sorted
if the list is sorted then duplicates can be found in one pass through the list duplicates will be right next to each other -- including the sort this is a total cost of o n log n

717189
panels	grid
use the corrent panels implementation in this case a grid would work best

717202
installation	building
when building qt finished go to your application sources open a cmd windows and run the qmake of your built qt installation -- c qt 4.5.0-static bin qmake in the example given above

717212
cucumber	testunit
so i was wondering if frameworks such as rspec cucumber shoulda replace the need for knowing using testunit

717224
selected	button
for example if user selects some word and then clicks button how do i find out which text was selected

717231
cucumber	webrat
bdd is a testing paradigm shift especially if you start using cucumber and webrat but it s fantastic once you get into it

717231
cucumber	testunit
shoulda is the easiest to make the transition to so i would start with testunit then move to shoulda then give rspec and cucumber a try

717237
contains	set
unless you set the needsdisplayonboundschange property to yes for a layer changing the size of the layer or its contains view will simply scale the contents

717237
calayer	uiview
i might suggest an alternative approach where you create a new uiview or calayer for each drawing operation

717241
stream	send
without any particular insider knowledge i would expect 1 chopping the input video into shorter segments to send to multiple encoders and 2 encoding the stream at the same time as you are uploading it rather than waiting until you ve uploaded the entire file to start

717244
any	set
set up the ipendpoint to use the any address

717250
any	set
set up a table in a db with a tasks queue that would be populated by php requests and let some other process on the server watch the table and process any waiting tasks

717261
communication	messages
queue.queue is intended for allowing different threads to communication using queue messages data whereas collections.deque is simply intended as a datastructure

717277
constructor	object
if it not a displayobject or if it s not gonna be on the display list the best thing would proberly be to give it the object that it needs to access like the textfield in either the constructor or a seperate method call

717304
numeric	digits
this is what i do always while working with datetimes in my front end specify my own exact format which is usually dd mmm yyyy - that way i am sure my day part is always numeric month part string and year part a 4 digits number

717319
value	field
from the info i gathered so far when sending the http request i need to add a header field with a key of range and the value bytes startoff-endoff

717336
any	set
is there any tool which will take a set of crud queries and generate a good enough

717338
any	set
you will have to set it programatically and be sure it doesn t break any rules from iphone human interface guidelines

717362
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i would choose webforms for local intranet applications with rich business logic and asp.net-mvc for public internet site blogs forums presentations simple services

717367
multiplication	subtraction
my impression is that the above algorithm is better than the classic one because the multiplication tend to restore the loss of precision of the subtraction

717370
synchronous	.when
.when should i use asynchronous operations in boost-asio instead of synchronous operations in seperate threads

717375
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i was going to start with webforms but now i see where the crowd is heading and i think i am going to give asp.net-mvc a whirl now

717379
webforms	asp.net
url routing is already in asp.net webforms

717379
webforms	asp.net
so i would stick with asp.net webforms i m not saying that mvc isn t good.

717385
viewwillappear	viewdidload
i have a property that changes to invalid as i move between viewdidload and viewwillappear

717385
viewwillappear	viewdidload
i don t do anything between viewdidload and viewwillappear

717394
wicket	spring
you can and probably should use spring with wicket

717435
culture	locale
the problem with using tolocalestring is that you lose timezone info and its obviously locale specific which means you need to parsing it with the right culture

717444
postgresql	mysql
i am developing a php application that uses sqlite as database management system mysql and postgresql etc

717457
hide	show
the separation is not entirely clear in fact you can show hide view components or change then and that can be seen as altering the view

717471
sqldatasource	gridview
here is my markup in my .aspx page the sqldatasource is feeding my gridview

717474
any	set
it also has a very comprehensive set of unit tests that i use to prevent any regressions

717480
command-line	cmd
i m new to symfony and i am trying to run a simple cmd on the cmd-line but i get an error message

717481
duplex	was
not too hard to guess duplex callback was what i was looking for

717481
wsdualhttpbinding	duplex
wcf offers the wsdualhttpbinding to support callback over http callback support also exists by netnamedpipebinding and nettcpbinding as tcp and ipc protocols support duplex communication

717487
inline-assembly	assembly
when compiling a project with tiny c compiler is it possible to use intel assembly syntax in inline-assembly blocks

717489
exception-handling	try-catch
in this case the try-catch in methoda just elevates the exception-handling but doesn t really handle it

717496
deployment	install
for example you might want to install a french and an english deployment of the same app to a single canadian

717504
convention	standards
you could argue this with me but trust me i ve seen enough code from hardcore pros that follow this convention it is the skilled industry standards

717505
perl	c++
c c++ many lisps and java with jit enabled do but ruby python and perl do not

717524
subclass	nsobject
not document-based generally library-based like mail itunes iphoto create a subclass of nsobject instantiate it and make it the application s delegate and in the delegate s applicationdidfinishlaunching methods create a windows populate it with views and order it front

717527
python	ruby
python does nothing that ruby doesn t do to prevent the practice

717527
python	ruby
that alone makes ruby code much easier to monkeypatch than python code

717541
beautifulsoup	lxml
what s my best bet for parsing html if i can t use beautifulsoup or lxml

717552
hide	show
this textbox will then have the + symbol on it and click will show hide the your month-by-month breakout the hidden columns

717563
python	ruby
philosophically it s something that tends to be frowned on within the python community distinctly less so in the ruby world

717566
pascal	scheme
i have also seen the underscore camelcase and pascal case debates split communites and sometimes teams - which is i guess the point of a coding scheme

717576
stderr	stdout
here s a related question using c++ -- cross-platform linux win32 nonblocking c++ io on stdin stdout stderr

717581
fread	eof
you may be able to disable input buffering which should cause fread to return an eof with setbuf but i ve never tried it

717588
optional-arguments	arguments
commands can either be argument less have optional-arguments or take an unlimited amount of arguments

717615
rewrite	rule
for www.domain2.com i have the rewrite rule configure like this from the web-config

717636
linux	osx
if not possible what would be the most elegant way to poll for same under windows linux and osx

717644
contains	any
generally is there any way how to say not contains string in the same way that

717645
order	add
you will have to explicitly add threading support to your program in order to use multiple cores simultaneously

717662
freebsd	linux
i ve also looked at the linux and freebsd source but they are quite large and will take time to understand

717664
interpreter	runtime
iron ruby is a .net based implementation of ruby and therefore is usually compiled to byte code and then jit compiled to machine language at runtime not interpreter

717675
google-chrome	safari
however in webkit based browsers google-chrome safari etc the menu doesn t have a background and it seems like the padding is not being used

717681
for-loop	loops
why cannot i use foreach loops instead of for-loops .

717701
alloca	malloc
for example the arm realview rvct compiler s alloca uses malloc to allocate the buffer referenced on their website here and also causes the compiler to emit code that frees the buffer when the function returns

717701
pointers	stack
this doesn t require playing with stack pointers but still requires compiler support

717703
postdata	request
the server confirms that post request are coming through from ie yet it would get the postdata only occasionally

717703
http-redirect	request
resolved i tracked this to an http-redirect i had in my request handling code

717711
triggers	insert
for example i might want a triggers to be fired insert data into another table after one particular type of update query but not others

717726
order	add
if my statuses are essentially immutable state of a blog post state of an order etc. i will create a unit test that determines if the number of enums i use matches the data in the lookup table - so if someone were to add a status to the database in the future it would fail the test telling the developer to add to the enum

717758
ifconfig	linux
check this in windows using ipconfig and in linux using ifconfig

717764
unsigned	short
because in vssapi.lib the first argument to shouldblockrevert isnâ t wchar_t itâ s unsigned short

717764
unsigned	short
once thatâ s done the lpcwstr macros is defined to unsigned short name mangling matches planets align and you can link

717771
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework tools stored procedures by guy burstein

717776
authentication	login
if a user is not logged in and hits a page that requires authentication authkit swallows the 401 not authenticated response and redirects to a login page

717785
internet-explorer	firefox
my logo which i m referencing in my external css style sheet is working fine in firefox but does not appear to work in internet-explorer

717815
for-loop	arrays
this function could take an arrays which could be nested into a 100 levels while you writing a for-loop would then require you to nest it 100 times

717823
assign	add
however the assignment inside that function to assign a new phrase to text doesn t add it correctly

717839
children	nodes
in computer science a tree is a structure made up of nodess where each nodes has some number of children that are also nodess or null

717839
binary-tree	tree
a binary-tree is a tree made of nodes that have exactly two children typically called left and right

717839
children	nodes
again the children can be nodes or null

717839
children	nodes
imagine that a nodes in addition to its children has a value a number and imagine that we wish to sum all the values in some tree

717839
children	nodes
now recall that the children if they re not null are also nodes

717839
children	nodes
notice that instead of explicitly testing the children to see if they re null or nodess we just make the recursive function return zero for a null nodes

717839
children	tree
so say we have a tree that looks like this the numbers are values the slashes point to children and means the pointer points to null

717839
children	nodes
in fact the order in which we called the children and added the current nodes s value didn t matter at all because addition is commutative

717839
binary-tree	nodes
we ll use a binary-tree of nodes but this time the value held will be a character not a number

717854
sftp	ftp
is there a class that could also provide support for ftp as well as sftp so that same functions could be used for both

717859
sftp	ftp
to switch from ftp to sftp all you have to do is to change protocol option form curlproto_ftp to curlproto_sftp

717859
sftp	ftps
curl supports following protocols http http ftp ftps scp sftp telnet ldap ldaps dictionary file tftp

717859
sftp	ftps
sftp is not to be confused with ftps

717859
sftp	ftps
sftp is ssh file transfer protocol while ftps is ftp over ssl

717880
click	mouse
add this to your mouse event handler for click or mouse_down

717903
device-driver	hardware
running directly on hardware without an os you will still want to encapsulate all of your i o operations in a module even if you don t formally define a device-driver interface and framework for all of your i o modules to follow

717903
printf	scanf
writing your own stdio replacement is a highly valuable exercise even if you don t use it in production code and is one i would recommend to anyone wanting to learn about what really goes on between printf and scanf and the terminal or files

717924
children	tree
this container allowes to set children and adds them into the logical tree

717979
any	set
for the kind of problem you indicate you use the process described above to build a set of paths terminating any that arrive at the desired destination node and when your graph is exhausted the set of paths that so terminated is your solution set

717982
children	nodes
breadth first search bfs means that you process all of your starting nodes direct children before going to deeper levels

717982
children	nodes
when you are processing your active nodes you add all of its children to the back of the queue

717983
udp	tcp
these are two different things socks is a protocol that allows you to route tcp and udp socks v5 through a proxy-server and it s for outgoing connections routers dont have anything to do with this except they are acting as a proxy too

717983
forwarding	port
the igd of upnp is an api that allows you to tell your router that you want to open a port and forwarding it to a computer this is for incoming connections

717994
subtract	add
i ve considered just storing the numbers with 1 subtract so for example 1.0001 would be stored as 0.0001 - but the problem is that to multiply them together again i have to add 1 and at this point i lose precision

717996
subtract	add
this means you can store the numbers with 1 subtract and instead of multiplying just add them up

717997
compareto	equals
i ve just written some code where i needed to implement compareto and override equals to get my program to work in a sane manner

717999
internet-explorer	firefox
in the mean time developers are invited to take advantage of these extra features - natively in firefox and using javascript libraries that provide backward compatibility with internet-explorer

717999
google-chrome	safari
also it may be interesting to note that webkit the engine developed by kde and used by safari google-chrome and several free software browsers supports javascript 1.7

718007
graph-traversal	shortest-path
this could be simulated using a standard sql database or key-value-store but that would be very inefficient for the graph-traversal algorithms i d like to use e.g shortest-path etc.

718010
multiplication	addition
logarithm conveniently reduce multiplication to addition

718021
ruby	php
it has docs for javascript jquery css html ruby php databases.

718026
firefox	opera
what is more information on support in ie firefox and opera and their respective versions is available on all of the appropiate pages

718060
authentication	login
so not a direct answer to your question but i would skip rolling your own login and checkout something like the restful authentication plugin

718061
compareto	equals
this include equals hashcode compareto etc

718062
python	ruby
as a python programmer who has had a taste of ruby and likes it i think there is somewhat of an ironic parallel to when python was beginning to become popular

718062
python	java
c and java programmers would â bashâ python stating that it wasn t a real language and that the dynamic nature of its types would be dangerous and allow people to create â badâ code

718062
python	ruby
it was with some amusement that i saw one of the key flexible features of ruby â monkey patching being touted as dangerous by the python crowd

718066
debugging	trace
i ve tried mocking this up with two very simple swfs and while it works fine when both are debugging builds when the outer swf is a non-debugging build while i can get the debuggingger to connect i don t get trace messages breakpoints don t work and it seems to lock up the flash app

718069
void	main
the way java finds the class in which to run static void main is by the name passed to the java executable and the classpath

718086
directory	folder
you just have to convert all print statements in the console.py and platform_ info.py files under the python1 folder in your netbeans installation directory to use parentheses

718094
macros	let
g addto macros appendix let section appendix section

718095
moss	wss
what setup do you use for sharepoint wss moss development

718106
javascript	dom
but as someone else said i d recommend using something like jquery instead as not all browsers fully support dom and those that do have quirks which are dealt with internally by javascript libraries

718125
value	field
this will be used to keep track of the occurrences of each keywords the value will act as a bit field

718125
value	field
iterate over all entries in the dictionary looking for the appropiate value bit field

718126
python	java
down the road i intend to implement bindings for other languages such as python java etc

718126
linux	osx
the library needs to be available on the major platforms win32 linux and mac osx

718154
scons	bjam
look on bjam or scons make replacers

718154
directory	folder
maybe you don t need different folder in build directory

718174
mouseover	mouseout
the e in each of the functions represent the event object for the mouseover and the mouseout event respectively

718183
controller	routes
and add an entry in to the routes table to route it to the appropriate controller and action

718185
wordpress	mediawiki
i m a fan of mediawiki for posting code there are some nice source highlighting plugins especially as code articles generally aren t date specific like blog posts on wordpress migh tbe

718194
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
some alternatives would be sharpdevelop and or visual-studio express

718196
sharpdevelop	monodevelop
after researching it a little bit it seems that monodevelop was started as a port of sharpdevelop which is an open source .net ide for windows

718196
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
you can specifically target the mono framework when writing apps in sharpdevelop something you can t do with visual-studio express

718198
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
you can use the same binaries produced from visual-studio or sharpdevelop on mono

718200
sql-server	mysql
sql-server mysql others or

718213
selected	textbox
on the exitfocus event not sure about the event name of the first textbox do a selected from the db for the text in the textbox

718215
value	field
it doesn t feel right for storing such a potentially large value in a field like this but maybe not

718216
python	java
i presume that a similar situation holds for ruby packages though i have no direct knowledge there nor even how common it is for ruby packages to use binary extensions.... you d be able to use the whole range of java libraries but very little in the way of python ruby libraries

718216
python	java
if your code is pure python then it s already cross-platform as long as the destination machine already has python installed just as java is.

718216
python	java
but at least in windows it s rather less safe to assume that python is installed than to assume that java is installed

718216
linux	bsd
really if this is a large-ish application stack and you want to be able to have a drop-in bundle that can be deployed on almost any server the easiest route would probably be to distribute it as a complete vmware virtual machine -- the player software is free for at least windows and nix but i presume for mac as well and it allows you to create a dedicated linux bsd system that s already fully configured specifically for your application

718216
linux	bsd
i say linux bsd because then you don t need to worry about os licensing fees...

718238
value	field
i find it unlikely that your user table will require so many varchar field that can t somehow be turned into fks from a master table of value

718239
sql-server	oracle
how can i run free personal copies of sql-server sybase or oracle on my linux box

718239
postgresql	mysql
i just want to re- familiarize myself with these different sql dialects and compare techniques and timing to the mysql and postgresql i do have installed

718247
compareto	tostring
i usually implement the compareto methods as well as the tostring methods

718254
value	field
bit field you can store many value in there and you can add more field as needed or even use a separate table

718256
virtualbox	vmware
for sql-server you will have to get windows either as a separate os or in a virtual machine like virtualbox or vmware

718261
document	element
it jumps on the first element mucks around with the attributes and continues looking for all of the elements with the default namespace in the rest of the document

718264
virtual-machine	vmware
use xen or vmware to create a new virtual-machine running windows or whatever platform you fancy

718264
remote-desktop	rdp
alternatively connect to your virtual machines via a linux remote-desktop rdp client

718267
data-uri	data-url
if you need to just open it in safari and the server doesn t need to be involved why not use a data-url

718274
temporary	copy
by using a temporary file you can copy the account from the account file to the temporary file

718274
temporary	copy
then when you copy the data back from the temporary file to the account file perform the necessary transactions

718285
export	csv
what sql-server express will not do is export your database into a format like csv

718293
system.out	system.in
x y via system.out and read in text via bufferedreader system.in but you don t have any control over what appears in the console as a result of user-input

718296
constructor	object
you can invoke newinstance directly on the class object if it has a public null constructor

718309
environment	building
i am taking this approach because we also have to building driver components so i d prefer to have a single building environment to building everything

718309
iostream	boost
has anyone successfully gotten the combination of boost iostream and the wdk to work together

718316
enterprise	platform
strangely the java community doesn t even consciously realize that this is the underpinning of their continued success as an enterprise development platform

718328
substring	strstr
if the number of options is small and you don t otherwise want need the extra flexibility and complexity of a parsing you could simply search for each potential replacement substring using strstr

718340
integer	zero
because the php rules for converting a string to an integer say that any number of leading zero in the string are discarded

718342
click	mouse
the polygon tool needs to keep track of multiple mouse click

718349
one-to-many	entity
contact is a parent entity and has a number of attributes that make up one-to-many relationships

718352
python	ruby
i ve been using python and ruby to build quick prototypes and been very happy with them

718357
csv	xml
the data started as xml but i changed it to csv for simplicity

718363
ico	gif
worse it tries for both ico and gif format for each

718367
transfer-encoding	chunked
looks like it s because of the chunked transfer-encoding

718367
transfer-encoding	chunked
this is defined in http 1.1 which is what firefox is using while wget is using http 1.0 which doesn t support chunked transfer-encoding so the server has to send the whole file at once

718370
multi-tier	n-tier
web-services is essentially soa service oriented architecture which can imply a multi-tier n-tier model

718372
derived-class	base-class
is there anyway of having a base-class use a derived-class s static variables in c#

718383
derived-class	base-class
the mynumber declaration in derived-class hide the declaration in the base-class

718383
derived-class	base-class
if you remove that declaration then references to the mynumber in derived-class static functions will refer to the base-class variables

718393
csv	xml
hey you should revert back to xml instead of csv then load that xml file in a temp table using openxml clean up your data in temp table and then finally process this data

718396
temporary	copy
copy everything to a temporary file

718407
tostring	equals
on objects that are used primarily for holding data rocks i find tostring and the equals hashcode contract to be invaluable

718407
tostring	equals
this is because rocks are typically passed into and extracted out of collections all the time most notably the hash set map collections which require the equals and hashcode contract and it is very easy to see these objects in a debugger if tostring is implemented

718418
attributes	properties
if on the other hand a flexible attributes system is called for then by all means go with the properties key properties value system

718425
file-manager	upload
for the past week i have been building an upload file-manager system for my asp.net-mvc project and my original attempt was to post additional post data with the multipart files values

718440
webforms	asp.net
postbacks were a bad implementation choice for the asp.net and generally are what ruin the webforms platform for me

718446
tostring	equals
effective-java has a chapter on how and when to implement tostring equals hashcode comparable etc

718495
unspecified-behavior	undefined-behavior
that s the pure beauty of undefined-behavior unspecified-behavior it s undefined

718509
unspecified-behavior	undefined-behavior
further there are a number of ways to invoke undefined-behavior in a program -- all of which may corrupt your stack it s unspecified-behavior after all

718511
python	php
joomla is php based whereas google app engine is python based and tends to use django

718511
python	php
there s no straight python to php conversion though

718511
python	php
edit but if you really want to be adventurous you can try the python in php project which is still early phase and looks to be someone s side project jon projects pip

718513
pointers	stack
you could have a random undefined pointers that ends up pointing to stack and write though that

718527
associations	model
i want to be able to deep clone 10 instances of an activerecord model and all its associations into memory work on them update the in-memory objects and then when i ve finished pick one to write back over the original in the database

718527
associations	model
retain all current ids as one of my main associations is a has_many through matching the ids of one model to another

718535
selected	button
click on the start button + toolbox drop down menu next to run and debugging and selected open external tools dialog

718554
primitive	int
i m trying to convert an arraylist containing int objects to primitive int with the following piece of code but it is throwing compile time error

718580
associations	model
associationss may be saved also but it really depends on the type of associations and in most cases you will probably need to call save on these model as well

718581
double	int
don t forget to cast your int to double

718596
tostring	equals
for data value classes i have an abstractpojo class which uses reflection to implement equals hashcode tostring and asmap

718596
implements	extends
i extends this class for all my data value objects so i don t implements this each time

718614
owasp	xss
xss prevention cheat sheet on owasp

718630
attributes	properties
also is there a way an attributes maybe to enforce that not null arguments wouldn t be passed to methods and properties without adding

718638
ruby	php
personally i started using .html moved onto php tried ruby hated it discovered python django

718650
binary-tree	tree
given a binary-tree with an integer left right pointers how can one traverse the tree in o n time and o 1 extra memory no stack queue recursion

718650
children	nodes
that encoded the parent of each nodes in the children

718651
32-bit	x86
x86 or power-based 32-bit win linux and mac would be most interesting

718652
pointers	stack
you can certainly access your own stack and use its values to manipulate any data that came in const pointers as well

718659
pointers	stack
either way it is guaranteed that the memory exists and that one past the end of the memory is a sensible address otherwise you would have got an exception-handling from new a null pointers from malloc or undefined behaviour if you tried to mis-allocate on stack

718665
revision	updates
so when you finally have a document in the repository it is quite simple to commit and to updates from any revision

718697
realloc	malloc
an object is a variables of any type or a memory area allocated with malloc calloc realloc

718702
perl	php
not to be mean to php because it s quite good to get stuff done and fast but object oriented php is a non feature in my book it s more productive to use php as a procedural language after all that s what it was made for oop is quite poor compared to other languages same way i d not use oop with perl either if you want to learn oop which i totally recommend you use ruby or objective-c

718704
click	mouse
if i click node 1 sounds it will display the appropriate groupbox but if i right click on treeview node 0 general it will display it s frame and once i lift up the right click on the mouse the focus will revert back to 1 sounds but leave the groupbox for node 0 general

718720
pointers	stack
taking pointers to stack variables is a good way

718720
pointers	stack
summing up stack corruption happens when there s stray pointers pointing to stack

718728
typedef	struct
in order to have a nice struct i want to have a typedef to this function pointer

718767
show	next
when the user reaches the last image and swipes the finger for next image i want to show the first image

718788
groovy	java
if the platform itself is getting you down there is no reason why you can t spike some code or algo in groovy ruby lisp ecmascript and then implement in java for example

718792
firefox	safari
i am having this problem using safari 4 firefox 2.0

718793
firefox	safari
in firefox safari etc

718807
ironpython	ironruby
you could use a ironruby or ironpython scripting and utilise the system.net.networkinformation namespace although it would prob be easier to whip up a quick c# or vb.net console app

718843
sql-server	mysql
i believe this has now moved to a google code project but it supports mysql via the datacontext approach of linq-to-sql sql-server

718861
moss	wss
if you are already familiar with c# and asp.net this book is the book to read to ensure you are aware of how to develop wss moss applications

718883
attributes	properties
another approach to work around this is to use the javascriptserializer s scriptignore attributes and create a partial class for the object in question new ing up the entitykey entitystate properties and adding a scriptignore attributes to them

718883
attributes	properties
if there were a way to dynamically add properties it would eliminate the need to override those properties just to add a attributes

718920
expression	evaluation
you should consider using the expression evaluation engine that is part of windows workflow-foundation

718932
command-line	cmd
you can establish a connection to the database using the client of your choice cmd-line odbc jdbc then issue a use database cmd the exec the sp

718934
contains	elements
logut-row will contains text and some form elements enabling the user to logout

718934
firefox	safari
since the web site will be launched in about a year from now we skip support for ie6 and focus on ie7 ie8 firefox 3.x+ and safari version to be decided

718935
common-lisp	lisp
i know that common-lisp has clos oo for lisp but my question is really about writing a flight simulator in a functional language

718938
shell	tcsh
people familiar with the readline editline capabilities for modern shell such as bash and tcsh will find most of the command editing features of jline to be familiar

718949
google-chrome	safari
ie7 8 ff3 safari 3 and google-chrome

718966
perl	tcl
does anyone know of a library for any of the major scripting languages tcl perl python ruby lua or less major ones newlisp for example which implements bignums in different radices with handling for radix point

718977
look-and-feel	nimbus
i m trying to use nimbus look-and-feel and i can t simply plug it in to replace other look-and-feel because it adds some external padding around each component

718977
margins	padding
i believe content margins is referring to the internal padding

718987
python	perl
i m looking for a script perl python or batch would be fine that will go through a designated file tree and renames all the child files

718992
order	add
for example with an order aggregate you might add orderlines using data obtained from your gui

718996
32-bit	64bit
but you can work around the problem similar to what you would do if you want 64bit datatypes but only 32-bit datatypes are available

718996
sqrt	pow
if you need more things like sqrt log or pow this workaround will get too complex and you should really look for a library

718997
methods	extend
you may just want to extend treeset to get all of its methods for free then override the ones you want to change

718998
value	field
these field will be variables means that the logic of getting these value will be different for each domain amazon ebay for example

719001
perl	php
i always use a regular expression for checking for an empty string dating back to cgi perl days and also with javascript so why not with php as well albeit untested

719009
common-lisp	lisp
really it is best thought of as a family of languages probably but these days when people say lisp they usually mean common-lisp

719009
python	lua
if you don t use a language with both high-level aspects and good performance like cl has as does ocaml and a few others i would definitely look at the possibility of a two level approach with a language like lua or perhaps python lots of libs on top of some c or c++ code doing the heavy lifting

719013
constructor	private
each of these 3 methods are private to exceptionlogger and the calling application needs to turn on these methods through the class constructor

719017
lisp	lua
lisp is a better choice or lua or javascript they are also functional but not purely functional so for your case try lisp

719036
order	add
i then add the scores from above 2 and display them in high to low order

719037
optional-parameters	named
the other approach is to use named parameters to represent truly optional-parameters

719040
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
i am using kohana but this question applies to ruby-on-rails codeigniter or any other mvc web development framework

719043
boost	stl
however is there a less obtrusive stl or boost equivalent to writing

719050
contains	elements
the mapping file can contains explicit xml elements to java class mappings and omit any translations you are not interested in

719050
contains	elements
so for example if an xml record contains a customer s billing information along with a history of the last 100 orders but all you care about is the billing information you can explicitly map the appropriate xml elements to your billing information classes

719064
http	ssl
in order to set up ssl and http i need to obtain and install an ssl certificate

719066
methods	extend
if the class you decided to extend doesn t provide the missing methods you have work to do or you did have to extend from treemap

719074
subclassing	base-class
keep the common logic in your class but make it a base-class of three distinct subclassing that separate out the various strategies and then call common functionality in the base-class

719087
installation	building
libtool is a very cool tool for simplifying the building and installation of shared libraries on any unix-like system

719108
boolean	int
for other data types the compiler can catch this as an expression like has an int value so it can t be used in the if-statement but an expression like has a boolean value so the compiler has to accept it

719109
buildpath	libs
from what you describe you don t need a plugin you just need to add the required libs to your buildpath

719130
common-lisp	lisp
i would like to develop a graphical application in common-lisp or other lisp dialect that could be deployed in mac windows and linux as a way of improving my knowledge of this language

719130
installation	environment
wouldn t need installation of the runtime environment

719150
default-value	default
for a variables of a value-type the default-value is the same as the value computed by the value-typeâ s default constructor â 4.1.2

719159
common-lisp	scheme
their development environment was written in allegro common-lisp and it included a compiler for a scheme a lisp dialect variant

719159
common-lisp	lisp
on the common-lisp side there have been lisp applications talking to flight simulators and controlling aspects of them

719170
subtraction	addition
also all addition and subtraction on that fixed-point variables was also fixed-point

719172
put	get
to get the maximum out of bricks just put them together

719180
development-environment	platform
you would have to buy the development-environment - delivery is free on popular platform

719180
linux	unix
lispworks has a graphical library for windows mac and unix linux

719180
32-bit	64bit
on the mac for example the 32-bit version and the 64bit version runs on both powerpc and x86 from a single application

719187
build-system	toolchain
first of all the autotools are not an opaque build-system but a loosely coupled toolchain as tinkertim already pointed out

719187
linux	aix
on the other hand autoconf used to be far more important when the target platforms were more heterogeneous and linux aix hp-ux sunos ... and a large variety of different processor architecture had to be supported

719187
automake	gnu
automake is an abstraction layer for gnu make and acts as a makefile generator from simpler templates

719187
autotools	cmake
cmake s most notable achievement is replacing autotools in kde

719187
autotools	gnu
if you really want to stick with autotools i strongly suggest to read recursive make considered harmful and write your own gnu makefile configured through autoconf

719201
order	add
in order to track a sale with paypal i need to add one input-field to the paypal button on the websites

719227
macports	fink
the only issue is that if you use macports or fink these will probably not see that you have ghc install and try to install their own version of it

719228
scheme	lisp
plt scheme is probably the lisp with the most work done on making it easy to write and distribute a little game or graphical app. they include many examples of games in the base distribution and their flagship ide drscheme is written in their own graphics framework

719229
webserver	upload
since the user would likely already have access to a webserver you could just have them supply the login information for the sftp scp and have the application upload the code to the remote or local server for testing

719230
pylons	django
if you combine it with one of the many web frameworks pylons or django would be my recommendation for python the amount of work you can accomplish quickly is astounding

719260
versioning	upgrade
in general you don t need to upgrade binutils unless you run into some bug fixed in a later binutils versioning or need new features such as linker build-ids

719272
e-commerce	product
you can always try and take a look at the sourcecode of some other e-commerce product like spree and substruct they probably already answered that question for you

719278
contains	any
problems i see with this is that you can t persist an folder whose descendants do not contains any items which isn t too big of a deal

719287
perl	ruby
you will not be able to use a language that compiles to bytecode that s java c# and the .net languages perl python ruby etc.

719291
subclassing	inherited
inserts will still be to the separate table usertype and usertype2 but then in oo programming ctors aren t inherited either and two subclassing of a common based don t necessarily have similar ctors

719291
derived-class	base-class
just as in c++ where the base-class is constructed before the derived-class you ll have to create the parent row bfore you can create a child row you need the fk

719296
any	set
while the example in the docs as the title suggests is for populating initial data using sql you can put any set of sql statements in the file including alter table commands to introduce a db-managed constraint with a function right after the table is created

719303
project-management	project
i m trying to choose a project-management and collaboration software for our next project and would like to know your opinion on enterprisey sharepoint vs

719303
activecollab	basecamp
lightweight alternatives like basecamp or activecollab from the two i would prefer the latter

719309
access-control	authentication
amazon documentation on authentication and access-control

719311
ado	jet
within access as the article remou cites says in code it depends on what data-access interface you use -- ado which nobody should be using from within access you use _ while with dao jet s native interface layer you use jet s native wildcards

719397
lan	vpn
you can do this for any lan machine or for any remote machine connect to your lan via vpn

719400
ruby-on-rails	rspec
it appears that the the problem is either with how class caching is implemented in ruby-on-rails or how rspec manages classes that have been created

719403
methods	extend
you could then let this class extend the class you want but i would consider it better to have a private member of mymap being of class treemap as you then only expose those methods you actually want and not all those that treemap has additionally

719405
python	ruby
honestly i like the design of django more then rails but i like ruby more then python

the document itself contains a hierarchical spreadsheet think of excel with chapters if that makes any sense

719476
parentheses	operators
how do i highlight operators parentheses brackets etc

719479
parentheses	keyword
the print methods was both a keyword and function prior to python 3 so the parentheses were optional

719485
arrays	loops
in short the 2 loops loop through same arrays of strings and choose only unique strings - it means that the string can t be a prefix to any other string

719486
host	root
i want it to produce but it instead produces foo bar appname admin questions add where foo bar is the path from my host root to the app directory

719494
debian-based	ubuntu
in my experience ubuntu and other debian-based oses are much more trouble-free developer environments for almost everything except c# and .net stuff

719497
bytearrayinputstream	urlconnection
then create a bytearrayinputstream with it and process that stream in place of the stream you got from the urlconnection

719499
delphi	c++
with c++ builder you can use delphi libraries from c++

719503

719535
ruby-on-rails	django
ruby-on-rails and django were difficult to install on vista

719535
postgresql	mysql
for ror and django consider not using mysql and postgresql at this time

719535
python	ruby
using the default sqlite that comes with the ruby python installers should keep you happy at this stage of the game

719537
google-chrome	opera
that all works fine in ie fx opera - the code registers a document.onkeypress event handler when the box is shown then tests the event keycode to see if it s the escape key or not keycode 27 but this doesn t seen to work in webkit based browsers google-chrome and safari 3 though other keys can be captured this way

719545
firefox	safari
renders pixel-for-pixel the same in safari whose baseline i trust and both firefox and ie7 check out as good

719547
keydown	keyup
catch keydown keyup instead

719548
environment	building
if you are using some sort of a building environment for example ant you may pre-process the javascript file for production and remove those test functions

719560
browser-detection	opera
this works everywhere except some versions of opera which i have considered an acceptable loss i might fix that via the use of one of the other solutions plus browser-detection later

719566
base-class	inherited
note that if this involves inherited in the declaring classes one class is overloading a methods declared by its base-class you re into a whole other problem and you need to cast the target of the methods rather than the arguments

719599
benchmarking	profiling
you can benchmarking in firefox using firebug s profiling and by writing out to the console like this

719604
document	element
the difference is that an id is something unique to a document so it should be only used for one element on a given html page

what i am trying to do is given an image of some format jpg tiff gif or pdf conver them to other formats

719629
put	get
i believe all macs sold in the last couple of years have been core 2 duo anyway and will all support at least 2gb - but it does pay to get one that will let you put 4gb in

719631
uninstaller	nsis
how do i require user to uninstaller previous version before installing a new version with nsis

719642
instrumentation	debugging
you d never want to distribute an instrumented version of your assemblies and you wouldn t want to use instrumented assemblies for debugging purposes as critical sections race conditions etc could certainly behave differently given the additional instrumentation

719642
instrumentation	profiling
that being said instrumentation can be very valuable for the goals profiling is meant to address

719643
checkbox	textbox
each view has a similar look with a header bound to the domain object and some edit controls based on the data type of the view checkbox for bool lots of textbox etc

719653

719655
silverlight	wpf
the one big advantage that silverlight wpf and javafx have over flex + anything is that you can use a lot of logic in the first two because you have the same vm on both sides of the app

719657

in firefox no problem but in ie the script is correctly executed but no effect is seen the methods is called in a callback

719666
dialog	pop-up
asp.net pop-up dialog

719672
button	popup
the basic idea is to have the click function on the button popup the dialog then return false to stop the normal action

719674
contains	elements
let s say there is an xml file that contains both the data and the hierarchy of certain elements of interest to the application

719676
carbon	cocoa
except in rare situations your keyboard and display are managed by a windows manager x11 gnome kde carbon cocoa or windowss

719676
buffering	capture
eventually -- when there s nothing of a higher priority to do -- it capture the keyboard input from the interrupt and buffering it

719695
getter	setter
define getter and setter if you want to access them external

719697
object-reference	instances
q1 - but when using firefox instead of being able to enumerate through all of 100 cookies app only manages to go through first 20 max 40 cookies before reporting object-reference not set to an instances of an object exception-handling

719697
object-reference	instances
q2 - when i request this page via ie then i will always get object-reference not set to an instances of an object exception-handling btw â i checked and ie did manage to store all 100 cookies into a single file on the first postback

719706
kdevelop	kde
kde is built on top of kde and if you use kde linux then you may also want to look at kdevelop a c++ ide that has many users

719709
scons	cmake
i use cmake which generates visual-studio solutions on windows but there are others too such as scons

719709
libjpeg	libpng
libpng libjpeg and others are good for loading saving images at a low level but there are probably other higher-level image libraries as well

on the other hand hosting development-environment can be managed by administration of any level especially when there are such easy to use servers like ubuntu

719733
ruby-on-rails	django
the unix platform has a very rich selection of contemporary web development frameworks - ruby on ruby-on-rails and django are two of the most popular today

719742
textmate	emacs
i m not sure what textmate e-text editor s counterparts are in nix emacs

719744
dictionary	arrays
what i mean by ordered dictionary is that the object has some concept of the order of the keys in it similar to an arrays in php

719756
click	mouse
when you normally use visual-studio you frequently will move your hand over to your mouse click through options dialog classes etc

719763
daemons	systemd
sqlite is the speed daemons of choice for systemd that don t make heavy use of concurrent connections and complicated database features

719763
postgresql	mysql
you might also want to take a look at mysql postgresql or mssql ce or express both free

719763
postgresql	mysql
edit based on your comments you will probably need something that runs on a server like mysql postgresql or mssql express

719797
swing	awt
shouldn t take you more than a day or two to learn the language but you might have to spend a few weeks on the class library how to use collections the concurreny package reflection logging swing awt dynamic proxies mbeans etc

719799
google-chrome	firefox
the code works perfectly in safari firefox and google-chrome

719799
google-chrome	firefox
anyone have any idea how to get the page to popup in ie preferably with code that works in safari firefox and google-chrome too

719800
buffering	streaming
what i want is to streaming an mp3 file so that it starts playing when a certain number of bytes are download ie whilst it is being buffering

719808
children	nodes
at first glance this is a tree of nodess where each nodes can have zero or more children

719808
linked-list	nodes
it s like a linked-list but each nodes can branch out into an arbitrary number of children

719816
getter	setter
properties are just setter and getter for ivars and should almost always be used instead of direct access

719816
getter	setter
it s easy now to distinguish between ivars and getter setter

719817
any	set
in your example you can do any one of the following to set the property myvar

719827
mousedown	mouseup
the other tricky bits are handling mousedown and determining if its time to start dragging mouse move while dragging and mouseup for end of dragging

719839
hide	show
this function looks at the state of the model member properties state and enables disables hide show whatever

719842
order	add
i would just like to add that you also need to make sure the order of your ignoreroutes rule is in the the correct order otherwise your first route will be applied first and your ignoreroute will.

719847
put	get
understandably you cannot put a lot of information into 5 minutes so hopefully this will give you enough to get going but if you have further questions please feel free to ask

719851
uninstaller	nsis
here is how i use nsis to uninstaller the current version while installing a new version of the same application

719870
superscript	subscript
and superscript and subscript respectively

719878
cygwin	gnu
i came across the following and i am wondering what implications it is going to have on my cygwin gnu environment should i be using something other than -o to name the output from a compile

719879
xilinx	fpga
you can trace activity on signals in a running fpga design using embedded logic analyzer software tools like altera signaltap or xilinx chipscope

719886
python	php
now i could do this in php which is the language i am most comfortable with but i am trying to make the shift to python so i m not sure how to get this done in python

719950
firefox	safari
because of the defined width select is cut off from showing their full values unlike in firefox safari where they are automatically resized to show the whole length of the value

719960
local-variables	class-variables
i have made the process a class-variables instead of a local-variables of the shellgetapp methods

719962
ref	out
either change your guithreadinfo to a struct or remove the ref on the parameter and add in out attributes

719974
ip-address	hostname
most webserver are configured by default to serve a web site to all-comers regardless of what hostname or ip-address they re accessing it through

719976
directory	folder
i created a folder devweb under the document root but instead of copying all the files i configured the server so that if a requested file didn t exist in the devweb directory it would look for it under the document root

719989
javascript	dom
by initiating the call manually in the test no such event happens. i also don t believe that functional tests actually track and update the dom or execute the javascript

719997
python	perl
i am looking for examples of real-world situations where knowing c would be useful while writing a project in a high-level dynamic language like perl or python

720006
version-control	git
i would recommend putting your website code under full version-control git or subversion

720006
configuration	environment
manage the database environment used by your site from an easily separated configuration file and tell your version-control solution to ignore it

720006
hosts-file	hosts
my second choice for that problem would be url-rewriting magic or its equivalent in the development server and my last choice would be just messing with the etc hosts when i wanted to test features that depend on them

720023
deep-copy	object
what you are looking for is a deep-copy of the object rather then passing by reference

720024
associations	model
if you use the reverse way of creating the associations then you are able to look at the model prior to them being saved

720032
strcat	strlen
the classic example that joel spolsky uses is on misuse of strcat and strlen and spotting shlemiel the painter algorithms in general

720037
order	add
and you need to add the following line to the end of the string_reverse function in order to ensure the string has a null terminator

720053
python	java
but the knowledge has no practical impact on how you use java or python

720053
linked-list	arrays
knowing the difference between linked-list and arrays list might help you write a java program

720053
linked-list	arrays
but the c implementation doesn t help you choose between linked-list and arrays list

720053
python	java
knowing c doesn t help you know the java collections or the python built-in types

720078
enterprise	platform
at the end of a day you have access to all the enterprise stuffs that the java platform has to offer

720082
cvs	git
currenltly we have cvs git and svn implementations

720094
duplicates	contains
both places should be well commented and it is probable that they will contains duplicates descriptions

720106
internet-explorer	safari
this applies to internet-explorer and safari iirc

720106
any	set
this assumes that you don t want any output buffering at all even if it was set up before your scripting such as in a php.ini or htaccess configuration

720121
document	element
an id uniquely identifies an element within the entire document whereas a class name is like a tag - many tags can be added to an element and the tags can be re-used

720121
contains	elements
it is possible for an elements to contains both an id and a number of class names and it doesn t matter or mean anything if the id is the same as one of the class names

720133
hide	show
i am trying to triggers a show hide of one div at a time

720140
superclass	inherited
in context of oo if you are working in a single inherited model there is an excellent case to be made for preferring interfaces over classes for defining your object model since that single superclass pathway is fairly precious and you want to save it for something more substantial than defining properties that are exposed on an object or methods

720168
binary-tree	nodes
that guy s algorithm is interesting but it needs to be pointed out that it does require o log n extra bits of space to traverse a binary-tree with n nodes

720174
json	xml
the data for the response back to the client may be packaged as json or xml or something

720174
json	xml
technically this is the task of your view layer though if your application s definition of a view layer is nothing more than an html templating system rather than processing and formatting anything that gets sent back to the client whether it s html or something else like xml then your xml or json generation may need to go into a new little section of its own

720186
eigen	jama
that jama reports eigen vectors equal to -1 times those of matlab is probably just an artifact of the algorithm they used

720195
gethashcode	equals
generally speaking if you re overriding equals you want to override gethashcode

720195
gethashcode	equals
by overriding equals and gethashcode you can report equality based on internal value rather than the objects reference

720204
textbox	button
i have been playing around with a search control and i have noticed that when you try and press enter from within the textbox it submits the form but doesnt click the search button like i want it to

720204
textbox	button
i added the onkeydown event to the textbox and it runs but when i try to use jquery to call the click function from the button it does nothing

720204
textbox	button
how can i make it so when enter is pressed in the textbox it clicks the button

720205
primitive	int
the int is a primitive type in the system so you re actually getting a copy of the value of the cell in the arrays rather than a reference to that cell in the arrays that you can assign into..

720205
primitive	int
when you have int it s a different story your int is not a reference it is an actual value on the stack since it s a primitive type so in each iteration the for copies a value from the arrays into the i

720211
.when	ready
from the initial opportunity i spent time getting ready for the next opportunity so .when it came i was ready

720213
arrays	loops
you cannot use a for-each loops to initialize an arrays

720213
arrays	loops
for-each cannot be used to initialize any arrays or collection because it loops over the current contents of the arrays or collection giving you each value one at a time

720223
instances	private
for instances a file for each class with a private section that shouldn t be used

720227
latex	tex
it s built upon a latex base so you re using latex commands where applicable but it s still in my opinion a much easier introduction to tex

720233
variables	boolean
at the place of declaration of the variables you can also declare some possible values of the variables and label them with boolean

720234
show	next
when the user click forwarding button it div show move to next div1

720259
research	metrics
can you please tell me some studies web sites papers links or research grouping that are investigating web pages design metrics similar to this

720274
textbox	button
i wrapped the textbox and button in an asp panel control and set the default button to the id of my linkbutton only to find that panels cant have linkbuttons as the defaultbutton

720275
any	set
you probably want to set isconnected to false on any ioexception as well as in closeconnection

720281
nsstring	nsobject
why is object declared as an nsobject if it s supposed to be an nsstring

720282
equality	boxing
if writing a struct it is more common to override equality not least to avoid boxing but it is very rare you write a struct anyway

720282
gethashcode	equals
when overriding equality you should always have a matching equals and gethashcode for two value if equals returns true they must return the same hash-code but the converse is not required - and it is common to also provide operators and often to implement too

720282
value	field
for generating the hash code it is common to use a factored sum as this avoids collisions on paired value - for example for a basic 2 field hash

720284
contains	elements
the contenttypes elements should contains a contenttype elements that specifes your custom content type

720289
value	field
to find a value of a specific property or a field

720291
firefox	opera
it works in firefox 1.5+ opera 9+ safari i don t know what versions and ie6+ using vml instead of canvas

720294
uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller
from everything i can see the uiviewcontroller s self.navigationcontroller is designed to always return the appropriate uinavigationcontroller as long as the uiviewcontroller exists within a uinavigationcontroller s stack

720326
inherited	subclass
for example if one methods in job2.pm needs to be customised i might create a subclass customjob2 which inherited from job2 and contains only the methods to be customised

720343
contains	set
the reason the cssclass might not be removing the border could be that .net has the tendency to wrap the generated html elements in extra divs or tables the border might be set on a different element contains in that div once you find out which element has the css class use css descendant selector to remove the border

720355
put	get
a variant way of doing that is for the constructor to get the current database handler and put a reference to it in an instance variables

720355
constructor	object
this technique gives the object constructor a chance to deny instantiation if the database handler won t initialize the factory call can check that

720367
asp.net-mvc	webforms
my hybrid webforms asp.net-mvc project is working fine in my local development environment but when i deploy xcopy to my test environment i get the error that sessionstate is needed full error shown below

720367
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m running a classic webforms site and only have one small section that i m moving over to asp.net-mvc 1.0

720369
contains	elements
the lookahead expression guarantees to selected a number d+ followed by an elements contains a text meaning no opening which include the word decisions

720369
contains	elements
would grab a single digit provided it follows a space followed by an elements contains the attributes y

720396
value	field
i am facing problem in display the column field value at the view

720399
gridsplitter	grid
usually you should either put a gridsplitter into its own grid cell or ensure via margins that no control can overlap it

720412
gridsplitter	grid
when gridsplitter is dragged to adjust grid row sizes for other controls like button etc it is properly visible

720424
entity-framework	nhibernate
as an alternative i would like to suggest looking into linq2sql entity-framework nhibernate combined with repository and unitofwork patterns

720427
triggers	insert
i would like to create a triggers that will create a unique 8 character id each time a new row a customer is insert

720442
spaces	output
wordsplitting what you re doing here is taking the output of the perl scripting splitting it into chunks wherever there are spaces tabs or newlines and taking those chunks as arguments to the first chunk which is the command to run

720442
shell	bash
you cannot do quoting or use any other bash shell features like parameter expansion bash keywords etc

720459
python	java
webservices are a bit more flexible as they re done using xml are designed to interoperate with other providers java python etc

720459
.net	wcf
alternatively have a look at wcf windows communication foundation as it s where things are heading in the .net world

720463
.net	wcf
note that remoting isn t available for all .net frameworks - for example silverlight doesn t support remoting but wcf and things like http raw sockets are fine

720468
32-bit	64bit
i don t think it is on 64bit linux size_t should be 64 bits but float 32-bit meaning your code will read something uninitialized

720470
mongodb	couchdb
mongodb is another option which is very similar to couchdb but using query language very similar to sql instead of map reduce in javascript

720472
ruby	php
it contains ruby rails mysql php and phpmyadmin

720483
put	get
the closest you can get is to put a series of textbox in the header and arrange them manually into a table

720487
required	checked
in case you specify i d add either isinitialized field that would be checked and an exception-handling thrown when calling methods property that required it

720487
exception-handling	error-handling
you would do your error-handling in your start methods and bubble up whatever wrapped exception-handling with all the detailed information

720505
boost-test	googletest
a ut framework cxxtests boost-test fructose googletest ...

720505
scons	cmake
something to manage the compilation chain scons aap b jam cmake ... -- i ve no idea what eclipse is using

720509
user-controls	ascx
this could be addressed by writing your own server controls rather than user-controls as server controls don t require an ascx file

720520
binary-tree	tree
this is typically a binary-tree such as a red-black tree

720522
click	mouse
in need a rectangle that can be selected and stays selected after a mouse click

.when	ready
.when i ve done some 3d art and am ready to improve my skills i m going to visit the places fa

720607
blender	maya
big names in the 3d modeling tool domain include 3d studio max maya blender lightwave and modo

720619
contains	elements
applying this xpath expression on the sample document will return a node-set contains both the page elements

720619
contains	elements
to explain you need to query for child-nodes of the book elements that do not contains any textual child nodes

720631
instances	self
by convention methods in a class instances receive an object reference as the 1st arguments named self

720639
children	nodes
here in the given example bookstore and book are also non-text nodes as they does not have any text of their own though their children do have text

720645
duplicates	contains
there are a few pieces to doing this assuming each list does not contains duplicates name is a unique identifier and neither list is ordered

720655

also on each page i looked at these were written as html tags but were rendered as text by firefox and safari

720704
zero	nan
if the arguments is nan or less than zero then the result is nan

720704
zero	nan
if the arguments is nan or less than zero the result is nan

720711
hosts-file	hosts
try editing you local hosts

720711
ip-address	hostname
type http ip-address all unassigned port 80 hostname simdomain.com then click ok

720738
pointers	stack
yeah see what you are doing there is returning a pointers to a object the arrays called board which was created on stack

720746
boost	stl
i would really recommend using stl vector or boost multi_array containers for this

720750
native-code	unmanaged
the unmanaged function-pointers actually refers to a native-code stubs that we dynamically generate to perform the transition marshaling

720750
contains	any
my filename struct is declared and managed in the same way as the protocol one above so probably contains the same mistakes but since this delegate is only called once and called quickly i haven t had any problems with it yet

720773
similarity	distance
for a given groupid the query should return all other grouping sorted by decreasing similarity where similar is defined as minimum euclidian distance between all possible pairs of 30 value in two grouping

720776
attributes	properties
does anybody know if it is the way to set control s child attributes properties by inline code

720785
hide	show
i think i have sinse found a small plugins which allows show or hide the full path

720793
constructor	private
for a singleton all constructor have to be private so that you can access only through a function

720803
arrays	loops
you can also buildup the jagged arrays in a loops while processing your file like this

720817
iostream	boost
in the boost examples in the documentation tcp iostream is used to very simply send streams over the network

720826
versioning	upgrade
this would allow me to display a message to inform them that they re running an old versioning and that they might want to upgrade

720826
versioning	upgrade
when one of my visitors is using such an old versioning basically i would like to encourage not force them to upgrade

720829
directory	folder
if you are used to creating a virtual directory pointing to the folder where your service resides that no longer works

720830
silverlight	wpf
i m looking for code of full applications that 1 use the mvvm pattern and 2 are approachable for wpf silverlight mvvm beginners

720830
silverlight	wpf
preferably smaller helper apps or tools that use mvvm but that have a completed feel perhaps with wpf silverlight graphic animation goodness etc

720830
silverlight	wpf
overview of wpf silverlight code examples that help you learn mvvm

720839
bibtex	latex
while it is possible to use make to do most of the work a specialized tool can handle the intricacies of latex such as rerunning bibtex a number of times to get all references sorted and things like that

720842
keyboard	mouse
the controllers interprets mouse and keyboard inputs from the user and maps these user actions into commands that are sent to the model and or viewport to effect the appropriate change

720843
put	get
for such cases - this is what i do - i get rid of the code behind and simply put that code in my aspx ascx file itself

720855
boost-test	cppunit
i ve used boost-test cppunit

720855
boost-test	cppunit
i would suggest that you give a try to boost-test and cppunit

720864
ping	lan
ping is so simple that processing time is very low compared to network time provided you don t check a lan with 1gb ethernet

720873
firefox	opera
i also tried setting the option explicitly it s supposed to be the default. i ve tested in firefox 3 and opera 9.6 so doubt it s browser specific

720897
strcat	strlen
a lot of c programmers probably haven t even thought about the fact that strcat has to do a strlen operation internally

720910
checkout	payment
just need to be able to have a simple checkout page to confirm they want the subscription and enter a coupon code optional and then provide a variety of payment options

720910
integration	payment
initially i only really need paypal web payment standard integration but would like if it already has hooks for others like authorize.net in case we add that in future

720918
document	element
in my case this works fine for me as i just want to ensure a certain element order is applied in my document before the user saves the xml

720937
silverlight	wpf
they ll get you started but the subtle differences in silverlight and wpf will trip you up occasionally triggers are one

720968
triggers	insert
then we produced triggers for specific insert or updates that did a join on all affected tables and inserted it into the snapshot tables

720988
selected	textbox
using the designer selected your textbox click on the properties tab choose databindings - advanced

720991
webforms	asp.net
what part of the puzzle does it fill for asp.net webforms and asp.net mvc respectively

720991
webforms	asp.net
in that case how did they retro-fit the classes in system.web.abstractions back into asp.net webforms

721008
digits	base
it is because computers do maths in base 2 and hence many decimal floating point numbers can not be represented exactly with a limited number of digits

721050
vbscript	vb.net
in vbscript vb.net the is used for making comments assuming the code you provided is in vb

721054
literals	hardcode
well a string literals that you hardcode in your program

721082
spaces	output
django sees the object internally as having two spaces judging by the two underscores and two spaces in the repr output

721082
space	input
in particular user agents should collapse input white space sequences when producing output inter-word space

721082
spaces	output
if multiple spaces are really important to you you ll need to use the entity though i don t know offhand how you d get django to encode the output of that specific object using them

721092
value	field
however if i start editing a field then hit the return key to triggers ok the old value of the field remains in nsuserdefaults

721092
value	field
so how can i force the changed field to affect the bound value when editing is incomplete

721098
expression	evaluation
this isn t ideal since i really wanted to evaluate an expression without building loading and evaluation a function

721103
pointers	stack
directly as stack variables or as a pointers

721125
display	width
soft tabstop setting allows existing text to be display by tabstop width while new editing uses this alternate setting inserting tabs and spaces to accomplish the new indention

721125
configuration	installation
multiple user configuration from a single installation

721160
macros	vba
i am trying to write a vba macros to track changes to a workbook in a separate sheet

721167
children	nodes
look at both of the nodes s children

721229
contains	sorted
also when the data isn t really numerical it s strings which just happen to consist only of digits but which need to be lexically sorted along with other strings that might contains non-digits

721251
command-line	cmd
i use ms cmd command-line

721256
instances	private
it s always safest to lock on a separate private instances object because you know that object can t be locked by any other code than your own which isn t the case if you lock this or the streamwriter object itself

721266
logging	trace
there are plenty of logging trace systems for letting your program output data or strings or state as it runs

721285
contains	elements
this is answered in perlfaq4 s answer to how can i tell whether a certain elements is contains in a list or arrays

721297
worker	resque
a lot of people have really lauded sidekiq for it s threaded workers rather than process per worker which can use significantly less memory than the likes of resque which i was using before sidekiq

721300
unsafe	out
it is like steve pointed out only used in unsafe code context e.g when you want to use pointers

721316
default-value	default
this is because struct are derived from system.valuetype and not system.object system.valuetype implements default constructor which you cannnot override this default constructor initializes all fields in struct with its default-value

721319
python	java
i don t program in java but my guess is that it can provide a stack-trace in the same way as python the stack is probably just another object in the runtime which can be inspected and manipulated

721323
value	field
basically the compiler must see that every field gets initialized in the constructor so that it can copy those value and it is not willing to examine calls to functions or properties

721333
classname	inherited
in .net 2.0 and above the codebehind attributes exists only for backward compatibility and you should be using the codefile attributes along with the inherited to specify a code behind file along with classname

721343
value	field
so you will have to provide initialization value for all field in order to avoid some field contains random value

721345
checkstyle	ant
then modify your checkstyle task in your ant build script to include a nested property

721363
order	add
i get this when my test below tries to add an orderdetail to the order while it is still transient

721379
basic	vb6
make sure anything that is vb6 centric and not basic centric is behind an interface

721384
32-bit	64bit
the reason you get i386 for build_cpu is probably because gcc compiles in 32-bit mode by default on mac os x even on 64bit cpus

721398
put	get
i need to be able to do common tasks like using the up one level button or put the control in file search mode get the active item etc

721421
attributes	properties
in the case of your three objects that each have a rows properties this will be set to null and respectively none of which have a columnname attributes so an undefined error will be thrown

721427
any	set
but if that particular book is not an option head over to any university library pick out an introductory set theory book and that should give you what you need

721431
factors	matrix
it doesn t sound like you d benefit a lot from a full digestion of a linear algebra course which goes into eigenvalues matrix factors other stuff

721435
concat	where
the problem is that mysql does not allow this kind of syntax something to do with the where clause... i tried using concat but with no result

721458
aes	des
pycrypto supports aes des idea rsa elgamal etc

721470
firefox	opera
does firefox opera safari complain when you run it in any of those

721475
value	field
this then applies it to the value of the _person field instead

721484
any	set
a form tag with action set to any web address will send to it

721503
gridview	listview
i want the photos to be stored in a thumbnail grid fashion when the user clicks on the photo it should bring up the photo on a separate page. - i would think any asp.net repeatable control that supports templating of the item element such as datagrid gridview repeater listview in asp.net 3.5 etc should do the trick for you here

721510
triggers	insert
instead of insert triggers should keep the pain to a minimum

721517
any	set
you could set up a local server and save such files in a domain you can now add to the trusted sites but opening the file in any other browser than ie is easier

721518
selected	button
now the problem with viewstate compression enabled if the user changes the selected items in the ddls before clicking the ok button they will get a required field validator error indicating that a selection has not been made in one of the ddls - but this is not the case

721534
exception-handling	try-catch
wrap the lot up in a try-catch finally logging any exception-handling in the catch block and closing the stream in the finally block

721562
forwarding	port
examples are ssh2 port forwarding ssh key generation wizard and socks connections

721599
selected	checkbox
new jobs have a checkbox next to them that allows the user to selected and kick off the associated job

721608
subtract	add
all you need to do is find the sheet index of the starting page and the sheet index of the ending page subtract them and add 1

721608
subtract	formula
if your label numbers are one-based the first label has the index 1 then you need to subtract one from n first so the formula becomes

721609
versioning	upgrade
but i wanted to know a thing if i make a change to one of the dll files and upgrade it s assembly versioning from 1.0.0.0 to 1.0.0.1 but do not change the publish versioning it still is 1.0.0.0

721616
value	field
this may be as objectionable as innerhtml to you but it has the advantage of working in some cases ie where innerhtml or appendchild do not like some table nodes the text of style and scripting elements and the value of form field

721631
constructor	object
lastly it sounds like you might be passing an object reference to this constructor instead of an explicit null

721631
constructor	object
if so you could test this object with instanceof and cast to the appropriate type before sending it on to the constructor in question

721635
value	field
i guess your real question is how to get the value of a field reflectively

721637
dialog	pop-up
i want to implement a logon dialog box that accepts a username password so obviously i don t want the user to be able to dismiss the modal pop-up

721659
required	checked
the second approach would required that the ajax refresh either be execute as a post so that the checkbox are submitted to the server or having a separate ajax action which fires off when a checkbox is checked

721665
32-bit	16-bit
wide char implementations 16-bit on windows 32-bit on linux

721680
xmpp	sip
hacking it together with sip or xmpp networks should be fairly easy as they are standards with libraries avaialble for many platforms

721708
.net	wcf
does .net 3.5 wcf or other offer any type of push notification service

721717
any	set
i have a set of audio video clips and i would like to know if any of these clips appear in the streams

721731
listitem	selected
but when i am submitting the form after selected the day month and year from dropdownlist the list item value is reindexing after each submitting.ex.for day 1 to 31 month 1 to 12 year 1970 to 2009.after submitting the form the list item is becoming double for each dropdownlist.like in day dropdownlist before submiting it was 1 to 31 after submitting if i check dropdownlist the value will be two times 1 to 31 i mean 1 to 31 again 1 to 31 inside the listitem it happens for each dropdownlist.here is my code

721757
arrays	loops
if you want to do this without storing the groups you ll have to handle the logic in your scripting language by grouping the photos together in a loops that checks the creation time of a photo groups following photos in an arrays with it if they have been created within a specific time period or restarts the loops using the most recent photo that did not fit with the previous

721761
any	set
with the following extension methods that i have created you can set or get any property value even if they are nested

721805
project-management	project
as you can read in project-management literature there s a project closing documentation which would give a an outsider the possibility to dife into the project

721810
constructor	object
an example is a constructor of an account object

721822
32-bit	16-bit
that will only teach you 16-bit stuff for the more advanced 32-bit stuff i read some tutorials online

721840
put	get
to get aroud it have all the pages inherit from a base page and place put the master page reference there

721852
oracle	mysql
i find these db specific tools like sql query analyzer sql-server oracle enterprise manager mysql query browser to be quite clunky and slow when it comes to running quick queries and looking at data directly

721863
realloc	malloc
when you create an environment you pass the pointers to your own malloc realloc and free

721865
profiling	debugging
accelerating application development cycles with code assist quick fixes sql to java round-trip debugging and profiling tools

721871
powerpc	arm
qemu emulates several risc architectures like powerpc arm and mips

721872
keyboard	mouse
they also give you the opportunity to build your own and make use of the framework to handle mouse keyboard events and stuff

721878
dictionary	map
brute forcing use something like owasp dirbuster ships with a great dictionary - also it will parse responses therefore can map the application quite quickly and then find resources even in quite deeply structured apps

721903
double	int
of course if operator+ makes sense in general for your struct then you d want to add overloads for using smystruct on the left as well and or make them templates so that you get functions for int float double long etc

721912
value	field
you force the creation of field by giving them default value in the target schema

721919
button	popup
the popup opens on clicking on a toolbar button

721941
perl	php
though i d personally use perl instead of php

721941
perl	php
php is sexier resume fodder and lets you do some very cool things on the front end but in my experience when it comes to writing server-side code perl simply blows php s doors off

721941
perl	php
and i ve heard that the html mason extension puts perl on pretty even footing with php s front-end niftiness but i haven t used it myself.

721950
webforms	asp.net
i have the following string in a asp.net 2.0 webforms page

721950
parsing	comma
i understand that .net thinks it is a thousand separator which in en-us is a comma but shouldn t it take the culture info i m passing to the parsing method and apply the correct format to the conversion

721954
publish-subscribe	messaging
would make it easiest to implement publish-subscribe messaging with durable subscriptions on windows and .net

721955
linux	unix
i wrote a article about dumping the stack in c c++ with windows and unix linux at ddj some years ago

721982
textbox	button
the product i currently work on supports opengl on three platforms win mac linux and we built all our own widgets textbox button dialogs

721984
put	get
office workers are much less likely to report a vulnerability and are often incredibly sloppy in their security habits -- passwords get put into wikis and written down on post-it notes stuck to the monitor road warriors don t encrypt their laptop hard drives and so on

721999
order	add
if you need to guarantee the order of your values without relying on the alphabetical sor just add a numeric column named order or sequence

722002
triggers	insert
however most inexperienced trigger developers think that triggers work on each row individually and do not design their trigger to handle multiple row insert

722002
while-loop	cursor
this is a huge flaw because the only way to handle it in a trigger is through the use of a cursor or while-loop

722003
directory	folder
my puzzle is that when i run the application via the ide and get it to print the current working directory system.out.println system.getproperty user.dir i expect the console output to be bin - instead the value printed is the projectroot folder without the bin suffix

722003
directory	folder
if i were to navigate to the bin folder directly and execute my java class the current working directory is printed as i expect it to be

722006
checkbox	textarea
depending on whether its a text box textarea or checkbox i want to add relative spaces

722010
dbd	dbi
to my knowledge the ado dbd for dbi is no longer supported

722029
hide	show
then if rad3 is click menu2 hide and img3 show up but rad3 is still selected

722036
python	java
in python you can put more than one class in a file module unlike java so the class still remains close to top level class and could even have the class name prefixed with an _ to help signify that others shouldn t be using it

722056
hide	show
this becomes pretty easy if you use jquery s built-in methods such as show or hide

722068
constructor	object
because the program does not create object of these types constructor don t have to be actually defined in a separate compilation module

722071
scala	java
mind you this is scala and so you can use all of java s existing frameworks

722079
vsts	tfs
since i do have vsts 2008 installed with the tfs client of course i find it odd that ssms express doesn t include support for it especially with the 2008 version

722084
javascript	dom
you use dom javascript e.g

722091
windows-xp	windows
currently we are running windows-xp professional but if we moved to vista or windows 7 would the increased security prevent my service from functioning

722117
value	field
the county field is initialized to some value which you can use a base value

722117
value	field
if the user sets this field explicitly it means it holds some value remains uninitialized otherwise

722118
versioning	upgrade
you need to update to the newest mvcfutures when you upgrade to the released versioning

722131
firefox	safari
firefox does not load external dtds nor does safari

722144
show	next
on the very next request and most subsequent requests the log for the same lines of code show this

722171
shopping-cart	cart
i would like the shops of company1 and company2 to have different session objects so that for example if a user opens the shops of company1 and company2 in different tabs of the same browser windows the items put in the shopping-cart of company1 won t show up in the cart of company2

722173
constructor	object
you aren t referencing the class object but instead are referring to a new variables poop inside of the constructor s namespace

722175
python	java
if you re looking for a class that exists within the lifecycle of the outer owner object and always has a reference to an instance of the outer classâ â â inner classes as java does itâ â â then python nested classes are not that thing

722186
value	field
and sometimes i wonder why the darned oracle driver itself can t detect that a field is a clob and just transparently cope with ps.setstring very long value

722209
authentication	login
i am in the process of setting up a little module where if the user login in last logged in at a certain date then he has to answer 10 options questions before being authentication

722228
smalltalk	lisp
that s where smalltalk got it from possibly - since lisp had images already before smalltalk existed

722232
foundation	cocoa
i started this thread what cocoa core foundation helper functions do you wish you knew about 2 years ago

722303
constructor	object
if you wrap the constructor in a factory object you can delay creation of the socket thread until its needed

722354
google-maps	gps
the location api only seems to work for me when i warm up the gps by opening nokia maps or google-maps

722369
display	width
i have an mx label tag that has a set width which is usually large enough to display the text it needs to show

722371
blender	maya
most of the engines to my knowledge have the ability to import models that have been made in other software like maya 3dsmax blender etc but i think the importing of textures may leave a little to be desired i could be wrong and looking at some of the demos people are making magic happen

722379
selected	button
i created a pulldown menu in html that lists all the tables in the database and once i selected the table from the pulldown i hit the submit button

722381
scons	cmake
to that end you could try to step away from simple batch build scripting and towards makefiles - or better yet an actual cross-platform build system such as cmake or scons please note that they re just examples i m not married to any of them

722385
exception-handling	error-handling
basically where ever the java mail api could throw an exception-handling is an error-handling case you must determine how to appropriately handle

722389
cfengine	puppet
if you use something like puppet or chef or cfengine etc. to build and manage your machines then most of the runbook contents can live inside the puppet configuration leaving you with a lot less stuff just the location and password for the puppetmaster if you take it to extremes

722399
selected	button
now when somebody selected a file through browse button and presses on submit not upload file is being uploaded and i wouldn t want that

722409
triggers	insert
it is triggers only if the user manually insert them through insert- worksheet menu option or when you add a new sheet through vba as thisworkbook.worksheets.add

722409
macros	vba
if you know any way of capturing this action macros results within vba that would be greatly helpful

722432
cfengine	puppet
configuration file changes on systems that you administer are better managed through a tool like cfengine or puppet rather than through custom rpms

722444
.net	wcf
i haven t used wcf yet but i know with standard serialization in .net attribute based i could have an onserializing and an ondeserialized method on a class

722448
jar	war
should i maybe add the jar files to the war package at server side

722450
python	php
you then have a little bit of php that messages the python server with pre-defined messages.

722471
checkbox	textbox
the purpose of the splash screen will be to load necessary settings into textbox checkbox etc

722475
traversal	parent
what i did was to check if an item s parent was the list i was currently traversal and work from there

722483
geocoding	geocode
reverse geocoding apis for getting city and state from the iphone s geocode latitudes and longitudes

722486
hide	show
i agree with doing this outside of the database that way other applications with different length restrictions can make their own decisions on what to show hide

722501
webforms	asp.net
all of us working with webforms since .net 1.1 we have no mvc experience before but all of my colleagues are interested in asp.net mvc but no luck our finally answer is no

722501
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i can say asp.net-mvc is not bad but webforms is strong enough to handle the job

722510
contains	elements
margins collapse even with contains elements so your inner div s margin is pushing the outer div down

722519
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if your webforms app is really large and uses a lot of server-side items that bloat your line with viewstate then asp.net-mvc may actually help you even though it may take longer to develop

722553
python	java
i ve been to a fair amount of training but i think that 75 of the skills i use regularly java python db design architecture apache config html i had to learn on my own

722560
contains	set
this works somehow but the result set contains a all possible options or - it s not an exact match

722572
publishing	release
i generally look at the publishing date and if it was publishinged before the release candidates started showing up late january 2009 i treated it with caution

722578
contains	set
set up each project as a remote branch in your main repo and merge from each of them into your master integration branch that also contains your core files

722578
push	pull
your shared scripting can be handled as another independent branch in your main directory which your external partners can pull from and push to as a remote branch

722594
convention	standards
what is the standards naming convention for naming these business level entities

722612
required	checked
the idea is that after all their selection are made we d make a web checked to see what dlls are required for their selection and checked to make sure they have the most recent versioning of those files

722653
python	java
in python unlike in java there can be any number of symbols defined inside a module so there isn t a 1 1 relationship between the imported module and the class defined in it

722655
selected	button
note that when the user initially sees this input neither button is selected

722655
selected	button
so if they do not selected a button and submit the page the gender property will be null indicating that they did not selected

722656
terminal	prompt
so open a terminal type mysql to get a mysql prompt and issue these commands

722656
terminal	prompt
keep the mysql prompt open and run your command-line sql execution on a second terminal

722672
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it s true that you need to do more in asp.net-mvc to get some of the same basic very automatic functionality you became accustomed to in webforms

722718
subproject	libs
you will have a new directory subproject which in your case would be the geomapping libs

722725
compact-framework	.net
testing for and responding to network connections in the .net compact-framework

722725
udp	tcp
and remember you only need this for lower level tcp or udp stuff

722747
windows-xp	windows
it is included in windows-xp sp2 and later but on earlier versions of windows the runtime must be installed manually

722750
asp.net-mvc	webforms
still there are some areas where asp.net-mvc approach would be much more complicated and create more mess than webforms would

722763
similarity	distance
now you define the similarity of two equivalence classes as the minimum euclidian distance of the projections of any two representative of the equivalence classes to the subspace of the first 30 dimensions

722770
imultivalueconverter	ivalueconverter
i looked at ivalueconverter and imultivalueconverter and these do not look like the way to go

722772
administration	account
i want my users to create an administration account for themselves and then create account for the people in their organization or the people that they want to give access to

722795
margins	padding
margins can t collapse through content padding or borders so another fix is to put any amount of top padding or border on any element between the marginned div and the bordered div

722795
margins	padding
using padding in preference to top and bottom margins where possible is generally a good tactic as the margin-collapsing rules in css are unintuitive and unhelpful and will bite you again and againâ â â even ignoring the bugs in ie6 s implementation

722796
compact-framework	.net
looking at writing an application using the .net compact-framework to extract sms messages on my windows mobile phone

722796
formatting	import
i basically want to be able to export the stored message in the inbox so that they could be import to excel or some other program for formatting and storage

722801
boost	stl
stl please no boost

722819
any	set
a transaction always gets an exclusive lock on any data it modifies and holds that lock until the transaction completes regardless of the isolation level set for that transaction

722829
instance-variables	class-variables
if your variables is an instance-variables and not a class-variables you must initialize it in the constructor or other methods

722853
cos	sin
i have found this to be very useful when i need a fast implementation of sin cos implements using a look-up-table for a sin cos implementation

722901
perl	ruby
after much experience scripting in the unix linux open-source world using languages such as bourne shell perl python and ruby i now find myself needing to do some windows xp administration scripting

722901
vbscript	basic
i haven t done basic since applesoft in the 1970s so i m not keen on learning vbscript although i did learn enough to write a small script to mount network drives

722906
masstransit	nservicebus
imho with so many good flexible and proven bus architectures to choose from nservicebus masstransit rhino service bus implementing your own would be a big nih

722922
malloc	free
however in c i can t handle malloc and free the same way

722942
solaris	aix
it s been a while since i used a non-gnu system but last i used one neither solaris nor openbsd nor hp-ux nor ibm aix sed supported the -i parameter

722956
double	int
if it is skip it then use the istream operator to load an int double float or whatever is needed

722970
linux	unix
in linux unix you would do this using the cpp command

722974
pagespeed	yslow
yslow or google pagespeed - it is a firebug plugins it show you why your web page takes time to load

722979
silverlight	xbap
support for xbap or silverlight clients would be nice but is not essential

722980
shell	bash
i have cygwin installed and use bash regularly and i also have the mingwin bash shell that comes with msysgit but sometimes i really do need to run things from the windows shell

722981
administration	account
add administrator account to administration role

722984
logging	daemon
if you do decide to use asl note that while it accepts strings in utf8 format and passes the correct encoding to the syslog daemon so it will show up properly in the console it encodes the string for visual encoding when displaying to the terminal or logging to a file handle so non-ascii values will be displayed as escaped character sequences

722985
any	set
and then any page that uses it s own page directive to set a masterpagefile will avoid being hooked up to the default master page

722993
malloc	free
malloc and free are similar to new and delete malloc allocates new memory and returns a pointers to that memory

722993
malloc	free
free makes that memory available again so long as it s memory that was allocated using malloc

722993
malloc	free
the important thing with malloc free is to decide on and consistently maintain a disciplined use

722993
malloc	free
try to malloc and free a chunk of memory within the same scope if possible

722993
malloc	free
when you can t make it clear that what you re returning is malloc ed memory so the caller can free it

723007
value	field
it specifies that the value of the field or the local variables is constant which means it cannot be modified

723033
vbscript	jscript
btw the visual-studio docs msdn also include documentation for jscript vbscript html and css

723038
32-bit	64bit
i understand that we can compile a .net application by targeting anycpu which will cause to run 32-bit in a 32-bit os and 64bit in a 64bit os

723038
64bit	x86
however there was a reported bug on a 64bit os that my app was giving an error and the solutions for that i need to target x86

723048
32-bit	64bit
running it on 64bit .net 8 seconds was about 4 times faster than 32-bit 30 seconds

723051
mta	sta
i don t know about itunes api but becaust it s a com api try to set the loading thread tread.apartmentstate to sta in case the itunes api doesn t use a mta thread which is default for .net threads

723059
32-bit	64bit
what you have to remember is that to get a 32-bit process to run in a 64bit environment the system has to do a memory address translation for everything it does

723062
linux	unix
perl unix versions of perl typically come with full docs as manpages and perldoc some linux distributions put these into extra packages

723063
32-bit	64bit
in fact we ve often found our 32-bit apps run on 64bit vista better than on 32-bit vista due to the newer os memory manager

723065
treeview	listview
i want to create a mix of a treeview and a listview

723065
treeview	listview
use the built in listview and manually create a treeview by adding childitems between the parent items and also change the indentation of these

723069
32-bit	64bit
if you leave your .net targeted from any cpu it will try to load your 32-bit dll in 64bit mode resulting in a crash

723075
contains	elements
the contains div is the elements with overflow

723082
textbox	button
no i don t think you can easily do that with a normal textbox or button

723106
order	add
once you do that you can just reverse the direction of your order and add limit 1 to the query

723122
malloc	free
let it worry about malloc and when i remove the object let it worry about the free

723122
constructor	object
if i have object references all over the place i will create the equivalent of constructor and destructor methods with c syntax

723132
32-bit	64bit
if you use structures allot and have lot s of 64 bit computations double long then you ll see a performance decrease due to the 32-bit jit engine being less advanced compared to the 64bit one

723132
32-bit	64bit
otherwise the 32-bit and 64bit version of .net are somewhat similar performance wise

723132
32-bit	64bit
the cpu is actually running in 64bit mode but using 32-bit for addressing for compatibility

723152
sftp	ftp
i am asking since we can use sftp or ftp over ssl both would require authentication

723155
tapestry	wicket
what i would suggest is as previously mentioned to pick a framework and there are many to choose from such as tapestry jsf wicket struts etc

723155
groovy	java
perhaps you should look at some of the other technologies that are available on the jvm so that you have all the java libs available such as groovy

723155
groovy	java
groovy allows you the ability to program with java syntax if you choose or a dynamic ruby-like syntax

723156
oracle	mysql
i like having a database agnostic tool that works with every major database out there and i don t have to keep learning new tools as i switch between sybase mysql oracle etc

723188
curly-braces	conditional
i don t want to know what variables is -- not to do a hard-coded conditional but to just see an uppercase alphanumeric tag surrounded by curly-braces and just do a file_get_contents to load it

723199
any	set
but again i don t appear to have any breakpoints set at all

723202
contains	elements
if i remember correctly you need to get a copy of the default templates of the treeviewitem and change the horizontalalignment property of the header elements to stretch remove the rightmost column in the grid that makes up the templates and change the width of the column contains the elements from auto to

723202
stretch	styles
in the styles that was created for the item set the horizontalcontentalignment to stretch it is bound to something else by default

723213
contains	elements
i need one liner or close to it that verifies that given arrays of 9 elements doesn t contains repeating numbers 1 2 3 ... 9

723225
contains	any
the thing that i can t understand is that neither of datagrid s and datagridcolumn s hierarchy of objects contains datagridcolumnheader object or any reference to it

723240
stream	send
on the sender side if your messages are structured as objects it is often easier just to send the object instead of first converting the object to a stream

723244
filtering	grouping
filtering the 0 s before grouping

723253
64bit	x86
i run a 64bit dev machine and had targeted the build and release modes to the x86 platform

723271
logout	login
i have a usercontroller that have methods like register login logout etc

723294
windows-server	windows
if you want more simultaneous network connections and you want to run windows get a license for one of the windows-server products

723316
javascript	dom
if you re using a javascript dom wrapping library such as yui prototype or jquery any differences in implementation ought not to be an issue

723324
error-handling	try-catch
try-catch was still years away and error-handling hardly excisted

723342
reflection	runtime
it uses reflection to lookup the class at runtime and instantiate it

723357
reflection	runtime
reflection is the ability to write static code that executes code at runtime that is normally determined at compile time

723357
reflection	runtime
with reflection i can load a .net assembly a dll in this case at runtime find out all the types that are in the .net assembly see if any of those types implement a specific interface and if so instantiate the class to which i invoke the interface methods

723357
reflection	runtime
i know that use-case is a bit technical but essentially reflection allows me to load plugins dynamically ie at runtime and lets me make type-safe calls to it

723359
reflection	runtime
in the .net universe reflection is the process of runtime type discovery

723359
reflection	runtime
using reflection at runtime i can inspect all of the assemblies in a certain directory location to see if they have this attributes defined

723359
exception-handling	try-catch
your statement makes me believe you have few if any try-catch blocks anywhere in your application such that every exception-handling is percolating back to the top of the call stack

723366
reflection	runtime
reflection allows one to escape static typing at compile time by discovering types methods fields etc at runtime

723379
png	gif
it basically contains the emoticon image gif png

723393
reflection	runtime
the most common use of reflection is an extension of what used to be called rtti runtime type information and was primarily the domain of c++ programmers

723393
reflection	runtime
reflection is a side-effect of the way .net is built and that microsoft elected to expose the libraries they used to create visual-studio and the .net runtime to developers outside of microsoft

723393
reflection	runtime
most of the reflection library focuses on type discovery and creation that can be invoked at runtime

723393
constructor	object
call an object constructor based on signature for an object of a class that is not known at compile time

723401
keystore	jks
in java both of these will be jks although it has limited support for pkcs12. there are default keystore truststore locations for the jre as well as for each user

723431
base-class	inherited
i have a base-class for some kind of user-controls and in that base-class and in its inherited classes i want to store some properties

723432
firefox	safari
however my simple solution turned out to not be so simple because the table also contains a tag which is not being displayed in firefox safari works

723449
setupapi	hid
i have a feeling that the win32 port of libusb could manage this without too much trouble but unfortunately i need a solution that depends only on libraries that come with windows such as the setupapi and hid dlls that contains the functions mentioned above

723460
contains	any
your user-interface shouldn t contains any logic that does more than presenting output to the user

723472
put	get
i also need to put a value in there to begin with since the date is loaded from a db once i get this code working that is

723472
google-chrome	firefox
i also tried google-chrome firefox and ie7 same behaviour.

723494
quadtree	map
more optimal then using a grid as your spatial data structure might be a quadtree because it logarithmically breaks down the map

723502
positioning	slider
i am currently making an mp3 player in wpf and i want to make a slider that will allow the user to seek to a particular positioning in an mp3 by sliding the slider to the left or right

723540
any	set
just noticed that you can set up chron jobs but they re limited by the same rules as any other request 30 second runtime can t modify files etc

723542
textchanged	textbox
any changes to the text in the textbox object are detected by the binding object which attaches to the textchanged event and passed into the myobject.text property

723560
persistence	hibernate
struts for front-end spring for middle layer and jpa hibernate for persistence layer

723579
exception-handling	error-handling
the lack of implicit memory resource and error management garbage collection raii automatically-called constructor destructors maybe exception-handling force c users to write a lot of initialization error-handling and cleanup code

723579
malloc	free
you can only write so many malloc free pairs before you start to analyze the lifetime of every single variables you come across in every single language

723592
google-chrome	firefox
you can try it with this document admittedly not pure html but that document works in desktop safari and google-chrome and firefox 3

723602
python	c++
perhaps my example was contrived - a friend of mine who actually likes python found this peculiar bug but the fact of the matter is all of these languages are implemented in c or c++

723607
pascal	delphi
we have released a new product for creating cross platform apps mac osx using delphi free pascal

723612
sql-server	oracle
the as400 can work with many database flavors such as db2 ms sql-server oracle etc.

723612
put	get
to take a quick stab at this without knowing which sql flavor i would say you need to put around your date values so they don t get treated as numeric values

723616
reflection	runtime
reflection provides the ability to determine things and execute code at runtime

723633
python	perl
i am looking for examples of real-world situations where knowing c would be useful while writing a project in a high-level dynamic language like perl or python

723633
python	perl
the truth is there are many ways to write perl or python code and some are better as in more efficient than the others

723633
python	perl
if you know the low level details of how your code is executed in perl or python both of which are written in c you can code around several inefficiencies --like knowing which looping construct is faster how memory is retained released etc

723633
python	perl
also when writing a project in perl or python you sometimes hit a performance wall

723636
implements	extends
glassfish v2 requires you to extends some of its own internal classes that implements loginmodule or realm themselves

723639
selected	checkbox
and i need to get multiple selected fields not checkbox from that

723639
value	field
and i doesn t understand how can i set current value of object for initial value of each field

723667
macros	basic
it provides some basic macros construction facilities that will help

723667
32-bit	16-bit
manx or lattice c were the c compilers of the time if you can find them good luck with manx tending towards 16-bit and lattice towards 32-bit

723667
processor	cpu
i seem to recall that the issue was surrounding how it would handle multiple processor and memory protection given that the entire microkernel runs in a non-priv cpu mode

723690
hide	show
1 not authentication access in which case the page should hide everything and just show the error message

723714
inherited	subclass
since with private inherited you don t have is-a no one will be able to use a baseclas pointers to a derived subclass and you won t get the slicing problem when passinfg by value

723720
base-class	inherited
inherited privately instead of publicly as above and add wrapper functions into the derived class that call the implementations of the base-class

723731
export	report
probably your only avenue will be to export the report to report definition file and to manually recreate it in 8.5

723733
detect	move
your code will be cleaner and easier to maintain if you take complicated actions like the reaction after you detect a door and move them into their own function

723742
put	get
and i had tried to open up two connections one for each server and using get and put to move it from server to server

723745
entity-framework	ado.net
i recommend against directly returning linq to sql or ado.net entity-framework objects from a web service

723761
textbox	button
i have a section on the form where i add some textbox dynamically when the user clicks a add new part button

723777
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
something ruby-on-rails could copy from cakephp scaffold paginator sorter on index in cakephp

723794
controller	routes
in configuration routes add a line that sends requests of the form baseurl controller vendor-name to the action showsummary or maybe a new action show_summary_by_vendor_name

723802
hide	show
because of this most people immediately understood that they could move between tabs we used javascript to hide and show the divs and a save would save changes to all of them

723841
document	element
whenever i insert an element into my xml document the system adds an xmlns attributes to it

723841
document	element
i believe one needs to include the namespace when adding the new element because the original document has a namespace

723854
asp.net-mvc	webforms
while asp.net-mvc is the new kid on the block there are still a lot of benefits to designing with the webforms model

723854
webforms	asp.net
choosing between asp.net webforms and mvc

723880
code-coverage	ncover
that being said you should check out the code-coverage tools in visual-studio team system or any of a number of external coverage tools such as ncover

723882
json	xml
there are tons of methods of serializing eg json xml or even java s built-in serialization support only recommended if both the client and server will always be java

723890
authentication	login
that said if you only need a single login so there s no complex user management going on why not use apache s built-in authentication features authuserfile .htpasswd together with require valid-user

723891
ip-address	proxy
in general this isn t a good idea as many users are behind a proxy or a nat router which would allow for multiple connections to come from the same ip-address

723893
command-line	cmd
if i interpret you question correctly you are sending the text to some sort of shell command-line interpreter and you want it to execute your cmd

723893
command-line	cmd
usually command-line interpreters output a certain prompt like on a linux system or c for dos that indicate that they can accept new cmd

723903
elementtree	lxml
you can do this with elementtree which is include in the standard-library or with lxml

723931
sql-server	mysql
it may be a common task but maybe 20gb isn t as common with mysql as it is with sql-server

723939
default	reset
this gives you the ability to reset the chain back to the default state

723944
xsd	xml
xmlns is xml namespace - basically the idea is the same as c++ namespaces java c# packages etc except it s for parsing against varying xml schemas eg xsd dtd

723946
perl	php
if you already know c perl and java then in all honesty you already know php you just don t know it yet

723948
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
then you use objectoutputstream and objectinputstream to write object

723954
export	report
since you are using .net you can use a local rdlc report rather than having to install reporting services. and use the report viewer to export as a pdf

723961
hosts-file	hosts
this possibly means that it s the fault of the operating system.web server in which case you can enter the ip-address of the server you are connecting to into your hosts manually

723963
contains	any
also anytime you run a query against the database that contains any sort of dynamic data there is a danger of sql injection

723974
constructor	object
if you create the object then assign to it in the constructor this generally results in the creation and destruction of temporary objects which is inefficient

723977
perl	php
with perl and c background i would think that php is going to come easy

723998
database-normalization	database-design
in relational database-design there is a concept of database-normalization or simply normalisation which is a process of organising columns attributes and tables relations to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity

724003
jquery	dojo
it is well supported by all the major browsers and there are a variety of rich frameworks available jquery dojo asp.net

724010
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
what you want is to use the objectoutputstream and objectinputstream classes

724010
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
objectoutputstream has a methods writeobject and the objectinputstream has a corresponding readobject methods

724021
put	get
core animation also has the advantage that if you want to do lower level graphics or integrate quartz composer animation you can put either of them into a calayer and so get the advantages of all of the systems

724028
external	embed
the flash is from an external supplier and i don t have a whole lot of control over it apart from the embed scripting

724032
duplicates	contains
1nf is the most basic of normal forms - each cell in a table must contains only one piece of information and there can be no duplicates rows

724048
debian	linux
gnu assembler 2.17 debian gnu linux

724049
url-encoding	url
yeah url-encoding is going to encode that string so that it would be passed properly in a url to a final destination

724053
internet-explorer	google-chrome
i tested your site in mozilla firefox 3.1 beta 3 internet-explorer 8 and google-chrome 2 beta and the menus work

724094
realloc	malloc
malloc calloc realloc etc

724096
boost-serialization	boost
boost-serialization i have a probably unjustified reluctance to use boost libraries at the moment

724099
lcov	gcov
use gcov to create an executable that generates profiling output and then use lcov to generate nice html output for your code

724102
pointers	stack
you can t assign a pointers to an arrays on stack

724112
private-members	object
there are many uses for reflection that have already been detailed here but another use might be to log the state of an object including its private-members for use in debugging

724126
32-bit	64bit
you can run 32-bit code just fine on a 64bit os and 64bit server 2003 will run awesomely well on such a system as you describe

724130
icmp	tcp
note that if your program is running with insufficient privs to do icmp ping then java will resort to using a tcp echo request to port 7 which will still suit your needs

724133
execute	prepare
many programmers tend to like the prepare statement approach as it allows them complete control over the query that is being execute while dbas like the stored procedure approach for the same reason

724139
canvas	scale
i just ran into a slight issue that whenver i scale zoom my canvas all the elements in the canvas get scaled and this is the behaviour i wanted but this also increases the stroke thickness of the path

724141
packets	ping
a common thread for all incoming packets that will decide whether an incoming packet is a ping request and respond immediately - which is useful if you want to test the current connection which takes other packets on that connection into account

724146
textbox	button
basically i want to get the text from the selected cells in the datagridview and display it in a textbox at the click of the button

724147
value	field
note that packing a single field with multiple value eg

724154
selected	cells
the following will create a comma-delimited list of all selected cells values

724163
double	int
and let s suppose the methods in either variant takes an int and a double and returns an int

724166
arrays	loops
then in your main loops you check the current state of the key and the previous state of the key by keeping a second arrays of 256 bits that you make a copy to every frame

724179
selected	cells
in this specific case the tostring will return the name of the object retruned by the selectedcell property. a collection of the currently selected cells

724183
selected	cell
or in case you just need the value of the first seleted sell or just one selected cell if one is selected

724187
contains	elements
using the wpf grid control is easy when your child elements are always contains within a single grid cell there is no column row spanning

724195
credentials	security
at the moment the auth credentials are in cleartext which is obviously not ideal from a security point of view

724202
callback	methods
what happens here is the methods is added as a callback for your event

724220
udp	tcp
these are two classes i made to somewhat abstract the work needed for tcp and udp socket protocols

724227
virtual-functions	base-class
just to add to the above answers you cannot instantiate an object of a class contains pure virtual-functions so in the future if you intend to have objects of your base-class do remember to make the function non-pure virtual

724260
instances	private
in those instances you can create an accessor and use reflection to invoke the private methods

724260
mstest	nunit
lastly i would recommend using nunit with testdriven.net - a very useful plugins whether you re doing nunit or mstest

724268
hash	md5
something like md5 for the hash

724270
contains	set
a union contains a set of mutually exclusive data

724271
any	set
any way to set the confirmation prompt confirm in javascript box s title

724271
internet-explorer	firefox
at the moment it will display the confirmation prompt box s title to windows internet-explorer if it run in ie and the page at said in firefox

724276
firefox	opera
according to the jquery website it s been tested for compatibility in ie 6.0+ firefox 2+ safari 3.1+ opera 9.0+ and google chrome.

724284
solid-principles	principles
you should read more about tdd and solid-principless especially single responsibility principles and dependency inversion

724287
droppable	draggable
one of the most used plugins is that which relates to improving the user-interface is called user-interface and include draggable and droppable as functionality

724295
value	field
after storing i have display these value in gridview under a single field called dateofbirth by using this query

724295
updating	updates
but when i am trying to updates the dateofbirth contains from gridview its not updating where as other field in the table is updating correctly

724295
selected	textbox
my second problem is when i am selected the date from calender control and putting it inside the textbox then saving.after that when i am displaying the in gridview date is showing correctly but along with this for all date time is 12 00 00am

this is why gcc tells you that your struct is 9 bytes long while your union is only 4 - it s not saving space - it s just that struct and unions are not the same thing

724309
vb.net	vb6
what you can do in the mean time is wrap the function in vb.net and use c# to call the vb.net method which calls the vb6 method

724321
malloc	free
don t settle for the standard malloc free

724321
malloc	free
also we re talking c here you re going to overwrite your objects free more and once and forget to free some so build some debugging support into your malloc

724321
constructor	object
if you think you understand how c++ works then adding constructor behavior to memory allocation in an object factory is not so hard to do and using a custom built free can then provide you the capability to call a destructor on the object being free d giving you back some of the c++ behavior you liked

724324

one solution as the rdocs suggest is to parsing the message that comes with the exception-handling and try to detect words like duplicates or unique but this is kludgy and the message is database backend specific

724437
mips	x86
in a project porting code from mips to linux x86 we did like this

724440
abstract-class	subclassing
the key here is that while toolkits apis can be useful in many domains frameworks are geared to solve issues for specific classes of problems that can be customized by creating application specific subclassing of abstract-class of the framework

value	field
for each field of the form the query string contains a pair field value

724554
pointers	stack
but for example if you have allocated a string object on stack and passed it somewhere by a simple pointers the destructor will free the memory when the thread exits

724572
constructor	object
the constructor of the global object will be invoked only once at the startup

724573
constructor	object
i d suggest wrapping the critical_section with a class that will handle the initialization and uninitialization of the critical section object in its constructor and destructor

724573
constructor	object
this way you ll be thread safe in most cases you ll have to make sure noone accesses the object before its constructor completes but that s relatively easy

724599
configuration	installation
i am trying to set-up an apache installation with forward proxy and authentication and even though i am close to make it work i wonder if there is maybe a better way as the configuration is fairly esoteric

724608
prolog	sml
both prolog and sml are used in theorem provers

724616
web-config	app-config
it sounds like it can t find the app-config web-config file

724616

724623
memcached	ehcache
decided to use ehcache on each of our webserver as it allows partial page caching and can be extended to a centralised cache server like memcached

i ve tried a single sl app which meant it contained all the control code as well but that relegates the server to data access which only needs some wcf web service code no need for asp.net-mvc there

724631
json	xml
in my next iteration i shall be using controllers to respond with xml or json directly to requests from a silverlight app which contains the views

724638
logout	login
to simplistic the client can perform 4 operations login send receive messages logout

contains	elements
when you re dealing with a document contains 20 000 childnode elements 2 seconds versus 200 seconds will become more of a problem

725010
instance-variables	accessor
using mst projects using the accessor classes to assign a mocked object directly to the instance-variables faking the object using memers.mustspecifyreturnvalues and isolate.whencalled using withexactarguments to set expectations but for some reason the mocked object always returns null and no exception-handling

it s true that a wsdl may contains annotations for any elements but there s no standard about for instance placing those annotations into comments in the generated proxy class

725249
perl	php
and if you are using a server side technology such as php or perl you can port you application on either web servers as both of these technologies are available on either servers

725252
bazaar	git
for most distributed vcs mercurial bazaar probably git etc. working with several branches or clones is the natural workflow

725265

725410
javascript	dom
going on from what jeffamaphone was saying if it is something to do with modifying the dom then it might be worth moving your javascript from the head to just before the closing body tag

725433
background-color	transparency
if the color transitions are very polarized ie not a lot of subtle gradient changes you can make a transparency hole for the colored part of you image use the 8-bit png or gif format to support ie6 and set the background-color to the real color

725438
localization	translation
ideally you want someone who understands how to translation text to do the localization and for them to use some tool that they re comfortable with

725440
protected	public
also you could look at making the accessor protected or internal depending on who is calling it it may not need to be public

725442
versioning	upgrade
first and foremost when migration is a nontrivial undertaking do yourself a favour and upgrade to the latest versioning of java which would be java 6 not java 5

725442
versioning	upgrade
you will probably want to upgrade all of these to the latest versioning as well

725443
constructor	object
when allowing an object to be initialised via the constructor you need to ask yourself why you are doing this

725443
constructor	object
if yes â add a default constructor to the foo object so that the caller doesnâ t have to supply a list to initialise it

725451

725494
spring	jsf
note spring webflow can be used on top of other web frameworks most notably spring asp.net-mvc and jsf

725504

you can self-sign the binaries but the end user will have to install your certificate into the device store and that is probably going to be more painful and more expensive in support costs than to just get a real signature

725513
session-storage	cookies
for your purposes option 2 or 3 would be more fault tolerant and i will throw in another idea for small pieces of data try using cookies for session-storage

725551

725566
device-driver	hardware
what you are effectively doing is writing a device-driver for a specialized piece of hardware

725622
required	checked
but the normalized structure does required more investment in the beginning -- every new transaction involves inserting into 2 tables you need to have a checked constraint to control the types etc

725648
value	field
the trick there is specifying layout for the field and dealing with field that have fixed value validation etc

725662

it would be a severe security risk - a site exploiting an internet-explorer bug would be able to infect a user on mozilla firefox in this manner

725691
dfa	nfa
this one is interesting because it is a hybrid nfa dfa implementation

725691
dfa	nfa

error-handling	try-catch
in classic vb coding use of goto is handy for emulating try-catch error-handling like this

725860
grouping	sorting
there are several common parameters in these reports -- they are ranges or sorting -- so the user might pull up a report about all the widgets numbered 200 through 4000 grouping by foo

725869
revision	svn
it highlights changes for the current revision and also names the person who last edited a line svn blame -style

725891
error-handling	try-catch
it doesn t have to be try-catch just any good or best practice use of t-sql error-handling

725930
error-handling	try-catch
there s a disclaimer at the front that it was originally written for sql-server 2000 but it covers the new try-catch error-handling abilities in sql-server 2005+ as well

725943
ftp	scp
ftp scp run a server yourself or purchase a hosted service

725946
put	get
and if you put an upper limit of one minute on how long the timer can run or just have a 1 minute recurring timer then you can get within 1-minute accuracy without ever resetting

725973

i really really like the conditional operators in c#

725974
value	field
you can pass any arbitrary valid value for the rowversion field datetime.now for example

725995
ftp	scp
assuming that you don t want to use ftp scp as suggested above here is how i solved a similar problem .

726000
decimal	hex

726061
mstest	nunit
mstest and nunit makes use of attributes to tell the test framework how it should use classes that define test fixtures

726062
conditional	operators
as noted you don t need to use the conditional operators here but a little care with your indentation can improve readability immensely

726062
conditional	operators
i love the conditional operators but if you run all your code together in a dense block with no indentation it s going to be unreadable no matter what operatorss you are using

726065
contains	any
when i remove these tags website is loaded successfully but while opening any of pages that contains any of these control i ve that error

726108
postgresql	mysql
i m using nhibernate for the database layer as i need to support different database options postgresql and mysql at a minimum

726117
conditional	operators
the example you have is an abuse of the conditional operators

classic singleton patterns in java typically involve private constructor and public static factory methods but are still vulnerable to instantiation via reflection or de- serialization

726212
spaces	output
if application produces a lot of trace output then sooner or later this information will use up all disk spaces

726213

726331
directory	folder
i have a bunch of externals directory in a plugins folder

sql-server	mysql
i did some searching and mysql doesn t seem to support the top n command as sql-server does

726395
attributes	properties
i would like to know if there is any posibility on java to keep the original order of attributes of an xml file processed by means of dom api or any way to force the order maybe by using an alternative serialization api that lets you set this kind of properties

727589
postgresql	mysql
acoording to google 23000 indicates a unique constraint violation in at least mysql postgresql and oracle

727596
subtraction	addition
consider a numeric class - you can perform multiplication division addition subtraction etc

727597
python	perl
the reason perl python etc use a slower algorithm though is that the regex language defined isn t really regular expressions

727597
regular-language	pumping-lemma
it follows via the pumping-lemma for regular-languages that this is not a regular-language

727601
buffering	streaming
i know that amongst streaming clients quicktime and wmp both do not work well with the idea of low-latency or zero buffering

727601
adobe-media-server	flash-media-server
adobe flash-media-server with a flash client - adobe-media-server seems to have little support for low-latency streams

32-bit	64bit
for 32 bit windows it will be 32-bit and on 64bit windows it will be 64bit

727678
32-bit	64bit
the reason for this is because size_t is defined as a 32-bit value on 32-bit windows and a 64bit value on 64bit windows

727678
32-bit	64bit
does this happen on other 64bit platforms using 64bit values ignoring that size_t might be 32-bit on some 64bit platforms

727678
32-bit	64bit
should i pull out the values as 32-bit values regardless of the target platform and will that cause problems if a 64bit value is pushed into the variadic function

727678
32-bit	64bit
the slot where an argument is placed might not be initialized to 0 and there might not be a slot --on some platforms you could pass a 64bit value and extract two 32-bit values inside the variadic function

assuming you have perl and or ruby support compiled in rubydo and perldo will run a ruby or perl one-liner on every line in a range defaults to entire buffer with bound to the text of the current line minus the newline

728173
32-bit	64bit
in this case size_t is 32-bit on win32 and 64bit on win64

728194
account	api
their data is more reliable and timely but obviously you need an account and they have to offer some kind of api

728198
char-pointer	pointers
the printf statement in initfoo reinterprets that pointers as a char-pointers and you get the correct results

728207
dialog	pop-up
one could use a modal dialog for a login form edit form etc where you want to have a pop-up for user interaction but not allow the user to return to the windows that opened the pop-up

728211
actionscript	mxml
then reference those either via binding in mxml or through simple assignment in actionscript

728212
value	field
you could always store a marker field in the metatable with a light userdata value unique to your module

728212
value	field
used this way the _flavor field can only take on values that can be created by code in the module that has the symbol green_flavor in scope and looking up the field and testing its value only required one table lookup aside from retrieval of the metatable itself

728212
value	field
with several distinct flavor variables available to use as sentinal value the _flavor field can be used to distinguish several related metatables

728217
delphi	c++
delphi vb.net c# - all were easy transitions and i attribute that to having c++ as the baseline

728250
c++	lua
there s nothing better than lua for embedding a language in a c c++ application

728252
stubs	tdd
also it is obvious to me that dependencies are a pretty big deal with tdd as one has to think about how to inject a stubs mock to the said methods for tests

728253
inline-code	code-behind
or if you dont have access to the code-behind put some inline-code on the page like just before the markup for the sqldatasource

728261
loading	gif
is it possible to preload all page contents like showing a loading bar animated gif

728277
primitive	int
in particular it allows us to write templates classes with syntax that can be equally applied to primitive like int and classes like a complex number class

728279
configuration	environment
configuration environment production.rb

728282
decrement	increment
you can write a function that will increment a global-variables for each image you tell it to preload and then your callback can decrement the counter

728284
jquery	.post
if you are using jquery s .post function you might follow this example found here

728291
constructor	object
in fact you may want to make the other object a member of you class and within the constructor call the factory or make the decision right there whether or not to instantiate the mock or the real thing

728293
python	php
currently my knowledge is mainly in python and php so i m interested in taking the iron python route to learning and implementing .net

728294
environment	building
then you ll need to download the sources for the cell portions of the toolchain and compile them with the appropriate options --target etc. using the building environment you just install

728295
debugging	trace
in development it would catch all debugging and above messages and trace for specific classes.

728307
textbox	button
i click edit button and can now change the individual textbox not the datagrid and change it to test changed value

728307
textbox	button
in the cancel button i issue a mydatatable.rejectchanges and the grid properly retains the original test value but the textbox control keeps the test changed value content

728327
debugging	trace
for the main logfile appender set up a to limit what is actually logged in the appender to info and above regardless of whether or not the loggers have debugging trace etc enabled

728327
debugging	trace
if your goal is to have a single file where you can look to troubleshoot something then spanning your log data across different files will be annoying - unless you have a very regimented logging policy you ll likely need content from both debugging and info to be able to trace execution of the problematic code effectively

728338
contains	any
when the user clicks on any of the above button to fade in another page that contains the slideshow using the jquery-cycle plugins ie7 crashes

728373
entity-framework	data-access
i have c# project that is using sql-server compact edition and entity-framework for data-access

728373
exception-handling	try-catch
another thing ive tried is inserting the record in a try-catch and if it fails update but that forces me to savechanges on every record to get the exception-handling as opposed to at the end which is a performance killer

728374
googlebot	sitemap
i know that if i put the first 4 lines googlebot won t index the sites but what if i put the last line sitemap will googlebot be able to index the site

728387
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
dynamic-sql may be potentially vulnerable to sql-injection

728388
python	c++
panda3d is another one wrote in c++ altho its better used with there nice python based api

728402
output	mode
depending on your compiler the standard output might be opened in text mode in which case a single linefeed will be translated to r n before being written out

728426
grouping	sorting
i d make the recordsource a regular select statement and use the report s sorting grouping

728426
filtering	grouping
certainly if your select with grouping by has no where-clause it s going to be a lot more efficient if you run the report with filtering values

728429
googlebot	sitemap
i tested your robots.txt against my own domain which has a sitemap entry for every page and googlebot and googlebot-mobile returned that they were disallowed access

728434
linked-list	dictionary
the iequatable interface is used by generic collection objects such as dictionary list and linked-list when testing for equality in such methods as contains indexof lastindexof and remove

728443
ruby	php
i want to know what is the main technical difference between web asp php ruby etc.

728468
web-applications	webserver
even though the webserver themselves run on some os the web-applications that run on them are not tightly coupled to that os

728497
system.data	.net
in an attempt to find out more about this application i ve used the .net reflector to have a look inside...and i ve found that it references mscorlib system system.data system.drawing and system.windows.forms but all of them state that they are version 1.0.5000.0

728500
python	php
if i set up something like sbcl as an interperter to interpret fasl files like python or php what would be the best way to use libraries like clsql for instance

728508
jruby	mri
is there a particular type of java functionality that people are using jruby for or is it mainly because of the performance advantage that jruby gives versus the mri

728516
authentication	login
this javascript function uses xmlhttprequest to login to the web site that uses spring security for authentication

728531
blacklist	whitelist
my plan was to modify the groovy and freemarker runtimes to read annotations that would either whitelist or blacklist certain methods however this would force me to maintain a forked versioning of their code which is not desirable

728533
constructor	object
specifically what i want is a reference to an object just after instantiation and at the same time references to the objects that were injected into the constructor

728549
urlclassloader	classpath
i had this exact problem and solved it by creating my own urlclassloader and using reflection to call a protected methods to add a new path to the classpath

728553
value	field
edit 2 the issue does not occur if i assign value to another field of question

728565
mouseleave	mouseenter
instead of hover you can use the mouseenter and mouseleave events which do not fire when child elements get in the way

728570
combinations	permutation
note make sure you use combinations not permutation -- that will be much slower

728574
global-variables	call
in this case the variables x is effectively a global-variables in that there is only one instance of it -- multiple call to func including recursive call will always access the same variables

728574
protected	public
the closest is declaring objects with package scope which is done by omitting a public protected or private

728581
populate	row
create a read-only property on the row class that you re using to populate the grid and get this property to return the results of your function

728595
rome	feed
there are opensource libraries like rome java that may help with the consumption of rss feed

728596
selected	textbox
the functionality i would like to add is to restrict what gets selected entered into the textbox to only be items in the list

728602
managed-code	native-code
we are trying to choose between writing the mobile client using managed-code or native-code

728623
onchange	onclick
you might have to use a combination of onchange and onclick to get the behavior you re looking for

728628
compact-framework	.net
i am using windows mobile pda c# .net compact-framework

728631
joomla	drupal
2 very flexible php based cms frameworks are drupal and joomla

versioning	upgrade
warning - the modules are versioning dependant and not all modules have been upgrade to run in the current production versionings of drupal so pay attention to the versioning support

728641
plugins	add-on
if you can setup a separate test machine where you deploy and run the tests you can keep firefox ie etc free of plugins add-on like firebug that might get in the way of your tests and avoid this problem completely

728644
base-class	inherited
so is it possible to create a base-class that inherited from spitemeventreceiver which can be used by ones custom list item event receiver classes

728645
haskell	erlang
haskell erlang etc are not options in this case as there is a significant quantity of existing legacy c code that will be ported to the new system and porting c to java c# is a lot simpler than to haskell or erlang

728694
attributes	properties
in addition to non-enumerable attributes you ll encounter a tougher problem when you try to copy objects that have hidden properties

728694
constructor	object
one solution might be to call the source object s constructor property to get the initial copy object and then copy over the attributes but then you still will not get non-enumerable attributes

728694
contains	elements
i further assumed that any elements contains in object or arrays would also be one of the 6 simple types in that list

728697
google-chrome	firefox
and this works without any errors in all major browsers ie6-8 firefox safari opera google-chrome

728708
compact-framework	.net
the other point to take into consideration as explained by a senior developer here is that the .net compact-framework needs to recompile the byte code into machine code each time the application is switched to

728711
observer-pattern	strategy-pattern
i guess it s a mix between the strategy-pattern and observer-pattern

728713
order	add
in most cases assumptions about data seem to come and bite me so i try to add lots of asserts in the code in order make sure my assumptions are correct

728716
height	frame
to get a real figure fit the string into a frame that is taller than the one you need - then you ll get a height that is greater than your actual height

728750
value	field
using django how do i generate the value of a field the first time it s accessed

728750
value	field
then storing the value on the field

textarea	textbox
instead of a what it should look like any suggestions on how i can make the textarea normal asp.net textbox with the mode set to multiline display the html as it should look and not the code

728755
lookup	any
but doesn t adding one more level of lookup to the original url affect page ranking in any way

728768
return-value	arguments
something that takes the desired return-value as an arguments then sets and returns that as the return-value

728777
attributes	properties
i should mention that i am using this in the context of a properties of an attributes so the class declaration itself cannot be generic this is purely focused on qualifying a methods parameter rather than typing a class and its methodss

728783
implements	sealed
string class is sealed so you can t inherited from it hence you cant implements an interface on top of it

728800
textarea	textbox
you can not display html result in textarea textbox control

728808
authentication	login
using ad for your authentication is a great idea since you need to add everyone there anyway and for intranet users there s no need for an extra login

728817
authentication	logout
assuming your user authentication is somehow session based then the answer to all your unexpected cases which will actually be the norm - people rarely seem to logout of web-applications will be that those user slots become free when the session times out

728843
arrays	loops
my current leaning is to have a script that pulls the desired metadata from each file into a summary json file and load this summary.json file in php decode it and loops through the arrays looking for those items that have attributes that match the current query all docs with keyword1 and keyword2

728852
textbox	button
i have added a custom class to the project but in this class i am unable to access the forms controls like listbox textbox button in order to programmatically change their properties

728864
decrement	increment
then you could increment a counter in session_start and decrement it in session_end and use it to keep track of the number of active sessions

728867
jpopupmenu	jmenubar
i can only add jmenu and jmenuitems to a jmenubar jpopupmenu and other jmenus and jmenuitems

728871
boolean	int
basically this parameter should be able to contain the sorts of things you d find in json a few primitives strings int boolean null or lists of zero or more items or maps of zero or more items

728871
scala	java
at the same time i think in java the closest i d really be able to get would be and i know one of the scala authors designed java s generics

728895
malloc	free
edited i looking for some open source in c or is there some api like malloc and free

728903
unsigned	short
if it is smaller than int say short int then the operands are converted to int and you get -4000 but on a 16-bit system uint16_t could be unsigned int and conversion to a signed type would not happen automatically

728970
datagridview	listview
listview with view detail or datagridview

729007
constructor	object
both assignment operator and parameterized constructor can have parameters of any type and use these parameters values any way they want to initialize the object

729012
windows-server	windows
this article explains how to setup user disk quotas in windows sbs 2003 and windows-server 2003

729012
windows-xp	windows
managing disk quotas in windows server 2003 and windows-xp has more information about setting quotas programmatically

729016
emacs	vim
the coding form is recognized out of the box by gnu emacs but not vim yes without a universal agreement it s essentially a turf war

729027
linux	unix
in unix linux i would have easily solved this with a synlink

729035
fireworks	layer
assuming you mean the layer png files as per fireworks i don t think you can do it

729043
gethashcode	equals
you need to override equals and gethashcode in your class mytype

729056
pixels	line
for every pixels you traverse also from left to right over the horizontal line in the original image

729056
pixels	line
so if the image is an image of width 100 height 50 you ll traverse from a to b in 100 steps and from a to c in 50 steps drawing 50 line of 100 pixels in the area formed by abc in their rotated state

729057
execution	exit
even if it s bots so it doesn t respect location you will call an exit so the execution flow is halted anyway so no harm

729062
gethashcode	equals
the easiest thing to do is to override equals always updates gethashcode to match the logic in equals

729080
any	set
is there any way to achieve what i want without pre-creating all the possible child objects and then removing them if properties haven t been set

729083
mouseleave	mouseover
i have a couple of divs with a class of .box_panel and i have it so that they on mouseover they go from 50 opacity and back to 100 opacity on mouseleave

729083
mouseleave	mouseover
the code i m using for the mouseover mouseleave effects is

729087
silverlight	wpf
if you want style and cross platform go for flex or silverlight as your already know wpf i d go the silverlight route

729095
textbox	button
what is the correct way to create a simple form with a button and textbox in asp.net-mvc and allow me to submit the data in the form to the product create action

729098
order	add
the order in which you add values to the arrays dictates the column they appear under so think of your sub item headings as 0 1 2 etc

729108
realloc	free
there s no need to free realloc at all

729110
keydown	keyup
yes many controls have keyup keydown propertys

729124
shell	bash
i note you re referring to bash on rhel but your shell is set to #

729133
swing	swt
you might also consider using java with swt or even swing instead of c# but that will probably not be an option you re willing to consider

729145
button	popup
i believe this can be done ussing two button very close then use the code above in the arrow button but setting the action button as the component of the popup so that the popup shows below of both button

729161
contains	elements
instead it will often be a construct of elementss contains in a div elements

729166
keydown	keyup
it seems that what you need to do is to handle the textinput event rather than the keyup keydown events

729183
launchd	daemons
if you believe you install it but it isn t working you may find that your sql-server full-text daemons launchd service is disabled

729183
launchd	daemons
find the sql-server full-text daemons launchd entry right click and selected properties then enable it and start the service

729186
attributes	properties
it was done in .net and we used a lot of custom attributes on the classes and properties to make it behave how we wanted it to

729193
selected	textbox
i have a web page with a textbox and then a selected drop down next to each other

729193
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome they line up fine next to each other but in ie the select box sits higher than the text box

729193
selected	textbox
theres is no css applied to this selected box or the textbox

729194
cublas	gpu
additionally there s neat compiler software like pluto automatic loop parallelization and openmp code generation and libraries like hoard tcmalloc blas cublas for gpu etc

729200
dockpanel	dock
i have found how to expand the header to the width of the container and thought i could simply add a dockpanel and set the second text block to dock right but it doesn t seem to help

729203
implements	extends
when implements the userdetailsmanager interface you have to implement five methods of its own and one which it inherited from the userdetailsservice which it extends

postgresql	mysql
i do not know of any database that supports this sql server mysql oracle postgresql

729227
nsmutablearray	nsarray
nsarray its modifiable variant nsmutablearray and all collection structures nsdictionary nsset are made for storing objects

729235
sql-server	postgresql
i don t know about postgresql but on sql-server

729237
put	get
basically you use a regex pattern to get convert the functions into compatible strings and put themin a private member

729241
margins	padding
are you using any css to reset the margins and padding across all tags

729241
margins	padding
this gets rid of many rendering inconsistencies between browsers ie and the extra css needed to provide padding margins where actually needed tends to be minimal

729241
default	reset
with this reset rule in place the boxes line up in ie 6 7 tested though the issues of different default font-sizes remains

729256
uiscrollview	sizetofit
i use sizetofit with uilabel and it works just fine but uitextview is a subclass of uiscrollview so i can understand why sizetofit doesn t produce the desired result

729259
webserver	nginx
so to set up the scenario imagine a webserver say nginx reverse proxy say varnish app server whatever db server say mysql

729264
dfa	nfa
though the ecma standard does not specify the algorithm an ecmascript implementation should use the fact that the standard mandates that ecmascript regular expression must support backreferences 1 2 etc. rules out the dfa and thompson nfa implementation

729266
lisp	let
run a lisp and let a frontend web browser another webserver ... connect to it

729266
lisp	let
so it might be useful to provide pre-configured lisp images that contain the necessary software or let the user configure and save an image

729267
constructor	object
i have a mocked object that is passed as a constructor argument to another object

729268
integer	digits
i need to encode decode an integer which is up to 9 digits long but most often 7 digits long

any	set
to help with security set permissions on the web site to prevent listing any directory

729281
arrays	loops
in a loops i build another arrays like this named searchme

729287
webserver	upload
i use an installation of xampp to test my files locally before i upload them to my webserver

729287
contains	any
my web pages usually contains a lot of hardcoded links which means to test any links or any forms etc i need to change the hardcoded link to point to localhost and then rechange it after i am done testing

729293
exception-handling	try-catch
you need to enclose the code that trys to write to the file in a try-catch block or throw the exception-handling

729313
webserver	host
edit tim sneath has a blog post that explains what needs to be configured on the webserver to be able to host silverlight content

729324
user-interface	look-and-feel
regarding positioning - i did not care much and simply generate table tr td tags 1 below the other - however if you want to implement this as well you can have 1 more attribute called cssclass where you can define user-interface specific properties look-and-feel positioning etc here

729324
e-commerce	product
update also note a lot of e-commerce products follow this kind of dynamic user-interface when you want to enter product information - as their clients can be selling everything under the sun from furniture to sex toys

729339
hosts-file	hosts
add your external url to your hosts which can be found either in

729349
any	set
it works but there is one major weakness carenumerationinitializer must be instantiated before any reference is made to car enumeration otherwise carproperties are null meaning that car s properties can t be set when car is loaded hence the illegalstateexception thrown to at least make it crashes in a predictable and documentated way

729366
font-size	height
in the past i have found that the height attributes of cells are overridden by the font-size inside the cell even if there is not font present

729366
font-size	height
set the font-size to something like 1 or 0 px and your height will actually take effect

729393
queue	fifo
begininvoke on a winform control to make a call across threads will use the windows s message queue which is fifo

729405
keyboard	mouse
i want to map a keyboard key press onto left mouse-button double-click and am looking for very simple tools or control panel extensions to do that and map key presses onto single mouse clicks too.

729426
groovy	java
groovy is a jvm based language source-compatible with java

729437
exception-handling	try-catch
one reason which is important to me is that when i read a try-catch control structure in a software i maintain or debugging i try to find out why the original coder used an exception-handling instead of an if-else structure

729454
checkbox	button
you can look at the eula dialog for sample the next button there is disabled until the user press the checkbox of agreeing to the eula

729491
lgpl	gpl
you embed the gpl into an lgpl application or module that is not just a wrapper++

729495
margins	padding
if anyone else has this problem then i recommend setting a wildcard css element at the beginning of your style to blank out all posible padding and margins issues

729498
private-members	private
well i might be talking rubish but i think you could try to define a twin class with same members as the class you want to modify but different public private modifiers and then use reintepret_cast to cast the original class to yours in which you can access the private-members

729500
licensing	gpl
licensing the work resulting from your translation under the gpl would certainly be the best way to handle that

729518
type-safety	generics
generics provides compile-time static type-safety for collections and eliminates the need for most typecasts type conversion

729518
primitive	int
autoboxing unboxing automatic conversions between primitive-types such as int and primitive wrapper classes such as int

729518
for-loop	arrays
enhanced for each loop the for-loop syntax is extended with special syntax for iterating over each member of either an arrays or any iterable such as the standard collection classes specified by jsr 201.

729518
revision	updates
the current revision is updates 12 which was released in february 2009

729518
versioning	upgrade
upgrade of jaxb to versioning 2.0 including integration of a stax parsing

729518

729518
look-and-feel	nimbus
a new swing look-and-feel called nimbus and based on synth. 23

729527
derived-class	base-class
is it possible to assign a base-class object to a derived-class reference with an explicit typecast in c#

729528
web-inspector	webkit
this may be similar to what you have in visual-studio eclipse but the latest builds of webkit and safari 4 have a nice way to view a javascript object in the console panels of the web-inspector

729531
derived-class	base-class
but you can assign an instance of a derived-class to a variables of base-class type

729535
derived-class	base-class
expanding on ybo s answer - it isn t possible because the instance you have of the base-class isn t actually an instance of the derived-class

729535
derived-class	base-class
it only knows about the members of the base-class and doesn t know anything about those of the derived-class

729535
derived-class	base-class
the reason that you can cast an instance of the derived-class to an instance of the base-class is because the derived-class actually already is an instance of the base-class since it has those members already

729547
derived-class	base-class
you can cast a variables that is typed as the base-class to the type of a derived-class

729567
latex	tex
latex and tex have been around for longer than most of us realise that there were programmes to do that sort of thing and that we were interested in them

729576
blacklist	whitelist
as with any string sanitization you re much better off working with a whitelist that dictates which characters are allowed rather than a blacklist of characters that aren t

729597
base-class	inherited
no that s not possible since assign it to a derived class reference would be like saying base-class is a fully capable substitute for derived class it can do everything the derived class can do which is not true since derived classes in general offer more functionality than their base-class at least that s the idea behind inherited

729597
constructor	object
you could write a constructor in the derived class taking a base class object as parameter copying the values

729603
contains	set
the basic idea is that for each element the set of subsets can be divided equally into those that contains that element and those that don t and those two sets are otherwise equal

729609
administration	account
i ve set the service to run with my own user account with administration privileges so i think that would rule out permissions problems but i can t think of anything else to try

729611
hash	md5
better use an unique hash md5 mt_rand

729611
youtube	flickr
without a correlation to the id and store that in the database afaik youtube and flickr do that

729614
methods	extend
rbf methods also allow you to extrapolate at least as far out as the support of the radial basis elements will extend

729618
cassini	iis
on iis not all calls will be processed by the asp.net handler unlike cassini the development server unless the call ends in .aspx .ashx etc

729624
user-interface	splash-screen
i ve used this technique for a splash-screen because the main user-interface thread got really tied up doing other things

729636
contains	any
wat the function must do is it should list out all the .zip files inside that parent folder.the parent folder can contains any number of subfolders and the same applies to the subfolders too

729645
contains	set
is there anything about the contains elements of the divs that will set them apart from each other

729645
contains	elements
if there is you can prefix your css declaration with the contains elements and specify a unique style for both divs

729652
contains	any
a udf contains code that becomes part of the running server so when you write a udf you are bound by any and all constraints that otherwise apply to writing server code

729660
lightbox	thickbox
lightbox thickbox would do the trick

729677
dictionary	map
aside i had originally assumed that the dictionary stored a map from each case to the an index into another map for the return values

729693
pascal	basic
it has very powerful script engine with more languages pascal basic java c

729703
line-endings	newline
most sensible code will know how to parsing text including encodings line-by-line any choice of line-endings with-or-without a newline on the last line

729703
eof	eol
indeed - if you end with a new line is there in theory an empty final line between the eol and the eof

729707
eof	eol
basically there are many programs which will not process files correctly if they don t get the final eol eof

729735
text-editor	editor
this was very visible with a proper text file with a well-behaved text-editor like vim compared to opening it in one of the above editor

729737
specifications	w3c
customizing the scrollbar is not a w3c specifications ie only css but details on what is possible can be found here

729754
versioning	migrate
this way you could easily migrate to more professional dbms versioning

729792
qnetworkaccessmanager	qtcpsocket
subclassing qnetworkaccessmanager and integrate the subclassinging qtcpsocket somehow this might involve subclassinging even more classes the qhttp ones

729804
value	field
if a field is a value type a bit-by-bit copy of the field is performed

729808
attributes	properties
setting the desktopcompatible attributes will prevent the designer from querying the properties directly but if you have any code in the control that may call it so if any code that will run in the designer might execute ce-specific code then you must also add code to prevent that

729825
perl	php
one way to automate the process would be to write a script perl php .net etc. to parse the html you re pulling in and replace any existing id s or classes with a modified version

729865
internet-explorer	google-chrome
i have developed the code and it works fine in firefox 3 and google-chrome however it just doesn t work for internet-explorer 7 8

729882
jquery	dojo
normally i d recommend jquery for this kind of thing but you re already using dojo so you should probably use that

how can i updates my combo box s selecteditem property without causing the selectedindexchanged event to fire

729905
multiplication	addition
the user will give some input value for a and b and will choose what operation to perform letâ s say that he can choose to compute addition or multiplication

729905
multiplication	addition
the methods that compute multiplication or addition will be implements somewhere no idea where

729919
temporary	copy
i think you ll either have to use multiple queries or copy your ingredients list into a temporary table and do the database query in that way

729921
setinterval	settimeout
is there any difference between using settimeout and setinterval

729942
for-loop	loops
though in performance critical parts of your application you should benchmark these functions versus the trivial for-loop because often loops are still faster

729943
setinterval	settimeout
they essentially try to do the same thing but the setinterval approach will be more accurate than the settimeout approach since settimeout waits 1000ms runs the function and then sets another timeout

729943
multithreading	wait
altough one might think that setinterval will execute exactly every 1000ms it is important to note that setinterval will also delay since javascript isn t a multithreading language which means that - if there are other parts of the script running - the interval will have to wait for that to finish

729951
setinterval	settimeout
apparently the difference is settimeout calls the methods once setinterval calls it repeatdly

729951
setinterval	settimeout
here is a good article explaining the difference tutorial javascript timers with settimeout and setinterval

729979
document	element
then get the document into which the new node is inserted and the parent element to be from it

729980
solaris	linux
i m using 3rd party audio and graphics libraries so my choices are limited to windows xp vista linux and solaris

730016
32-bit	16-bit
please excuse my lack of knowledge here but could someone let me know how i can get the first 16-bit of a 32-bit hex number

730021
silverlight	wpf
if you look at a programming framework like .net you ll easily be able to switch between web asp.net and silverlight mobile .net mobile and desktop .net and wpf as the languages are all based on the same core framework

730028
hide	show
when i click on the visible row for a table i want the rest of its rows contents to show hide

730060
sftp	ssh
twisted conch supports ssh and sftp

730079
subclassing	base-class
briefly an envelope and a letter are both subclassing of an abstract base-class interfcae that defines the public interface for all subclassing

730085
variables	boolean
i have always used a boolean flag variables to protect against unwanted event handlers

730088
any	set
do i need to set any properties or something

730129
directory	folder
what you can do is in the sharpbits.base folder that you download from codeplex there is a dll you can reference in the bin directory

730145
internet-explorer	firefox
is there a way to get set the location of the scrollbar in internet-explorer firefox

730173
unsigned	integer

it contains the info necessary to handle nested elements and collections

730182
joomla	drupal
i don t work with drupal but i do work with joomla a lot

730182
gzip	zip
i deploy by archiving all the files in the web root tar and gzip in my case but you could use zip and then uploading and expanding that archive on the production server

730187
bison	yacc
since you said in a comment that you aren t using flex and bison which versioning of lex and yacc are you using

730188
spring	jsf
we are in the process of re-evaluating our usage of jsf brought in before i came onto the project vs the possible usage of other web frameworks such as spring asp.net-mvc

730188
spring	jsf
from my view point it appears that the development time to building out pages takes a very long time using jsf never developed with compared to using spring asp.net-mvc which i am familiar with

730207
any	set
is there any way to set a foreign key in django to a field of another model

730211
configuration	environment
looking at the content of your example targeting different staging environment rather than reading configuration files dynamically you might want to look at web deployment projects as indicated in the answer to an earlier question

730217
getter	setter
create a builder class which contains all of those getter and setter with a build methods that returns an object of the class that you re really trying to construct

730222
revision	svn
the problem with svn is that revision tag and branches are all implemented the same

730227
constructor	object
you can decide when enough is enough and use introduce parameter object for your constructor or any other method for that matter

730236
getter	setter
this will let you use getter setter without worrying that the characterization is incomplete

730245
constructor	object
if you really are constrained to construct the object in one go you can usually collect related parameters in simple value objects and pass those into the constructor

730248
any	set
it can be set up in code or the pair can be read from a file using any of several classes for this purpose in spring

730258
sql-server	oracle
the stored procedures can run from oracle db2 or ms sql-server databases

730259
64bit	x86
and if i had vista 64bit it d probably be under program files x86

730266
arguments	default
one possibility is that you ve accidently changed the default member alignment either through a command-line arguments to the compiler or via a #pragma in the source so that two different translation units think the structure has a different size because of differing amounts of padding most x86 compilers default to alignment on 4-byte boundaries but allow you to request alignment on 1-byte boundaries as needed

730297
attributes	properties
your best bet would to be write an extension methods on the htmlhelper that would use reflection to get the attributes from the properties

730310
continuous-integration	teamcity
after the kona continuous-integration and better unit-testing screencast the first 1 3 about teamcity i ll check teamcity too

730352
show	next
cryptanalysis of the winapi guid generator show that since the sequences of v4 guids is pseudo-random given the initial state one can predict up to next 250 000 guids returned by the function uuidcreate

730358
xlsx	xls
spreadsheetgear for .net will create xls or xlsx workbooks and include full formula support

730367
setinterval	settimeout
both setinterval and settimeout return a timer id that you can use to cancel the execution that is before the timeouts are triggers

730374
numeric	zero
comparing testval against user-input allows all numeric value to get through including zero only non-numerics will triggers the else statement

730375
xlsx	xls
spreadsheetgear for .net can generate xls and xlsx workbooks and include a comprehensive api for customizing formatting the data

730385
exception-handling	try-catch
the reason is that a given try-catch handler should not take the decision to run nested finally blocks for exception-handling that it is not expecting to see

730385
exception-handling	try-catch
as soon as an exception-handling is caught for the first time any finally blocks on the stack beneath the try-catch will be executed by which time it s too late - another exception-handling may be generated and this means that the original exception-handling is lost

730396
environment	building
i want to building a voip test environment for a student project

730396
freeswitch	asterisk
my first idea is to use asterisk opensips or freeswitch for the server and sip communicator minisip or linphone as softphone clients

730406
listbox	textbox
thank you for reading so far as you would have understood by now is that the code filtering a listbox based on the input in the textbox which works like a charm btw

730406
selected	listbox
when the windows loads the listbox has all the items in it and i select the first item then i type something in the textbox and the listbox filtering to only show the relevant items after selecting another item i remove all the text from the textbox which brings it back to the original state but this time the selection has changed to only the item that i selected in the filtering view so instead of two items being shown as selected only one shows as selected

730407
selected	textbox
you shoudl selected the textbox and then set the new class

730422
chmod	sudo
if you have administrative privileges try sudo chmod in terminal

730435
google-chrome	firefox
the fact that i cannot find other mentions of this behaviour causes me some worry that i am doing something wrong - but my sites all work in firefox google-chrome safari across windows and mac and previously worked well enough in ie7

730438
reliability	scalability
this help the scalability and reliability of the system

730440
sharing	share
imo it will lead to an unnecessarily large amount of code sharing plus every single different class we share is an extra set of versioning requirements that need to be watched

730453
continuous-integration	build-process
i am currently in the process of setting up ndepend report generation as part of continuous-integration build-process using cruisecontrol.net i have followed the instructions outlined in thoughtworks website

730456
autoscroll	panels
just set the autoscroll property of your panels to true and it will handle adding the scrollbar for you

730457
enterprise	platform
message queuing solutions like mq series or msmq are used extensively for integration distributed enterprise applications especially running on different platform

730461
click	mouse
note just found that yui has a way to simulate mouse moves and mouse click

730481
ip-address	hostname
sjphone can establish a peer-to-peer connection just by using an ip-address or a hostname

730490
build-process	ant
since we are using ant for our build-process the server connection information is dynamically specified in our build properties file and the server.name server.port and context.root placeholders are used in the services-config.xml file instead the actual values

730505
icollection	ienumerable
the class currently implements ienumerable idisposable icollection and iserializable

730519
json	xml
if they are serialized in an platform independent format json xml the ojects can even be exchanged between different programming languages

730520
silverlight	wpf
it s for silverlight but applies to wpf as well

730520
contains	elements
another way to do this would be to bind your dockpanel width above to the actual width of the elements contains the expander

730521
contains	any
forces any updates to this channel s file to be written to the storage device that contains it

730531
linked-list	tree
browsing the tree is not expensive grosso modo like following a linked-list you won t benefit from the cache as much with a vector but generally it s what you do when you iterate that is expensive not the iteration itself

730534
32-bit	64bit
i have a file that has a 32-bit version and a 64bit version

730541
triggers	insert
for example i will use a default value on insert and a triggers on update to set the last updated time fields on insert update

730554
pdf-viewer	acrobat
i need a way to jump to a given page in a pdf that is on the users computer that works across versions of acrobat or using an alternative pdf-viewer like foxit reader

730558
sql-server	mysql
i developed ssis project on my local machine extracting data from mysql db to sql-server 2008

730558
sql-server	mysql
the problem is that package default to sql-server driver instead of mysql drive

730568
contains	elements
ws-i bp2122 a wsdl types elements contains a data type definition that is not an xml schema definition

730574
sql-server	oracle
i am not very familiar with oracle so am avoiding sql-server specific approaches other than the table variable for sample purposes but a way to solve the problem as stated would be to create a subquery that unions the four columns and maps column names another subquery that retrieves the max for the 4 values and an outer query that returns the joined result

730579
innodb	myisam
i am fairly inexperienced with the innodb engine and never experienced this issue with myisam

730591
web-hosting	hosting
essentially to allow scriptinging to load up their own private keys would compromise the security of the windows key store so all sensible web-hosting providers turn it off lest a rogue scripting steals overwrite the hosting provider s own private keys

730599
internet-explorer	gecko
all desktop agents use a specific rendering engine that is already built into web browsers thunderbird uses gecko earlier versions of outlook use internet-explorer mail.app uses webkit etc which makes them virtually indistinguishable from the browser itself

730604
selected	listbox
probably in your textchanged event handler you should store the listbox s selected items like so

730615
selected	textbox
if the user selected the dropdown with text first the data in the textbox has to be a number

730621
rollback	commit
i understand the need to commit before and after a ddl but conceptually i d have thought the same consistency requirement could be achieved with a rollback before the ddl and a commit after

730637
margins	padding
i ve changed the padding on the box to a margins moved the border to your box and added an underline to the header

730644
create-table	alter-table
a truncate table or an alter-table or a create-table do always cause a commit

730675
instances	destroy
you could write a class that always returns the same integer as a hash-code for all instances but you would essentially destroy the usefulness of a hashtable as it would just become one giant bucket

730678
directory	folder
for bulky folder like the files directory use a symlink in the proper location to point to a server-side directory outside of the webroot

730685
fitnesse	dbfit
there is a great tool built on top of fitnesse called dbfit which seems to take all the pain out of unit-testing the dblayer

730688
hashtable	set
the maximum size of this arrays is typically smaller than the number of items in the set of possible values for the type of data being stored in the hashtable

730703
webforms	asp.net
the point of asp.net mvc is that it is a more simple and a better fit for webapps then the whole stateful event-driven model of webforms and something that pretty much everyone outside of the microsoft space moved to years ago

730726
click	mouse
i have a wpf label contains in a flowlayoutpanel and i want to determine the positioning of the label when click with the mouse

730759
visual-foxpro	vbscript
i ve got a vbscript that calls a visual-foxpro instance and runs a vfp program

730761
dependency-injection	singleton
the problem you are having is because dependency-injection relies on inversion of control and singleton typically construct themselves

730765
environment	building
java tm se runtime environment building 1.6.0_13-b03

730770
triggers	insert
an insert triggers will make our work a bit more complicated

730806
exception-handling	try-catch
when you just want to do a try-catch without handling the exception-handling how do you do it in python

730813
spaces	output
usually the output of such a hash algorithm is inside a range of some large number typically much larger than the spaces you have in your table

730813
division	modulo
of course modulo calculation isn t done like that it s done with division and a remainder

730813
put	get
in the library sense when you get to the shelf and the slot number you wish to put a book in there s already a book there

730822
selected	checkbox
open the .testrunconfig file and under the deployment menu item selected the enable deployment checkbox

730827
rollback	commit
i ve already traced through the code and made doubly sure i commit or rollback all transactions

730832
cassini	iis
note the code runs differently depending upon whether you are running it under iis or cassini -- under iis the initial identity is the anonymous user

730851
updating	updates
updates sorry for not updating this my mac port project was postponed

730852
polymorphism	override
covariant return-type overriding similar to polymorphism lets you override methods with a more specific return-type

730857
gethashcode	equals
when testing for value equality is desired such as when using objects in collections you should implement the iequatable interface override equals and gethashcode for your class

730857
gethashcode	equals
if you implement iequatable you should also override the base-class implementations of equals object and gethashcode so that their behavior is consistent with that of the iequatable.equals methods

730864
32-bit	64bit
if the format is .xls use microsoft jet oledb 4.0 should work without problems as long as it s run on a 32-bit system - there are some hick-ups with 64bit systems - which i suspect that you ve already messed around with a bit

730865
controller	routes
the form helpers are the recommended way because it allows you to provide a controller action and other route data and the url is auto-generated based on your routes in global.asax

730884
oracle	mysql
this works fine in ms sql and mysql but i keep getting the above error from oracle

730911
xml-serialization	xml
personally i d drop xml-serialization go with xaml and forget about trying to get my xml looks

730912
contains	elements
the transaction contains two elements id and type

730913
malloc	free
note i have also tested with new delete replacing malloc free without success either

730915
zend-optimizer	php-ini
i am looking at the zend server pe and ce and am woundering if its just a frontend for php-ini and automatically has zend-optimizer which basically is apc right

730915
lighttpd	apache
just get apache php and apc or use lighttpd with xcache

730922
average	max
measure the fact that on average a developer can write circa 200 max 300 lines of code per day

730934
user-controls	treeview
2 if i do end up using treeview creating a new node type currently it is a .ascx user-controls could be tricky to deal with as i would need to open a new windows and return node id and name to the parent page which contains treeview upon node type creation and seemlessly update it

730938
malloc	free
if you write programs on c++ - use new delete instead malloc free

730950
firefox	opera
this works wonderfully in safari firefox and opera

730950
contains	set
setting the height of the 3rd td to 100 will cause these scrollbar to always appear since the height of that row will actually be set equal to the height of the entire table it will be 100 of its contains element

730950
quirks-mode	doctype
removing the doctype declaration and reverting to quirks-mode seems to make the issue go away in ie but i need to use html 4.01 transitional as that is what all of the other existing pages in this application expect

730959
orientation-changes	portrait
i then implements the same methods in the viewcontroller i am loading and it is responsible for detecting when the orientation-changes back to portrait and dismissing itself from the view stack

730967
default-value	default
when assigning a default default-value to a field here false to a bool fxcop says

730967
value	field
should i always ever never initialize object field to default value

730971
malloc	free
there is no memory leak there but you should use new delete instead of malloc free

730975
value	field
every time you pull a field out of jsdata you would need to pattern match checking whether the value was of type or the two sub-types of

730983
attributes	properties
it appears that you must use the height properties of the table and not do it via a style attributes

731003
google-chrome	safari
it s so very much not like a web widget set that i actually ported it to the desktop - - using webkit the same engine in adobe air google-chrome safari etc.

731006
value	field
exclude a warning from this rule if the constructor calls another constructor in the same or base class that initializes the field to a non-default value

731010
firebird	mysql
i spend most of my time using firebird so the mysql syntax may be a little different but the idea should be clear

731011
contains	elements
i m not familiar with queries so i am unsure whether it can happen in this case. if a row does contains multiple results then when you try to access it it will throw classcastexception at runtime because that elements will be an object object instead of a string object

731018
highlight	selected
when you selected a day the selecteded day is highlight which i like

731018
highlight	selected
however if you selected the current day the highlight because it is the current day supersedes it being selecteded.

731018
highlight	selected
i would much prefer it being selected to supersede the current day highlight which i feel would make it very clear that you have selected the current day

731020
declarative	imperative
what i want to do is to create a declarative and imperative binding so i can write

731024
spring	grails
grails incorporates spring webflow and hibernate only you don t have to modify xml

731033
expectations	assertions
and assertions aren t really assertions they are expectations

731049
hide	show
while i realize that i could just show the form off-screen and hide it along with many other forms of winforms hackish wizardry i d rather stick with the zen path and get this done right

731061
contains	any
another more simple approach is to save your icon as a 57px x 57px png called icon.png without any shine effects then ftp it to the root folder of a webserver and create a file there called icon_test.html contains the following code

731062
select	union
the second case b may actually be better which is why you sometimes see a select with an or turned into one select for each leg of the or union d together

731069
exception-handling	try-catch
one of the ways i ve tested exception-handling is by using a try-catch block within the class itself and embedding assert statements within it

731097
uninstaller	msiexec
the solution i used was to bundle the install with a scripting that would run msiexec once to install uninstaller the old package then again to run the new install

731100
filtering	grouping
you may well want to grouping assemblies which implement similar functionality - colour contrast together while keeping them separate from very different kinds of filtering edge enhancing

731117
ssl-certificate	ssl
i m trying to write a php script using curl that can authentication a user through a page that uses an ssl-certificate in addition to username and password and i can t seem to get past the ssl cert stage

731122
scp	ssh
if you use ssh keys properly you do not need to use expect as the scp command won t ask for any user input

731125
command-line	tasklist
if the file is a .dll then you can use the tasklist command-line app to see whose got it open

731146
logout	login
returnurl 2fmydomainname 2flogout.aspx so that the user can t log back in again since a successful login returns to the logout page

731149
callback	methods
it can callback but at least the accept methods will be clean

731178
any	set
do you want any set of possible quoted strings and non-quoted strings like this .

731192
contains	any
there can be at most one mnemonic using any character on a page contains many forms

731193
python	ruby
learn either python and django or ruby and rails

731199
jquery-plugins	jquery
i really recommend learning jquery as it would save you loads of time and it is easily extensible by jquery-plugins

731205
cakephp	symfony
if you want to stay in the php world check out some of the common frameworks such as cakephp codeigniter or symfony

731205
python	php
for example try picking up postgresql to have as an alternative to mysql and python django as an alternative to php

731209
revision	svn
one way to handle this very flexibly is to have a build directory under revision control not try and svn your actual home-directory which has its own issues

731219
append	input
however i need to append to the beginning of the string that the tab-completion produces as it replaces the whole input string remember it s treated as one word

731233
rabbitmq	activemq
we d be interested to hear any experiences with the pros and cons of activemq vs rabbitmq vs zeromq

731251
macports	fink
launch is in fink and macports too

731263
httpwebrequest	webclient
i m looking to understand when to use a wcf services instead of just using webclient or httpwebrequest

731267
base-class	inherited
in my opinion you have the right solution - create a base-class that contains the canadian federal fax rate from which all of your derived classes can inherited

731270
decrement	increment
so you ll need to add a counter of tickets to flights and increment decrement that when creating deleting tickets

731279
reflection	runtime
we should not have to manually search for cryptically-named definitions op_explicit of appropriate conversion operators with reflection at runtime on the types involved

731285
reflection	runtime
you can deploy them individually and load them at runtime using reflection plugins

731285
installation	building
or you might have an additional helper program maybe for installation that only building for release

731286
virtualization	parallels
i can t really treat them as parallels systems either because no matter how good the virtualization software is it can t abstract away two servers trying to peg the cpu at the same time

731289
httpwebrequest	webclient
i m currently using wcf for most of the things that i would use webclient or httpwebrequest httpwebresponse in the past

731295
any	set
the set of instructions created as a result of compiling your code can be interleaved in any order

731297
integer	short
don t have enough points to comment yet but whatever solution you choose keep in mind that fileversion fields can only support a short integer

731297
revision	svn
in our situation our svn revision was already above this and resulted in an invalid revision number in our fileversion

731301
inherited	subclass
inherited and implement the abstract methods calculate in each subclass here you ll see that both methodss are the same but let s continue

731302
any	set
after finding a comma the lookahead asserts that if there are any quotation marks ahead there s an even number of them meaning the comma is not inside a set of quotes

731311
driver	kernel
this can be done but you are talking about a kernel driver to do it

731319
revision	svn
in svn the technical difference between using a tag and tracking a revision is nil

731324
basic	vba
first thought does your workbook already contain a reference within vba to the microsoft visual basic for applications extensibility library

731338
any	set
all you have to do is create a .skin file within your app_themes folder and in here you can place the default for any controls that you want to set one for such as your textbox but if you want to have more than one then you need to set a skinid

731347
constructor	object
a good rule of thumb for constructor is to pass an object its identity not its state

731347
constructor	object
i ve chosen to pass the shootonsight variables into the constructor because here it was important that at all times the object knew whether to shoot burglars

731360
controller	routes
home index should be calling the index action of the home controller assuming you re using default routes

731373
shell	tcsh
i d avoid tcsh or any other version of the c shell there be monsters

731397
binaries	install
not a direct answer to your question but i ve successfully been using the mercurial pre-packaged binaries from here with the standard python 2.5.1 install on osx 10.5 without issue

731406
zend-framework	cakephp
there s the zend-framework or cakephp among others for php

731406
jquery	dojo
or pick up a toolkit like jquery or dojo for javascript

731409
revision	svn
if you ask them to look at revision x they have to first look at revision x to see that it was changing say svn proj1 trunk makefile and hence deduce that svn proj1 trunk x is what they should be looking at

731422
design-time	designer
this is called visual inherited and the windows forms designer has some nice design-time support for this

731428
inline-assembly	assembly
i m trying to port some assembly code written in visual-studio into gnu inline-assembly on linux

731429
return-value	undefined
the vfork function has the same effect as fork except that the behaviour is undefined if the process created by vfork either modifies any data other than a variables of type pid_t used to store the return-value from vfork or returns from the function in which vfork was called or calls any other function before successfully calling _exit or one of the exec family of functions

731433
any	set
this will keep all your sets to be only valid during the current session and will not leave variables left around named like filename1 or any other variables you set during the run that could interfere with the next run of the batch file

731451
cassini	iis
are you using visual-studio and cassini locally and iis remotely

731484
databound	gridview
this doesn t work since the gridview is databound and is going to fetch the actual data at a later time while rendering the page

731488
base-class	inherited
the thing i don t like about the inherited model is that i need to have a common interface base-class

731502
attributes	properties
when i add a displaycolumn attributes to one of my linq to sql entity classes and reference a properties from my custom code in the partial class i lose the ability to sort by that column in the generated gridview

731545
.net	wcf
are you talking about when to create a wcf service yourself over web service or when to consume an existing web service using wcf instead of .net 2.0 asmx clients

731546
firefox	safari
it is coming out as desired in firefox and ie but oddly enough safari is acting up

731546
firefox	safari
now it looks fine on safari on my macbook but not on safari on my pc or in firefox for that matter

731557
deployment-descriptor	web.xml
deployment-descriptor the web.xml

731587
getter	setter
this assumes that your bean has getter and setter for a city property which you have already implements

731589
gethashcode	equals
i ve overridden equals and gethashcode in an abstract base-class to implement value equality based on an object s key property

731603
stream	send
i have an android application that plays music from a site however to authentication to the stream you need to send a cookie first i.e

731611
google-chrome	safari
i haven t got safari so i cannot test although i m using google-chrome but the problem is probably coming from the

731611
quirks-mode	doctype
if you do not declare a specific doctype correctly a visitors browser must guess usually by applying the loosest possible doctype or a quirks-mode doctype of its own resulting in slower rendering

731613
gethashcode	equals
so there is no need to override equals and gethashcode because this is the same identity you want to implement

731614
constructor	object
this same arrays or one very much like it of function pointers is used in a c++ link to hold pointers to constructor of global object

731615
any	set
obviously the equals methods will return true for any object of the same type that also has not set the id

731625
setinterval	settimeout
for example if we represent a call to settimeout setinterval with

731625
setinterval	settimeout
in terms of browser compatibility settimeout predates setinterval but all browsers you will meet today support both

731634
linux	unix
if you don t care about portability these solutions should work on pretty much any unix box linux fuser 1 offers some additional options and there is also flock 1

731652
turbogears	django
this is easy to do in python -- use django or turbogears or any python-based web framework

731657
input-field	checkbox
this field is a multi-choice column checkbox input which i prefer over the current input-field for targeted audiences

731657
hide	show
note that i know audiences can also be used to hide show web parts but that is not something i am interested in

731669
contains	any
is there any way to create a jbossall-client.jar that contains all of these classes instead of having to put the 70 or so individual jars on the classpath

731673
external	embed
to make it work you must both embed some object type information in data where it is only useful for deserializing and usually use external schema definition which otherwise would not be needed like xml schema for xml

731683
children	nodes
do it recursively on a control type using the children control from the treeview root and check to see if the control type is the type of the nodes you are looking for cast change backcolor and you are done

731693
rabbitmq	activemq
testing of activemq rabbitmq etc

731695
hash	md5
with server 2000 domains there s an option for store passwords in reversible format - that will allow a domain controller to calculate md5 hash of the password to compare against your presented md5 hash

731695
hash	md5
ldap signon should selected md5 digest as the authentication type supply the username and then supply the md5 hash of the password

731701
json	xml
when using proper parser for input and generators serializers for output you do not have to worry about well-formedness resulting xml or json being syntactically correct

731705
any	set
is there any way to set this up

731736
command-line	cmd
if you want to run hudson build step on the cygwin cmd-line you need to figure out what cmd hudson runs and in which directory

731766
asp.net-mvc	webforms
things that take little time in webforms can take a lot of time with asp.net-mvc

731835
executable-jar	jar
the only place where the class-path attribute in the manifest is used is when the jar containing the manifest is called as an executable-jar using java -jar thefile.jar

731844
mouseover	mouseout
the code basically sets alternating table rows to have a different css class and adds a mouseover and mouseout event change to a third css class highlighting the row under the mouse

731851
any	set
i could use some schema versioning technique like dbdeploy but i really like the simplicity of running a set of files through psql without incurring any unwanted side effects

731857
unsigned-integer	int
interpreted as unsigned-int it is +4 but we have to interpret it as signed int -4

731862
subtract	add
add one to the magnitude of all even numbers subtract one from the magnitude of all odd numbers

731864
integer	numeric
for instance numbers should be stored using integer or floating-point types not strings because you can do math with numeric types but not with strings although it s easy enough to parsing a number into a string that this is not a big deal

731871
mouseover	mouseout
2 attaches a mouseover and mouseout event to the row so the row changes background color when the user mouses over it

731879
mouseover	mouseout
mouseout row - the reverse of mouseover restores the old class name and background colour

731894
instances	self
here you actually have a reference to self which you can use because a distinct instances of an object has been allocated

731921
order	join
one word of advice that i would mention is that access requires you to use parentheses when joining more than table in a query i believe this is because it requires you to specify an order in which to join them

731937
stream	send
in this case to send an xml stream

731956
json	xml
of course it could be done by json or xml

731956
contains	elements
my question is that how would you do it when you know that the returned data is very variables in some cases it might contains even html elements quotes double quotes etc

731956
json	xml
if i am not mistaken in some special cases this could screw up json and xml as well

731956
json	xml
is there anybody who would suggest a nicer way for this or who could show a safe way to do it in json or xml etc

731962
pdf-generation	printing
we use it in a number of areas including pdf-generation for web reporting user report design and automatic printing

731974
sqldatasource	gridview
if i bind gridview to sqldatasource and also set autogenerateeditbutton to true and if i then try to update a field this field being a primary key in database then database should return an error and thus sqlexception should be thrown

731974
value	field
instead all gridview does is setting all field in that row back to their original value

731974
identity-column	sql-server
when i executed same update statement with the following code i got cannot update identity-column employeeid exception so iâ m assuming sql-server did report same error when gridview tried to update but for some reason exception wasn t raised

731981
nhibernate	ado.net
i am working in a microsoft .net shop where it is okay to use nhibernate or ado.net ef

731989
json	xml
serialize the entities to xml and json

731989
boolean	int
that means i want proper int boolean and nulls and i don t want extra object wrappers or something that tries to capture the entire xml infoset

731989
json	xml
deserialize xml and json and merge the data into existing entities

731989
json	xml
most libraries deserialize into java objects but at that time the distinction between an undefined property and a null empty property as it exists in javascript json xml as described above php ... is lost

731993
multiprocess	stackless
people told me to use the multiprocess package i checked it out and it looks good but i also heard that processes unlike threads can t share a lot of information and i think my program will need to share a lot of information. additionally i also heard about stackless python is it a separate option

731996
command-line	cmd
i ended up implementing this by using this code to call reg.exe and parsing the output from hklm software classes.pdf to see if its the acroexch class then getting the cmd-line from hklm software classes acroexch.document shell open cmd

732001
png	gif
this microsoft article has some information about gif files that should be relevant to png also

732004
detect	move
then every time you detect movement move the client s cursor back to the center of that clipped box

732006
checkbox	button
if i select the platform pocket pc 2003 and go to form view i get a long list of device controls button checkbox combobox etc.

732026
udp	tcp
if you do decided on using processed sharing information between sub processes can be accomplished in several ways tcp udp connections shared memory or pipes

732046
any	set
selected enable project specific settings and set any of the ten element checks to ignore.

732051
implements	final
that said i would suggest carefully examining any case where you consider declaring a non-final static variables aside from a singleton instances and see if it can be refactored or implements differently -- moved into a singleton containers or use a final reference to a mutable object

732061
amazon-ec2	vps
amazon-ec2 is a vps service requires system administration knowledge and is more expensive

732069
subtract	add
i have to add subtract multiply divide 2 objects from the polynom class

732081
expression	brackets
you could either use a regular expression to match the values inside the brackets

732081
expression	brackets
or you use this regular expression to split the brackets list using look-around assertions

732101
derived-class	base-class
in addition i don t have to worry about two classes trying to define duplicates property keys because a derived-class already can t have a duplicates property name to one in its base-class unless there is an explicit abstract override relationship

732116
put	get
a server is another architecture where multiple client processes get and or put information into a central server

732124
spaces	output
it is a very common error to read code with include or require functions or another file-access function and have spaces or empty lines that are output before header is called

732126
hide	show
you best bet is probably to create a custom control by inheriting from the gridview class adding the required columns and exposing a meaningful property to show hide a particular column

732136
.net	wcf
wcf is the .net framework solution for serializing data it looks like this link figured out how to consume the data in c++ that s kind of the opposite direction of what you want but there might be an easy analog for reversal

732154
margins	padding
vertical align is only supposed to apply to inline-block elements i think images are the only things that have this layout property by default so to use it to positioning an inline element first turn it into an inline block then you can use margins and padding to positioning it similar to how you woudl a normal block element

732158
value	field
i can change the value or delete the entire field clientside using firefox and firebug and asp.net will not throw an error like it should

732158
value	field
the hidden-field is added to the page but asp.net does not validate the field or value on postback

732174
base-class	inherited
it is a base-class that your control can inherited from.

732182
dictionary	arrays
arrays and also maps and dictionary and arguably even objects are essentially functions in the mathematical sense

732182
dictionary	arrays
and indeed there are languages which treat arrays as functions of integers maps and dictionary as functions of their keys and objects as functions of their slots

732183
contains	any
any class that contains it should have a single responsibility let the program start from the command-line

732216
profiling	debugging
it sounds like you are looking more-so for debugging or profiling tools such as gdb and its various front-ends xgdb ddd and and gprof

732216
memcheck	valgrind
memory bounds checking tools like electric fence glib s memcheck valgrind and mudflap might help if this is a memory or pointers issues

732222
transfer-encoding	chunked
transfer-encoding chunked on response

732227
entity-framework	nhibernate
just do a comparative search for entity-framework and nhibernate and you ll see what i mean

732240
data-members	private
you ought to have two classes a monomial class that abstracts a single term with a coefficient and exponent and a polynomial that has a list of monomials as private data-members

732240
subtract	add
the monomial will only allow you to add or subtract terms whose exponents are equal

732240
arrays	map
arrays list map - your user doesn t care as long as you uphold the contract

732252
worksheet	excel
note this code does not play nice if you are using excel s protect worksheet

732252
worksheet	excel
see this question for dealing with excel s worksheet book protection

732266
transfer-encoding	chunked
twisted supports chunked transfer-encoding api link see also the api .doc for httpchannel

732268
default	reset
from this dialog you can reset your ide settings choosing to reset all environment settings to one of the default collections of settings

732270
ia-32	x86
this is due to the libc the standard c library which by default on a x86 ia-32 linux system is 32-bit functions provided by glibc gnu s c library

732272
arrays	map
processor then code-generates some routines that populate the map arrays

732278
syntax-error	syntax
my current syntax to do that isn t working though my error is parsing error syntax-error unexpected t_string

732282
hosts-file	hosts
if that works then its because a windows updates messed up your hosts

732282
hosts-file	hosts
if this is the case make sure you hosts has this line in it uncommented 127.0.0.1 localhost

732282
hosts-file	hosts
my hosts is in this directory c windows system32 drivers etc

732292
children	nodes
linq-toxml handles this fine there is an xelement.elements nodes operation to get immediate children and a xelement.descendents descendentnodes operations to get all descendents

732292
children	nodes
for this the linq-to-xml navigation functions are not children and childrennodes but rather elements and nodes

732311
callback	methods
my understanding was that when you make an asynchronous i o call that no thread is used while waiting but that an iocp is set with a reference to your callback methods

732316
get-childitem	copy-item
i think the best way is to use get-childitem and pipe in the copy-item command

732321
any	set
i m trying to compile from the command-line and i m not using any compiler flags so i m not sure if i need to set a flag in order for the compiler to optimize out the const - or if i stumbled onto some kind of special case

732333
malloc	free
as it is now callers rely on knowledge that dvector is implemented using malloc and that free is the appropriate release call

732341
export	csv
you can t search in it but you can export the list to a csv file and search there

732345
javascript	dom
javascript lives in a sandbox which means it is totally unaware of anything beyond the scope of the dom except when the browser chooses to grace it with a bit of information

732355
webforms	asp.net
i am however using asp.net webforms

732393
attributes	properties
i have different events that i somehow probably delegate need stored in a properties of an attributes i just add an attributes to a properties linking to the corresponding event

732393
attributes	properties
these properties are already raising a general event which i am catching determining the related properties and thus getting the related attributes and delegate event

732395
droppable	draggable
you can make certain elements of your page draggable others droppable then handle the events when the user drags an element around

732431
ip-address	hostname
you just need the same credentials you use to log into a command-line on the ec2 instance - the hostname or ip-address plus the username usually root and the ssh keypair that you used when you created the instance

732431
cyberduck	winscp
then you ll be able to connect with any client that supports sftp cyberduck on mac winscp on windows

732451
3-tier	n-tier
i don t agree with you that entity objects make the code harder to maintain actually the whole purpose of this architecture is to make it to easier to maintain and modify your code and this is what i see in practice i wrote spaghetti code for a long time didn t use 3-tier or n-tier architectures so i know what i m talking about

732475
embedded-browser	gecko
you can also write your client using c++ with an embedded-browser like gecko or webkit within it

732476
ruby-on-rails	django
i m thinking either django or ruby-on-rails

732476
python	ruby
i kind of like the python language better and it seems to be more full-featured than ruby for statistical scientific and networking let me know if you think this is wrong

732476
ruby-on-rails	django
anybody have experience with both ruby-on-rails and django

732476
webforms	asp.net
it is imho a much better and more intuitive way to write web apps compared with asp.net webforms

732497
required	checked
e.g when you need to do any kind of validation that doesn t actually required a user-input control such as checked if a cookie exists or if the control you want to validate has to follow input rules that are too involved for the other validators

732527
windows-xp	windows
if i remember correctly inkobj.dll is available on windows-xp sp2 and all later windows client oses regardless of whether the machine is a tablet pc

732528
enterprise	platform
seems to have the best of both worlds - a scripted easy to use open source rad asp.net-mvc framework on an enterprise platform

732528
groovy	java
it uses the groovy scripting language ruby -like but runs on the jvm so you can use full java framework if you like

732528
ruby-on-rails	django
not a lot of tuning or maintenance unlike ruby-on-rails and django

732528
postgresql	mysql
for a db mysql is the sexy pick but postgresql is superior

732528
innodb	myisam
with mysql some features you want are in innodb and some are in myisam

732528
postgresql	mysql
postgresql performance has greatly imnproved with the version 8 release same as mysql now and has a nice windows installer finally

732540
joystick	keyboard
if you want to go for polling the joystick just because you are not able to capture the keyboard event i think you need to re-work your strategy

732554
keyboard	mouse
use something like ahk auto hotkey it is a simple language that can be compiled to an exe and is designed for automating the keyboard and mouse

732556
spring	jsf
we can also use spring web flow with jsf which introduces view scope and flow scope if we have long workflows in application to reduce the no of views configured in session

732559
joystick	keyboard
use something like ahk auto hotkey it is a simple language that can be compiled to an exe and is designed for automating the keyboard and mouse i m not 100 sure how well it works with a joystick but i m sure it s possible they managed to write some stuff for the wii remotes

732574
web.py	web2py
pylons and turbogears offer enormous flexibility and focus on best of breed components web2py appears to have a very cool dal orm that i m itching to dig into and web.py and werkzeug amongst others are minimalistic and don t try to dictate how you should build your app

732578
contains	any
the packets can contains any byte from 0 to 255

732579
keyword	synonym
you can create synonym for classes such as int32 or string but not int or void because those are keyword

732585
jquery	.post
from my view i m trying to .post using jquery as such

732591
execute	prepare
now when you execute you will insert the number into the spaces reserved for your prepare statement

732602
g++	gcc
gcc v4.3 vs g++ v4.3 reduced to simplest case used nothing but simple flags

732604
ruby-on-rails	django
though the development is easy and fun i ve heard some stories about deployment and configuration headaches with both ruby-on-rails and django mostly ruby-on-rails

732608
g++	gcc
the g++ compiler must be doing something different from the gcc compiler

732609
instrumentation	profiling
instead i want to track allocations so i can start tracking down the issue and on a mac i d use instrumentation which gives a detailed profiling of what objects have been allocated and by whom but on windows what would i use

732617
malloc	free
i want to make my own malloc free so i can make a precise copying allocator

732620
double	int
off hand i thought that double could represent all int within their bounds exactly

732624
ruby-on-rails	django
i understand the desire to look at ruby-on-rails or django for need 1 but for need 2 i d expect you would be more productive more quickly with mvc

732629
document-ready	.when
in firefox document-ready gets executed .when i open a new windows and it does not gets executed .when i open a new tab

732630
distinct-values	contains
basically create a second table from the 3-column table that contains all the distinct-values for each successive level of the hierarchy as well as a column to indicate the depth of that row in the hierarchy

732632
g++	gcc
when compiled with gcc and g++ the only difference i see is within the first 4 lines

732640
execute	prepare
the speedup comes when you prepare a statement once and then execute it many times

732642
32-bit	64bit
however my application has to call and access a driver which may be 32-bit or 64bit depending on the system where it is installed

732642
32-bit	64bit
use the 32-bit or 64bit version of the structures for the deviceiocontrol calls

732663
32-bit	64bit
you maintain both 32-bit and 64bit version of structures and implement special handling via iois32bitprocess irp function in device driver device_control handler and convert it to 64bit structure whenever needed

732663
32-bit	64bit
since you later mentioned you don t have control over driver source code i suggest you to maintain your own variant for 32-bit on 64bit and send the right one checking the os architecture

732665
object-oriented-database	relational-database
given linq and technologies like i4o is there any real reason why an object-oriented-database management system won t be a viable alternative to a relational-database management system for new projects starting in the next 3 to 5 years

732667
linked-list	dictionary
then you just add the items to the linked-list and use the dictionary to get the next item

732674
configuration	environment
this is strange because debugging was working fine until now and no configuration changes have been made in my environment for a while

732677
primitive	int
the idea behind this is that i have xml to parsing and the desired values are often primitive bool int string etc. and this is the perfect place to use generics.

732698
required	checked
obviously some checked would be required to ensure a deserializer has been registered in the dictionary

732701
methods	extend
if i want to extend a class like avaudioplayer whats the best way to also add another methods to avaudioplayerdelegate

732708
rar	zip
zip rar have overhead to store things like filenames

732710
.net	wcf
there s a wcf web services windows forms project in c# .net 3.5 a web site in php with generous javascript and maintenance on a legacy windows application written in vb 6

732712
ruby-on-rails	django
if you re building this for yourself then i would try both ruby-on-rails and django or one of the other frameworks that c.batt mentioned to see what feels the most comfortable

732722
document	element
it exposes some of its child elements as if they were properties which can be accessed with the - operator but still preserves the full document internally and you can do things like access a child element whose name is a reserved word with the operator as if it was an associative arrays

732730
value	field
even if you used a hidden-field control on the server page you still wouldn t be able to validate the field value because the control doesn t generate postback events there is no way for the user to interact with it and therefore no events for the server to validate

732730
value	field
the simplest solution is to use viewstate to store the value of the field then on postback verify that the posted value of the field equals the value stored in viewstate

732749
png	gif
bitmap gif png and tiff are some of the common image types supported

732769
python	java
i do spend a crazy amount of time in java and c++ crafting custom data structures that are just free in python ruby

732774
margins	padding
otherwise there s simply too many things that you d have to define - you d have to define every single style padding border margins background .

732775
value	field
note that if you re grouping on one column and returning others you have to provide some sort of way to cram all those value in the other field into one

any	set
charles petzold has a walkthrough of this in chapter 11 of applications code + markup but the basic idea is that you create a frameworkelementfactory for the templates root element and further factories for any child elements create a controltemplates and set the visualtree property of the controltemplates to the frameworkelementfactory

732801
document-ready	ready
i cannot use document-ready because i need to disable the the before the document is ready

732803
32-bit	16-bit
a sample can be represented as an integer number usually 8 12 16 24 or 32-bit or a floating point number 16-bit float or 32 bit double

732812
internet-explorer	firefox
i have internet-explorer and firefox and i am setting firefox as my default browser

732815
sqlcompare	redgate
i have ran redgate sqlcompare and there is no schema difference indexes and so forth difference

732816
contains	elements
this munged version allows you to do things like echo xml- surname or xml- names 1 as if it really had these as properties but is separate to the true xml contains within in the munged representation elements are not necessarily in order and elements whose names are php reserved words like variables aren t presented as properties but can be accessed with code like xml variables - as if the object is an associative arrays

732843
logfile	tail
typically perl file-io is buffering so if you re expecting to see the full last line of the logfile via tail -f or something you may be disappointed until the program exits

732846
passthru	exec
passthru is similar to the exec function in that it executes a command

732863
hide	show
if you need to go the extra mile do as the other suggested and hide disable the link also in the tag and use jquery to show enable it

732870
inherited	subclass
and then you have a subclass b which extends a b cannot implement because b already implements inherited from a and a class cannot implement an interface twice

732888
mouse-listeners	mouselistener
i ve tried using mouselistener but i can t figure out how to detect events on the actual frame of the jframe

732898
disposable	dispose
some types encapsulates disposable resources in a manner where it is easy to use and dispose of them in a single action

732918
selected	listbox
when the user selected something from the listbox you want to know and modify other things on the form

732927
default-value	arguments
however i believe you will not be allowed to use this the default-value of an optional arguments because it can t be calculated at compile time and put into the defaultvalueattribute

732929
jquery	dojo
if you also use a 3rd party javascript library jquery prototype dojo you should be fine or as fine as anyone of us can be

732935
gethashcode	equals
if you override equals you must override gethashcode as well

732942
value	field
for best results the hash code must be based on the value of an instance field or property instead of a static field or property

732943
ajax4jsf	jsf
my real interest is to know what are your alternative strategy for using pure ajax and jsf 1.1 without adopting middle layer like ajax4jsf and others all good choices but too much plugins than specs

732949
background-color	display
aside from the background-color and one having the display inline there is no difference correct

732957
similarity	distance
then i can take euclidean distance between each of the points in this spaces to get the similarity of any two articles

732957
similarity	distance
then compute the euclidean distance between any two clusters which gives the similarity of the topics

732968
show	next
that s why on next application instance show the old data

733006
postback	ajax
i typically prefer the last one over the second one but i never use ajax anyway and the first it only needed when you want to add in script after a postback to the server is done

733017
firefox	safari
some of the most end-user visible innovation has come from a new browser war examples would be html5 several vendors canvas apple xmlhttprequest microsoft s outlook web access team input range safari s built-in rss reader and the video element firefox --these came from the proprietary level on up not from the standards tower on down

733022
perl	ruby
there are one or two choices perl python ruby bash sh csh groovy ecmascript heavens for forbid windows scripting files

733027
csv	xml
or you could even load all of the attendance records at once as a csv or xml document

733028
contains	set
it would be nice if there was a menu item called profiling that you could set up to contains different profiling with different settings and change them on the fly

733031
python	ruby
in general i would say that a scripting language like python or ruby together with a aws library is the best solution

733034
macros	vba
alternatively you can write vba macros which set and read a global variable

733036
abstract-class	pure-virtual
the base abstract-class animal provides a pure-virtual breathe methods because an animal must breathe to survive

733036
base-class	inherited
the simple rule for public inherited is that you should only do it if the derived class object truly is a base-class object

733053
click	mouse
then i click mouse at any place on the listview and

733063
attributes	properties
setter properties injection in unity without attributes

733064
constructor	object
and you can write a macros that will itself allocate an object and pass the name-yelding macros inside the constructor

733078
perl	ruby
in addition to ruby perl etc. you may want to consider yaml

733100
value	field
how do i exclude one value from a grouping sum based on a value of another field

733100
value	field
ie i open report report properties code and insert my custom code but how would i change the below code to exclude a numeric value of another field for the below case

733102
keydown	keyup
this is easy enough by handling the keyup or keydown event however how does one determine if it is toggle on or off even if a key hasn t been pressed

733128
buffering	streaming
depending on your environment using setvbuf to increase the size of the internal buffering used by file streaming may or may not improve performance

733147
.net	wcf
could i know ways to improve performance of my .net wcf service

733155
c++	lua
as of now it s really on the responsibility of the lua c++ wrapper system to do that

733156
reference-type	generics
i ve restricted it to reference-type for convenience but it s still generics so you can reuse it more easily.

733170
g++	gcc
i also do not want to install cygwin for g++ gcc

733180
selected	listbox
so far i ve found 2 ways to delete selected items from a listbox winform

733185
ruby-on-rails	django
since you re a seasoned .net programmer you really should look at asp.net and mvc before turning to ruby-on-rails and django at least if your goal is to get up-and-running quickly

733185
ruby-on-rails	django
so pick up django ruby-on-rails lift or whatever you feel like doing -- it will help expand your mind and give you different ways to look at solving problems

733188
hash	md5
if you use an md5 hash of the image data as the file name for example you can prevent people from uploading duplicate images and you also don t have to think of a way to generate unique names for the images

733190
heuristics	greedy
it contains every single problem including but not limited to ai greedy algorithms heuristics search algorithms theory formal-languages automata systemd architecture etc

733217
data-access	nhibernate
i commonly use the repository pattern to diversify data-access methodologies and use plain objects poco and interfaces that are persisted via technologies such as nhibernate

733217
.when	ready
.when you are ready to move cross-machine physical boundaries you simply create your boundaries in the service implementation

733220
javascript-events	domcontentloaded
the blue and red lines mark when the javascript-events domcontentloaded and load are fired

733225
updating	updates
we perform frequent updates on that table and will be updating only 5 columns of 50

733226
rewrite	rule
edit unfortunately the rewrite module doesn t know which name maps to which id unless you make a separate rule for each id which doesn t scale at all

733228
submission	contact
you should use the name display under team contact info tab of the program portal where you are submission your certificate signing request to

733237
integrated-security	connection-string
i then connect to sql-server with integrated-security sspi in the connection-string

733241
postorder	inorder
what you need is a basic tree traversal function preorder inorder or postorder -- this doesn t matter and a filtering function

733250
directory-structure	subdirectories
basically the subdirectories under i18n lang is mirroring the classic sphinx directory-structure

733277
gridview	listview
how to create a gridview like view to the wpf listview if i dont know the column names at the design time because the collection will be created at runtime and the collection will be of type datatable and it may contain a no.of columns.i can do it with wpf datagrid but i want to achieve this with wpf listview and i want to achieve this without code behind

733278
default-value	arguments
i haven t tested this but you could try adding a second parameter to the report without a default - call it pdateoverride for the sake of arguments and then change the default-value for pdate to be an expression using the new value if it s present otherwise now

733288
decrement	increment
or should they simply have a votes field that is decrement increment based off what the user does with no persisting of that

733291
arguments	default
oftentimes you see the suggestion use use keyword arguments with default value instead

733306
scheme	lisp
it depends on what you mean by scripting language. it isn t commonly viewed that way but many scheme implementations seem to fit the bill as well as python and lisp is sort of the archetypal functional language

733310
implements	extends
your application must then implements a class that extends the midlet class

733317
checkbox	button
as it is stated there glui is a glut-based c++ user-interface library which provides controls such as button checkbox radio button and spinners to opengl applications

733318
triggers	insert
because check constraints are table-level and are only checked when the table on which they are defined are update d or insert ed you would need to put appropriate check constraints on all the referencing table the same would apply to sql-server triggers

733318
required	checked
however i m wondering if you have subclassing each entity represented by an id can be typed in which case you should be able to use foreign key s and row-level checked constraints or validation rules if you are more comfortable with the ms-access interface than sql dll that is required for checked constraints

733319
value	field
this i think is written in another table but because it is expensive to recalculate all votes every time someone views a question they keep calculated value in a field changing it whenever someone votes

733333
keyboard	mouse
next your usb keyboard and mouse will stop working

733346
arrays	loops
you have an arrays of objects maps so the outer loops iterates over those

733366
python	php
it has great support for xml html php python and other dynamic languages and syntax highlighting for tons of other languages

733369
ruby-on-rails	django
i like django better because it s less magic with ruby-on-rails i feel they pushed the convention over configuration principle too far so i prefer the more explicit nature of django

733372
order	add
i need to implement google checkout using asp.net c# i was able to get items in my shopping-cart populated in google checkout but was unable to proceed with shipping charges and vat and what to do after that track order and redirecting to my site so i could add customer s order

733382
constructor	object
to construct an object a constructor needs the exact type of the object it is to create ... furthermore ... you cannot have a pointer to a constructor

733403
constructor	object
i don t really know what this would mean but i guess it would have something to do with being able to override the constructor implementation based on the dynamic type of the object being created

733403
virtual-functions	base-class
this would then allow the base-class constructor to maybe call other virtual-functions at construction time with a not fully constructed dynamic class type

733419
safari	opera
check the site quickly in safari and opera to make sure design has no flaws there

733436
python	c++
unlike object oriented languages such as smalltalk or python where the constructor is a virtual method of the object representing the class which means you don t need the gof abstract factory pattern as you can pass the object representing the class around instead of making your own c++ is a class based language and does not have objects representing any of the language s constructs

733441
ruby-on-rails	django
my personal preference is django but i know for a fact ruby-on-rails is good too

733454
integer	zero
i need to add leading zero to integer to make a string with defined quantity of digits cnt

733454
python	php
what the best way to translate this simple function from php to python

733474
double	int
a c++ version probably bending the rules somewhat but works for all numeric types floats int double and even class types that overload the unary minus

733476
row	col
you can use cell row k9 and get back row number 9 and there s an equivalent col parameter but it returns the column number 11 rather than the letter

733514
python	c++
now unless you re trying to write c++ code using python syntax what would you need overloading for

733516
linux	unix
i wrote a article about dumping the stack in c c++ with windows and unix linux at ddj some years ago

733527
python	perl
some things like perl python etc are installed on the base system with mac

733548
arguments	default
as unwind noted keyword arguments with default value can go a long way

733549
pointers	stack
in your copyto function you would be returning a pointers to an object that was created on stack - this is an impossibility because the object the pointers points at will be destroyed when the function returns

733549
pointers	stack
in your case i might allocate the object to be returned dynamically using new rather than on stack then you could safely return a pointers

733602
linux	bsd
i think there are some linux and also some bsd distributions that keep all the sources of all the packages in a single sourcetree especially in the embedded or special purpose space

733616
http	ssl
ssl http will encrypt this request for you to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks

733620
javascript	dom
if you really really wanted a guerilla option if you have control over the documents and you don t have x-domain worries you could do some javascript dom manipulation to read from iframe loaded documents and copy the important nodes into the parent document deleting the iframe as you go but it s nothing like as clean or reliable

733624
masstransit	nservicebus
take a look at all free and open source nservicebus masstransit or rhino service bus if you can live without wcf

733634
ruby-on-rails	django
also i am not sure what people s experience with django is on stackoverflow but all of my ruby-on-rails questions get answered very quickly

733634
ruby-on-rails	django
here is an article written by a guy who went from .net c# to ruby-on-rails to django python and then back to ruby-on-rails

733648
pointers	stack
you can pass an stack allocated element to a function but returning a pointers reference to an stack allocated element is again a segmentation fault the object will be destroyed when the function ends and the receiver will be left with a dangling pointers reference

733661
contains	elements
i have a form that contains one date elements and 3 time elementss

733671
web-applications	security
plain sql in web-applications should only be used if absolutely neccessary alone for security reason but also to avoid problems like yours

733702
private-key	rsa
if you reverse the keys for rsa it can be used to generate a digital signature - by encrypting something with your private-key anyone can decrypt it with the public key and if they are sure the public key belongs to you then they have confidence that you were the one who encrypted the original

733715
subtract	time
when it finishes subtract the start time from the curren time to determine the elapsed time then print it out or log it or whatever

733720
hashmap	arrays
in the extreme case matrix with a billion rows and columns with only 10 cells used a hashmap can be more efficient than any arrays implementation

733720
hashmap	arrays
for other problems it can be more efficient to mix the approaches depending on the problem for example a hashmap of arrays of mini-matrices when cells clump in a gigantic empty space

733740
python	php
at first i recommend not to use php but a better language python for example

733750
webforms	asp.net
yes you can have master pages for your views in asp.net mvc framework as well it works pretty much the same as in webforms

733754
function-call	inline
in the cases where the function-call is unambiguous and the function a suitable candidate for inlining the compiler is smart enough to inline the code anyway

733757
lan	wan
your questions helped me to get around the problem when i change from lan to wan

733758
32-bit	64bit
another thing to check is to make sure you are downloading the 32-bit version of mysql unless you are on a 64bit mac

733769
value	field
only selected part assuming that pdate max pindate and pln acthec field need to be latest value and some act rows can be missing

733777
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql is often sufficient

733787
ninject	moq
ninject moq and asp.net-mvc help with testability and getting the app out the door

733787
implements	abstract
or should entity be an abstract base-class with an abstract id field and should it also implements needed interfaces in an abstract way for others to override

733788
globalization	localization
easy localization and globalization with the .net

733788
entity-framework	nhibernate
microsoft entity-framework nhibernate spring.net

733794
solaris	unix
my case in particular is with solaris servers but generic unix bsd tools are more than welcome

733802
apache-mina	mina
mina is a very well designed asynchronous nonblocking networking framework

733804
host	dns
host key changed due to dns spoofing

733816
any	set
i am using visual studio2008 for my development and i want to create a silent set up package i don t want any user-interface to come up during installation

733822
contains	elements
we have agreed that he can extend the xml that he fires at my webservice to include 3 new elements that will contains the html and i will adjust my schema accordingly

733828
linqdatasource	gridview
i have a gridview with linqdatasource

733828
value	field
im using the following technique to populate a field supplier in this case with dropdownlist contains value from a different linqdatasource

733850
configuration	upgrade
the good one does what i ve listed above creating an upgrade project with the default build configuration base debugging and release

733850
configuration	upgrade
is there a master build configuration that might now have a time date that makes d2009 think i want that instead on a default upgrade

733856
authentication	login
i m using form based authentication jboss jaas but my form is sending the data to my servlet so i can perform some checks before trying to login

733862
decompression	on-the-fly
stick the byte arrays you received into a memorystream and compress decompression it on-the-fly without using temporary files

733864
arrays	map
they also speak about the data structure to allow for more variation such as having a base image and randomly add a number of small fringe images when you define the representaion in your map arrays

733886
principles	srp
following srp and kiss principles i designed an object with properties only but i need methods to work with the objects

733887
markup	xhtml
by the way atom-editor and rss publishers use cdata sections for inserting xhtml html markup

733889
contains	any
if the original string doesn t contains any byte 126 then it s already ascii

733901
python	perl
it could be bash perl python sh or something else

733901
shell	bash
in reality the kernel will often use the user s default shell to interprete the file which is very dangerous because it might not be the right interpreter at all or it might be able to parse some of it but with subtle behavioural differences such as is the case between sh and bash

733921
boolean	int
at once into c arrays especially for the int and boolean

733925
malloc	free
to reset the state of the heap you have to call free for every malloc call

733936
detailsview	gridview
you may want to look at gridview detailsview repeaters etc

733948
debugging	trace
when i debug into it using the minidump - i m not actually debugging the real app all the debugging symbols are loaded correctly i can see the full stack trace of all of the native threads correctly

733968
button	popup
button on the .net components tab in the dialog that popup might take a few seconds for it to show

733972
postgresql	mysql
if you want a fast free alternative to ms sql then postgresql may be a good choice - it is fast reliable and has a more open licence if you use mysql for a commercial project you ll want to read its dual licence very carefully

733972
postgresql	mysql
the only downside to postgresql is that it shares some of the same dba guru requirements as oracle where as ms sql can often be managed by a regular it person and mysql doesn t need much management besides restoring the old backups everytime it decides to become corrupted and lose your data

733975
32-bit	64bit
i can build the application using the 64bit version of msbuild found in framework64 or i can build it using the 32-bit verison found in framework

733995
64bit	x86
the application did work on the 64bit platform we just needed to specify x86 for the cpu which sort of defeats the purpose

734018
directory	folder
this can happen if you use import existing projects into workspace that are folder in the filesystems without the copy into workspace checkbox checked or if you create a project using an existing directory

734025
value	field
inside the templates the travels field as actually an instance of boundfield which is a django object that binds together the field and its value for rendering

734033
boost	tbb
but at some point the cost for us to backport newer features developed in newer vcs will exceed the cost of them upgrading at their end especially as more boost and intel tbb creeps into the codebase s head

734060
contains	elements
this has the disadvantage that the message contains a lot of overhead the namespace is defined in each elements

734062
unit-testing	assertions
on the other hand i m really fond of assertions but they don t replace unit-testing

734071
keyboard	hid
this should show you the list of things you can get out in of a keyboard through hid

734074
constructor	object
nhibernate will always use the default constructor to instantiate an object of the type unless you want to create some kind of dto and retrieve it via hql and then it will use the properties or backing fields if specified to populate the object

734088
passenger	thin
at the minimum you should consider using the rack middleware to make life easier for you - connect your app to rack and use rack to host the site through passenger thin mongrel etc

734091
any	set
the same principle exists for base class constructor or for any set of functions where the derived implementation also calls the base classes implementation

734095
32-bit	64bit
since a 32-bit executable cannot pick 64bit dlls and vice-versa

734095
32-bit	64bit
you just have one directory with everything 32-bit executable + dlls and another one with everything 64bit

734147
uiapplication	uiwindow
am i right with my understanding that an uiapplication object uiwindow object uiview object or any uiview subclass is an responder object

734174
order	add
the one thing i can guarantee is that the order will be such that entries that should come first will be added first -- i ll never add one with identifier bbbb then go back and add bbba later

734188
installation	environment
dependent if it is just a out of the box sharepoint installation or a more customized mission critical environment i should at least think about doing some load tests and see how the installation scales..

734202
json	xml
writing xml or json based on bean properties is pretty simple

734202
json	xml
for reading one approach might be to use existing libs for json or xml to create objects then deal with merging the properties between objects

734202
json	xml
otherwise reading json or xml is a little trickier but not too bad

734207
ubuntu	debian
it is only available on some linux-based platforms like debian and ubuntu

734207
macports	fink
mac os x has two similar utilities fink and macports

734208
credentials	security
youâ re essentially giving the user the connection credentials to your database and daring them to find a hole in your database security

734227
low-level	hardware
i am planning to write a code library to access some hardware at a low-level flipping register bits and such

734242
administration	account
the code is running inside a windows service and is running under the administration account

734243
versioning	upgrade
general rule seems to be that a new versioning is an upgrade and is thus worthwhile

734243
versioning	upgrade
upgrading compiler versioning could well be a project in its own right make sure you have stable code and good tests before you do an upgrade and when you finish prove that it is still working the same

734252
instance-variables	accessor
generally the convention is that instance-variables and accessor use the bare noun and parameters use the indefinite article plus either a role or a type or a combinations

734256
directory	folder
i have several branches in my svn sometimes it is very small branch and it is nice to have it in the same directory but sometimes these branches grow big and it is nice to move the whole thing to another folder

734256
git-clone	git-svn
but when i do a git-clone from this local repository to another place on my disk git-svn lost all its information and i don t known how to connect it back

734261
default-value	default
as a side note doing that will make your default route redundant as you provide a default-value for the slug parameter

734262
function-calls	main
the swf is successfully loaded in all browsers main ones but in firefox does not appear to receive the variables or function-calls that javascript passes

734266
datepart	getdate
print right datepart year getdate 2 --string with leading zero

734266
datepart	getdate
print convert int right datepart year getdate 2 --int

734266
datepart	getdate
print datepart year getdate 100

734281
git-clone	git-svn
unfortunately not as git-clone does not clone the git-svn information when performing a clone

734314
contains	elements
in this case the form will be rendered at the end of the matches list because of the updatetargetid refers to the div elements which contains the matches list

734314
contains	elements
to avoid this the updatetargetid must be changed to refer the div elements contains the form

734315
python	c++
the examples you gave should have absolutely no performance difference in c++ and i doubt they would differ in python either

734315
iteration	set
the latter is faster in some architectures because the act of decrementing the variables will set the zero flag which can then be checked in a jump-if-not-zero instruction giving you the loop iteration and the conditional in one go

734338
double-quotes	single-quotes
you can use single-quotes instead of double-quotes which do not expand inline variables names

734400
attributes	properties
i ve got most of the way using a soapheader instead adding an appropriate attributes to each methods of the web service and also an appropriate field properties with an instance of the required header - but the soap serialization is currently giving me headaches in terms of specifying the right element names with namespaces

734405
unix	aix
once at a unix shop aix iirc developers would work via nfs mount and checkin checkout via rcs.

734413
python	ruby
suppose i wrote a compiler in python or ruby that translates a language into a c# ast

734413
python	ruby
how do i pretty-print this ast from python or ruby to get nicely indented c# code

734417
administration	account
i have set the anonymous access user on the iis virtual directory to be my own domain account which is a member of the administration grouping on the local machine

734441
sequences	unique
tfs use a numbering sequences unique for the tfs server

734443
logout	login
if i watch the audit login and logout events in sql profiling i can see that numerous requests to the app result in only 1 audit login event

734443
logout	login
however if i run that same code from outside iis a test app calling the same methods in the dll i see many login and logout events

734443
logout	login
also i learned that audit login and logout events don t necessarily change for connection pooling so i started using the login sec logouts sec and user connections performance counters sql-server generalstatistics to determine if connection pooling occurs

734443
logout	login
from inside iis i see many login sec and no logout sec

logout	login
outside of iis i see many login and logout per second and user connections fluctuates it holds steady in iis

734462
scala	ocaml
i recommend learning ocaml f# or scala and familiarizing yourself with immutability with those languages

734464
selected	button
it s the button in a red box here screenshot of selected button in attach to process windows

734476
buffering	streaming
with fgets your data is copied into memory twice first by the c runtime library from a file to an internal buffering streaming i o is bufferinged then from that internal buffering to an arrays in your program

734552
llvm	gcc
try looking for a simple gcc front end and you will realize how clean llvm is

734553
.when	ready
this is obviously because those styles are applied .when the dom is ready only it s currently being called with the standard jquery function .

734553
callback	methods
the ajax request provides a way to execute a javascript methods on callback and i d like to be able to apply those same styles via jquery from that javascript function

734556
boolean	double
the following types built into the .net can all be serialization and are considered to be primitive-types byte sbyte int16 int32 int64 uint16 uint32 uint64 single double boolean char decimal object and string

734557
sql-server	oracle
where x level changes involve anything from a complete rewrite redesign to just changing the database structures to changing databases from oracle to sql-server - in other words anything that isn t a drop in change that requires a port or conversion process

734577
configuration	installation
i have never seen a configuration setting in the installation that allows you to indicate a system account for the service

734583
contains	lookup
i would need to ensure that my database contains a table that tells me that the former is to be routed as a category and the latter as a questions - this could be achieved by a simple database lookup and would need to be implemented within global.asax

734620
silverlight	wpf
but wpf silverlight binding will not automatically do this work for you

734626
button	popup
has anyone any ideas how i can add a javascript confirmation popup windows when clicking this button

734627
perl	php
php does it on its own perl and python you can import modules to use

734629
deployment	install
install system provides for db and file migration with install and uninstall hooks so it s a pretty reasonable system for deployment

734638
declarative	imperative
declarative verbose and i find a imperative style much more succinct

734641
difference	zero
if both of the types are statically typed to system.string there is zero difference between the code

734646
sql-server	mysql
i have etl task that will extract data from mysql database and load into sql-server

734646
sql-server	mysql
but if i move the whole project over and open the project with bids on the server i saw that in the connection manager for mysql i lost mysql driver setting it default to sql-server driver

734654
rewrite	rule
i d like to use mod_rewrite to redirect hits to the incorrect address to the correct address but my rewrite rule is not working

734668
grouping	sorting
i m thinking that sorting either way may have no effect - a pebble landing at random on a wheel containing different sized by fitness slices will have exactly the same outcome chance whether the larger slices are grouping together or not

734691
dependency-injection	inject
try getting spring to inject it assuming you re using spring as a dependency-injection framework

734703
parentheses	braces
note also that ruby is confused when you use an implicit hash parameter in conjunction with a block delimited by braces so you either need to use do..end as i have here or enclose the parameters to stack inside of parentheses

734711
webserver	upload
all you need to do it to upload the whole directory to your webserver access it from the browser and follow some simple steps

734741
linqdatasource	gridview
in an attempt to add additional search criteria i have tied in to the selected event of the gridview s linqdatasource and am trying to add additional items to the whereparameters collection of the linqdatasourceselecteventargs

734761
contains	elements
but changing the style s definition is feasible as is changing the class of the parent enclosing contains html elements

734772
updating	updates
to be more complete i should wait some time before updating control that i updates only 60 times per second

734779
attributes	properties
unfortunately there are also cases when the attributes produces strange side effects such as loading a linq entity from the database changing one properties without submitchanges then loading the same entity again

734790
.when	ready
if you use the property now you ll be ready .when you modify your code to use automatic properties

734792
value	field
it helps with consistency within your object because that way you know that the value of your private field have gone through whatever rigors you choose to put in your accessor or setter methods

734795
getter	setter
sometimes you will write getter setter that do important pre-processing for any realistic integration with the field

734795
getter	setter
i think the bottom line is that it depends on what kind of logic you are using at any given point in the class and what kind of preprocessing exists in the getter setter

734795
getter	setter
if you are ever unsure or it seems like it doesn t matter it is probably better to use the getter setter public property so that you write more maintainable code that will follow constraints added later

734801
any	set
i wouldn t set any default display for the class at all though

734804
versioning	packaging
when you have the word packaging that means you do not versioning one but two components set of files

734824
png	gif
i ve changed some of the graphics from png to gif but it is just as likely to say it s waiting for somegraphicsfile.png as it is for somegraphicsfile.gif

734824
any	set
i checked the iis settings and enable content expiration was not set on any of my folders

734824
versioning	upgrade
when we upgrade to the latest versioning of jquery user-interface 1.7.1 and replaced the destroy s with disable s for the datepicker the problem went away or mostly went away - if you do things too fast while the page is loading it is still possible to get the n items remaining status

734832
communication	messages
what would the so community reccommend for a basic event messages based framework for the communication process

734845
any	set
nothing outside of the dal should have any knowledge of anything db related if you want to have the client set what connection string to use then have them set the configuration nothing more

734854
pointers	stack
i want to allocate some memory on stack instead of the heap because i don t want to have to deal with releasing that memory manually i know about smart pointers and all those things

734867
order	add
then in order to get it to stay at alpha 1 i would add an event to the effect and check its alpha value and either set a delay or temporary pause the animation

734867
any	set
you can set repeatcount to 0 to play the effect indefinitely and a repeatdelay to get it to stay at final alpha values then maybe you won t have to add any additional event handler

734893
selected	button
so when i selected the forum and do br.submit it clicks on the attach button instead of create

734893
selected	button
extensive googling has yielded nothing useful for selected a specific button in a form

734903
localization	translation
as other s stated you will obviously have other localization issuse such as translation or date currency formats as well

734910
constructor	object
make a node object constructor that accepts rawstrings or a function

734920
python	java
regardless its a tremendous framework and i fully expect that mvc will continue to support it as it allows them to compete with ruby python java in the mvc space

734935
textblock	viewbox
if you put your textblock inside of the viewbox the textblock will resize itself to only use the spaces it needs and the viewbox will handle stretching this to the dimensions of the containers

734936
library-project	libs
have one include in the very root of the libs-project lets call it foobar.h which includes all of the headers in the libs such as src some_namespace someclass.h and so on

734939
debugging	trace
the website memory dump software trace debugging malware victimware and intelligence analysis portal has been very informative for me

734942
stderr	stdout
so if i don t manually clear the stdout and stderr buffering my code will hang

734947
put	get
start documenting the code reviews put in a wiki a company sanctioned wiki -- don t get into trouble now just document it for now -- it s not yet time to pass judgement you re just gathering data

734950
getter	setter
more generally using setter and getter insulates you from changes

734953
drawimage	draw
use the drawimage methods to draw the image onto the bitmap with a negative x and y coordinate

734967
boost	stl
stl boost and others who have a lot of header files to include they provide you with independent tools and you can use them independently

735004
persistence	hibernate
then to stop changes to a value once set is also easy using java.util.concurrent.atomic.atomicreference although hibernate or some other persistence layer usage may need to be modified

735013
csla	wcf
wcf and csla and all major interop systems always provide xml as one of their cornerstones of communication

735032
constructor	object
include an expirationdate property in the object that you will be caching probably a wrapper around your real object and set it to expire in an hour in its constructor

735085
enumerator	any
also you do not need to mark you enumerator as a datacontract as the datacontractserializationr will automatically serialization any enumerators that you use in your existing datacontracts

735112
order	join
it doesn t look like you can do the join between the local collection order and the linq2sql results with deferred execution

735114
authentication	login
you can find out the last time a user logged on and what dc authenticated from ad but the problem is that when you login the first dc to respond is the server which authentication with

735114
authentication	login
so that being said i guess you could get the last login from the lastlogontimestamp ad property from the user account and then query the eventlog from all of the dc s in the domain to find out which dc it was that authentication them and from what system

735134
shell	bash
i d prefer a bash solution but any unix shell is ok

735138
constructor	object
my problem here is that i would like to pass an object to a derived class but it must be done before the base class constructor since the base class will immediately call the derived class s start method that uses the object

735142
constructor	object
a constructor in a base class must be run before the constructor of any derived class otherwise there would be potential for corrupt object state

735149
properties-file	jar
i don t want to put the properties-file inside the jar as it should be editable by the user

735164
.when	ready
my concern is .when i m ready to actually use the db for my model i don t want to lose my test model

735173
credentials	integrated
for our particular situation because both the client and the web service are running on our company intranet a solution that may work for us is to handle the authentication on the client end using the integrated windows ntlm authentication and then then just have the client supply the credentials to the web service

735174
filtering	grouping
you can t filtering it sort by it or grouping by it

735182
anchor	nav
edit i should have added i want the nav item and it s subtitle in the same anchor tag because they are one link and i want a hover to work

735199
firefox	opera
actually the above code sometimes looks like it works in firefox never looks like it works in opera

735221
attributes	properties
if i create a public properties on my user control with a type of system.type i cannot use a normal string representation of the type system.int32 as a declarative markup attributes value for the properties

735232
instances	destroy
users of a library or framework then call helper functions to create manipulate and destroy instances of a forwarding declared struct or class

735232
instances	destroy
c programmers use pointers and helper functions to create manipulate and destroy instances of these objective-c classes

735233
credentials	account
the best option i know of in the bcl is to start the process under a user account with limited credentials using this process.start overload

735236
revision	svn
i could write a script that would svn diff each successive revision backwards from head and check if the line at a given line number was different

735238
aggregate	grouping
maybe some gurus can give caveats and advice on using grouping fields and aggregate obtained at runtime from a configuration for use in a reporting like structure

735256
properties-file	jar
you can put the properties-file in a directory or jar in your classpath and then use

735262
contains	elements
it generates an exception-handling if the list contains more than one elements

735292
google-chrome	firefox
everything seems to work fine in ie7 but in firefox and google-chrome i am getting the strange behavior

735295
windows-xp	windows
according to this post sleep isn t available on windows-xp and you have to download the windows 2003 resource kit in order to get it

735297
csv	xml
also lets you export result sets as csv xml and html

735299
any	set
if i set the debugger to break on any exception-handling i do get something interesting

735304
dialog	pop-up
if you happen to have ms visual-studio on your build machine it will catch application errors and pop-up a dialog box

735334
firefox	opera
works in ie 6 7 8 opera 9.6 firefox 2 3

735334
google-chrome	safari
does not work in safari for windows 3 4 or google-chrome

735337
python	c++
i have a python w c++ modules application that makes heavy use of an sqlite database and its path gets supplied by user on application start-up

735339
profiling	trace
i would set up a trace in sql-server profiling to see what set options settings your application is using for the connection and what settings are being used in ssms

735349
solaris	linux
linux and solaris seems ok

735363
teamcity	msbuild
i m familiar with msbuild but maybe teamcity has other ways to build things

735375
python	ruby
your question must be python or ruby

735377
webforms	asp.net
i am using asp.net 2.0 webforms not mvc c#

735383
click	mouse
what does it mean when a lefty mouse has its right button click

735385
arrays	loops
then do the loops for each day on the arrays returned by the database query

735396
boost	stl
using boost s bind and function are much better but it is impressive which can be done with just stl

735408
margins	padding
play around with padding and possibly margins until you get your desired result

735427
textbox	button
my rowdetailstemplate contains 3 items 2 rich textbox and a button

735427
textbox	button
what i would like to have happen is the button stay docked to the right edge of the windows and the two rich textbox expand to fill the rest of the space

735448
msbuild	nant
msbuild or nant will probably offer the best options for you

735453
keyboard	mouse
i believe this gets around the problem with the exclusive lock which you would encounter for example when trying to open a handle to a device that windows considers a system keyboard or mouse

735460
type-safety	generics
essentially when you use a generics it s a compile-time-trick to ensure type-safety but doesn t actually compile-in the class

735462
selected	textbox
when the user selected a date from the calendar it fills that date into the textbox

735462
selected	textbox
when a date is selected the eventhandler puts the date into the textbox

735462
textbox	onblur
i have tried setting the focus to the textbox at this point then putting an onblur attribute on the textbox but the textbox never seems to get focus

735463
hosts-file	hosts
i ve updatess my hosts after discovering an windows updates messed with it

735493
soil	glut
i m trying to make a simple textured rectangular in opengl using soil and glut

735519
linux	unix
lots of in jokes for the unix linux crowd to enjoy

735530
textbox	onblur
i tried to onblur the textbox inside my usercontrol when the value my mask but it won t change my textbox to 0.00

735532
selected	cell
i ve got a custom uitableviewcell implementation leveraging labels as subviews that is rendering the list of items correctly but when i scroll down and select an item say number 43 of 100 i see a rendering of a cell from earlier in the list from say number 3 on the first render page in the table appear on top of the cell i selected

735578
click	mouse
once you have done that you should be able to right click control-click if you don t have a right mouse button and choose inspect element to bring up the web inspector

735605
show	next
when the user pressed the next button the next record contents are show

735605
fadein	show
when this transition is taking place from one record to the next i want to show some kind of animation of the entire view like curlup fadein etc

735631
webserver	upload
i have a web application .net if it matters where when one of the pages is loaded a file on the users local machine needs to be copied upload to the webserver

735637
python	java
higher-level programming languages many popular implementations of java python etc

735647
solaris	unix
sorry didn t mention the code is cross-platform linux windows solaris and a few other unix flavors mostly using gcc for compilation

735664
fileoutputstream	filechannel
if you want to do that use a fileoutputstream get the filechannel and directly write the floatbuffer since it s a bytebuffer

735665
32-bit	64bit
edit for gcc-only code you can use __i386__ to check for 32-bit x86 chips and i suggest trying __x86_64__ or something similar to check for 64bit x86 chips

735665
64bit	x86
note it has come to my attention that the previous answer involving __ia86__ is actually a different chip not a 64bit x86 chip

735682
webserver	upload
in any case if you really wanted to do it and you have full control of the client kiosks you could install a windows service on them that can manage file upload downloads and be controlled via tcp ip from the webserver

735691
packets	ping
by default again on the os x versioning of ping it will ping until interrupted which isn t going to work for this so ping -c 1 will only try sending one packets which should be enough to determine if a machine is up

735695
32-bit	64bit
what i would probably end up doing is within a makefile determine if you are on a 32-bit platform or 64bit using uname

735696
put	get
what you could do instead is have the 2009 and 2010 in a table and beside them put the names of the ranges then do a vlookup to get the range name

735700
silverlight	wpf
java applets would seem to have their best analogies to wpf browser applications in .net if not silverlight 2.0

735700
silverlight	wpf
although wpf browser applications are of course restricted to the windows platform unlike silverlight they perhaps resemble applets more greatly in the respect that they can utlise the entire .net among other things

735700
webforms	asp.net
perhaps more accurately javaserver pages most resembles asp.net either webforms or mvc model-view-controller for that matter

735706
contains	any
i create a libraries folder in my project and source control that contains any third party assemblies

735706
build-process	build-server
my solution then references those assemblies and my build-process pulls that folder down to our build-server

735708
internationalization	localization
the development of multilingual software currently goes through two phases the first phase is internationalization and the second phase is localization

735708
culture	locale
localization l10n is the process of taking a product and making it linguistically and culturally appropriate to the target locale country region and language where it will be used and sold language culture specific

735720
show	next
i find it most usable if there is a generic error at the top of the form saying something like there were errors submitting your information please correct the fields in red then show the more specific error messages next to each form field that had an error

735721
binaries	install
when binaries or install are too big it can cause havoc for remote users

735721
binaries	install
the upside of storing binaries and install is that everything a developer needs to get up and running is in source control and the versions are correct

735728
any	set
the log is set such that i can recover the database from any point between one backup and the next

735729
any	set
what a z model of your domain would give is an implementation independent set of type constraints expressed more powerfully than the type system of any common implementation language

735733
environment	building
for test and production environment that also mean your own product the packaged result of what you are building should also go into your scm only the official release not the intermediate ones used internally

735733
any	set
that scm configuration not only stores any kind of set of files but also their relationships aka dependencies between those sets in order for you to query one set of file and to pull every other deliveries on which that set depends on to build or to deploy or to run

735746
domain-object	repository
for example say i have a service which talks to a repository in order to extract some domain-object in order to manipulate it in some way

735746
domain-object	repository
considering the domain-object which came back from the repository and which my service acts upon there is less value

735763
any	set
padding 0 to the top of your stylesheet and then adding in any extra padding and margin you need later - this will more or less set all browsers to the same starting point when it comes to layout

735768
stdio	gets
if you have to work around this then you need to wrap your current socket opening code so that if it gets an file-descriptor in the range 0..255 then it calls dup2 to create a file-descriptor in the range that stdio won t use - and then close the original file-descriptor

735769
selected	button
what i want to do is when the form submit button is clicked check if yes is selected

735773
delphi	c++
you would need skills in c c++ or delphi would do on windows

735784
combinations	permutation
it seems like you are talking about permutation of character combinations

735797
.net	wcf
with that said i m looking for an elegant solution to make these properties safe across asp.net wcf and any other multithreaded .net code

735802
ruby	php
i ve never developed anything with php but i think that you could mix both approaches orm and plain sql maybe after a thorough profiling of the app you can determine the real bottlenecks and only then replace that orm code for hand written sql usually in ruby you use activerecord then you profile the application with something as new relic and finally if you have a complicated ar query you replace that for some sql

735805
any	set
if you know that you will only ever have a set of strings well below 4 billion in size then perfect hashing would let you handle any value of l but restricting the set of values can be very hard in practice and you must know them all in advance or degrade to what amounts to a database of string - hash and add to it as new strings are encountered

735805
any	set
for this exercise the universal hash is optimal as we wish to reduce the probability of any collision for any input the probability of it having output x from a set of possibilities r is 1 r

735815
onsubmit	onclick
i ve seen reports of some odd bugs in ie7 where confirm didn t execute in an onclick or onsubmit event handler

735822
constructor	private
i have also verified that the private constructor in remotableobject gets hit twice while debugging

735847
contains	any
such cookies do not contains any info regarding when they expire

735848
double	int
even and especially if those objects are the primitive wrapper types byte character short int long float double and boolean

735851
payment	billing
all of this was done in views with a short 100 line or so stored procedure that essentially did what i ve outlined above used a view that order the billing of invoices by these rules applied payment in the view calculating what additional payment to invoice on what date to which insurer

735851
any	set
the stored procedure then just generated invoices for the current date which current date could be set again using a view to any date for testing purposes

735901
any	set
any application-scope settings are kept but any user-scope settings are reset to their default values whatever they were set to in the ide when program a was written

735901
contains	set
when program b calls foo.getstuff it doesn t return anything because my.settings.userfilename doesn t contains the user s file name - more accurately it containss whatever the default value for that setting was as set in the ide when you set up the setting in the first place

735904
rewrite	rule
here is my iis7 url rewrite module rule the action type here is actually a 301 redirect not a rewrite

735924
attributes	properties
my issue is that to use the backing model as the command properties editors are necessary for conversion of non-string attributes

735925
default	reset
for those that do set the isolation level for that transaction before you begin and reset it whatever your default is after it commits

735926
downgrade	upgrade
the problem you will run into is that if you ever need to have an app use a different version of the dll all the others will have to upgrade or downgrade

735940
python	java
if you can consider open source options java has a blocking queue link as does python link

735940
python	java
also search stackoverflow for python gui and subjective gui java if you wish

735947
document	editing
it is no surprise that these applications whose main purpose is the editing of document in the application s native format are doing not a perfect job there

735969
constructor	object
the object exists only after the constructor ends.in order for the constructor to be dispatched using the virtual table there has to be an existing object with a pointer to the virtual table but how can a pointer to the virtual table exist if the object still doesn t exist

735969
constructor	object
but there is nothing polymorphic with constructor constructor job in c++ is to simply put an object data on the memory

735974
show	next
this would lead to the updates data not being show until the next postback because the new bindings wouldn t be saved in viewstate

735977
webserver	host
everything works great until i host the site at my ssl enabled webserver

735978
python	java
static methods in python are similar to those found in java or c++

735991
ref	out
you should be able to get rid of pelement entirely and pass oelement as either a ref parameter if you care about what s in it on the way in or an out parameter

735994
hash	md5
but even in this case a common hash function as sha1 or md5 will be of little use because modifying a single pixel or metadata such as the author will change the hash and make it impossible to identify the two images based on a common hash function

735995
version-control	cvs
you have two version-control systems maven s which quite frankly isn t very good and your source code control s which assuming it s cvs or better supports real workflow

736005
viewwillappear	viewdidappear
you may need to resize the view before adding it to the windows and call viewwilldisappear viewdiddisappear viewwillappear and viewdidappear on currentview and the new view controllers before and after they re removed added

736046
sql-server	mysql
if you re looking for something like mysql s dump then good news sql-server 2008 management studio added that ability

736062
processor	affinity
the openmpi project has a library to set the processor affinity on linux in a portable way

736062
processor	cpu
on these intel xeon processor two cores on each cpu share their l2 caches i do not remember whether the processor has an l3 cache

736063
having	select
as i m using mysql i m under the restraint of only having one layer of sub select available to my knowledge

736073
constructor	object
however note that this either limits you to object with default constructor only

736075
unique-index	jointable
in that case you d use a jointable with a unique-index on the foreign key and a column indicating which type of measurement it was

736076
perl	php
there are actually some languages that compliment each other very well like php and perl or c# and java

736081
click	mouse
the mouse click event is on the grid so calls the same methods

736094
click	mouse
in your example if your mouse click on a screen rotated the object under it and you really did need to check to see if the object could be rotated before doing something like that you d do

736123
hash	md5
what i do is put the md5 hash the mysql query and store that as the key for the memcached data

736140
contains	any
any methods names contains an

736141
sequences	unique
create a new row in the installexecutesequences with your unique name for action not install for conditional and a sequences number before the use of targetdir 750 was the first use in the sample i made so i used a sequences of 555

736147
msbuild	nant
both nant and msbuild have a notion of xml peek and poke

firefox	opera
this is a bug in firefox and apparently safari 3.5 win and opera 9.5 win iframes reload if moved in the dom tree

736169
pthreads	longjmp
just had to tweak some files about floating point numbers turn off some pthreads someotherstandard flags that made it not use some more sophisticated functions and write support code for longjmp setjmp that load and store register state into the jump buffers

736169
binutils	newlib
i used this blog of anthony green as a guideline where he describes porting of gcc newlib and binutils

736190
attributes	properties
for each properties check to see if that properties s generic parameter type has the tableattributes attributes

736236
configuration	environment
this means we can deploy all our configuration and just switch one value to change environment

736245
webforms	asp.net
i am using asp.net webforms 2.0 c#

736263
put	get
put the two together and you should get what you asked for

736269
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
she uses touchesbegan and touchesmoved to determine swipe direction then sets the animation based on the direction in touchesended

736269
order	add
you could extend or amend this to add tap detection in order to determine which view to transition to

736276
xsd	xml
since there s no standard approach that works for exporting relational data into xml documents there s also no one approach for generating an xsd for that data

736276
xsd	xml
i got past a similar roadblock a while back by creating a small model of the database using access and then exporting from access into xml data and xsd schema files

736276
xsd	xml
they weren t obvious but they do exist. the generated xml and xsd weren t suitable for my application but just having that example to work with was enough to get me started

736281
click	mouse
if the right mouse button is click while the left mouse button is held down the expected behavior is that the background color changes from blue to green

736297
private-members	instances
note that although nested classes have access to the enclosing class s private-members the reverse is not true hence the need for instances to be internal here

736307
data-structures	tree
in the course of implementing i obviously run into the problem of having to implement the basic data-structures from the ground up actually not only linked lists but also stacks tree et cetera

736307
linked-list	tree
i am focusing on lists in this topic because it s typically a structure i end up using a lot in the program either as a main structure or as a helper structure for other bigger ones for example a hash tree that resolves conflicts by using a linked-list

736307
having	union
making only one list but having a union as element type containing all element types i will use in the program easier to debugging

736320
for-loop	loops
i changed the for-loops for...in loops and it worked

736322
value	field
firefox was already leaving the cursor at the end when there is already a value for the field

736325
traffic	packets
then compare and contrast the packets in both directions and i almost guarantee that you ll see something different in the http-headers or some other part of the traffic that will explain the problem

736330
constructor	object
for object that are derived from qobject almost all classes prefixed by q are constructor take an optional parameter parent

736331
xcopy	cmd
one thing i haven t looked at is using the cmd u switch but i m pretty sure that is only for built in shell commands and won t help you with xcopy

736333
having	union
making only one list but having a union as element type containing all element types i will use in the program easier to debugging

736335
python	php
is there is a super global like php in python

736356
webforms	asp.net
i am using c# with asp.net webforms i also have ajax toolkit but haven t used it yet

736365
atomicity	lockless
the individual reads of a and b are atomicity and all writes elsewhere in the code to these two memory locations are also lockless atomicity

736367
value	field
as an aside if the uniqueness property is important to your application you don t want multiple records with the same value for a field email you can define the unique constraint on a table

736373
32-bit	64bit
assuming these are consecutive in memory and 32-bit each and that your processor has an atomic 64bit read then you can issue an atomic 64bit read to read the two values in parsing the two values out of the 64bit value do the math and return what you want to return

736390
openoffice.org	spreadsheet
for simplicity i would like to record the data in a spreadsheet program such as openoffice.org calc

736391
where-clause	sql
i want to use an equivalent of sql s operator in the where-clause below..

736409
64bit	x86
if you are targeting x86 you can use the 64bit compare exchange support and pack both int s into a single 64bit word

736418
sendmessage	message
you use the sendmessage methods to send the bcm_setshield message to a handle in this case the handle of your button that should show it

736425
json	xml
you could try making a generic functions that process the data like parand mentioned which you can call from the views that generate the web pages as well as those that generate the json xml whatever

736431
perl	awk
at that point awk perl ruby or something similar which meets your tastes .

736432
tapestry	wicket
i was hoping to find something like wicket tapestry or barracuda for the scala language

736444
associations	model
in each case you have two model but they work together seamlessly via their associations

736454
python	java
don t write java when you re using python

736470
itextsharp	pdfsharp
how about pdfsharp or itextsharp

736494
duplicates	contains
given a set s contains duplicates elements how can one determine the total number all the possible subsets of s where each subset is unique

736502
websphere	ibm
ibm s websphere real-time

736511
menuitem	button
when i click on the overflow button of my toolbar the special items menuitem appears with a little arrow next to it indicating nested elements

736511
click	mouse
however when i hover the mouse over special items or try to click on it the menuitems c and d are not being displayed

736515
exception-handling	try-catch
do it in a try-catch block because it can throw a cancelled by user exception-handling

736532
payment	billing
what are the providers vendors that can offer billing services including managing invoices subscription renewal and reminder for payment dues

736537
swing	awt
the latest version 2.1 is compliant with jdk1.5 so you should have swing awt available

736551
implements	abstract
asp.net allows you to abstract security components so much that i find it s really easy to implements them after the fact

736556
sorted	lookup
a central component of the original program is a perl module that does string prefix lookup in a +500 gb sorted text file using binary-search

736568
children	nodes
like i said before each nodes has a unique guid identifier but right now nodess reference their parents children directly and do not store their ids

736585
any	set
i have one host that has identityfile set to .ssh iddsa_aux but the parameter should accept any path name

736614
keyboard	mouse
in a non-web interface the controllers handles the inputs from things like the keyboard and mouse choosing which views to render and what changes to make in the model based on those inputs

736629
negative-number	numeric
in the case of numeric fields they don t have quotes around them but they do start with a + or a - sign depicting a positive negative-number

736658
instances	private
in java all instances functions are virtual and can be overridden -- unless they are declared as private and or final

736662
backwards-compatibility	deprecated
stringtokenizer is deprecated and is only available for backwards-compatibility so don t use it

736663
low-level	hardware
to run the low-level hardware tests i wrote a simple scripting reader

736665
protected	public
and is your foo class methods declared public protected or private or package local

736665
protected	public
perhaps less obvious is if they are package local no public protected private scope then you can only override them if you are in the same package as the original class

736665
void	main
public static void main string arguments

736665
protected	public
if you declare the original a methods in foo public or protected you will get the result you expected

736686
default	reset
formalizing a consistent state among the project team could mean establishing natural default value which would be used as a reset state

736688
licensing	gpl
you should probably note that nmap considers a product that parsing its output to be a derived work according to the licensing chapter in the manual and thus fall under the gpl licensing obligations

736701
textmate	vim
i just recently set up my vim environment from textmate after becoming addicted to its modal input

736701
textmate	vim
picture comparison between textmate left and vim right

736710
.when	ready
.when you are ready to move it online just make sure the host supports everything you need

736789
gridview	listview
i am using a wpf application in which i placed a listview control which has 3 gridview columns

736792
tinyurl	bit.ly
is there an expiry on bit.ly or tinyurl shortened urls

736797
protected	public
access-modifiers private public protected

736813
mp3	wma
does anyone has an experience of reading and writing id3-tag in an mp3 file or a wma file

736814
ado	jet
i use ado components include with delphi for this microsoft jet 4.0 ole provider

736817
document	element
finally if the structure of the provided xml document is not going to change a more efficient xpath expression because using the abbreviation causes the whole sub tree starting at the top element node to be scanned will be the following

736835
gridview	listview
from what i see the wpf gridview is just a view mode look n feel for the listview control.

736878
pecl	pear
hint pear classes are pure php pecl packages are modules

736893
delta	diff
if the content is very large and the changes are only minor ones you may consider to go for a reverse delta approach only the latest version of the text is stored in full format and the previous vesion is a diff from the latest version to the previous

736893
pecl	pear
if you can t or don t want to user pear and pecl you still can use the diff utility called by exec

736898
google-chrome	firefox
for example software such as ie8 google-chrome or firefox might all be tagged browsers to categorize them on a download page

736899
key-value	key
the initial state would be your hash key and final state would be the hash value and then you d have a key-value pair for each initial state

736899
user-input	output
obviously such a large general purpose program would require an impractical amount of memory to hash and would not be useful anyway since the system is self-referencing irreducibly complex next user-input depends on previous system output

736899
lookup	any
any by zero i mean a very fast o 1 running time -- the time it takes to lookup the terminating state if it terminate

736902
if-statement	for-loop
the if-statement in the last for-loop can be better like

736920
quicksort	heapsort
for general-purpose sorting the answer appears to be no as quicksort merge sort and heapsort tend to perform better in the average- and worst-case scenarios

736923
insertion-sort	quicksort
most sorting procedures will use quicksort and then insertion-sort for very small data sets

736938
insertion-sort	quicksort
in the case of two algorithms with different asymptotic running times such as one o n 2 and one o nlogn as is the case with insertion-sort and quicksort respectively it is not definite that one is faster than the other

736945
haskell	scala
scala s equivalent of haskell s adts uses sealed traits and case classes

736977
configuration	environment
in a heterogeneous environment there are a lot of different webserver and configuration

737040
json	xml
i know there is the xstream xml serialization library and json as alternative solutions however since delphi and .net have built-in support for soap xml serialized objects this would offer a standardized way with support for advanced features like nested objects arrays and so on

737081
capture	player
using a flash player users can t download them as such but they could easily do a screens capture

737084
subroutine	scoping
functions and subroutine do have their own scoping for this though

737112
compact-framework	.net
in the .net compact-framework 3.5 exceptions by default don t have their actual error message string installed

737156
instances	private
to look at non-public properties use for example getproperties bindingflags.public | bindingflags.nonpublic | bindingflags.instances which returns all public private instances properties

737185
network-interface	subnet
note that since you re using the same network-interface in the global zone and the child zone you must choose an ip-address for the child on the same subnet as the global zone s

737244
value	field
somewhere in my code i need to convert a list of viewvalue instances to a list contains value of id field from corresponding viewvalue

737245
pointers	stack
gcc allocates the arrays on stack just like it does with by just adjusting stack pointers

737247
python	java
these are python and java centric i don t have any trouble reading the code samples but as i am a c# developer it would be fun to play with some of these ideas in my native language

737257
function-pointers	member-functions
change classes to structures make existing member-functions as function-pointers in those newly defined structures and then invoke those functions using function-pointers etc..

737294
required	checked
in brief your needs might change where there s no sanity checked now one might be required in the future

737294
protected	public
this refactoring process is obviously made much easier if you are already using properties in place of public protected fields

737294
vb.net	vb6
vb6 already did this for com-exposed classes and i see absolutely no reason for vb.net and c# not to do the same

737304
initializer	setter
but if you would have used setter you would only have to change the setter to initializer the object with the provided string

737311
export	report
if we export to excel from the reportingservices report web site the user gets an option to open save cancel

737323
implements	extends
you can see it wraps and changes the httpservletrequest object to the securitycontextholderawarerequestwrapper class which extends httpservletrequestwrapper which implements httpservletrequest and feed it back to the standard servlet filtering dofiltering chain

737324
updating	updates
i had to make it work so now my updates code is fecthing the record from the database updating and then executing savechanges methods

737329
fileinputstream	bufferedreader
use a normal inputstream fileinputstream wrapped in an inputstreamreader and then wrapped in a bufferedreader - then call readline on the bufferedreader

737333
buffering	streaming
i ll happily roll my own input streaming wrapping with buffering etc. but nine times out of ten the commons io stuff works fine and is sufficient more concise less error prone etc

737340
any	set
you should be able to do almost any search in less than 10 ms no matter how many records you have to search provided that you have set up your lucene index correctly

737358
command-line	cmd
is there a higher purpose to this than just being able to accept cmd-line arguments especially since a vast majority of java programs are gui driven and don t need to receive args through cmd line

737382
implements	extends
if not implements a class extends the authentication interface on which you can put your authentication parameters

737403
jquery	dojo
use a library like jquery prototype dojo or mootools because both of these methods are fraught with trouble

737403
javascript	dom
the writers of the major javascript libraries have spent a lot of time and have entire bug tracking systems to make sure that when you call their dom modifying tools they actually work

737409
getter	setter
i think getter and setter are evil if used excessively by that i mean when it s not necessary and would break the business model but why shouldn t we have a function called getbalance

737409
getter	setter
now in some sense getbalance may not be relevant enough to argue that getter and setter are good because it doesn t or maybe shouldn t have an accompanying setter and speaking of which a function called setbalance float f could be bad in my opinion because it would imply to the implementer of the function that the account must be manipulated out side of the class which is not a good thing

737415
arrays	map
below is some code i am using to translate a map arrays into sql code so i can easily update my database when i have updated my game map

737418
selected	listbox
i switched it with a listbox to apply thru triggers a new datatemplate when an item is selected

737421
ostringstream	std
an example in std ostringstream is the str function

737427
compression	streaming
that way you can even compress the data on the fly using a compression streaming wrapper if amnount of data gets really large

737437
getter	setter
for less typing you can implements trivial setter getter as inline methods

737437
getter	setter
and don t forget that getter and setter are somewhat evil

737438
getter	setter
the legwork is not more if you implements just the default setter getter inline in the class declaration which i tend to do - more complex setter move to the body though

737445
buffering	streaming
use some reflection hackery to retrieve the value of the private variables of the streamingreader object that corresponds to the current byte positioning within the internal buffering different from that with the streaming - usually behind but no more than equal to of course

737445
streamreader	binaryreader
don t bother using a streamreader at all but instead implements your custom readline function built on top of the stream or binaryreader even binaryreader is guaranteed never to read further ahead than what you request

737474
typemock	nunit
at my work place we are using typemock and nunit for our unit-testing

737478
controller	routes
on httpapplication.application_start your can add dynamically any routes controller and action anme to routetable.routes this you can use any information available in this event or ever populate routes from configuration file or database

737489
compact-framework	.net
there is a time when i consider not using properties and that is in writing .net compact-framework code

737519
put	get
the only way to get it right for sure is put everything yes that too in one big file

737520
any	set
both of the columns are datetime if this makes any difference one of the columns is nullable and is maintained by a triggers on updates and the other is not nullable and set using a default value in the table definition

737520
attributes	properties
b a way to programatically set the storegeneratedpattern attributes against the properties when i create the objectcontext the easy answer is to manually manipulate this in the .ssdl but this would then be overwrite if i refreshed the model from the database and i cannot go down the route where the .csdl .msl .ssdl are hand-cranked

737528
click	mouse
right mouse click on the menu and selected customize from the drop down

737530
parentheses	braces
mismatched braces or parentheses

737531
wait	hang
this means that calling openssl s ssl_shutdown properly twice - once to initiate the shutdown and again to wait for the response - will hang on the second call

737552
getter	setter
getter and setter are evil

737552
getter	setter
use of getter and setter is in opposition to the fundamentals of object oriented design data abstraction and encapsulation

737552
getter	setter
overuse of getter and setter will make your code less agile and maintainable in the long run

737552
getter	setter
you ll need to change the private data field the getter the setter and all the client code of this class that calls these getters and setter

737552
getter	setter
this not to say that getter and setter don t have their purpose

737552
getter	setter
the getter and setter make it more difficult to fix the problems since the client code dostuffwithaccount is now bound to the data-type we used to implements the account balance

737552
getter	setter
the overall point though is that you must be careful with getter and setter

737552
getter	setter
do not get into the habit of writing getter and setter for every data-members

737560
web-hosting	hosting
i don t mean not-open projects like google web-hosting which use google ressources not users but open projects where each user contribute to the hosting of the global web-hosting by letting its ressources cpu bandwith be available

737567
virtual-functions	derived-class
in c++ you can have an arrays of base class pointers but you can call different functions of the derived-class by assigning the derived-class objects addresses to a base-class arrays of pointers by using virtual-functions is this dynamic binding

737572
any	set
get and set are a pain inflicted upon people if you have to use them in any language

737576
dynamic-dispatch	dynamic-binding
this is much closer to dynamic-dispatch than dynamic-binding

737577
early-binding	late-binding
link-time binding aka early-binding is the opposite of dynamic-binding aka late-binding

737591
dynamic-dispatch	dynamic-binding
dynamic-binding choosing which methods to call based on the receiving object s type may be implements using some form of dynamic-dispatch your 1 but we generally define the name to only refer to situation 2

737594
carbon	cocoa
since matlab doesn t support the creation of additional threads and that would be needlessly complicated for this situation anyway i can t make use of either the carbon or cocoa event managers

737595
constructor	private
now the only way a singleton can be created is via the instance function because the constructor is private and so you can guarantee only one singleton exists

737595
constructor	private
if you want to use the free function approach described in your question you could consider making the function a friend of the singleton class while retaining the private constructor

737596
getter	setter
that s fairly common in c++ after all if it doesn t take any argumentss we know it s the getter and if it takes an arguments it s the setter

737599
command-line	cmd
actually it doesn t need to strictly be cmd-line based as long as it cooperate with other cmd line tools as i mentioned git for example then it s fine

737617
versioning	upgrade
you either have to backport the sqllite module from python 2.5 to python 2.2 or ask your web hoster to upgrade to the latest python versioning

737622
keydown	keyup
alternatively you could handle keyup keydown events

737625
oracle	mysql
is that the case with mysql oracle etc

737644
32-bit	64bit
the issue i ran into was related to having a 64bit machine and running a project that had a mixture of 64bit and 32-bit 3rd party dll s

737644
32-bit	x86
the solution was to ensure i had the correct bits 32v64 and then to have the project build in 32-bit mode project properties build platform target x86

737644
32-bit	64bit
another time this occurred i had to remove all the 64bit dll s and reinstall with the 32-bit dll s

737656
constructor	private
protected private constructor with createinstance method

737656
constructor	private
another way around this is to make your constructor private or protected and make a createinstance method that can return errors

737746
restart	exit
currently i m planning to save the state and exit relying on the http completion to restart the paused stream

737746
buffering	streaming
but for the streaming should i decouple the data being received from the processing it and buffering it while the http requests are being processed

737788
default-value	default
the default keyword will return the default-value of the generic type

737788
reference-type	generics
if you only want reference-type as entities you should set constraints on your generics parameters

737794
any	set
in sas 9.2 although the return value is 0 successful and the library object does get created i checked manually using the management console the uri variables stays blank so any subsequent operations to set attributes etc fail

737799
processor	affinity
for example you might want to limit an application to using no more than a given number of processor to take money for using each processor - you will use bit shifts to count bits in the affinity mask

737802
any	set
i could call it and set the loadfunction to almost anything so i don t know what the arguments are going to be at any given time

737809
selected	button
when the user subsequently hits a connect button i can ascertain which of the ports from the arrays was selected

737809
attributes	properties
therefore in my appcontroller.h i am expecting two attributes which i can presumably create as properties and synthesize

737809
contains	set
i have created a simple project which contains just a pop up and a label and following various articles i have managed to populate an nsmutablearray with elements which i then use an arraycontrollers to display values and then on selection set the value of a label using an object controllers

737867
value	field
essentially i have some field in my header footer which pull information out of the resulting dataset this is done by creating hidden textbox in the report body then creating a textbox in the footer with its value set to reportitems

737891
order	join
because primary keys are referenced by other structures and therefore used in join operations the criteria for primary key selection boils down to the following for me in order of importance

737922
linux	bsd
if you re looking for a command line utility it doesn t look like there is one standardized but gnu linux and bsd both have readlink 1

737927
filehandle	stdin
after grabbing that shift the args over by one and then either use the remaining args as your file list or the bash special filehandle dev stdin if there were no other args

737931
ruby-on-rails	django
i m a ruby-on-rails guy so i ve no idea how easy it is to implement with django

737939
python	ruby
seen the python answer like 3 times but no ruby

737946
attributes	properties
for the id attributes the is key properties is set to true and all other attributess are marked true for is required

737956
build-system	cmake
i vote for cmake as a meta-building tool that really rewrite kde4 build-system from scratch -- and make kde4 now a cross-platform desktop that even running on windowsce

737956
toolchain	cmake
cmake is the carrier porting kde4 to any os on earth -- by generating makefile or vcprojs in windows case for about 40 oses with relative toolchain

737960
directory	folder
the result of this wizzard is a discomap and wsdl files that are put in the app_webreferences folder of your site in a directory structure based on the namespace you ve chosen in the dialog

737967
webforms	asp.net
for my prototype i built a simple dashboard web app using both webforms and asp.net mvc

737967
asp.net-mvc	webforms
in the end we migrate our main methodology from webforms to asp.net-mvc

737988
export	report
i did some detective work and found that several of our other report bind columns to the header footer and they export just fine

737988
contains	set
cause of the problem the row contains my hidden textbox was set to invisible i did this so i wouldn t have to toggle the textbox individually

737988
export	report
now the report outputs fine and the export looks fine as well

737996
directory	folder
this gives me a bit of a problem since if i run the program from another directory with the command . folder folder program for example my program will not find the text because the working directory isn t correct

738005
keyboard	mouse
i figure tracking my keyboard and mouse is a good way to see when i left and arrived

738005
keyboard	mouse
have a system wide callback for every mouse and keyboard press

738019
command-line	cmd
in linux you can get the cmd line by reading proc folder as proc pid cmd-line

738036
e-commerce	product
it was an e-commerce application where each product had a number of configurable attributes

738037
any	set
it will set one ant property if any high priority warnings are found a different property if any correctness warnings are found a third property if any security warnings are found etc

738053
configuration	environment
configuration reader setter which reads the configuration from ini xml file and sets the environment of the application

738061
python	ruby
bit shifting in ruby or python sounds really weird to me kind of like mixing high and low level

738065
value	field
i need to iterate over all fields that are annotationss with column and get name and value of field and annotations

738065
value	field
but i ve got problem with getting value of each field since all of them are of different data type

738078
implements	super
i searched many years for the paste command knowing this is a super basic operation someone must already have implements something to solve this problem

command-line	cmd
the second cmd-line first translates all newlines to spaces and the echo cmd is added to add a final newline to the input because sed will ignore lines lacking eol thereby joining all the input lines into one single line which then the sed cmd splits up again portability note not all sed programs will work with arbitrary line lengths but gnu sed does

but as long as you re not using the server itself to do the editing which would be the case if say you created some kind of text-editor web application it s perfectly fine and a completely normal practice to edit files in the document root

738288
ref	out
an out parameter is by ref - so you ll find pinfo.parametertype.isbyref returns true

738292

logout	login
also i see that login sec and logout sec counters are both very high - if connection pooling were used logout sec would be at or near zero

738688

738819
gridex	janus
the gridex control from janus systemd can do it but honestly i d really stay clear of doing things like janus systemd do so it s better you should find your own way

i have this annoying problem where my exception-handling windows in visual-studio 2008 is replaced by a windowss pop-up dialog box see images below

738836

the same problem is with checkbox and radio-button

738836
firefox	opera
i need solution that works for ie6+ firefox 2+ opera 9+ .

this will segfault because you are trying to free c which is not something that has been malloc ed before

738856
floppy	hdd
i need to know if my program can write files to the disk hdd floppy flash cd from where it is running

738867
silverlight	wpf
i ve done this in wpf but not silverlight

738877
mouseover	mousedown
you ll also find that the mousedown and mouseover states for the control will be fixed as the default style

738880

the goal is when information dialog windows pop-up it can always go to the specified url

738981
versioning	upgrade
one more reason for upgrade to newer windows versioning

738986
compact-framework	.net
the irdaclient class is part of the .net compact-framework

739009
annotations	mapping
all the hibernate etc annotations are just fluff that i never look at once my mapping is working fine

739034
contains	set
also you can raise exception-handling-handling if you are returning a value different from zero and then set two exception-handling variables mine exception-handling and exception-handling_msg the first contains the exception-handling type and the second a human readable message

739052
any	set
each object has a corresponding dictionary string key object value collection to store the values it has set for any of the user properties

739077
directory	folder
i want all new vc project created to automatically include i the directory and link to the shared .lib dll in that shared folder

739078
business-objects	data-access
it s nothing new to de-couple the data-access code from your business-objects but i m always on the look-out for the best way to achieve something

739084
contains	set
the datagridtemplatecolumn.celleditingtemplate contains a combobox with iseditable set to true

739085
average	median
a simple way perhaps not the best way to do this reduction could be to take the average or median of the rgb components

739090
environment	building
ensures a local building directory gets added to the environment s ld_library_path variables

739090
signals	sigint
at first i thought python was grabbing the sigint signals but this doesn t seem to be the case as i set up signals handler forward the signals to the debugee and that doesn t fix the problem

739090
signals	sigint
i ve tried various configuration to the python scripting calling os.spawn instead of subprocess etc. it seems that any way i go about it if python launched the child process sigint ctrl-c signals do not to get routed to gdb or the child process

739095
selected	listbox
i am using the listbox in win32 c++ and when getting the selected text from my listbox the string returned is just garbage

739121
implementation	instantiation
this way when you use the templates in any compilation unit you will generate an unknown reference to the implementation which can then be satisfied by the linker from the one compilation unit where you do the explicit instantiation

739128
instances	private
i assume tclient instances would have a private reference variables of type tfacade

739128
instances	private
a methods somewhere in tclient would create an instances of tfacade and assign it to this private variables

739128
constructor	private
presumably tfacade instances do the same thing--they have private workerclass variables and create instances of the workerclasses perhaps in the tfacade constructor

739133
updating	updates
if i am updating a feature that is mentioned in several locations i need that list to at least have an idea for where to look for a potential need to updates

739138
uiresponder	uiview
in your uiview subclass or actually any subclass of uiresponder

739176
swing	swt
i take it this is a client gui application swing swt awt but beyond that i think we re going to need more details

739181
required	checked
everyone is close but there s a rule in the enforcer to specifically checked for a property no ant or funky profiling required

739193
curly-braces	include
the curly-braces are optional though i just include them to make it clearer

739195
arrays	map
and if you need to get a value for a key you should use a map not an arrays

739197
any	set
any server could run any code as long as there was some type of environment set up on the server to interpret and run it

739202
arrays	loops
you have to loops through the entire arrays there s no changing that

739205
hide	show
you could add remove the label from the layer to hide show it just retain the label instance for later retrieval

739244
order	add
you d add an order by sum vote_code

739274
jax-ws	cxf
in addition to axis2 which works ok sun s jax-ws version 2 and apache cxf nee xfire are worth checking out it soap is your thing

739282
json	xml
beyond that and other recommendations json with jackson works quite well much faster than xml competitive with pb hessian and bit more compact

739286
default-value	default
an explicit default-value the default

739292
virtual-machine	vmware
my primary development box is a windows 2003 server installation running on a vmware virtual-machine that runs off a 500 gb external usb 2.0 hard drive

739306
gedit	gnome
if you re a linux user and you also use gnome then i would have to recommend gedit

739306
kate	kde
if you re not running gnome but are still using linux kde you might be able to use kate

739306
gedit	kde
gedit will work in kde but it won t look right

739308
callback	methods
when you register for a notification the callback methods you register gets called on the object that registers and if you ve overridden it in a subclass then the overridden methods gets called

739315
32-bit	64bit
tortoisehg 0.4 does work on 32-bit windows-vista but there are still problems with 64bit vista

739315
32-bit	64bit
the problem is that windows explorer is a 64bit process and 64bit processes can not communicate directly with 32-bit libraries

739319
hierarchical-data	nested-set-model
i ve looked at managing hierarchical-data in mysql but it really only deals with adding and deleting nodes in a nested-set-model

739325
python	c++
i want to do this in either c# python or c++

739334
children	nodes
consider that moving a nodes is equivalent to deleting the nodes and all its children if any and insertig the nodes and its children if any in the new position

739342
rollback	commit
hoping this is a rare event i would clone the git repository and start rollback versioning to locate the commit that is closest to the tree you wish to duplicates

739346
enumerate	except
alternatively do a deep-copy of your list into a new _displaycollection list and enumerate through this separate collection which will not be written to except being filled before the display process begins

739358
decrement	increment
the code that s walking the tree simply needs to increment the indent level every time you enter a block and decrement it when you exit a block

739370
python	java
at my company we don t commit qt to source we compile it separately on build machines and then link to it in the project whether that s c++ java jambi or python pyqt

739373
constructor	object
the page flow.jsf has a command button pointing to an another managed bean called objectlist session scoped containing a property object named objectlist.selectedcontractor a pojo initialized into the constructor so its children properties are always empty only at the first mb call or wrong

739379
contains	any
at least the output was not allowed to contains any when i was in charge of it

739395
solaris	freebsd
i m still reading design impl of freebsd with solaris internals being the next on my list so all i can do is make wild guesses atm

739419
hide	show
how would i set the binding to show and hide the respective panels

739429
carbon	cocoa
that also kills native 32 bit libraries such as swt carbon which is what eclipse uses they need to move to cocoa now

739429
32-bit	64bit
update snow leopard apparently has java6 for 32-bit intel too in addition to 64bit

739434
create-table	alter-table
this also demonstrates creating foreign keys in a create-table instead of in an alter-table

739451
python	java
clarification i am asking about the java toolkit not the python one

739452
hide	show
by the way this is probably just be because you have abbreviated the model code but if you want to show and hide dynamically your model will need to implement inotifypropertychanged

739464
command-line	cmd
in order to edit the cmd at the cmd-line using the example above type

739470
emacs	vim
then i imagine there are ways to configure vim to work nicely with matlab i m an emacs person these days and there are solutions for emacs

739474
environment	building
i have used c++ for a long time now and even though i ve built several mfc and beos applications with it i ve building a number of unix server applications with it and still the console game environment is significantly different

739475
any	set
if they claim any c++ knowledge a really good set of screening questions are

739475
protected	public
what are the difference among private protected and public declarations in a class

739480
ruby	php
is there a realtime apache php console similar to webrick or mongrel with ruby on rails

739507
hide	show
i would like to have a button used to expand retract the height of the cell when it is pushed you know show and hide

739508
constructor	private
perhaps the simplest way to refactor this is to change the name withage to initage make initage private then call it from your constructor instead

739510
double	int
works on positive and negative int of any size double and ratios too

739530
for-loop	loops
if adding items then the for-loops may skip some silently while the foreach loops will throw

739549
mocking	tdd
this is the first project that i have used tdd and mocking on so sorry if this isn t really a big problem

739553
msbuild	nant
having said that if you re willing to invest the time msbuild or nant perhaps

739553
msbuild	nant
if you want something which offers a greater range of customization you ll probably be spending a decent amount of time learning and understanding it - msbuild cifactory nant etc are no cake walk

739578
dictionary	map
how do you map rudimentary data structures tree dictionary in an orm such as nhibernate

739610
buffering	streaming
given the buffering inherent in all the stdio functions i would be tempted to read the streaming character by character with getc

739610
buffering	streaming
edit to have control over the buffering on the input streaming you might need to call setbuf or setvbuf to force it to a bufferinged mode

739610
buffering	streaming
if the input streaming ends up unbufferinged then using an explicit buffering of some form will always be faster than getc on a raw streaming

739620
subtract	time
my own personal preference is to install cygwin and use the time command but if you actually have to do it as a batch file you can t just subtract the strings you have to treat them as parts

739634
subtract	time
time evaluates to something like 12 34 56.78 and the set a command can t subtract those

739644
triggers	insert
triggers make your front-end easier to migrate to something else and they will keep the database consistent no matter how data is insert updated removed

739694
organization	naming
i have been trying to clean up the naming and organization conventions of our projects unit and integration-testing

739694
organization	naming
it seems that if there is one best practice for unit test organization it is that the layout and naming of the test classes and namespaces should mirror those of the code under test

739712
audio	ogg
for decoding ogg audio files you can look at the csvorbis module in mono s sn server

739717
fortran	perl
another thing that keeps my perl from looking like fortran c is a regular reading of module sources especially those of the masters

739723
constructor	object
there is a subtle additional risk in that calling withage within the constructor on a partially constructed object isn t quite the same as calling it after the constructor

739733
children	nodes
the path enumeration design also makes it easy to relocate a nodes and its children

739734
implements	extends
you could extends the foreign class assuming it s non-final and make that class implements the interface

739748
printf	atoi
sizeof is a keyword because despite it s name and usage it is an operator like + or or rather than a function like printf or atoi or fgets

739748
operators	keyword
if instead of + c used the keyword plus to add numbers you would make it an operators

739751
operators	keyword
all operators are keyword

739794
malloc	free
6945 address 0x7 is not stack d malloc d or recently free d

739794
malloc	free
6945 malloc free in use at exit 4 bytes in 1 blocks

739794
malloc	free
6945 malloc free 1 allocs 1 frees 4 bytes allocated

739794
malloc	free
when running this application you would not longer get a segmentation fault emitted by the kernel but a warning from glib the owner of malloc and free

739794
realloc	malloc
if you would run this in valgrind which operates by replacing the free malloc realloc .

739794
malloc	free
6955 malloc free in use at exit 4 bytes in 1 blocks

739794
malloc	free
6955 malloc free 1 allocs 1 frees 4 bytes allocated

739808
selected	textbox
then you can add a textbox a dialog right click the start grouping and selected add dialog to the project set the visible property for the textbox to false

739812
jquery	.post
jquery doesn t traverse the parameter map below the first level so the example in the question is likely generating this .post data

739812
contains	any
the other working example does not contains any sub-objects so it is being translated directly like this

739815
updating	updates
when installing new plugins or even updating old ones eclipse has a tendency to contact all enabled updates sites

739815
updating	updates
btw eclipse 3.5m6 has option to use only selected updates site -- it is great help when updating installing plugins

739824
directory	folder
i want an app that would route the subdomain to a folder inside the directory

739862

739880
msbuild	nant
so we had cc scripting that triggers nant jobs which for building used msbuild

739881
json	xml
also when visiting the url he sees xml not json

739889
msbuild	nant
nant is open source and if it weren t i wouldn t be able to customize our build-system msbuild is not

739889
msbuild	nant
nant can easily run msbuild i m not sure about the other way around

739891
folder	dir
when i create this and view the folder windows has set the dir as read only

739901
sql-server	sqlcommand
i have a timestamp column updated in my microsoft sql-server database and wish to retrieve the value as a datetime object using sqlconnection and sqlcommand

739902
sql-server	oracle
for example to ship an sql-server application to a new site that uses oracle

739945
double	int
even if you re given a positive int it s not hard to get it to a double

739945
double	int
going from a 32-bit int to a double should provide adequate precision

739953
32-bit	64bit
it works with all version of .net and works with both 32-bit and 64bit versions

739953
instrumentation	profiling
a managed implementation of a code profiling is not possible same for java as well as then the profiling would instrumentation itself

739957
user-controls	ascx
beacuse at runtime all user-controls ascx merged to your page aspx

739977
arrays	loops
you can loops through the json object just like you would any arrays really

739992
perl	awk
in the case of your re where you wanted to get all annotation xml where the about attribute contains match i would do it in perl or awk for us old-timers - since the input file was reasonably fixed format

740002
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework is cross-database and should be a loy closer to your current code

740003
persistence	hibernate
unlike hibernate which is based on an unobtrusive persistence model he presents an obtrusive framework in which domain objects has to be extended from a persistentobject

740010
rollback	commit
another problem with myisam although not really database corruption in the strict sense is that it does not properly support transactions commit - rollback

740014
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework works with any database supported by ado.net

740043
value	field
for security reasons no one can write a value in a file field in html

740066
debugging	trace
when i trace this with debugging the ctr + 1 statement gets executed but the actual counter remains at zero

740067
bazaar	git
i haven t used git but i used svn and bazaar which is similar in philosophy to git so i can answer you in general terms

740114
value	field
from what i ve ready you should be able to use the value property of a file input-field to get the currently set path of that field

740116
click	mouse
and then you can click the mouse wheel to paste the contents

740149
coff	elf
you can parsing the coff elf whatever format file from the build and this gives you the information you need to work out the names and types of the variables in your object

740175
visualworks	squeak
i was aware from the beginning that smalltalk has several dialects perhaps dialect isn t the best word but by this i mean visualworks squeak and dolphin to mention just three

740175
visualworks	squeak
so far i have limited my foray to visualworks and squeak

740191
swing	gwt
these might be swing or it might be a web browser via gwt for example

740211
innodb	myisam
however due to various and maybe obvious reasons i want to switch from myisam to innodb as i need transactions at some places

740214
webforms	asp.net
we have a 3-tier web application written in asp.net webforms where we will not be able to port it - recession really sucks

740222
project-management	project
as for issue tracking project-management we settled on vision project after a long investigation

740224
append	input
i was trying to use append to put the block content onto then bottom of the body and display with absolute position but when displayed an input checkbox becomes non-clickable on firefox

740226
lookup	any
to lookup srv records and indeed any other dns resource record type other than an a record you need a third party library

740228
value	field
first i tried an enum with defined value for all the field

740229
exception-handling	error-handling
a misused exception-handling is worse than no error-handling at all as you can grab a crash dump and view the unhandled exception-handling to find the error in seconds

740245
value	field
in theory you could pack 10 such field into a 32-bit int value

740249
debugging	trace
debugging.write is only effective on builds where the debugging flag is defined while trace.write is only effective when the trace flag is defined

740253
display	width
my best guess at this point is that you need to put a container a block level element such as div around the description or the whole document and specify a width for it that is within the dimensions of the display using css

740266
debugging	trace
here s a good article on debugging trace etc

740278
python	php
i know that most of the php frameworks nowadays make this job easier but somehow i don t feel like porting all my code to one of these frameworks and i can t quite understand how the form validation is implemented in django for instance i know it s python but i really like their approach so i though the best way would for me to post here the way i process a simple form and maybe you guys can point me in the best direction

740285
linqdatasource	gridview
i have a gridview that is bound to a linqdatasource control that is returning a collection of customers

740312
python	java
well no this is python not java we don t worry too much about evil programmers using properties and methods they shouldn t we just put â _â at the start of the name and let that be a suitable warning to all

740318
webforms	asp.net
you might find it easier however to develop a web site that is non-javascript friendly using asp.net mvc rather than webforms

740318
json	xml
the framework provides a pretty easy mechanism on the server side to determine whether the request is an ajax request or not so you can respond appropriately by rendering a new view or sending back json html xml as appropriate

740318
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i know that i ve found it much easier to write accessible web sites using asp.net-mvc than i did with webforms

740325
command-prompt	cmd
you can do this be running a cmd-prompt in elevated mode and executing this cmd

740327
firefox	opera
as you ll be able to see at this demo page everything pretty much works at least in opera and firefox save for the gradient being ever so slightly off at the end hover to be shown the hex value

740351
type-safety	generics
also it raises unchecked warnings because of the type-safety issues around generics arrays

740359
lazy-evaluation	maybe
maybe a bit more lazy-evaluation

740370
button	popup
when the admob view is clicked safari gets opened and if there is any error in loading the ad it displays an error message saying safari cannot open the page because too many redirects occurred there is a ok button in the error popup when ok button is clicked only the error popup is closed and control is not coming back to the application

740382
directory	folder
zipoutputstream can handle empty directory by adding a forward-slash after the folder name

740392
environment	building
building chain i don t put it in version-control when i trust the provider or when i can recreate the environment apple s xcode open-source tools such as gcc or doxygen ...

740404
xsl-fo	xslt
what s the difference between xslt and xsl-fo

740410
xsl-fo	xslt
xslt formatting objects or xslt-fo is

740410
xsl-fo	xslt
xslt-fo is part of xslt

740412
xsl-fo	xslt
xslt-fo stands for extensible stylesheet language formatting objects and is about formatting and now is known as xslt to avoid all confusion

740414
xsl-fo	xslt
xslt is used for transforming xsl which is the same as xsl-fo is used for formatting

740429
static-class	base-class
you could make an abstract base-class for all your forms classes for fieldtypes and a static-class just for validating the value of various types validatestring validatehtml validateemail validatenumber date etc just the methods..

740429
value	field
defining your form you would define what field objects would it use so the form- validate methods would invoke the field- validate and return the filtering value or error message

740429
value	field
read the post once pass it once to the form validation and then work on filtering field value

740432
csv	xml
however back in the real world xslt which is also what most people will assume you mean by xsl is a means for transforming xml documents into something else - that something else more often than not being another well structured document probably also formatted as xml though i ve used xslt to render xml to csv and plain ish text

740432
xsl-fo	xslt
one would therefore take a load of data in say an xml format and then use xslt to convert that data into a document consisting of xsl-fo that in turn is rendered using an appropriate tool in say pdf for print or other means of distribution

740453
instances	private
making the assignment op and usually the copy ctor private and then not implementing them means it is impossible to assign or copy class instances which is desirable behaviour for most business -oriented classes

740460
sortedlist	sorted
if you don t need to enumerate the widget in sorted order don t use the sortedlist it will be slower than the dictionary o n log n insertion deletion retrieval vs

740462
client-server	webserver
that s not to say a webserver wouldn t be able to cope just that it would not be an efficient client-server match

740468
communication	messages
we needed to communication with the server every few seconds and ended up using ultra-lightweight json messages to save on bandwidth and keep it snappy

740470
python	java
most languages give guidelines to separate different words of a name by underscores python c etc. or by camel-casing java

740498
defined	declare
it simply means that the function has been declare but not defined

740507
arrays	loops
another simple way out would be to save the winnable positions as a data in an arrays and use a loops to check all possible winning conditions instead of multiple ifs statements

740518
python	c++
i think what you want to use is oechem for c++ that s open eye...there is a python library too

740534
postgresql	mysql
the only case in which a database would be better is if you have a system where multiple users are interacting with and updating a central data repository and for a case like that you d be looking at a database server like mysql postgresql or sql server for both speed and concurrency

740535
callback	methods
i updated the callback methods from the dev forums post to the following

740538
contains	elements
this means you can listen for events starting on contains elements or on children elements

740541
contains	any
in fact i encrypt any section that may contains user credentials

740544
updatepanel	datalist
i have an .aspx page and form then ajax updatepanel inside it there is my datalist datalist1 that has an edititemtemplate that has the following

740544
object-reference	instances
so of course i m getting object-reference not set to an instances of an object for the fileupload and the label

740544
object-reference	instances
but of course this is throwing the object-reference not set to an instances of an object error

740548
32-bit	64bit
installing the x64 package for .net 3.5 will install both the 64bit and 32-bit frameworks

740558
primitive	int
create a data type in a visual-studio database project c# which internally stores the value as a primitive type int float string etc. but constrains the values it can be constructed with

740558
constructor	object
for example if you had a score type the constructor would throw an error if the value is outside the range of 0 to 100 ensuring that only valid score object can exist

740577
pointers	stack
if so how does the compiler calculate how to move stack pointers if one of the smaller datatype of the union is active

740595
exception-handling	try-catch
put a try-catch around the actual code where the exception-handling is occurring if it s in response to a button click handled by an actionlistener put the try-catch inside your actionperformed methods

740612
windows-server	windows
why haven t you look at windows media server comes with windows-server 2003 and up

740612
google-chrome	firefox
it is supported on most browsers ie firefox google-chrome and stream live video feeds

740641
groovy	java
here is a list of items that are valid java 6 but not valid groovy 1.6

740647
struct	unions
this is why unions usually make sense inside a struct that has a flag that indicates which is the active member

740658
constructor	object
what are the differences between the two and when would you use an object initializer over a constructor and vice-versa

740662
constructor	object
a constructor is a defined method on a type which takes a specified number of parameters and is used to create and initialize an object

740662
constructor	object
an object initializer is code that runs on an object after a constructor and can be used to succinctly set any number of fields on the object to specified values

740662
constructor	object
you would use a constructor without the help of an object initializer if the constructor sufficiently set the initial state of the object

740662
constructor	object
an object initializer however must be used in conjunction with a constructor

740662
constructor	object
the syntax requires the explicit or implicit use vb.net and c# of a constructor to create the initial object

740662
constructor	object
you would use an object initializer when the constructor does not sufficiently initialize the object to your use and a few simple field and or property sets would

740665
output	cat
it fires off cat in the background to feed data from files supplied on the command-line and then we use exec to replace the scripting s stdin with the output from cat

740665
stdin	pipe
this requires sort of the opposite process converting the scripting s stdin into a file actually a named pipe whose name can be passed to the command

740665
stdin	pipe
this uses to launder the scripting s stdin through cat to a named pipe which is then passed to command as an argument

740666
constructor	object
as you can see an object initializer allows you to specify values for public fields and public settable properties at the same time construction is performed and that s especially useful when the constructor doesn t supply any overload initializing certain fields

740667
document	element
in general you shouldn t treat the loaded element as a new page and call the document .ready

740667
callback	methods
all ajax methodss feature a callback methods that is invoked when the data are successfully loaded

740668
constructor	object
if you have properties that must be set on your object for it to work properly one way is to expose just a single constructor which requires those mandatory properties as parameters

740669
click	mouse
involves click with a mouse

740671
superclass	subclass
then you can make later versions of the cards be new subclasses of card the stuff that stays the same is in the superclass the varying parfts are the subclass s business

740682
constructor	object
constructor run given 0 or more parameters and are used to create and initialize an object before the calling method gets the handle to the created object

740682
constructor	object
in general it s considered good practice to have a constructor require the parameters needed in order to completely setup an object so that it s impossible to create an object in an invalid state

740682
constructor	object
also object initializers are simpler to read especially when you set multiple values so they give you the same benefit as many overloads on the constructor without the need to have many overloads complicating the api for that class

740683
compact-framework	.net
it is an msdn blog post about fixing exception messages on the .net compact-framework 3.5

740686
contains	any
note one special guarantee is made in order to simplify the use of unions if a pod-union contains several pod-structs that share a common initial sequence 9.2 and if an object of this pod-union type contains one of the pod-structs it is permitted to inspect the common initial sequence of any of pod-struct members

740686
having	union
storing such a flag in addition to the union for example having a struct with an integer as the type-flag and an union as the data-store will give you a so called discriminated union an union which knows what type in it is currently the active one

740687
16-bit	8bit
this means that even though you re outputting 16-bit data the effective resolution is only 8bit

740704
http	ssl
as it s internal you don t need a paid ssl certificate if cost is the reason for avoiding http - i can t think of any other good reasons - you should be able to use a self-signed one

740711
decrement	increment
when the ack packet is returned with the sequences number increment they can decrement it and get the information back

740711
sctp	tcp
note that sctp implements a 4-way handshake with cookies built into the protocol to protect against syn floods while allowing more information to be stored in the cookie and thus not having to limit the protocol features supported because the size of the cookie is too small in tcp you only get 32 bits of sequence number to store all of the information

740716
document	element
css offset gets the current offset of the first matched element in pixels relative to the document

740721
synchronous	.when
.when a multicast delegate is invoked the delegates in the invocation list are called synchronous in the order in which they appear

learn how to write a kernel filesystems driver buy a license from ms develop the driver and use it to make changes to a live filesystems

740748
google-chrome	firefox
it shows up fine in firefox google-chrome

740751
xsd	xml
been wondering just as we use the -declaration to bind xml to a dtd how do we do it with xsd

740755
erlang	lisp
are there fewer vigorous complaints about the readability of erlang lisp syntax because there is only one way to write code in them

740768
base-class	inherited
i am kind of mid core developer so i was thinking of base-class inherited interfaces what do you think

740773
directory	folder
i deleted the folder library application support iphone simulator in my user directory

740784
hide	show
i m using css hover to do my show hide if that s relevant

740787
gridview	formview
for controls such as the gridview detailsview and formview controls data-binding expressions are resolved automatically during the control s prerender event

740791
hotmail	gmail
a new feature i wish to add to our local network is the ability to retrieve email from free email services such as gmail yahoo and hotmail using php

740808
xsd	xml
just as we use the -decleration to bind xml to a dtd how do we do it with xsd

740808
xsd	xml
post-dtd you can take an xml document and validate it with xsd or relax ng or some other mechanism - they are decoupled in theory at least

740814
application-pool	iis-manager
left click the virtual directory in iis-manager then on the far right of the screen click on advanced settings the application-pool is at the top of the list there

740823
uitableview	uiview
should i subclass uiview and add the class to my uitableview then use drawatpoint

740826
google-chrome	firefox
i also read about plug-ins for firefox and google-chrome that supposedly support activex but they aren t native

740845
message	alert
i don t want to show any message or alert to user they have exceeded the limit

740847
authentication	login
you then need to make sure only authentication users are able to login to the server

740873
superclass	subclass
i was wondering if there s a language feature in java in which methods of a superclass would be invisible for members of a subclass

740873
instances	private
either that or you can keep a private instances of a and have something like this

740887
value	field
bit field are wasteful because if you use 3 bits each you ll waste some value you could never set 6 or 7 even though you have room to store them

740890
put	get
i understand that i need to put or do something within set to get it to send the update value from the class back into the form1 class so that it can update the label

740891
double-quotes	single-quotes
in javascript it doesn t seem to matter whether you use single-quotes or double-quotes when writing strings

740897
datagrid	listbox
if i add an item to an itemcontrol such as a listbox or datagrid like this

740898
perl	php
in some scripting languages shell perl ruby and php single-quoted strings do not support character escapes except in some languages to escape the quote and backslash characters nor variable interpolation

740907
hotmail	gmail
yahoo gmail and hotmail all support pop3 a standard protocol for retrieving email

740909
swing	awt
i have to say that i m not so happy with swing and awt in java

740912
groovy	java
you might want to look at groovy it provides a nice dynamic wrapper around java which makes doing gui work a little easier and can leverage your existing java knowledge

740919
python	tcl
if tcl s not your thing there are tk bindings for other languages for example python and ruby

740919
perl	tcl
for more on tk you might want to check out tkdocs which shows examples in tcl ruby and perl

740934
python	c++
qt is becoming quite popular particularly for c++ and python

740950
postgresql	mysql
sqlite just does not scale anywhere near as far as apache etc with mysql postgresql

740950
ruby-on-rails	django
is it me or are ruby-on-rails and django difficult to install on windows

740950
postgresql	mysql
plenty of folks install django with mysql postgresql and other databases every day on windows and nix systems

740978
object-pascal	pascal
also as it based on pascal you will be concentrated on gui and not in the language itself because object-pascal is really easy and i think the course you are going to take will have emphasis in this gui not languages details

740979
python	ruby
python and ruby can already run on both vms or neither have big communities and big libraries and seem to be about the same level of abstraction but are far more mature

740993
any	set
i tried to get the device context dc of the windows and set the background brush to wx.transparent_brush but that doesn t seem to have any effect

741038
mstest	nunit
mark the test with the expectedexceptionattribute this is the term in nunit or mstest

741066
exception-handling	try-catch
in these cases i wrap it in a try-catch block that expects the exact exception does an assert.fail if the code succeeds and also catches generic exception-handling to make sure that a different exception is not thrown

741071
onchange	keyup
the keyup won t prevent a right click paste operation that could go over the limit- you may want to set the value onchange or onblur as well as on the keystroke

741099
gridview	formview
the code you pointed out refers to a formview however i am tring to change it to a gridview

741117
reflection	runtime
like in c# there is runtime support by using reflection getting an object describing the types used to instantiate a generics

741117
required	checked
it s not even required to a c++ compiler that the templates is syntactically checked for validity

741117
base-class	inherited
c# as far as i know it can constraint the parameter to implement an interface or inherited a base-class

741128
factors	primes
this xpath 2.0 expression defines the maximum primes factors of a natural number

741128
factors	primes
to pronounce it in english the maximum primes factors of a number pnum is the number itself if pnum is primes otherwise if vdiv1 and vdiv2 are two factorss of pnum then the maximum primes factors of pnum is the bigger of the maximum primes factorss of vdiv1 and vdiv2

741128
factors	primes
how do we use this to actually calculate the maximum primes factors in xslt

741129
keyboard	mouse
the clipboard in response to a keyboard or mouse event makes this

741187
expression-blend	silverlight
you may want to checkout expression-blend which is microsoft s product for creating rich user interfaces in silverlight

741190
for-loop	arrays
how would i store a pointer in the classobject arrays within my while for-loop

741192
http-delete	get
if you delete a resource with http-delete and it succeeds 200 ok and then you try to delete that resource n number of times you should get back a success message 200 ok for each and every one of those delete calls

741192
http-delete	get
if you delete a resource with http-delete and it succeeds 200 ok and then you try to delete that resource again you should get back an error message 410 gone because the resource was deleted

741199
.net	wcf
how to create an end-to-end mobile gps tracking application using the .net compact framework wcf linq silverlight deep zoom and virtual earth

741199
compact-framework	.net
inspired by a true-story mobility case study recently published on the microsoft.com website this session will walk you through how to create a mobile gps tracking application using the .net compact-framework windows mobile sdk and compact sql

741199
webserver	host
at the web host layer we will create a windows communication foundation service and generate a compact-framework client proxy to send the gps tracks to a host webserver - where finally the gps trail can then be viewed using linq silverlight deep zoom and virtual earth

741207
subtract	add
add up their widths and subtract them from the width of the panel

741214
managed-code	c++-cli
if that s the case you really should look at c++-cli which lets you easily use managed-code .net from c++

741220
buffering	streaming
if you have the address of the buffering you re writing to the streaming can you just copy into that

741230
organization	naming
as for the naming and organization of unit tests standards are changing quite a bit especially with some of the bdd styles that are popping up

741235
telnet	ssh
some networks have the policies to block telnet connections packets on the premise that they are unencrypted and only allow ssh

741250
jquery	dojo
i know dojo has a wizard in dojox namespace and i m pretty sure there are wizards for jquery

741254
any	set
i need to be able to set any reasonable starting time and have it count forward depending on a timer internal to the program

741257
lwjgl	jogl
otherwise there are numerous high-quality 3d apis available for java eg jmonkeyengine or ogre3d or you can always use lowlevel apis such as jogl and lwjgl

741265
host	dns
i m a newbie at dns and would like to know how to point a domain to a host when the domain and hosting are from different sites

741301
subtract	add
however for compression then i need to subtract these 128 bit values and for decompression i need to add these values

741309
transient	entity
a socket that your program has access to is a transient entity that will be relinquished

741315
click	mouse
if one div is click by mouse everything is ok

741321
constructor	object
i guess you want to construct a classtype object by passing const char as the constructor parameter

741334
boolean	int
my db have some fields using int data type but after ss generated them all of them re boolean db type

741341
subtraction	addition
although i should warn you for anything more complicated than addition and subtraction and shifts you ll need to use non-trivial algorithms

741341
subtract	add
to add and subtract you can create a class structure that holds two 64-bit integers

741341
subtraction	addition
you can use simple school math to do the addition and subtraction

741341
subtract	add
basically do what you do with a pencil and paper to add or subtract with careful consideration to carries borrows

741343
javascript	dom
why a alert can affect the dom and javascript

741345
authentication	login
i m using the zend-framework and the openid selector from - however i find i can t login using sites like google and yahoo as they use direct identity based login system whereby one is just redirected to a url as opposed to entering a unique url of their own for authentication

741345
authentication	login
in the case of yahoo and google - you don t enter a unique url instead you are redirected to the providors login site and upon login and authentication you are redirected back - so basically whats happeining is that the zend_openid object when it parsing to tell who the providor is it fails to tell from the general url itself

741348
exception-handling	error-handling
similar problems can result if error-handling code triggers exception-handling

741348
handler	service
all event handler public component functions and service methods should catch all exceptions that occur

741350
virtualbox	vmware
if you don t have the cash for vmware if you do it s the best money can buy try virtualbox

741351
groovy	java
as greg above points out languages like clojure and groovy target the jvm for one main reason so that java developers can have the best of both worlds

741354
keyboard	mouse
the definition of the focus action is to bring the input keyboard or mouse to a certain element usually an input-field

741371
subtraction	addition
if all you need is addition and subtraction and you already have your 128-bit values in binary form a library might be handy but isn t strictly necessary

741371
unsigned	integer
i don t know what your compiler uses for 64-bit types so i ll use int64 and uint64 for signed and unsigned 64-bit integer quantities

741373
shell	bash
the m-x compile command calls out to a shell linux bash windows cmd.exe etc to run the make command

741373
shell	bash
if you want your m-x compile to use a different shell probably cygwin bash in your case then you need to tell emacs through changing shell-file-name variable or using the shell environment variable

741383
order	join
selected from users left join updates on users.remote_id updates.owner_id order by updates.time desc limit 50

741386

i expect you can upgrade from the standard versioning though

741413
asp.net-mvc	wcf
i am developing an application which includes a wcf service and its asp.net-mvc client

741413
asp.net-mvc	wcf
so somewhere inside an asp.net-mvc controller i call wcf service s method that returns me an arrays of products that i need to display

741414
triggers	insert
i need to write an insert update triggers on table a which will delete all rows from table b whose one column say desc has values like the value inserted updated in the table a s column say col1

i d like to show popup menu when user right clicks on the cells of the table and take appropriate action when an option is selected from the menu

741424
firefox	opera
when i was testing it through opening the file with firefox opera it worked

741432
mbunit	nunit
look at visual c# express for your ide and compiler ndoc for your documentation mbunit or nunit for unit-testing and i believe c# express will handle deployment as well

741435
triggers	insert
triggers have special insert and deleted tables to track before and after data

741435
triggers	insert
look for insert in create triggers

741435
triggers	insert
after comment this answer is only for insert and updated triggers

741435
triggers	insert
obviously delete triggers can not have always rows in insert as i said above

741443
contains	any
you want to be able to do the equivalent of a reinterpret_cast with relative safety so long as the struct does not contains any fields which are themselves reference-type

741454
controller	routes
you have two routes one is the empty string no parameters which matches controller home action index

741454
controller	routes
unfortunately this means you have to manually add new routes for each new controller action like i showed above which is a pain

741454
controller	routes
under these routes if asp.net-mvc sees a controller name like home it will check the first route find that it doesn t match the regular expression and move to the next one

741474
httpconnection	downloading
if you are downloading the file with http you can use an httpconnection with the if-modified-since request header

741480

the code below relies on using the new error-handling to pass back the error result set via exception-handling raiserror

741589
worksheet	excel
as far as i can see what you want is some 3rd party script or a vba script in the excel worksheet to do the copy pasting for you

741589

if the detail resultset is sorted on master id the last loop could be optimized to only lookup each master once from the dictionary

741643
buffering	capture
so is there any way to screen capture a windows which is obscured or partly off screen by directly reading these buffering

741650
hide	show
if you app requires full screen game etc then hide the status bar during game mode and show during setup start main screen etc

741669
javascript	dom
what data do you want do display and in which format is this data is it form data javascript objects dom objects etc

741683
access-control	authentication
i use custom authentication filtering to implement role- and owner-based access-control

741702
double	int
to get your intended effect cast the int to a double before the division

741710
put	get
i want to get all this record and put

741711
put	get
therefore a replacement for your fetch get put would be

741720

does anyone know a dom inspector javascript library or plugin

741721
attributes	properties
unfortunately you can t use delegates as properties for attributes

741746
udp	tcp
we develop a network library that uses tcp and udp sockets

741758
debugging	trace
compile your dlls and executables in debugging attach a debuggingger and make sense of the stack trace you get

741772
bufferedreader	printwriter
even better might be to change both to use printwriter and bufferedreader like the example client-server pair in sun s socket tutorial

741775
void	main
i would like a methods that given a class object will invoke the main methods that is to say public static void main on that class if it exists and capture the console output of that main methods

741776
base-class	inherited
- create a base-class that both these user-controls inherited from and in the base calass you can define your properties that the controls should interact through

741790

so it will setup various parts of the system - like setting up interrupt handler or interrupt service routines

741799
stderr	stdout
the process class provides the necessary methods to capture stdout stderr and or stdin

741824
authentication	login
we are not really wanting to do this with intergrated login as we do the adminstrators we are looking at sql authentication

741838
32-bit	64bit
you could also consider putting input limitations for your program and having a different one for 32-bit and 64bit systems

741857
interpolation	splines
i have used cubic splines for interpolation before however i need something a lot more feasable for a data-set that varies between 0.0 and 1.0 quite aggressively

741865
tcsh	bash
i am sorry i can t provide tcsh but there is a bash idiom

741866
raw-sockets	packets
windows-xp sp2 and later no longer support sending tcp packets over raw-sockets

741879
account	api
i haven t looked at the api myself but if you have an adc account you should have a look at the api

741894
value	field
asp.net won t send the value and the field will get a new guid

741896
populate	row
depending on the complexity of the query required to populate the table and the quantity of the data in the table you can poll to get the complete data set back and rebuild the table if necessary or poll for the latest updated row and then issue a query for the complete dataset if this has changed

741902
attributes	properties
for example if you want to get entities where a related entity has a particular properties value using the attributes decorated entity will allow linq to generate the sql to pull just those matching values from the database

741908
children	nodes
that way if you don t distinguish between right and left children if your tree is considered the same if a nodes s counterpart has one child regardless of right or left child you can handle that at that time

741916
attributes	properties
yes you can but you have to apply the same attributes as the linq2sql generated properties

741923
children	tree
blank cells correspond to left or right children that don t exist defining the structure of the tree

741929
swing	swt
i m a total noob in swt just getting started but i have previously worked with gui frameworks such as swing

741929

http	ssl
curl supports ssl certificates http post http put ftp uploading http form based upload proxies cookies user+password authentication basic digest ntlm negotiate kerberos... .

741950
required	checked
the functions all have different amount of arguments required so currently to checked if the user entered the correct amount of arguments needed for each function i placed the required amount inside the dictionary case statement in the form

741957
arguments	default
get the names and default value of a functionâ s arguments

741957
arguments	default
a tuples of four things is returned arguments vararguments varkw default

741957
default-arguments	arguments
defaults is a tuples of default arguments values or none if there are no default-argumentss

741967
any	set
as someone else pointed out on 32-bit windows platforms the limit on virtual memory is 2 gigabytes unless you set the special flag for 3 gigabytes and can ensure that all the pointers both in your code and any libraries you use only use unsigned pointers

741967
32-bit	64bit
so either forcing users to 64bit or monitoring your virtual memory and capping your max block size to something that comfortably fits inside the limits imposed by 32-bit operating systems would be my advice

741980
any	set
if you name a page x y the link will be wiki x y which means you can set access rights in any good proxy like apache based on directory

742004
persistence	hibernate
i have configured two persistence units in my jpa hibernate configuration

742013
python	java
edit due to the ongoing interest in this topic i ve published an efficient solution to github with implementations for javascript php python and java

742013
contains	any
instead of abcdef there can be any other string with six characters contains a-z a-z and 0-9

742013
hash	md5
hash algorithms like md5 create too long strings

742042

we need a way for people to edit text that turns into vml svg when rendered but remains editable with minimal styling such as bold italic font face and size and if possible ability to create a text region anywhere on the canvas

742047
division	modulo
this requires use of integer division and modulo

742060
any	set
set up your clean sp environment anew without any service packs updates patches etc

742076
protected	public
in my opinion hiding them is tantamount to hiding public protected private keyword in methods signatures or any other component of the language

742082
contains	elements
the union members would contains elements that are appropriate for either requests or responses but not both

742088
contains	any
it hasn t changed in four or five years from the cvs repository and doesn t seem to contains any documentation

742095
scala	java
java works better than c or c++ but it still requires many more lines of code to implement an application than scala does

742096
hash	md5
i have read and re-read the code and i don t understand how i use those functions to turn example into a md5 hash

742097
methods	extend
and i want to call a methods with its parent class name when i extend my super class to any class

742100
defined	declare
however it is a good practice to make every function in c static until you can demonstrate that it is needed outside its source file and then you ensure that there is a header that declare the function and that header is used in the file that defined the function and in every file that uses the function

742109
nsbitmapimagerep	ciimage
how can i make my ciimage finite after an ciaffinetransform so i can pass it to nsbitmapimagerep initwithciimage

742110
subtract	add
to ease that computation i would suggest you get the pre-aggregated annual data per utc time and the subtract aggregate data for the first for 4.5 hours of the year and add aggregate data for the first 4.5 hours of the next year

742112
pascal	delphi
when designing aspects of the delphi object pascal language oop object oriented programming had been in the mainstream for several years

742112
pascal	delphi
delphi s object pascal language isn t the only language to recognize this problem

742121
getter	setter
is this a reasonable way to handle getter setter in a php class

742134
execute	prepare
pdostatement execute works with parameters markers so you have to construct query before calling pdo prepare

742145
macports	fink
launch is in fink and macports too

742157
heuristics	a-star
a good heuristics for a-star with the 15 puzzle is the number of squares that are in the wrong location

742157
heuristics	a-star
because you need at least 1 move per square that is out of place the number of squares out of place is guaranteed to be less than or equals to the number of moves required to solve the puzzle making it an appropriate heuristics for a-star

742165
arrays	map
instead of using a bit map to track hash occurrences use an integer arrays instead - either byte 16 bit 32 bit or even 64 bit depending on your input size

742178
json	xml
ajax calls and results must contain only json or xml formatted data not html

742179
linux	unix
i ve tried all the unix linux based solutions and the results were not so great

742193
switching	screens
i would also provide a simple way to switching from full screens to windows for instances by pressing esc and another way to go back to full screens

742210
javascript	dom
does anyone know of a dom inspector javascript library or plugin

742211
malloc	free
it s a plugins replacement for malloc new and free

742216
javascript	dom
how about firebug lite - it s like firebug but you insert it into your page and so you can debug your html css javascript and the dom on most browsers including non-ff ones

742217
javascript	dom
you can browse a page s html javascript dom network activity etc

742227
database-table	mysql
mysql has 4 levels of collation server database-table column

742258
spaces	output
for example if the output file starts with check sum size of the data leave spaces on the first pass and seek write to that spaces later

742288
command-line	cmd
if you post the cmd you are running from the cmd-line we will be able to point you on the right direction but most likely you are just missing a classpath parameter

742321
base-class	inherited
the basis of the system is that a specific directory apppath plugins will have a bunch of precompiled dlls and i want to look through each one with reflection and for every class available if it inherited a specific base-class this is defined in yet another dll but i ll go into that later then create an instance of it and call a specific function in said instance

742322
put	get
the simpler you make it and more trust you put in your devs the less hampered your devs will feel and more likely to just get on with it

742338
any	bag
it doesn t appear like you can tap into any events when .update is called on the property bag when title is updated

742369
tracking	robot
i have a robot that uses an optical mouse as a positioning tracking

742369
tracking	robot
basically as the robot moves it is able to tracking change in x and y directions using the mouse

742369
tracking	robot
so the movement of the robot is ideally in straight lines although the mouse tracking can pickup deviations if you veer off at particular angles

742369
cosine	sine
a friend provided an idea that i could continuously sine and cosine the mouse value and calculate the final vector but i m not really sure how this would work

742374
boost	stl
the only solution i know of is to implement something similar to the apache pool you allocate a block of memory and have your allocator which you give to stl or to boost work inside this pool

742376
implements	abstract
another option is to mimic abstract function as show here q can you implements abstract-class in python in 0 lines of code

742383
contains	elements
the returns a slice of x which happens to contains all its elements and is thus effectively a copy of x

742400
switching	screens
how can you switching to the emacs manual such that i can roll down the screens by c-v

742418
contains	set
by windows i mean a windows manager object with a title bar and decorations and all that while frame means a part of a whole windows set off to contains a single buffer

742422
base	zero
this is a bad habit you will also zero out virtual pointers and pointers to virtual base when using memset with a complex class

742434
instances	destroy
however if your vector2 class has any virtual methods and the usual mechanism is used to represent them by your compiler then that memset will destroy the vtable and break the instances by setting the vtable pointers to null

742438
display	width
if you float the iframe to the right of the ul then the content of the ul will be able to fill the full width when it is removed or the display style is set to none

742440
command-line	cmd
i ve noticed that last time i m making very tricky manipulations with unit-tests cmd-line test runner --filter cmd

742452
subclassing	base-class
arguments checking is handled by the command subclassing themselves using properly defined general methods form the command base-class

742453
python	java
1 first you will have to adapt your website to the gae framework python with django or the new java environment

742469
freebsd	netbsd
reference freebsd netbsd openbsd and os x manual pages

742481
puts	gets
autorelease pools are kept as a stack if you make a new autorelease pool it gets added to the top of the stack and every autorelease message puts the receiver into the topmost pool

742482
scheme	lisp
with the thousands of implementations of lisp and scheme available i m having a very hard time finding just the right one to use for windows development

742482
scheme	lisp
what is a scheme or lisp implementation with the following requirements

742504
racket	scheme
a fairly complete usable and free scheme implementation is racket formerly known as plt scheme

742521
dictionary	arrays
i m writing an iphone application with json and am trying to turn json strings into objects not dictionary or arrays

742525
rhino-mocks	typemock
i don t use rhino-mocks but i think it is not possible to mock static-methods with any .net mocking framework except typemock

742541
windows-mobile	symbian
they support android windows-mobile blackberry and symbian which covers almost all smartphones

742553
filtering	grouping
at the moment i m doing a simple select with the filtering applied grouping by day and it s running pretty well but i was wondering if there s a smarter more efficient way to extract such data

742565
triggers	insert
since you wouldn t want to do it manually but automatically create a triggers on mv6.posts so that update occurs on mv5.posts automatically when you insert into mv6.posts

742579
erlang	scala
erlang scala clojure are languages that might suit you

742586
expression	evaluation
so all you need to do is iterate through all 19683 cases each time building a string for that case and evaluation the expression

742586
expression	evaluation
evaluation the expression is a straightforward task

742616
children	nodes
in addition you could write a super-naive algorithm to confirm this isomorphism by attempting all possible mapping functions and ensuring that for every nodes in the first tree that gets mapped to a nodes in the other the corresponding mapping happens with the parent and with the two children

742625
tokenize	parsing
that is why when you are trying to tokenize and parsing a large file parsingr is expected to be used while regex can simply find special pattern s inside the file

742649
expression	evaluation
ghc provides several methods to leverage multiple hardware execution units ranging from traditional semaphores and mutexes to channels with lightweight threads which could be used to implement an actor model like erlang to software transactional memory to pure functional parallel expression evaluation with strategies and experimental nested data parallelism

742670
buffering	streaming
part of the problem you are experiencing may be due to the fact that printf can have streaming buffering so it may not actually change the file and hence be visible to the other process when expected

742698
linked-list	arrays
a sorted linked-list or sorted arrays for that matter is also isomorphic to those since in that case no information would be lost in the transformations between the two

742698
any	bag
if the binary-tree was used in a manner where sort order was irrelevant a bag sort of container then the information would just be the contents in any order and all the following would be isomorphic that second last one s just a bag the last is a list

742717
unique	words
usually you want to keep the sentences that have words that are more unique to that article

742730
codeigniter	kohana
kohana and codeigniter both have encode_php_tags

742732
verilog	hdl
when learning any sort of hdl verilog vhdl... it is important to keep one thing in mind

742741
ftp	scp
and writing across networks using rcp scp ftp or ftp+ .netrc scp fetch

742760
codeigniter	kohana
since kohana does not use eval for templates it is possible that it is just left over from codeigniter days

742773
pointers	stack
if you are sure that you don t corrupt stack by writing past stack allocated data check for rouge pointers mostly uninitialized pointers

742777
codeigniter	kohana
if you re using other xss preventing methods provided for codeigniter or kohana there s no necessity to use this

742812
button	popup
when you click on the reddit register button a nice windows popup and the rest of the screen goes blackish

742827
z-index	overlay
the div for the login box then has its z-index set to 1001 so that it appears above the div overlay

742829
positioning	slider
hopefully this can be done in a way that in its normal positioning the background extends unseen off to the left enough so that when the view is slider to the right the custom background is still visible across the entire cell

742831
thickbox	jqmodal
all things considered though to have the floating div with the form and such you re going to want to use one of the many plugins already made for this such as thickbox or jqmodal

742851
vba	vb6
strange that this lack of registration does not seem to affect the dll s ability to function other than its discoverability within vb6 s and vba s references dialog

742869
object-reference	instances
i keep getting this error object-reference not set to an instances of an object

742878
user-controls	ascx
here is my full user-controls ascx code

742887
png	gif
also im not sure how to filtering for more than just one type of file ie jpg gif png in the directory info

742892
webserver	host
the usages would be to host my own repositories bazaar svn etc have a small webserver to host a wiki trac for my personal programming projects and a ftp to host files

742896
any	set
the basic idea is to set a upskin style or any other necesary skin for each itemrenderer imagecell instead of all of them as would tilelist.setrendererstyle

742900
versioning	upgrade
has anything changed in the database server versioning upgrade

742910
put	get
how do i get the background image to stay put

742916
attributes	properties
this is because the selecteded properties of a selected dom node differs from the selecteded attributes of the options

742952
.net	wcf
there are a number of ways of doing this but wcf is the best match for .net code

742953
external	host
backup for my vms i use synbackpro to run a timed backup of my project files to a shared folder on my host machine then on the host i have syncbackpro running a timed backup to an external drive

742956
order	add
if it s a global variables you need to add this to the top of the function in order for php to find it

742981
command-line	cmd
so for instance you have a simulation class that has your 3d graphics stuff and then a cmd-line class that has your cmd line

742996
json	xml
part of what objectivesupport does is serializing and deserializing json as well as xml object

743010
implements	super
does that mean i need to implements both initwithnibname bundle and initwithcoder and would each methods call its respective super initializer

743010
designated-initializer	initializer
it seems like this violates the whole designated-initializer convention as there would essentially be 3 separate initializer that don t end up calling a common init methods

743010
designated-initializer	initializer
or is there a way to create a common designated-initializer while supporting the 3 different initializer routes

743020
append	input
i append a text input into form by using javascript after i removed it by removenode it disappear document.forms form .length 0 but i can still get it s obj by using document.forms form inputname not return null

743022
double	int
i have made all those int mess to double

743033
mstest	nunit
in fact if you google around for reactions to mstest you ll find many who think it a ripoff of nunit

743034
any	set
this weigh may have to be looked up from another spherical set but that set will stay static for any given run of the algorithm.

743052
radio-button	selected
i have radio-button list which has id as the value i want to access the selected id in the jquery function

743056
listselectionlistener	listeners
register listeners with the jlist generally you ll want a listselectionlistener

743071
stream	send
socket class have a methods getoutputstream you can use this stream to send a message

743072
reliability	scalability
you can save yourself a lot of trouble and easily add reliability and scalability if you use jms and activemq for your communications rather than mess around with sockets yourself

743094
webforms	asp.net
i ve been developing an asp.net webforms app that needed account login functionality register new users change passwords recover passwords profiles roles etc

743114
any	set
this will set texture coordinates to tile any texture 3x2 times on this surface

743126
push	pull
i would also look at other tools to push pull the data into other formats

743126
perl	ruby
a variant of the above in perl ruby insert favorite scripting language with a dbf library

743151
copy-constructor	constructor
the standard way to define the assignment constructor correctly so that it is exception-handling safe is to define it in terms of the copy-constructor

743151
boost	stl
note you just need to make the swap a no-throw method this is relatively simple if you are using stl objects as they all define a no-throw swap just for this situation as does boost and all good libraries so you should follow suite

743151
temporary	copy
at this point you have not modified your own object as you are copy constructing into a temporary

743160
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
one way is to use nscalendar and nsdatecomponents

743166
revision	svn
run svn info on an item to see it s base revision

743173
udp	tcp
it has lower-level replication mechanisms which can allow you to use udp or tcp multicasting broadcasting replication

743182
exception-handling	try-catch
the try-catch finally approach is widely used in java but hardly ever used in objective-c and is not a preferred approach - you simply do not need it as libraries will not throw exception-handling the way java library calls would and if you are writing your own libraries you should not expect callers will naturally think to look for exception-handling to catch

743182
callback	methods
the convention most widely used and understood is that of a delegate that has an error methods callback or perhaps notifications for more general failures that you need to pass up through multiple levels of code

743191
contains	any
what i want to do is to capture 4th fields in variables as if it doesn t contains any value

743220
buffering	streaming
here is an example if my recorded avi video is 10 mins and now i am playing to the 4th mins and the local buffering streaming media is buffering to the 5th mins i cannot jump to any time after the 5th mins like the 7th mins in windows media player

743220
wmv	asf
i did not face the same issue with other formats like asf wmv

743222
python	ruby
ruby 1.9 may be better but still has a global interpreter lock like python

743222
unsafe	out
if you are writing ruby code where you are considering these sort of potentially unsafe optimizations to wring out some extra performance you should probably consider using another language

743225
scala	java
the fact that there s no buzz around scala on .net compared with the java version isn t encouraging either

743229
wmv	flv
for example flv wmv ogg theora etc

743244
postgresql	oracle
remember that oracle s implementation is closer to postgresql than to sybase genesis of ms sql server so performance will be different for each on different tasks.if you can avoid the hustle of tweak for performance on systems that can swap able back-ends go for least common denominator if you need to work with both

743267
animated-gif	watermark
essentially im looking to watermark animated-gif files as well as have the ability to cull frame out of animation every 2nd 3rd frame to be removed for example

743271
csv	xml
files xml files and csv files as

743285
scala	java
i think that idea is key a lot of clojure programmers use clojure because they love lisp not because they hate java whereas a lot of scala programmers not all but a lot use scala not because they love object-oriented functional languages but because they don t want to use java

743287
bison	yacc
but that s not something i d ever suggest to anyone who hasn t had to write compilers or parsing before without the benefit of lex yacc bison or other similar tools

743290
worksheet	excel
i work on a product that loads a file into the excel worksheet

743316
declarative	imperative
it s not an imperative language i guess so that means it s some sort of declarative functional language but i m no expert in language taxonomy so what should the d language officially or semi-officially be classified as

743321
pointers	stack
is it good to send stack allocated object as a pointers parameter to some other function

743326
pointers	stack
in case the call is asynchronous the function you called passes the pointers to a different thread then it will definitely creates issues as you might try to access the memory address from the different thread even after stack allocated object is destoryed

743346
triggers	insert
i was wondering how to triggers a notification if a new record is insert into a database using php and mysql

743358
margins	padding
in the end i found out that i prefer the layout as viewed by css â padding margins floats blocks inlines etc

743372
having	select
what will happen is that the linux scheduler will now be able to select two or more up to four postgresql threads processes to run all at the same time basically they are working in parallel rather than having to wait on each other to get a slice of cpu time

743403
function-call	inline
3rd it s not very likely to incur the overhead of an extra function-call since the empty -function is probably inline in both of the implementations

743407
implements	abstract
methods and therefore your class is abstract until you implements or subclass and then implements the missing methodss

743419
contains	any
of course the deserialized object would contains only data not any of the php methods

743420
children	nodes
element nodes contain text nodes as children and it is these nodes that contain the values you want

743430
json	xml
the two most obvious examples are xml and json

743434
getter	setter
but i want a simple property getter and setter pair int getoneid void setoneid int on the many domain-object rather than the associations methods that hibernate would ordinarily expect me to provide one getone void setone one

743438
zend-studio	komodo
i ve been using zend-studio for a while now but tonight i shifted to komodo

743438
plugins	add-on
komodo has a plugins you need to actually add-on even before you can access remote folders in a way that allows simple browsing point and click edit and save functionality

743445
cross-compiling	toolchain
i use it on xp alongside gcc from the mingw project as well as with several different embedded systems cross-compiling toolchain

743445
environment	building
we do use cygwin for a couple of projects in particular one where the system-on-a-chip vendor provided a complete working toolchain and building environment hosted in cygwin

743445
shell	bash
this started as a fork of cygwin by the mingw developers and it intends to provide a minimal set of unix-like tools with a bash shell so that configure can be used on windows

743445
arguments	default
each line of an action is a miniature shell scripting that is in the language of the default shell which might be cmd.exe rather than bin sh on windows and each command has options and arguments

743445
environment	building
if you are comfortable with your nix building environment then cygwin might be the path of least pain

743472
python	java
there are some reasons though why it s not in the same league with java python c# ruby etc

743472
python	ruby
dynamic programming languages such as javascript ruby and python have taken over some big chunks of the language market making it harder for compile-time-type-checking-languages to find an audience

743472
scala	java
most new jvm-languages such as scala are compatible with already-written java code

743485
superclass	inherited
have subclasses inherited from the superclass for each actual payment

743517
data-members	constructor
marking a const data-members will ensure that the data-members can only be initialized in the initialization list of the constructor and can t be changed

743524
json	xml
e.g xml json etc

743554
textbox	button
is it possible to make a program that open a page as if a bookmark file were opened by ie and based on its content generate a feedback that should be fedback in a textbox on said page by pressing a button on said page

743560
rhino-mocks	nmock
this kind of functionality is tested using nmock or rhino-mocks in which a mock object is created which is in tern equser-interfacevalent of your user-interface object and its mocked to have functionality of your user-interface component which is used to test the functionality you would expect the user-interface component object to pass

743576
textbox	button
when i click a button i need to create some textbox dynamically

743576
textbox	button
the values of the textbox must be entered in the database by clicking a button which should be enerated dynamically below these textbox

743577
shell	bash
the arguments are handled by the shell i assume you are using bash under linux

743591
oodbms	rdbms
does anyone have any ideas suggestions for an orm and or experience migrating from an oodbms to rdbms

743594
boost	stl
is there a good implementation in stl or boost that anyone can point me too

743598
oodbms	rdbms
it might be possible that an oodbms - rdbms migration tool exists but i m not aware of any

743632
bug-tracking	workitem
it also handles bug-tracking and other workitem tracking

743649
put	get
but when i try and put a filtering into it for the company i will get an error at runtime when the company is null

743654
driver	kernel
kernel side of the driver just loaded value in on irqs

743654
driver	kernel
nice clean separation between your closed driver and the kernel

743659
getter	setter
in this case you could declare these as properties and implements the setter and getter yourself using the objc_ runtime methods above

743669
inlining	inline
if inlining a function duplicates the code in the place the function is called then the static and local-variables are duplicates for each function calling it and if there is only one thread running the function that calls the inline one at the same time then the code is thread-safe

743681
duplicates	contains
there are or perhaps were buggy compilers that duplicates static variables for each inlining of the contains function

743687
contains	elements
you could put the overflow auto onto a contains elements of the inner table cells only.

743697
double	int
i think instance variables are simple data types like int or double

743699
python	java
if you do have some server side logic going on you will need to convert it to either python or java and convert your relational database to google s data api which does not support the sql your current database uses

743701
.net	wcf
there is a design flaw in wcf that makes this about the only place in .net where you should not use a using block

743704
instance-variables	local-variables
if they are both declared and created inside a function they are local-variables and not instance-variables

743711
mouseleave	mouseover
it can easilly be controled by setting some flags on the mouseover mouseenter and mouseleave events

743712
debugging	exit
it annoys me whenever i debugging and found to know that the stored procedure doesn t exit which created and tested some days ago

743716
contains	any
fping is different from ping in that you can specify any number of hosts on the command-line or specify a file contains the lists of hosts to ping

743716
packets	ping
instead of trying one host until it timeouts or replies fping will send out a ping packets and move on to the next host in a round-robin fashion

743735
cos	sin
the test program uses printf to show the result stored at 0x30fa8c but for the second sequences the result is display as -1.#ind the first using cos and sin works fine

743741
sql-server	mysql
if you want to be more or less database-vendor independent you can use the sql standard catalog views called information_schema - they re implemented in sql-server mysql and many other system

743770
python	c++
however i can t decide betweens the various ways of exchanging data between the server c++ and the clients any language but the first reference implementations will be in c++ and python

743770
json	csv
for encoding the data i considered something arbitrarily defined by me something primitive like csv json and xml but i d like some comments regarding ease of use in c++ easy implementations on various languages and understandability by humans

743797
bots	api
it makes sense to me to keep your api for the bots similiar to this rather than duplicating work for yourself

743805
oracle	mysql
database workbench can be use for oracle - sql server and mysql

743819
margins	padding
6 made very sure that the quantity of columns match in all three tables and that all three have the same styles regarding padding margins and borders

743827
javascript	dom
now i m trying to read all the html content of body tag using xml dom in javascript

743852
ms-project	vsto
i ve written a vsto plugins for ms-project 2007 which basically just publishes project data to our sharepoint portal

743866
reflection	runtime
we are having application which load our custom dlls these dlls are implementing some interface on runtime from the root of the application and execute a methods through reflection

743868
deployment	install
we are currently using odp.net 11 s xcopy deployment for all of our .net operations and everything is peachy - we can run on machines with no oracle client previously install

743874
httphandler	httpmodule
you should use response.writefile methods in an httpmodule or httphandler to manually stream the file to the user

743889
put	get
i have a product column and another column is stores where i put in all the stores where it is possible to get this product

743890
moss	wss
features like publishing are only available in moss so your cms localization requirements may not be satisfied with wss

743903
uiimage	nsdata
anybody enlighten me to how i can post nsdata from a uiimage using their api

743906
hide	show
i found resizemode windowstate and windowstyle but none of those properties allow me to hide the close button but show the title bar as in modal-dialog

743926
exception-handling	error-handling
how do you expect to do error-handling if you don t catch exception-handling

743926
exception-handling	error-handling
you simply cannot write an application which both ignores exception-handling and has sufficient error-handling

743932
row	col
. . . row col . . row col . . row col .

743936
exception-handling	try-catch
if this is a windows application then the entry point should always have a try-catch as a last ditch attempt to catch any exception-handling

743939
hash	md5
md5 sha1 or any long hash function seems too heavy for a simple task i am not doing cryptography

743939
python	perl
does hash algorithm in perl python use 32 bit hashes too

743940
exception-handling	try-catch
and while it is true that you should avoid try-catches when they aren t necessary check instead of letting x throw nullreferenceexception you will find that especially on web-applications there are tons of times were try-catch statements are absolutely required because sometimes you will lose connections or the user will do the wrong thing and exception-handling will be thrown whether you like it or not

743943
value	field
if the new key is an identity you simply put the value of the old key in its field and let the database create the new keys

743943
key-value	key
then use the old key-value in the table to update the foreign key fields with something like

743948
textbox	button
i have a .aspx page that contains a textbox and a button

743957
children	nodes
the empty selector says that matches all elements that have no children including text nodes

743985
exception-handling	try-catch
you should have a try-catch around any statement that might throw an exception-handling that you can reasonably handle

743989
authentication	login
different users can login to the application and the specified user can see the data for which he is authentication

743995
constructor	object
you essentially pass in all necessary object in the constructor

744005
contains	elements
the iframe contains a list of draggable elements prototype scriptaculous

744011
webforms	asp.net
use asp.net mvc if you want dynamic creation of elements on your page mvc framework is much better suited for this than webforms are

744027
exception-handling	try-catch
if it is the exception-handling you need you can catch it with a try-catch in the methods calling your methods for instance

744030
checkbox	textbox
this code works for wordml textbox and checkbox

744030
checkbox	textbox
it s index based so just pass in an arrays of strings for all textbox and an arrays of bool s for all checkbox

744042
attributes	properties
i don t know if nh use the same transient annotation attributes as the java version to ignore a properties in persistent operations

744046
punctuation	words
this allows you to filtering out any punctuation you don t want and use only words

744049
textblock	expander
with your workaround i would suggest using a textblock rather than a textbox since you probably don t want the user to be able to edit the text in the expander header

744055
inline-assembly	assembly
when using inline-assembly under msvc one is allowed to jump outside of the assembly block by referencing a label in the c c++ code as explained in this msdn article

744059
constructor	object
to get the current system date simply create a new date object without passing any values to the constructor

744064
subtract	time
you can subtract one from the other to get the difference but unfortunately there is no built in time span class to handle this cleanly

744068
subtract	add
the built in date class handles â œoverflowâ very well this can be used to add or subtract time

744070
constructor	object
it appears that hash cons is the process of hashing a lisp constructor to determine if an object already exists via equality comparison

744080
updating	updates
you re updating data and then immediately replacing some of the data you just updates

744111
logout	login
your application should detect that client_1 is already signed it and restict login for other users from the same browser until logout

744120
enumerator	iteration
that enumerator causes two methods calls per iteration one to and another to

744122
vmware	esx
the suggestion is to buy a high end server install vmware esx and deploy mutiple vms for build tfs database .

744142
textbox	button
3 textbox belong to one button and 2 textbox to the other

744142
textbox	button
how do i trigger a particular button according to the textbox the user was in when he press enter

744152
virtual-machine	vmware
i m trying to roll out a policy in my company where all developers have to work on a virtual-machine vmware workstations that have the dev

744155
uiimage	nsdata
use the uiimagepngrepresentation function or its jpeg equivalent to turn a uiimage into an nsdata

744185
environment	building
if it doesn t you either need to get a faster machines for them or go back to documenting how to setup the building environment

744185
virtualization	vmware
now iirc vmware has a virtualization project called thinapp that transparently puts a os environment onto your local box so you can have several conflicting applications running side-by-side

744188
highlight	selected
all we do is detect which radio input is currently selected and flag the containers li with a selected class thus allowing css to highlight it appropriately

744188
highlight	selected
finally set some styles for our highlight selected item

744199
textbox	button
when the user clicks the asp button it inserts the text from the textbox into my sql database and then redirects back to the page

744206
callback	methods
then you call your actual methods and allow the callback to process the result

744206
callback	methods
one final note a personal stylistic thing but i like lambda expressions rather than generating a whole new methods for the callback

744210
textbox	button
in this situation i would grouping the related textbox and the button in a panel

744211
32-bit	x86
please install a 32-bit x86 operating system

744219
direct3d	directx
direct3d directx

744221
contains	set
if you take a look at the code of set contains you will see it doesn t work well with nested contains at least not in your case

744229
keyboard	mouse
and finally such automation relies on taking control of the entire user-interface including i o devices such as the keyboard and mouse

744231
expression-blend	wpf
i d recommend checking wpf samples that come with microsoft expression-blend

744237
contains	set
we have a set of data that contains articles and the correct entities mentioned within in

744237
aggregate-functions	sum
also there is no product aggregate-functions in sql so of course you can just do sum log x or exp sum log x to get the equivalent of product x

744237
put	get
so if i get a new article in split it up into distinct words and put those words into a big in clause and a potential entity id to test how can i get the naive bayesian probability that the article falls into that entity id s class in sql

744251
google-chrome	firefox
upgrading to firefox or google-chrome

744252
windows-xp	windows
the issue you have started happening when windowss-xp introduced the concept of windows ghosting

744262
bitblt	gdi
i use a rewritten versioning of jeff s user-friendly exception-handling and he uses bitblt from gdi to capture screenshot

744266
perl	ruby
i don t know who marketed perl or python or ruby

744301
submission	contact
also contact your service provider and ask them if they can convert an xml submission to sms on the fly

744308
blacklist	whitelist
the user can whitelist and blacklist addresses as they like

744308
blacklist	whitelist
any addresses that aren t specified can either be handled per message or just default to whitelist or blacklist again user specified

744308
blacklist	whitelist
or should i add a whitelist and blacklist field to each user s profiling model

744331
value	field
i m using cakephp and i want to add a first and last name column to the users table but when i pass through the field value firstname lastname the columns are always left null while the default fields are populate fine

744343
global-variables	call
you could call a function instead of referencing a global-variables

744385
json	xml
go with a format like xml or json instead

744394
svg	vml
one important question first why specifically should the output of the wysiwyg editor be in vml svg

744394
svg	vml
1 if you re intent upon vml svg one library i know that can bring the two together is raphaeljs which has some degree of text support but i m really not sure how sophisticated the degree of manipulation of the text is

744394
html5-canvas	canvas
i would recommend using vml canvas via the excanvas library which allows you to write code using the html5-canvas element which is automagically translated to vml in ie trident browsers in addition to the new canvas-text library

744405
getter	setter
dot syntax works in many places throughout objective-c although it is only considered acceptable for getter and setter

744424
any	set
then i want to remove any duplicates all of these objects are of the same type with an auto_increment int pk but i can t use set because they aren t hashable

744428
panels	grid
inside windows tag there is grid panels it contains several rectangle shapes and few other grid

744430
any	set
is there any way to set my vsm once only

744436
selected	textbox
a user can select items from a list and for each item there is a corresponding text which is displayed in the textbox when the item is selected

744436
textchanged	textbox
my problem is this i use the textchanged event to detect when the user enters some text and i update the internal variables in the event handler however this event handler is called when i programmatically change the values of the textbox too

744451
textchanged	textbox
the textchanged event is invoked whenever the textbox changes its text property which can be achieved via modifying the text property or when the user directly changes the text there are other events which are more likely usable for the scenario you are trying to achieve

744458
message	alert
i cannot work out why the app is crashing when i add the o1votes variables to the alert message though is it something to do with a conflict in holding just a number inside an nsstring

744493
typedef	struct
my usual style for declaring struct in c includes the typedef so i forgot to mention it sorry

744502
typedef	struct
you should probably typedef the struct once in an h file to make it an actual type and then declare instances

744502
typedef	struct
here s a good tutorial on typedef for struct

744516
installation	upgrade
now hacking a joomla installation is not really a good idea since upgrading will become hard and a not upgrade joomla installation is a great security risk

744516
joomla	drupal
but the code legacy of the joomla 1.0 series was strongly flawed and a new player quickly took the momentum drupal

744516
joomla	drupal
in the same time when drupal got strong and popular the joomla 1.0 series had serious security problems

744520
one-to-many	entity
you can see that the membership entity of which user has a one-to-many set is causing some problems

744536
typedef	struct
typedef for struct seemed to be the solution would it be the same for arrays declaration and assignment

744562
value	field
not actually downsides necessarily one is that declaring instance field methods in the constructor creates separate value for each instance

744562
constructor	object
if you make the foo function in the constructor as a per-instance method then once jmath object are created they are independent and the only way to change the foo function is by changing each one

744562
getter	setter
warning the syntax for defining getter setter apparently is not something that ie doesn t implements nicely

744571
benchmarking	profiling
if you re really concerned about performance should should benchmarking profiling the code before you decide to make a design decision based on those performance worries

744599
constructor	object
but it s not a constructor - it s just a static object math.constructor object

744612
web-config	app-config
the external modification updation in application configuration files for .net - app-config web-config - would be applicable at run-time

744628
entity-framework	ado.net
if you have created a website targetting .net 3.5 assuming you have 3.5 sp1 installed then you have the support for ado.net entity-framework in your project

744628
entity-framework	ado.net
this namespace is very essential in developing applications with ado.net entity-framework since it provides you the objects that can handle entities entity queries and query results

744635
return-value	arguments
if the code object has been compiled with exec as the kind arguments eval â s return-value will be none

744643
mousemove	mousedown
if you wish to react before the user removes his finger from the screen listen to mousemove events and check the direction and distance relative to the mousedown event that you require for an action to take place

744644
user-interface	look-and-feel
user-interface changes look-and-feel are relatively easier so if you really have to nail down one thing make sure it s how data is to be organized

744649
udp	tcp
overlay tcp on top of udp as tcp already does

744661
getter	setter
it sounds like it s a very small class empty constructor two fields two setter getter

744670
perl	c++
if the application is the parser then perl will be fine just due to that it will handle everything surrounding it too but if it s integrated directly into a larger application then it s fully possible that you may want to look into something like lex or flex these days this tool generates the parser for you and you can integrate the c c++ code directly into your software

744677
callback	methods
this would be non-trivial but not excruciatingly so if you basically copy and paste the current httpresponse implementation from the standard-library and tweak the begin methods in there to perform some processing or callback when reading from the socket begins

744695
sctp	tcp
if you absolutely need a message-based transport layer protocol where you can turn off some of the tcp reliability features like head-of-line blocking check out sctp

744696
abstract	extends
but that function doesn t appear in the abstract format class and the variables i m working with can be anything that extends format

744701
udp	tcp
reliable udp is not the same as just using tcp

744741
simpledateformat	decimalformat
as patterns actually exist at the leaves of the format hierarchy simpledateformat messageformat choiceformat decimalformat

744754
internet-explorer	google-chrome
browsers including internet-explorer firefox and google-chrome all have different ways of doing some things and there can be the pain of having a pair of code running in some cases if you have some javascript mixed in with the server side code

744757
firefox	gecko
rv 1.9.0.8 gecko 2009032609 firefox 3.0.8 .net

744768
boost	stl
for instance i have tried asking questions about the company s use of things like stl boost 3rd party libs etc. but that only seems to get incrementally closer to the reality of situation you ll find once in it

744772
packets	lan
just arrange things so that there can t be any collisions the #1 source of lost packets on a lan

744772
ethernet	lan
put one client and server on a dedicated ethernet link perhaps a switching between them but no other systems on their private lan

744774
primitive	int
each object that can have these custom properties has a dictionary collection where the string is a unique key to identify the property and object is the value of a primitive type string bool int etc..

744778
silverlight	wpf
at the end i would say that .net frame work is such an amazing world if you know how to use the right tool for the right job then you can make anything you want and more beautifully is that if you use winforms wpf silverlight asp.net or asp.net-mvc there is always many things that you don t have to learn because they are shared among the framework

744782
updating	updates
depends on the time it takes to updates count if its a time consuming process and you infrequently call count i would opt for updating count when you call the function and not every time you modify the collection

744791
implements	extends
note that you don t strictly have to extends java.util.observable - you can implements the design pattern without doing that

744800
buffering	streaming
typical use of them is in read buffering for streaming

744800
common-lisp	lisp
none of the usual common-lisp implementations has a concurrent gc and support for concurrent lisp threads

744817
observers	listener
while this seems like a lot of steps compared to a observers and listener setup

744836
instrumentation	profiling
crack open instrumentation and profiling your code

744837
schema	rdbms
in which case you re just replacing one technology for enforcing data organization rdbms with another xml schema

744844
required	checked
app checked for updates and downloads it if required

744850
shipping	tax
now i would like to have a calculated field on my salesorder object called total that is the total of all the lineitems subtotal fields plus a few other things like tax and shipping but don t worry about that for now

744859
databound	gridview
the gridview gets databound from a method that iterates through an splist with a foreach loop to build a datatable

744860
environment	building
i am trying to implements a nightly building environment for our sharepoint solution that include vs 2008 and vs 2008 extensions for windows sharepoint services 3.0 versioning 1.2

arrays	loops
i m guessing there should be some way of adding elements to the potions arrays and then doing a bulk save at the end i m also not liking hitting the db each time in the loops to get the number of items for the market again

744911
n-gram	words
as for input representation you can try your luck with extraction words and character n-gram

744922
wxwidgets	mfc
these are the kind of guys and gals that would swoon over an mfc or wxwidgets program thinking it was the greatest

744927
command-prompt	cmd
on linux you type this at the cmd-prompt and matlab will run in that same cmd windows in text mode

744951
annotations	mapping
i only have experience with the xml mapping approach with i think is simpler in osgi as i think the annotations way requires aop weaving of some sort and that s another current pain-point with osgi

744964
required	checked
i dont think you will required to checked what cuased the postback because anyway you will load grid once only

744982
blacklist	whitelist
do you have a column whitelist blacklist in your model which prevents those fields to be saved

744995
sql-server	oracle
we are using ssis sql-server 2005 to pull some data from oracle and import it into sql-server

744999

one set shows what the value is set to in the actual object with a blank field if it not set

745017
duplicates	elements
randomly selected a small subset of k elements and look for duplicates first 4 first 8 etc

745023
radix-sort	in-place
well you can do an in-place radix-sort as described here pdf this takes no extra spaces and linear time

745026
default-value	arguments
both of them have a default-value however in the case of ttl the default-value isn t really used it serves more as a marker to find out whether the arguments was passed in or not

745026
default-value	arguments
since the default-value for the ttl parameter is nil this conditional is true if no arguments was passed in for ttl

745026
smalltalk	lisp
ruby inherits blocks from smalltalk but the concept dates all the way back to 1958 to lisp s lambda expressions

745026
expression	evaluation
it means replace the token inside the string with whatever the result of evaluation the expression between the braces

745029
wicket	jsf
i m debating whether to use seam wicket jsf or gwt as the foundation for my presentation layer in a java project

745047
any	set
any internal framework calls after this point will use the current culture set for this thread so for example the convert.todouble call will work here

745047
culture	french
if we set the culture to french canadian

745047
parsing	comma
this will work and correctly parsing the string because the default decimal separator for the french canadian culture is a comma

745049
gnome	kde
it seems to detect if kde or gnome are running and if not decides not to bother

745060
configuration	environment
to handle the configuration imho is to have the client code tell you what environment you re in

745065
bellman-ford	dijkstra
they support finding shortest paths using various well know algorithms such as bellman-ford and dijkstra they also have a complete javadoc available online

745137
font-size	display
that s control panels - display - appearance tab - advanced - selected menu from the item drop-down and change the font-size

745158
32-bit	64bit
this can reasonably be the largest 16-bit unsigned the largest 32-bit unsigned or the largest 64bit unsigned depending on the memory model the compiler compiles to

745206
local-variables	class-variables
i ve noticed while browsing the java source code that some methods like string.contentequals duplicates below makes redundant local-variables that are merely copies of class-variables

745206
local-variables	class-variables
i believe that there was a comment somewhere that implied that accessing local-variables is faster than accessing class-variables

745207
put	get
i set the data-access mode to sql command but when i try to put in the sql above i get invalid parameter count when it parsing the sql

745211
textmate	vim
if you don t like vim textmate is a decent text editor

745216
contains	elements
then you would go through each such grouping generate the cosets and check that each coset contains one of the elements

745217
latitude-longitude	location
apparently after the rummble application receives the location data latitude-longitude address etc. it sends this information using a get request to some api on another server that acquires the various establishments in a given mile radius

745221
webserver	upload
for example if i were to change some html tags around within an .aspx page then only that page would need to be upload to the webserver

745226
getter	setter
you don t have to synthesize numberofsides if you re planning on implements the getter and setter

745227
keyboard	mouse
if you are using winforms and will only deploy on windows machines then it s quite easy to use user32 getlastinputinfo to handle both mouse and keyboard idling

745233
mouseup	keyup
using a mouseup keyup event is useless because for whatever reason they fail to be triggers a bug

745234
contains	any
size_t is defined as a type which can contains the size in bytes of any object you could access

745239
logout	login
for instance we have a web based application and we do smoke test to ensure we can load all the web pages lets users to login logout etc

745245
hide	show
based on that the form show hide fields changes its recordsource and binds the fields to the appropriate data columns

745248
.net	wcf
some design-first advocates will define the schemas to the messages that are going to be sent for the request and the response first which is what wcf transforms the .net contract interface into

745257
revision	updates
after a commit or partial updates some files might be at the head revision but only after an updates that didn t skip files you can be sure that all files are at the same version

745259
return-value	arguments
my arguments was not null and i wasn t checking the return-value cough

745260
base-class	inherited
may - just as proof-of-concept - you should inherited the class and replace all references from base-class to this new

745263
any	set
if testclass is something you defined you could replace the initialmethods definition with a property and delegate which can then be set to any methods with a given signature

745265
positioning	slider
slider fires before the handle is moved so your value is ending up at the previous handle positioning

745267
png	ico
of varying types ico png xaml etc

745307
checkbox	button
i m trying to select all the checkbox when clicking a button

745323

these kind of methods adds functionality to a closed assembly letting you extend in functionality a closed dll assembly

745331
asp.net-mvc	webforms
does not matter whether the app is webforms or asp.net-mvc

745336
base-class	inherited
i created a webpart base-class in my web assembly and tried to inherited from it in my site templates assembly

745338
constructor	object
your object are probably private or they don t have a public default constructor

745339
contains	any
should any or all have their name contains the version serv71.exe module71.dll or not

745352
seam	jsf
also it looks like seam and jsf are not mutually exclusive

745352
tomahawk	trinidad
good widget library available in tomahawk trinidad

745361
click	mouse
the shortest code to delete the tab the middle mouse button was click on is by using linq

745366
boolean	int
during the conversion to .net it was decided that when using visual basic conversion routines to convert a boolean value to an int value visual basic 6.0 semantics would be maintained on the return value

745366
boolean	int
under the hood this does an implicit conversion from int to boolean

745367
contains	elements
when no key can be inferred a code comment that contains the corresponding entitytype elements with no key elementss is added to the ssdl section of the .edmx file

745372
value	field
imaging that you have something in application start global-asax which sets the value of a static field based on a configuration value

745380
wicket	jsf
i believe that you can use seam with jsf wicket and gwt

745380
seam	jsf
since the focus of your criteria seem to be the marketability of your skills i would suggest trying out seam and jsf via facelets

745384
configurationsection	configuration-files
multiple calls to getsection however are likely to require re-parsing of the configuration-files and allocating new configurationsection instances which has a high overhead considering the configuration is not likely to ever change after initialization

745392
json	xml
it can use either xml or json for data serialization

745401
versioning	upgrade
i favour append a versioning identifier to interface and coclass names whenever i want a clear upgrade path and anticpate any changes

745403
rewrite	rule
in the former case you will still need to write an apache rewrite rule to extraction the variables from the url and route to the controllers action with the right set of variables as part of your _request

745415
contains	set
for example if the search set contains the string mypossibleresultstring i want to be able to match it with the likes of the following

745442
build-process	msbuild
the sdk also contains msbuild actions for making the parsing generation a part of the regular build-process

745465
subtract	add
the java.util.calendar class allows us to add or subtract any number of day weeks months whatever from a date

745471
value	field
for example the legal value for field a may be constrained by the value of fields x y and z some of which may actually be unknown and unknowable at a given time

745471
value	field
if the current state of the data would be better represented by a modified schema one that reflects the allowed enumerator value for field a or the union choice that is currently allowed for field b then i proposed that perhaps transforming the schema before creating the form might do the trick

745478
short	base
the short and simple answer is if you can t adjust the base testclass code no there s no way you can modify the class to replace a methods by another

745517
put	get
my guess is this is a way to get code that will work whatever you put in n and s just a guess i m too tired to try and see if that is the case

745519
while-loop	loops
i guess the obvious answer is that a for next loops can be written as a do while-loops and converting one to the other means you only have to implement one type of loops in the complier

745520
configuration	environment
i ve added this to my environment configuration

745524
command-prompt	cmd
also just running sc from a command-prompt will show it s possible cmd

745529
vmware	esx
we have two vmware esx boxes that hosts our dev machines and it works great as long as people remember to switch off those images that are not in use

745546
theorem	proof
the pcp theorem says that you can make proofs that are so easy to check that you only need to look at a constant number of randomly selected bits to usually tell a bad proof from a good one

745546
theorem	proof
the pcp theorem in its strongest form says that any language in np has a proof systemd that can be verified by only looking at a constant number of randomly selected bits

745548
subclassing	nsobject
the class is a simple class that defines a polygon and subclassing nsobject

745557
antivirus	security
could there be antivirus software or other filesystem security blocking i o for unauthorized processes

745569
subclassing	nsobject
subclassing of nsobject at least on the iphone do not import the cocoa.h header

745580
unsafe	out
basically it would stripes any unsafe characters out of a filepath component

745594
32-bit	64bit
the important point here is that scratchpad takes up 400 bytes on a 32-bit machine 800 bytes on a 64bit machine of the stack each and every time recursive_function is called so if recursive_function is called recursively 100 times then 40 000 bytes or 80 000 bytes on a 64bit machine of stack space are being used for buffers and it s very likely you can modify the function to reuse the same buffer on each call

745594
pointers	stack
i say probably because although the data is kept on the heap or somewhere else the container can only access that data through pointers it keeps internally if the container is on stack then those pointers will reside on stack and those pointers take up space

745656
selected	button
if you want to upload from a browser you will always have to selected the file or type the filename into the box or click the submit button manually

745659
silverlight	wpf
it says it s for silverlight but i don t see why it wouldn t work for wpf

745664
value	field
to set the audience field value you can use audiencemanager.getaudienceidsastext

745670
noscript	meta
you can have a noscript block in the head element with a meta refresh tag in it

745680
buffering	streaming
if you are buffering a lot of data to be eventually parsing in one pass you are better off reading the data from a streaming into an arrays before working on the arrays

745681
keydown	keyup
you need 2 different callback one for keydown and another with keyup or keypress which is only fired when the element registered both the keydown + keyup

745682
checkbox	button
what i want to do is to change from a checkbox to a two radio button like this

745702
plasticscm	accurev
if you really want to handle multiple releases but not suffering the pain of clearcase you should try something like accurev or plasticscm

745705
document	element
when the above transformation is applied on the provided xml document the children of any p element are correctly present in the output

745718
double	int
conversions from int to double and vice versa involve the representation of floating point and you might lose accuracy which does matter in pointers

745724
put	get
to get all the items and put into a document or to a string just do a for like this

745743
python	java
is python strictly interpreted at run time or can it be used to develop programs that run as background applications like a java app or c program

745751
interpreter	runtime
python is an interpreter language but it is the bytecode which is interpreter at runtime

745753
google-chrome	firefox
we had the company switch to firefox and specific users move to google-chrome

745756
implements	extends
i want to have a class object but i want to force whatever class it represents to extends class a and implements interface b

745761
webforms	asp.net
i m currently using an open session in view pattern in an asp.net webforms application adapted quite a bit from billy mccafferty s

745761
rollback	commit
commit at end of request rollback on any errors

745763
triggers	insert
it is possible to get dynamic sql by connecting to the server in another process or in mysql by creating a prepared statement but it s not possible to do that and reference the magic insert and deleted pseudo-tables available in a triggers

745775
attributes	properties
if you are using .net you may opt to use attributes for your class properties to serve either as a mapping within a class or as data that can be reflected

745787
innodb	myisam
- i heard myisam easily corrupts what about innodb is it crash resistant

745789
python	java
on the other hand there s no explicit compilation step in python as there is with java or c

745795
innodb	myisam
if it is more read than write then you should stick with myisam if its more write than read you should look into innodb

745795
innodb	myisam
if you want to know the difference between innodb and myisam then wikipedia has a great list of their difference

745795
innodb	myisam
myisam uses table-level locking on writes to any existing row whereas innodb uses row-level locking

745799
stax	sax
without it stax has similar low-level of abstraction as sax

745802
linked-list	arrays
keep the pointers in a hash table arrays or linked-list associated with the script engine and pass an integer index or key into that data structure

745805
configuration	environment
so if i ve got the classic three environment dev test production should the build script include the configuration within the deployment distribution or is that something which should be separate and deployed separately

745829
webforms	asp.net
i handle this in asp.net mvc not webforms but the principle is the same by explicitly defining a unit of work in my controller methods

745829
open-session-in-view	lazy-loading
for my purposes the open-session-in-view is useful mainly to allow lazy-loading of related objects in the view stage

745849
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 2 3 ie6 7 8 google-chrome and safari 2 and 3 opera 9 all support document.domain

745859
python	c++
c++ doesn t have built-in support for meta-classes not in the python objective-c way however you can manually mimic the behavior of meta-classes

745859
any	set
besides that if you re really set on a objective-c-style meta-class system i m not aware of any libraries that do that but there might very well be

745861
python	ruby
the thing is once you ve done those things you ve got python or ruby with a c-ish syntax

745862
hosts-file	hosts
make a domain name in the windows hostss-file on the vista hosts systemd

745868
value	field
i know some companies override the mail function to avoid spam and require additional arguments or some predefined value like the from field is required to be a valid address from your domain name

745884
ip-address	hostname
when a host gets it s ip-address via dhcp it can automatically update it s dns records with it s hostname

745884
hosts-file	hosts
then you can add this address to your hosts for access via name

745891
put	get
provide services which behave as expected get requests are idempotent put updates records post creates delete deletes

745897
double	int
numbers can be either int or double but i know when they are one or other

745906
.when	ready
imagine if user can ask a heavy report that may take some minutes to generate instead of click and wait he can choose send me the latest report .when it is ready

745907
32-bit	64bit
are some of the machines running 32-bit os and others running 64bit os

745913
webforms	asp.net
i am trying to call via ajax a webmethod hosted in a traditional asp.net webforms code-behind page

745925
copy-constructor	constructor
what happens is that the compiler creates a temporary gautostring to hold the return value for the function and then in passing that to the variables a on the stack calles the operator t of the temp variables and then the gautoptr t ptr 0 constructor instead of just using the copy-constructor gautoptr autoptrref p

745925
constructor	object
also i don t want const anyway because the copy constructor takes ownership of the memory block which removes ownership from the object being copied.

745932
enterprise	licensing
the deployment requires enterprise or standard editions or purchasing a hosting solution which handles the licensing for you

745934
cocoa	uikit
on the iphone you generally use uikit instead of cocoa which is for mac os x

745943
constructor	object
i set up my true business objects as close to mutator-free as humanly possible then i use a set of dto objects that are designed to be serialized public properties blank constructor etc. it s not an ideal solution but i have found that if you try and mix very rich object sets with serialization it can get ugly

745958
environment	building
however if each of your building tfs testing staging dev environment will be heavily used by all developers during the working day simultaniously then there might not be as many cost savings by virtualizing everything

745962
python	ruby
while javascript cannot be hosted with the dlr outside the browser ruby and python can

745963
innodb	myisam
that said a very hot table lots and lots of selected s will benefit from being migrated to innodb because myisam does not support concurrent read

745970
textbox	button
so given that can someone please explain why after clicking the button in my tiny test example the name property appears in the textbox but the listbox shows nothing

745974
having	select
what i really want to do is remove the border from a combobox this would allow me to display the information while also allowing the user to select other items in the set without having to display them all

745974
selected	button
basically what i m looking for is a link that when clicked opens the default email program and fills in the address but i want the drop-down button so an alternate address can be selected

745978
children	nodes
reasons being multiple but number one reason was performance my classes with up to 100 or so children would actually perform better while manipulating them as arrays than through the the nodes of a tree mostly because of hardware locality and cpu prefetch logic and cpu pipelining

745996
checkbox	button
this.form should be fine gets the form object from the submit button which should then let you get the checkbox from it via getinputs

745996
checkbox	button
if so the only thing i can think off is are the checkbox in the same form as the button

745999
nsxmlparser	nsstring
in cocoa you will generally use an nsxmlparser which just uses nsstring

746007
textbox	button
i ran your sample and when i clicked on the button the textbox was populated with the name as expected

746009
forms-authentication	security
my security grouping has a requirement that we use forms-authentication membership provider

746019
value	field
the above example doesn t work as it shows nan and other value in the text field

746019
value	field
i want the field to show default-value and other value

746020
button	popup
so when the button is clicked the menu popup displaying the alternate email addresses

746047
contains	any
should the backing bean contains any actual business logic or should it strictly contains data

746063
any	set
is there any way to set constants in an environment file and have them work correctly in development mode

746069
contains	elements
when you use the templatescolumn in the grid and the templates column contains some controls when you tab from the previous column the focus is not automatically given to the first elements declared in the templates column

746072
shell	bash
those who learned shell using bash or ksh often prefer the double square bracket operator instead

746079
.net	csla
i suspect that the main compatibility issues with csla under mono are centered around mono not implementing all the .net data binding nuances especially datagrids and serialization format differences

746082
perl	c++
i am mostly looking for solutions using the big 3 ps python php and perl although anything with java or c++ is cool too since speed is essential

746090
dictionary	arrays
like him you can start with a dictionary and the canonacalize words by creating a dictionary from an arrays of letters sorted alphabetically to a list of words that can be spelled from those letters

746091
javascript	dom
placing javascript in the head tag can slow down the load time of the page since the js has to be parsed processed and executed and possibly downloaded if they are external files before the dom is rendered

746102
filtering	sorting
filtering out duplicates and sorting is trivial to due after the algorithm has finished

746112
textbox	button
first i want to be able to change my textbox type to integer so that when i press my add button the event will add the integers and not concatenate them

746115
updating	updates
by updating your flash cs3 installation through adobe updates manager you will be able to use adobe air within the flash application

746116
triggers	insert
columns_updated - check if one or more column s is are insert deleted within triggers

746121
protected	public
there s no way to declare these textbox in my user-controls be public instead of protected

746128
double	int
right now i don t want to mess with custom editors so i m only allowing primitive type properties string int double datetime bool etc. that the propertygrid already has built in editors for

746151
git-repo	repo
my situation is that i currently already have an existing git-repo and want to tracking the trunk of a svn repo by making it a remote branch in my current git-repo

746165
show	next
i have a app now i want to edit it with the germany versioning but i found a funny thing under the tiger i found that when the about panels show the info with germanic character if a line cound not fill the characters it will show remains to the next line as example

746165
show	next
copyright â 2001-2009 aaa co. ltd if one can show the copyright â 2001-2008 aaa only the next line can show the co. ltd not like 10.5 or other language versionings under tiger about panels can fit the length of character automatic.i think this is maybe the germany versioning not fit the tiger very well

746173
selected	checkbox
if i selected both checkbox i am getting an error selected a valid choice

746173
selected	checkbox
selecteding one checkbox doesn t work either it gives me selected a valid choice

746203
32-bit	64bit
performance was about 10 faster than 32-bit and was nearly identical whether you were just using 64bit types to reverse bits on two 32-bit ints at a time or whether you were actually reversing bits in half as many 64bit values

746207
bazaar	git
let s suppose right now i want to support bazaar and git

746207
bazaar	git
so of course i can make bazaarlogfilereader and gitlogfilereader and hard-code them into the program but i want it to be set up in such a way that adding support for a new version control program is as simple as plopping a new class file in the directory with the bazaar and git readers

746207
bazaar	git
so right now you can call do-something-with-the-log --software git and do-something-with-the-log --software bazaar because there are log readers for those

746218
order	add
that means you need to add locking code in order to use it in your singleton

746225
python	java
d1 is was a relatively conservative attempt to create a better c++ by adding some lessons learned in the past 20+ years from languages like java and python

746227
integer	digits
i am trying to replace last 2 digits of a integer with 38

746240
copy-constructor	constructor
so if i write a constructor that takes in a pointer and thought that s my copy-constructor the compiler would still supply with the default copy-constructor in which case my constructor which i thought was my copy-constructor would not be called and the default copy-constructor would be called

746251
put	get
loose coupling is not achieved by listing a set of resources and saying ok you can get put post delete all you want.

746252
copy-constructor	constructor
but the copy-constructor is the name we give a specific constructor

746252
copy-constructor	constructor
a constructor that takes a reference preferably const but not required of the same class as an argument is just named the copy-constructor because this is what it effectively does

746253
constructor	object
yes you can write a constructor that takes a pointer to the object

746253
constructor	object
the very definition of a copy constructor requires you to pass an object of the same class

746253
copy-constructor	constructor
if you are passing anything else yes it s a constructor alright but not a copy-constructor

746257
copy-constructor	constructor
you can write a constructor like that but its not technically a copy-constructor

746301
testng	junit
you may want to use junit in the part of unit-testing but testng is more than a unite testing framework

746301
web-testing	selenium
watir or selenium as web-testing

746316
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i know 3.5 asp.net-mvc well and have come from a ruby-on-rails background so this webforms stuff looks kinda gross to me p

746316
triggers	insert
in asp asp.net-mvc i would do something like making a partial representing a single node and a jquery ajax triggers controller action that renders a collection of these partials the children which is insert into the target s children div s innerhtml

746316
children	nodes
use asp ajax to call a codebehind methods that recursivley adds controls representing the children of this nodes

746322
value	field
place the value of variables entryid into the entryid field or property of this object

746322
arguments	default
in php arguments are passed by value by default inspired by c

746334
wicket	jsf
which framework should i choose - seam wicket jsf or gwt

746342
directdraw	gdi
the author of windows graphics programming win32 gdi and directdraw feng yuan made sample dll for that matter

746366
templating	frontend
i have an n-tier system where a frontend templating layer makes calls out to a backend application server

746370
background-image	width
the third element has its background-image set to filmstrip.png and its width and height set to the dimensions of this image

firefox	safari
firefox however doesn t have extensive scripting capabilitiesâ if you are willing to use safari there is an applescript command available to inject javascript code into a document the do javascript commandâ look it up in safari s scripting dictionary available from within script editor

746377
web-services	security
i m looking at web-services security for an environment which already has active directory

746377
credentials	security
from my initial reading of brokered kerberos authentication once the user credentials are provided then a kerberos security token will be returned and authentication is not required for each web service call

746381
python	c++
see welsh s seda architecture see yield code.google.com p yield for a good python c++ hybrid implemenation

746391
valarray	std
bonus question is there some way that i can use std valarray to keep from having to type lots and lots of operator overloads

746409
wsdualhttpbinding	duplex
out of the box there s only the wsdualhttpbinding to support duplex but since you re internal behind-the-firewall you might want to look at creating your own tcp-based duplex binding it s not as hard as it might sound at first

746411
keydown	keyup
i think your best bet is using keybd_event keydown called extendedkey with the lwin value of the system.windows.forms.keys enum then keydown second character + and keyup both keys

746420
revision	svn
check the svn log and find out the revision number of delete operation

746420
revision	svn
use svn checkout to check the revision just before the delete operation

746425
linked-list	arrays
the only caveat is that we assume that the arrays is in a linked-list for it to give a o n complexity.

746431
revision	svn
depending on your svn client you should be able to get these files from a previous revision using show log as its called in tortoise.

746432
valarray	std
then you can go for std valarray or boost ublas vector matrix types to leverage existing code get quality performance vector operations to boot

746490
screenshot	fps
i tried a similar thing a while back problem with java is you can t take screenshot fast enough i could not even get 1 fps

746494
digital-signature	sign
i m using digital certificates to sign a transaction results also i need to print out a slip with information and digital-signature on it

746496
stderr	stdout
are you piping both stdout and stderr

746497
jasper-reports	birt
what is the best free or low-cost java reporting library birt jasper-reports etc. for making newspaper-like reports

746517
order	add
any ideas how to add the order case insensitive so result a2 will end up before b1

746531
contains	elements
this creates a situation where an inline elements contains a block elements the div becomes inline and the p is block by default

746538
constructor	object
hint nothing if she wants to construct out of a heap object she can just dereference the pointer and use the regular copy constructor

746539
contains	elements
elements contains within other

746551
put	get
i m aware there are dozens of questions about this and blog after blog post but can someone put the simplest answer or link to the existing question if there is an appropriate answer to get the following working on visual-studio 2005

746573
expression	brackets
square brackets do not need a specific notation in xml but they have a special meaning when used in xpath expression for xsl transformations

746583
dependency-injection	service-locator
this mechanism is similar to resolving services objects via service-locator service-locator pattern where you use a dependency-injection engine and ask it to resolve an instance of the service by a known name by interface etc.

746595
json	xml
then daily the entire db could be loaded into objects number of users data is relatively low and then serialized to something like xml or json

746606
udp	tcp
a great many applications that use udp use it because they need the low-overhead low-latency nature of it much more than they need the precise reliability of tcp

746627
safari	opera
i want to make a cross-browser ff3 ie6 safari opera w3c valid html and css both stretchable horizontally vertically without javascript and with semantic and lesser html markup round corner

746631
freeswitch	asterisk
asterisk or freeswitch is very different

746631
freeswitch	asterisk
asterisk and freeswitch meanwhile can function as pbxs ivr servers media servers etc

746631
freeswitch	asterisk
if it is to tinker with certain high-level telephony applications use asterisk or freeswitch

746653
function-pointers	member-functions
a pmf pointers to member function is like a normal static function-pointers except because non-static member-functions require the this object to be specified the pmf invocation syntax or allow the this object to be specified on the left-hand side

746660
bindingsource	datarow
where templatebinder is a bindingsource object with the datasource property set to the datarow i want to trickle out throws an exception-handling when i go to show the form

746660
contains	any
not really sure what i should do differently - the templatesbinder won t contains any datasource until i get the templates row and if i have to manage the bindings myself instead of setting them and forgetting them at the top of the page i m not getting much value out of binding

746660
contains	set
i m trying to pass the bindingsource a row that contains the values i want to propagate to the form suspend binding switch it out for a blank row from the table so the values i propagated out stay in the properties i ve bound show the form let the user fill it out and then turn on binding again so the bound properties in the controls trickle into the blank row i ve set as the bindingsource datasource

746694
constructor	private
the implementation should favour immutability by using private final variables and constructor instantiation

746694
tostring	equals
the equals hashcode and tostring methods should be generated

746699
multibyte	ord
the ord function will return the code for the left most character both if it is multibyte or basic ascii

746705
jtable	jlist
that way you can have jlist as well as jtable and jtree display massive amount of cells without having to instanciate components for each cell

746705
jtable	jlist
just as neil coffey said you can add your listeners to the jlist jtable jtree instead and use the helper methods locationtoindex ... getcellbounds ... to dispatch which cell was affected and thus deal with cell specific logic

746709
continuous-integration	teamcity
to do this properly you probably want some kind of continuous-integration server like teamcity or cruise control

746710
constructor	private
it s basically a class with public final static fields for the values and a private constructor or more

746715
arguments	default
the default implcit is to assume a function returns int and has an empty arguments list

746720
pointers	stack
arguments by using a direct pointers to the last non-vararg argument because then you have to care about the alignment and stack direction of your target-platform

746723
cocoa	uikit
there is no need to or benefit in learning desktop cocoa before moving to uikit on the iphone

746723
cocoa	uikit
although there are a lot of concepts shared between uikit and cocoa they are no easier to learn on the desktop

746724
tostring	equals
create a constructor for those fields as well and also implement equals hashcode and tostring methods

746727
lookup	any
for doing normal hashtable lookup on basically any kind of data - this one by paul hsieh is the best i ve ever used

746735
ostream	std
i have to know whether there is some kind of ostream which accept an instance std string and write on that instance

746740
webforms	asp.net
differences between asp.net webforms and asp.net mvc

746744
ostringstream	std
std ostringstream part of sstream header

746749
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you have something like company-internal framework which facilitates many common operations and it is built with webforms you will likely not persuade them to adopt asp.net-mvc since it means lots of work dramatic changes in the thought patterns and likely a significant amount of time costs

746765
firefox	opera
i tested it on ie6 ie7 firefox 2 and 3 safari and opera

746767
value	field
most of our development is done in vb.net not my choice and one frequently used code pattern uses an on error goto followed by a resume next so that all database field can be read with a directcast and any dbnull value are just ignored

746775
margins	padding
more specifically i would like to be able to selected a tablelayoutpanel invoke some command menu macros verb whatever and have the autosize anchor margins padding etc

746786
background-image	width
if you want a rounded border rather than just a rounded solid background the above can be tweaked using border negative margin positioning relative absolute width and background-image positioning so it works but can t remember off the top of my head how

746798
asp.net-mvc	webforms
do you mean some sort of wizard or tool to convert from a webforms app to asp.net-mvc

746839
exception-handling	error-handling
also error-handling should use exception-handling not vb6-style on error goto hell...

746842
value	field
before looping over the rows in the idatareader get the ordinal value of the column names and use the strongly typed getx methods to retrieve the field value like so

746846
where-clause	sql
having formulated this combination you need to put those guys into the where-clause of your sql update statement to identify the row you want to update

746861
host	dns
trace route and reverse-lookup the ips to host names using dns and try to read the host names for geo-information such as country and city

746873
python	perl
i also know python and perl but i ve never used this languages for a web development

746885
ruby	php
it has apis in many of the programming languages including ruby and php

746895
revision	svn
so developer x and y did checkout from svn repo with revision no as 2

746910
put	get
if you have wfetch or fiddler or live http headers then i would show the client side request as well and highlight the absence of view states and highligh the post get verbs put delete if you are using wfetch

746915
revision	svn
in other words if programmer y updates file test.txt from revision 2 to revision 3 and programmer x having revision 2 of test.txt and changes that file when he tries to commit revision 4 svn will force programmer x to update first

746936
arguments	undefined
as every answer so far has said to avoid the errors declare the function before its use and as chris jester-young points out use the standard mechanisms for accessing the variadic arguments or suffer the pains of undefined behavior

746936
fortran	pascal
you will usually run into this when linking modules written in pascal or fortran with modules written in c

746948
cassini	iis
my understanding of the problem is that the process trying to execute the code is running as a different account under iis than it does under cassini

746955
duplicates	contains
given that the above grid contains only 16 characters some of them duplicates you can greatly reduce the number of total keys in your dictionary by simply filtering out entries that have unattainable characters

746955
tree	trie
its a bit bloated but at least i reuse tree trie from cpan

746957
javascript	dom
the thing about javascript is that are basically two parts to it the language and the dom document object model

746957
javascript	dom
most of the time javascript is used in the browser which means it has to interact with html via the dom

746957
javascript	dom
js the good parts will teach you the javascript core then you can look up the dom interaction elsewhere

746972
perl	php
i have a program that has to read a configuration file from a php script and a quick search has revealed there are dozens of ways to handle configuration files in perl

746980
difference	count
given 2 timestamps in postgresql how do you calculate the time difference without count whole saturdays and sundays

746987
tga	pgm
btw i m trying to write image files first i want to try with tga pgm

746996
vba	vb6
microsoft have been dropping hints at a managed-code version of office with an integrated vsto presumably in the same way as the vb6 ide is integrated for vba so the vs ide would be integrated for vsto ever since .net was first released

746996
macros	vba
they will never actually remove vba from the products of course - excel still supports excel 4 macros and word still has the wordbasic automation object to support word 6 macros and there s no sign of either of those being removed since there is too much legacy code to support - and no-one has used either of those coding models in a decade

746999
png	gif
i wouldn t want to attempt tiff png gif or jpg in fortran without the help of external libraries however

747020
getter	setter
if you do not want to hardcode calls to each getter and setter reflection is the only way to call these methods but it is not hard

747020
getter	setter
can you refactor the class in question to use a properties object to hold the actual data and let each getter and setter just call get set on it

747021
having	select
i can get the team1 column using max from a sub select query but i m having a complete mental block on how to achieve team2 team3 etc

747031
contains	any
at any rate even if it were possible no program that uses tcp-ip which is most modern software since most contains some kind of .net integration auto update etc. would work

747031
tcp-ip	arp
based on your comment below if you want bypass disable the arp handling of the tcp-ip stack then winpcap should let you do that

747038
methods	extend
because things like include or extend aren t actually keywords but ordinary methods that take ordinary parameters you don t have to pass them an actual module as an argument you can also pass anything that evaluates to a module

747046
textbox	button
i have added some dynamic textbox upon a button click

747048
textbox	button
you need to save a reference to those textbox so you can access them inside your button click handle method

747064
abstract	extends
in the following solution each enum class extends an abstract base-class abstractenum and has its own set of all value automatically generated and stored in a static map in the base-class

747072
linux	unix
afaik there is no way to run this on linux unix

747077
value	field
get that field from the bean and append any other non transient value in a value map

747089
button	popup
i ve only seen this problem popup when a button click calls javascript that manually calls form.submit but does not correctly cancel the click event and thus it posts twice

747109
aggregate-functions	sum
we have aggregate-functions like sum avg and so on but not the basic math operators

747130
imagemagick	phpthumb
maybe take look at phpthumb it works with gd and imagemagick

747151
background-color	height
so in the above example you would resize so that the height is ok then fill up 7 pixels on each end i think to the left and right with a background-color

747158
rewrite	rule
updates use a rewrite rule to make turn into foo bar or similar -- whatever works in your app

747161
xml-serialization	xml
if you use something like xml-serialization either using xmlserializaer or datacontractserializer you will be able to produce xml

747221
nsmutablestring	nsstring
so i made currentelementvalue an nsstring instead of an nsmutablestring and i can get the proper intvalue

747224
insertion-sort	quicksort
i have tried quicksort and binary insertion-sort

747236
value	field
so like this i want to store the value for the field for all the rows in the datatable

747245
dictionary	map
if you have absolutely no idea what fields can be in each element your only choice is to create a property bag map dictionary of key value pairs

747245
ordereddictionary	bag
you can use an arraylist or an ordereddictionary which allow indexing by ordinal to hold each property bag element

747246
silverlight	wpf
here s a sample tested in wpf but should work in silverlight

747248
any	set
set working directory to you can change this to fit your needs but i d assume the project s base directory is as good a place as any to set as the working directory

747248
any	set
set arguments to the double quotes should be include otherwise any spaces in your path will muck things up

747261
any	set
may work as it will pick up the url encoded extended chars but it will allow any char not just the set you want

747275
difference	count
however the performance difference might be negligible so unless you are doing this a lot count spaces would likely be the most accurate way to go

747286
postgresql	mysql
my problem is when i need to query a relational database - i m only really concerned with postgresql and mysql - i ve been struggling a bit

747288
authentication	login
so in a sense the access of these image resources must be properly authentication which means that only login users can access those images

747289
scons	cmake
in c i can use autotools scons cmake + cpp

747294
postgresql	mysql
linq provider for mysql postgresql oracle this is open-source

747338
turing-machines	automata
complexity and computation-theory think turing-machines and automata introduction to theory of computation

747339
embedded-fonts	fonts
if the pdf doesn t have embedded-fonts then you shouldn t have too much trouble mapping the fonts to the afp ones

python	java
all modern languages java python etc. have collection classes that implement a better sort than bubble sort

747340
python	java
programming language java python etc.

747340
json	xml
other data representation languages xml json

747340
bubble-sort	quicksort
why a bubble-sort is bad is that it s o n 2 where a quicksort is o n log n

747362
anjuta	gnome
anjuta is a really great ide for gnome

747372
priority-queue	heap
you could use priority-queue based on a heap data structure

747376
cursor	row
creating a triggers and calling a dml function is equal to opening the cursor selected the updated rows and calling the triggers code for each row of this cursor

747379
icmp	udp
rather than listening for icmp responses to your failed udp sends why not send a brand spanking new icmp echo request

747388
windows-mobile	windows-ce
engine default is aes128 it s not compatible with windows-mobile 2003 or windows-ce 4.2

747399
prolog	lisp
for example learning prolog made me truly understand recursion for the first time smalltalk and ruby helped me understand the beauty of dynamic typing lisp just blew my mind and c made me realise what was going on behind the curtains.

747413
bubble-sort	quicksort
no not bubble-sort quicksort

747413
quicksort	big-o
it s the big-o thing- bubble sort average o n 2 quicksort is o n log n

747428
textbox	onblur
then trap the onblur javascript event of the textbox to call a function that formats values as per your requirement

747442
button	popup
i have a rather pesky problem when trying to add a confirm popup message to the onclick event of a button

747464
pointers	stack
you will know what a pointers and an offset is you ll have a deeper understanding of why character encoding matters you ll know about stack and the heap memory-management etc

747465
directory-structure	filesystems
suppose the directory-structure on the filesystems is like this

747472

- you get many templates for your like i use it a lot when the database return no result you can put a message here to inform the user instead of showing blank screen

747481
shell	bash
bash linux shell

747481
shell	bash
bash shell into a file

747487
perl	c++
if you already know a higher level language like python ruby perl vb java and so on i would recommend that you make some effort to become skilled in c and not try to tackle c++ just yet

747488
visualvm	jvm
the difference are in non-core places like garbage-collection the jconsole visualvm in the sun jvm precompilation etc

747490

747522
decimal-point	digits
numeric_limits digits10 specifies the number of decimal digits to the left of the decimal-point you can represent without a loss of precision

747556
ip-address	hostname
once you have the ip-address you can try and do a reverse lookup to get the hostname

747579
abstract-class	base-class
another thing to consider is that since there is no multiple-inheritance if you want a class to be able to implement inherit from your interface abstract-class but inherit from another base-class use an interface

747594
put	get
you basically have to weigh server load against speed - if you poll often you get a very responsive client but you put a lot of load on your server

747614
any	set
are there any other methods i can try to set the hostname permanently

747615
windows-mobile	windows-ce
it says that for kiosk mode applications it seems to be better on the long run to use windows-ce instead of windows-mobile because the former is easier to adapt to these needs

747622
.net	wcf
since you ask for .net 2.0 i guess you know that this is fixed in wcf where you can add the attribute faultcontract typeof yourcustomexception

747626
findwindow	showwindow
showwindow with the intptr from findwindow and 0 sw_hide

747628
subclassing	superclass
you need to work out the relationship between them -- are they superclass-subclass or are they peer subclassing of some other superclass

747628
superclass	subclass
you may have proper superclass subclass relationships

747628
superclass	subclass
one choice is to have a superclass table with an optional fk reference to the additional information in the subclass

747628
superclass	subclass
one choice is to have a subclass table with a mandatory fk reference to the superclass information

747635
directory	folder
with tools we ve used previously it s been possible to set up a reference directory or folder on the network which stores the latest revision of everything that s been checked in so that people can easily browse the latest versions without having to use a dedicated tool

747636
jasper-reports	apache-poi
jasper-reports uses this api alternatively to apache-poi because it supports images

747670
input-field	selected
now how do i selected the checked input-field with name foo

747678
directory-structure	filesystems
otherwise if you want access to a full directory-structure by the filesystems any simple scripting can run an svn update command

747693
value	field
you can choose another order by changing the teamlist query but the field you choose must have different unique value for each team or the comparison will generate wrong numbers

747702
startup	launch
launch your application at startup

747702
startup	launch
usually programs not launch on startup so you shouldn t worry about this

747703
.net	wcf
wcf is the part of the .net framework dedicated to communications

747703
.net	wcf
wcf is a unified programming model that combines the best of breed features from xml web services .net remoting msmq and com+ into an integrated platform that is completely based on a set of open industry standards

747720
where-clause	sql
based on your comment that you only want to build an sql where-clause from your lambda let s have a look at the where-clause

747723
revision	svn
what you need to do is just replace your copy with previous revision in svn repository

747738
aggregate	grouping
i am trying to implement a query where i am using aggregate to sum certain value and then grouping by mysql date functions month | year | week

747752
python	c++
i m only a novice programmer i do it for fun and i m coming from the world of python c++ other procedural languages and procedural style of problem solving

747764
.net	wcf
wcf is the replacement for wse now obsolete asmx the old asp.net web services and to some extent is also a replacement for .net remoting

747806
udp	tcp
using this paradigm you can use udp tcp http peer-to-peer msmq - all using the same 3 core concepts

747820
implements	extends
i know that in eclipse if your class implements an interface or extends an abstract-class there is a quick way to add the methods definitions to your class

747822
numeric	digits
for some comtries those strings may consist onl of numeric digits but that doesn t make them integers

747827
revision	svn
svn does not allow you to undo anything since it saves revision as changesets

747830
backgroundworker	winforms
threads only when you don t have to work with a ui winforms or wpf and backgroundworker when you do have to deal with a ui

747838
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere once upon a time include a similar set of tools for their whole j2ee application server not sure if they still do but i would assume that s still true .

i really don t want all the joomla folder clogging up my root directory

747865
hosts-file	hosts
i ve edited my hostss-file it s a development machine to redirect each site s hosts header to the local machine 127.0.0.1

747865
credentials	security
not sure why it would challenge though - i am logged in as a machine domain admin and ie is configured to pass credentials in internet options security tab custom level automatic logon in intranet zone

747886
aggregate	grouping
if you have an index on the groupinging field and don t order by the aggregate results then an index scan for grouping by is applied and each aggregate is counted on the fly

747888
getter	setter
better i d say to have explicit getter and setter using properties

747888
initializer	getter
you ll also want some code in __init__ to initializer the value of myvalue if it doesn t exist yet or to at least handle that it might not exist in the getter

747907
value	field
if i understand correctly field eis.ecmscore contains multiple value which it s a violation of normalization rules

747916
binary-data	chunks
if you are dealing with rows of data rather than chunks of binary-data the pattern is still fairly similar

747916
progress-bar	progress
each time you do that successfully you can then inch the progress-bar forward and allow the user to remain fully aware of the progress of the long-running operation

747934
temporary	copy
you can then simply take the temporary formula-image and copy it somewhere else

747956
contains	any
if the reinstallmode contains an a it will always install the file regardless of any version or date information attached to existing files

747960
directory	folder
here s a post build macros that i think will work by copying all files in a directory called configuration to the root build folder

747967
bubble-sort	big-o
and most importantly big-o so you know why you should use one of these instead of a bubble-sort

747969

data-structures	tree
advanced data-structures like b-tree binomial and fibonacci heaps avl red black tree splay tree skip lists tries etc

747989
bazaar	git
has tried out bazaar mercurial darcs git

748003
terminate	timeout
that way the client s connection won t timeout while waiting for the system call to terminate

748006
stderr	stdout
ffmpeg uses stdout for outputing media data and stderr for logging progress information

748013
haskell	fortran
but functional ml lisp haskell logical prolog object oriented c++ java smalltalk imperative c pascal fortran even

748048
any	set
do you really want to be adding datetimes that do not have any value set

748054
environment	building
a server was upgrade from windows 2000 to windows 2003 and now i can t access environment variables from ant building scripting

748056
export	csv
i had to export the excel spreadsheet with the locations to a csv

748058
command-line	cmd
a concrete example using cmd the windows command-line interpreter with 2 arguments

748065
silverlight	wpf
the ability to merge resource dictionary has been a hindrance to silverlight developers until 3.0 and a boon to wpf developers since the beginning

748091
ref	out
first you can use ref or out parameters to assign value to your parameters which get passed back to the calling routine

748093
ref	out
use output parameters using the out or ref keyword

748094
jqmodal	jquery
i would recommend using jquery with the jqmodal plugin instead of using a â popupâ

748103
ref	out
an out parameter is identical to a ref parameter with an additional compiler enforced rule

748103
ref	out
besides that rule an out parameter works just like a ref parameter

748104
margins	padding
if you re planning on using a border around the image be sure to use margins properties instead of padding or you ll wind up with whitespace between the border of the image and the image itself

748127
environment	building
you may be able to get around rewriting all your building scripting by either 1 setting the java_home environment variables manually or 2 modifying the ant.bat file to assign it manually

748150
32-bit	64bit
i found this as a problem as my dev machine was 32-bit and the production server 64bit

748155
nested-lists	tree
i ve read a lot of people discussing nested-lists but i was wondering how to iterate through an adjacancy list tree in php

748170
linux	unix
i am pretty sure that you are talking about windows here based on the phrasing of your question but in a unix linux including mac environment the commands module is also available

748170
stderr	stdout
the commands module provides an extremely simple interface to run commands and get the status return code and the output reads from stdout and stderr

748177
apache	squid
in this case you need a regular server running squid apache django mysql whatever

748180
mta	sta
chances are something is setting up your main thread to be mta but your library expects and required sta so it s coinitialize call is failing

748189
synchronous	.when
.when you execute something synchronous you wait for it to finish before moving on to another task

748192
wait	hang
the advantage is that you can execute b c and or d while a is still running in the background on a separate thread so you can take better advantage of your resources and have fewer hang or wait

748213
methods	extend
also there are suggestions to extend the dg s drawrowbackground methods but i need to set the background externally not from logic inside the dg

748219
firefox	opera
if i try it in firefox opera i get a new session id on the redirected page

748226
macvim	vim
if you re coming from nix and you like vim then macvim

748226
textmate	vim
if you re coming from any other os and or you don t like vim then textmate

748228
ref	out
use out ref parameters

748243
selected	cell
the one where the only thing you can do is selected in each cell of for this column

748254
compact-framework	.net
i would prefer something in .net compact-framework but i can do win32 as well

748258
http	ssl
i am now trying to implement ssl support for it so that it can handle http requests and responses

748258
networkstream	sslstream
how do i know if i need to read the information using sslstream or networkstream

748262
sql-server	mysql
i m not sure if sql-server supports it but mysql has bigint columns which go up to 2 64 2 63 if you want it signed

748270
cucumber	testunit
the really cool stuff is all being done with rspec and cucumber so if you don t have a personal preference yourself i d probably skip testunit

748271
filtering	sorting
the downside is that the sorting filtering of these data are exceedingly difficult.not only that when the data size is large it s very slow to read them from hard disk into memory

748273
contains	set
do you have the allowfullscreen flashvar set in the contains html

748299
getter	setter
property getter setter in javascript

748303
contains	any
it works because php automatically converts a bare string an unquoted string which does not correspond to any known symbol into a string which contains the bare string

748341
linked-list	tree
this could take up to n n-1 2 iterations in the pathological case of your tree being a linked-list

748341
children	nodes
stop when all nodess have been added to the tree or the number of remaining nodess remains the same from one iteration to the next - this means the remaining nodess are not children of your root nodes

748341
children	nodes
alternatively if your database supports recursive sql queries you can use that and it will only selected the nodess that are children of your parent nodes

748347
getter	setter
to add on- you need to closely inspect your setter and getter and see if they return a different value on different calls

748356
environment	execution
very useful for exploratory testing as it records all the integration of your java app with its surrounding environment user-input system calls db response and allows later replay of the recorded session with the application actually running and execution the same path through the code

748359
document	element
you re creating the element in one document and then append it to a child located in another document

748359
document	element
you need to create the element in the document that you re going to be adding it to

748384
methods	extend
the reason you re properly using interfaces is due to the fact that you cannot have all your classes that needs these methods extend a base class that contains these yet you need to know that specific classes promise to implement these

748415
click	mouse
if you test a normal button you will see that the click event doesn t happen until you release the mouse

748424
selected	checkbox
i have a selected checkbox that has invisible set to false

748445
shell	bash
shell bin bash

748459
primitive	int
this is assuming currentfitness is of type int and not the primitive type int

748501
joomla	drupal
of course as with anything like this your mileage may vary and since i only used joomla briefly i can t say that drupal is necessarily better than it

748503
linux	unix
note our build environment is linux unix based so we can t use any windows-only tools

748516
subtract	time
of course if only one job can be running at any time i could just subtract out the running time of each job but the overlap part has me stumped

748518
compareto	equals
by convention you should either implement the equals methods to be consistent with your compareto methods or clearly document your class to note the inconsistency

748533
subtract	time
if it is a stop time subtract 1

748540
installation	uninstall
so i botched an msi installer and deployed it after only testing installation not uninstall bad i know added running of an exe after install but forgot to specify that it should only occur on install not uninstall

748549
selected	cell
both those grids support selected the cell via code so you should be good to go

748554
python	tcl
ps consider writing a command-driven simulation framework maybe built on python or tcl

748555
cppunit	cunit
pick a good platform i like cunit and cppunit and go from there

748605
triggers	insert
is there anyways i can do this without having to use triggers on insert

748607
any	set
make sure to set the expiry times correctly in your dns entry and you shouldn t see any visible delay

748625
python	java
it also gives you a deeper appreciation for what languages like java c# python ruby are doing for you

748626
apache	squid
apache has a built-in proxy module but i ve heard that squid has better performance

748632
gridview	listview
i ve got a listview control bound to an observablecollection of items and i ve set it s view to a gridview with columns bound to properties data

748667
windows-mobile	windows-ce
there is a sample called stockpor in the activesync sdk folder by default it s at c program files windows-ce tools wce500 windows-mobile 5.0 pocket pc sdk activesync activesync stock portfolio sample that gives you an example of how to do custom item synchronization

748670
dependency-injection	service-locator
this is an m-v-vm library full disclosure i m the author based on using services and either the service-locator or dependency-injection patterns

748679
any	set
so basically it is creates a mask which can be used to test if the any of the lower bits were set

748682
put	get
do make sure you remember to get your serial number in if you put this on production

748720
updating	updates
surely it s not good to loop over an updates query for every row what s an alternative in one or very few queries suitable for updating one cell in 20 rows or even more 50-200+

748738
oracle	mysql
in mysql this would be easy with the group_concat function but it looks like to do the equivalent in oracle it s a little messy

748740
python	c++
i tested a similar setup using c++ and winsock2.2 and had similar results as when i ran your program under python namely the process-blocking effect

748772
selected	textbox
to resolve it right click on the virtual directory - selected properties and then click on create next to the application label and the textbox

748798
put	get
or on some hosted sites that you re allowed access to you need to put in a ticket to the service center or help desk to get them make it an app

748799
iteration	set
if the result of the comparison is 0 you set right to the middle index-1 therefore resetting the search range for the next iteration to the left half of the list

748807
google-docs	spreadsheet
i am currently populating a google-docs excel spreadsheet with all of the data i want to eventually be able to query from the website after it s imported

748815
worksheet	excel
in the more general case you do not need excel to create worksheet and you should avoid any solution that requires it for web use

748826
textbox	button
first one being a textbox an ok button and a clear button

748826
textbox	button
but when the user clicks ok button of the message box the textbox looses focus and the focus passes to the next control which is the ok button

748843
textbox	button
clicking on the ok button forces it to have control and therefore the textbox loses control

748848
push	pull
if i am doing all initializing and synchronizing programatically with rmo like here does it matter if it is a push or pull

748848
push	pull
if i can it seems that even though pull is favored for merge replication i would want to use push to make the server bear the brunt and easier management

748857
children	nodes
i would add a nodes to the tree and each nodes contains a parent and a collection of children

748859
access-vba	vba
i haven t done any vba coding for several years but i recall that access-vba had an eval method that could be used to evaluate code represented as a string

748873
put	get
any information i can get would be better than nothing so please feel free to put in partial answers

748906
ref	out
can you work out why the originator of the code thought that they needed to have the parameter as a ref

748909
value	field
for instance you cannot pass constant value readonly field properties etc. so that a lot of helper variables are required when calling methods with ref arguments

748909
ref	out
last but not least the performance if likely not nearly as well since it required more indirections a ref is just a reference which needs to be resolved on every access and may also keep objects alive longer since the references are not going out of scope as quickly

748910
redmine	trac
we hit the same problem with trac our solution was to move to redmine

748919
perl	tcl
i mean a shell script or perl python ruby tcl whatever to do that is probably less than 5 lines of code and less than 10 minutes of work

748921
mouseover	mouseup
bind works with almost every event you need possible event values blur focus load resize scroll unload beforeunload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change selected submit keydown keypress keyup error

748926
python	ruby
on os x python and ruby are both already set up with dtrace hooks

748926
debugging	trace
but being able to attach debugging trace to a running process is well awesome

748929
configuration	environment
this simply loads up the merb environment at which point you can proceed to inspect its configuration

748936
absolute-path	realpath
if you cannot use the absolute-path because you don t know what the absolute-path is use php s realpath to figure out what it is and then use it

748938
directory	folder
are the httpdocs and httpsdocs directory both located in the same parent folder

748939
put	get
i need to put a max length on my test field on my views using asp.net-mvc with the entity-framework and i can t find how to get the max length of a varchar field

748947
absolute-path	realpath
you can use realpath __file__ to determine the absolute-path to a file

748956
animation	rotation
one thing to be aware if you re animation text dynamic text looks better animated when you ve got the font embedded also if you plan to animate rotation or alpha you will need to embed fonts otherwise you won t be able to animate those properties

748970
32-bit	64bit
i m not sure if there is still a server and a client vm for 64bit there is for 32-bit so you may want to investigate that also

748984
google-chrome	firefox
if you open different brwosers at the same time such as firefox opera google-chrome and ie you ll have to log in in all of the browsers independently

748989
forms-authentication	security
you could choose employ cookie munging storing the forms-authentication ticket on the url but this seems like a bad idea from a security pov

748990
canvas	scale
zoom bind the slider to the scale transform of the canvas

749018
environment	building
the postresults servlet is useful in a continuous-integration environment where you want to have the selenium test results sent to a url of your choosing i believe it s configurable when setting up your selenium test and then have that server include the selenium results as part of the building results

749054
revision	svn
you ve already discovered the simplest way to specify a shallow clone in git-svn by specifying the svn revision number that you want to start your clone at

749054
revision	svn
but in svn and therefore in git-svn you will have to find the revision number yourself

749057
selected	textbox
i have a textbox where i want to limit the number of selected items to maxselection

749058
command-prompt	cmd
to get the elevated command-prompt click on start and then type cmd followed by ctrl+shift+enter

749063
dialog	pop-up
when you right-click and choose run as administrator do you get any kind of pop-up dialog at all

749063
dialog	pop-up
if you get no pop-up dialog at all then my guess is one of the following has happened

749068
struct	unions
c uses a form of type equivalence that falls between name and structural equivalence and which can be loosely described as name equivalence for struct and unions structural equivalence for everything else.

749071
mousedown	keydown
you could also store the selection in other events such as mousedown or keydown which are known to be triggers before a change

749089
http	ssl
all other pages are accessible only through http over ssl

749093
32-bit	64bit
maybe a simpler methods would allow us to just access the 64bit gethashcode methods for serializing this string so that we get the same results for 32-bit and 64bit calls.

749097
boost	stl
this is the easiest solution that comes to my mind as neither the stl nor boost contains anything to do it easier

749119
arrays	map
the each method is meant to be an immutable iterator where as the map method can be used as an iterator but is really meant to manipulate the supplied arrays and return a new arrays

749119
arrays	map
another important thing to note is that the each function returns the original arrays while the map function returns a new arrays

749119
arrays	map
you can also use the map function to remove an item from an arrays

749119
callback	methods
ironically the callback arguments used in the each methods are the reverse of the callback arguments in the map function so be careful

749136
http	ssl
you need to get a cdn that supports serving files over http then use that cdn for the ssl requests

749139
output	mode
one way to get top output is to send -b switch to run top in batch mode and use exec to get output in an arrays with one element per line

749144
contains	set
as noah said it is probably easiest to set up a dummy data source contains the available fields especially if you haven t worked with mail merge before

749155
attributes	properties
just specify the formula attributes for that properties

749158
arrays	map
map on the other hand takes an arrays and returns a new arrays with each element changed by the function

749180
value	field
can i create the struct somewhere with default value of dont care and just set the field i care about after i declare it as a local variables

749198
attributes	properties
but not selected the following span which differs from the original in that the style attributes has a display properties whose value is inline instead of none

749198
webforms	asp.net
i am aware inline styles are evil but an asp.net webforms validator control is generating it and doing a lot of good as well as evil

749199
priority-queue	heap
besides the obvious answer of a priority-queue when would a heap be useful in my programming adventures

749203
web-config	app-config
i ve found a couple of snippets of information pertaining to app-config web-config that hints at almost codeless configuration of bcl components directly through the app-config

749206
radix-sort	shellsort
while people have spent careers worrying about which is the best sort algorithm for very large databases for small n it really doesn t matter whether you use quick sort heapsort radix-sort shellsort optimized bubble sort unoptimized bubble sort etc

749214
value	field
otherwise the best solution i can think of is treating a value of 0 in a struct field as a do not update flag - so you just create a funciton to return a zeroed out struct and then use this to update

749214
value	field
however this might not be very feasible if 0 is a valid value for field in the struct

749215
binary-tree	nodes
if you think of a heap as a binary-tree stored in linear order by depth with the root nodes first then the children of that nodes next then the children of those nodess next

749215
children	nodes
then the children of a nodes at index n are at 2n+1 and 2n+2

749218
python	java
this is also the approach taken by python or at least cpython the most common implementation. the jython and ironpython implementations also take this approach but compile to the bytecode for the java and c# virtual machines resepectively

749218
processor	cpu
in some cases this can actually outperform native compilation as it is free to perform runtime analysis on the code and can use specific features of the current processor while static compilation may need to compile for a lowest common denominator cpu

749264
hexagonal-tiles	tile
i think it would be interesting to cover a globe with hexagonal-tiles and be able to map a geographic coordinate to a tile

749284
google-chrome	opera
i m not sure how opera google-chrome or safari handle sessions

749300
arrays	map
map calls the function on each element and stores the result in a new arrays which it returns

749313
entity-framework	ado.net
edit 3 others would also suggest things such as the ado.net entity-framework

749330
coldfusion	railo
btw for those interested in running railo cf or open bd on tomcat matt woodward will be speaking on that this week at the online coldfusion meetup in the 6pm slot on thursday april 16

749333
pascal	delphi
in old day pascal delphi when you wrote

749334
gridview	listview
i have a listview that is configured as a gridview

749335
selected	cells
to begin with i want to be able to selected cells diagonally apart from horizontally and vertically

749347
google-chrome	opera
everything works great in ie6 ff3 google-chrome and opera

749349
filtering	sorting
jxtable from swinglabs has several nice features column control toggle column visibility highlighting rows sorting rows filtering rows horizontal scroll control and resizing columns and it is free

749359
python	perl
i am open for anything also languages i do not know like python perl etc

749368
firefox	opera
i have jquery code which works offline in safari and opera but neither in firefox 3.1 nor 3.08

749382
constructor	object
the bullettext argument is actually a constructor to the paragraph object not the tag - try this

749387
safari	opera
both safari and opera come with javascript debuggers

749402
instances	self
then in gencontrollers in the viewdidload methods i create an instances of another controllers getinfocontrollers and insertsubview into self.view which at this point self is the original instances of gencontrollers

749416
methods	extend
you can extend this methods by creating a dictionary with a delegates as values

749417
contains	set
however in ie specifically 6 and 7 if the content is simply contains in text nodes the height is not calculated and just defaults to the height set in css or on the height attributes on the iframe

749418
contains	elements
since you don t care which elements in the list contains the keyword you can scan the whole list once as one string instead of one item at the time

749418
order	join
for that you need a join character that you know won t occur in the keyword in order to avoid false positives

749425
subclassing	superclass
all the classes involved are subclassing of a common superclass

749425
subclassing	superclass
i want to return an arrays of classes that are all subclassing of a particular superclass

749439
richfaces	icefaces
regarding drag-and-drop i ll suggest that you look at richfaces or icefaces

749439
selected	button
the richfaces component set also got an ordering list under rich selected but it doesn t seem to allow for changing the ordering by entering a number rather it is done using up and down button

749441
environment	building
this is highly dependent on what environment are you building in

749442
revision	updates
we do this for our large repo the first thing a client does is to checkout the top level directory only then to get more data use the repo browser to go to the desired directory and updates to this revision on it

749442
updating	updates
updates tends to be slow the more files you have on windows that is ntfs seems to be particularly poor with the locking strategy used for updating

749448
contains	set
i have a vb.net data set that contains data from multiple tables

749458
abstract	extends
the object html-input is abstract thus on runtime time it is always implemented by an object that is extends html-input

749458
implements	final
due to the nature of final methods it is never overridden so there is no callstack the error comes beceause the compiler sees it as just html-input and not an implements html-input. ref he thinks there will be no callstack

749469
mousedown	mouseup
now when you mousedown inside the span move the mouse anywhere outside the frame and mouseup the span stays gray forever -- css considers it active forever

749488
type-safety	generics
this will function but without the type-safety that generics can provide you

749488
type-safety	generics
if it s performance that you are worried about just use an arrayslist so you are just using a thin wrapper around an arrays but with all of the type-safety guarantees provided by generics

749498
handler	service
enabling service tracing will allow you to log service calls and exceptions and see the stack trace without the additional coding and polluting your client with service exception handler

749527
sql-server	oracle
it supports sql-server sybase ase sybase sql anywhere and oracle

749528
stderr	stdout
also ensure that you do not have stdin stdout or stderr being intercepted by the java process

749534
unmanaged	c++-cli
if you actually want managed objects your easiest solution is probably to write the wrapper in c++-cli formerly managed c++ as that provides a full feature set for managed unmanaged interop

749542
attributes	properties
associated with a properties through an attributes

749546
event-listener	listener
when i add the same event-listener and handler function directly into my zoomgrid class the same class that the event is dispatched from then the listener and handler work properly

749553
xsd	xml
i am studying computer science and we have to do a programming project which must be strongly related to xml and using xsd and xslt or xquery xpath at least

749556
contains	elements
anywhere where you see collection elements as in the case of the and elements the individual elements contains within may vary depending on what you are adding the specific attributes on those elements will vary depending on exactly what you re adding to the collection

749567
firebird	mysql
one day i ask in mysql forum if event like in firebird or interbase exist in mysql and i see that someone answer yes i m really not sure

749576
contains	elements
i can find the sid referenced by if i start the search at which is the great-great-grandparent of the elements that contains the reference but i can also find it if i start searching from

749576
document	element
does the spec provide a limit to how close to the document root an sid referenced by a particular element may be found

749580
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning 1.6.x

749580
revision	updates
basically everyone checks out tops folder + children only then selectively updates to revision the folders they need to checkout fully

749581
click	mouse
the piece of functionality you re looking for is a repeatbutton this will fire it s click event repeatedly while the mouse button is held down

749589
runlevel	shutdown
if you re a second late on the draw for shutdown -c and already root on the console a very fast # init 5 will cancel a shutdown after init changes runlevel

749598
json	xml
convert the data into xml or json and output it to another element like div or textarea

749610
kdevelop	kde
i had such a hell of a time trying that with kde and kdevelop a year or so ago that i completely gave up and went back to msvc

749610
qt-creator	kde
unless you really really want to develop for kde only and are determined to use kde functionality that goes above and beyond qt i would choose qt-creator

749612
selected	listbox
the user selects a title and the author or authors of the selected title will be listed in a listbox

749614
32-bit	64bit
microsoft does not support visual-studio 2003 on vista anymore no matter whether 32-bit or 64bit version

749614
versioning	upgrade
if a direct upgrade to .net 2.0 or greater is not an option i would use a development vm with the older vs versioning to maintain the .net 1.1 projects

749625
ubuntu	linux
this is on linux ubuntu 8.04 and os x 10.5.6

749627
configuration	upgrade
you should at least upgrade to .net 1.1 sp1 even if you don t care about running a supported configuration

749628
environment	building
i have a makefile downloading building and deploying a runtime environment which is certified for my trunk versioning

749628
versioning	upgrade
the sql code that brings up your database layout versioning to upgrade

749628
versioning	downgrade
the sql code that bring down your database layout versioning to downgrade

749660
hide	show
how can you show one drawer and hide the rest at the startup

749665
order	add
you may have to add a typeconverter or other designer support in order for asp.net to convert your preferred textual representation into an instance of the class

749726
deep-copy	object
couldn t you just make a deep-copy of the previous object and use that as the next object allowing users to overwrite any fields that changed

749726
deep-copy	object
unfortunately making a deep-copy of an object messes up the objectcontext when relationships are involved

749757

if you just need to access databases you should have a look the various access strategies - datareader dataset linq to sql entity-framework nhibernate - and pick a solution

749899
any	set
using it you can set any field in your model to behave as an upload field like so

749906
temporary	copy
writing to the properties width and hight of this copy makes no sense because it is just a temporary copy and not backed by memory anywhere

749921
groovy	scala
actually groovy also has optional static typing so i ll include it as well but most static-type uh types seem to prefer scala

749934
having	select
this has the advantage that you don t need to pre-fill the database or run a separate select query -- you can do this all from within one insert statement by having your n just be an auto-increment and have a separate id column that defaults to the n m

by subset i mean any subset including the empty set and not necessarily a proper subset.

749967
any	set
if so this solution will stripes out the duplicates lines leaving only one copy of any given line in the set of files as a whole

749967
command-line	cmd
i recommend the latter as your file names at least in the sample files you provided do not naturally list out in order when using simple cmd like ls on the command-line or glob in the perl script

749990
python	perl
i know i could just write a bash perl python script or some such but i d like it to be at least moderately user-friendly so i could teach my intelligent but less technically-inclined workers how to use it and make their own modifications

entity-framework	nhibernate
while entity-framework is a capable orm in many respects it is not as mature as nhibernate and there are a few reasons in this case specifically why i think it s probably not the best choice

751107
base-class	inherited
if you want to use the currently supplied tools for entity-framework you will probably need to migrate your code to generated partial classes which inherited from the entityobject entity-framework base-class

751107
entity-framework	nhibernate
i m sure transparent lazy loading is something you are used to with an oodbms and it is supported by most other orm s including nhibernate of course but with entity-framework you will find that you need to explicitly .load related objects both parent and child relationships before you reference them in your code

751112
procedure	records
if i want to use that stored procedure i need loop through the records either by cursor or by writing loop myself

751143

751488
contains	set
if the browser is not submitting in utf-8 chances are you re failing to set the charset of the html page contains the form

751500
exception-handling	try-catch
however whenever i pair this process w a web service methods that involves a database call i get the following exception-handling depending upon whether or not i wrap in a try-catch

751515
stderr	stdout
that sort of approach is only likely to work if your ide output information to stdout stderr etc

751515
stderr	stdout
the scripting launches your ide and captures stdout and stderr which will give you both normal output and any errors

751517
any	set
fortunately since you have a very limited set of urls you re interested in you can use any of the techniques above

751561
implements	abstract
i intend to implements the repository-pattern so i can abstract out ad exchange integration allowing different implementsations in the future

751566
methods	extend
what about methods that don t specifically extend string or datetime but rather target or return a string or datetime

751571
endpoint	uri
the determination of the complete endpoint uri is then performed using either the localserverrooturi property or using the application url as our services are exposed by the very same server that serves the application s swf which is as far as i understand your case too

751578
constructor	object
no safety is lost because you don t need to control the value of any expression involving a object -- you only need to check the constraints at a time when a t becomes a namely in s constructor and in any of the mutating operators

751594
constructor	private
you could arrange it so that all the constructors called a common maybe private this ... constructor that is the only one that calls down to the base ... - but that depends on whether a it is useful to do so and b whether there is a single base ... ctor that would let you

751598
.when	ready
to detect .when the iframe has loaded and its document is ready

751609
nested	order
just a wild guess maybe it helps to set the controls parents in reverse hierarchical order first set the parent of the most deeply nested controls then that of their parents and so on

751623
subtract	add
clutching at straws perhaps add the number of rows+1 then if that works subtract the number of rows -s

751626
benchmarking	profiling
i can use various profiling and benchmarking tools for that

751627
switching	screens
whatever to resume it we can see video tv stream video in a reduce mode and if we click on the screens it switching to a full screens mode

751632
contains	sorted
consider l1 l2 l3 as lists contains n1 n2 and n3 integers in sorted order respectively

751639
margins	padding
make sure you have reset the padding and margins to 0 prior or the output will differentiate cross browser

751656
children	tree
i don t know if the effect of setting disablealign on the root of a tree of controls will flow on to it s children or not

751664
value	field
same goes for the subclass unless you need either field to have a particular value when you instantiate which in your example is not the case since you already have the default constructor

751664
constructor	object
also remember that any constructor should put the instance of the object in a correct state

751666
order	add
in the order table you would add a column for the id field s from the customer table

751684
margins	padding
make sure that you have reset the default padding and margins for the items before expressing yours

751688
droppable	draggable
when the mouse is released the draggable happens to fall on both droppable divs two droppable events are fired

751688
droppable	draggable
what i would like to happen is that in this scenario the draggable will fall on only one droppable and nother other

751692
triggers	insert
i agree with the triggers idea although i would use a join to insert instead of a subquery

751702
google-chrome	safari
when using a form with many text input webkit safari google-chrome submits the form when enter is pressed in any input element

751705
linux	osx
regarding my earlier question about the point of mono on windows let s say that i develop an app against the windows mono runtime so that it will also run on linux osx etc

751708
value	field
i d also like to log the data that was deleted but would prefer not to hassle with writing code for each field and value

751724
push	pull
you can either push or pull the data

751743
punctuation	comma
i often need to list items separated by comma spaces or punctuation addresses are a classic example this is overkill for an address and is for the sake of an example

751743
arrays	loops
in a loops for example what s the best way of determining the last item of an arrays or the loops condition is met to not include a comma at the end of the list

751756
wxwidgets	mfc
personally i d recommend avoiding mfc in favour of wxwidgets

751760
exception-handling	try-catch
the exception-handling is happily rethrown and it s almost as if the try-catch didn t exist

751762
configuration	installation
i ve checked through the sql reporting service configuration settings the help files and forums and have not located a solution for this problem on a native installation

751772
exception-handling	try-catch
if that s the case the try-catch is pointless except as you say to obfuscate where the exception-handling occurred

751799
any	set
jaxp is a pluggable api a set of interfaces and abstract classes with a reference implementation by sun but it uses the factory approach to allow you to swap out to a different implementation one that might be faster in certain types of uses without having to change any of your code just by changing a system property

751799
stax	sax
it include dom sax stax and xslt

751799
stax	sax
sun has a good comparison page for dom sax stax

751799
perl	c++
it also includes libraries for c++ and perl

751849
derived-class	base-class
i think i can t get to the methodss of base-class or the intermediate derived-class simply using the most derived instance without modifying the methods signatures of the 3 classes

751856
if-statement	arrays
philip s solution is probably best when working with arrayss if you don t have to filter out empty values but if you can t use the arrays functions--for instance when dealing with query results returned from mysqli_fetch_object --then one solution is just a simple if-statement

751857
contains	any
contains spaces any characters valid

751867
output	mode
take the output in sql-server management studio within text output mode and do alt-left_click-drag a square over the column names and copy this column based selection

751867
triggers	insert
do the same thing for the columnname... values in the right of the insert and you now have an insert that will build the data you want but will not waste too much time in the triggers

751869
required	checked
by making the parameters optional your gui will need to checked to make sure all required parameters are passed for individual inserts and adding a parameter for a batchnumber to be passed in for set-based operation you can put the logic for both in one proc

751873
execute	declare
so that you can declare a collection or a methods parameter as some base type and include pass it a mix of derived types and yet when within the code even though each object is assign to a ref variables declare as the base type for each one the actual implementation which will be execute for any virtual methods call will be that implementation defined in the class definition for the actual tyoe of each object.

751874
radio-button	selected
just make sure that you selected the radio-button link to the data source by creating a linked table. if you first remove the existing table and create a linked table with the same name you just might fool your application into viewing the text file through access as a proxy

linux	osx
when developing with mono for an app to be run on windows and mac osx and maybe linux which would you suggest winforms or gtksharp for the gui and why

751909
twitter	tweets
since twitter can only do a posting that is 140 characters or less you should make sure that the incoming tweets string is likewise 140 characters or less

751912
datagrid	listbox
the reason behind this is that the datagrid supports user-interface virtualization and the listbox does not

751912
datagrid	listbox
this means that the datagrid only creates visual elements for the visible items while the listbox creates visual elements for all of its items

751912
selected	listbox
whenever you have to selected from a list of items that can be very large use the datagrid instead of the listbox

751912
datagrid	listbox
you can style the datagrid and use the templatecolumn to make it look just like a listbox

751932
processor	cpu
there is an issue with certain types of processor when dealing with very small floating point numbers which can cause cpu spikes

751950
uitableview	uiview
the best way is to add a label and uiactivityindicator on top of the uitableview in your uiview

751971
reflection.emit	dynamicmethod
you can thus work around c# s limitation by using reflection.emit in combinations with a dynamicmethod

751989
memcheck	valgrind
valgrind --tool memcheck --leak-check full .

751993
delphi	vba
i believe there s a bit of vb vba and delphi knowledge present in the company it s not an it company and i m not likely to program it myself

752001
implements	extends
for once we manage to create d s in all places where formerly were c s somebody else finds another interface j useful and derives e extends c implements j

752001
implements	extends
rather now we d need a new class f extends c implements i j.

752017
tapestry	wicket
see my comparison of wicket and tapestry 5 difference between apache tapestry and wicket

752022
swing	swt
i don t think there is a mature .net gui toolkit for os x at this point at least nothing at the level of swing or swt

752028
versioning	upgrade
i have a bad edit was hyper-conservative dba who won t upgrade the dev server to the same versioning as the production one so i can t just use apply and be done with it

752031
hide	show
alternatively you can always do this in server-side code and can then show hide any controls that runat server depending upon any criteria you like

752043
javassist	cglib
if you need similar runtime compatibility with classes i suggest you take a look at cglib or javassist opensource libraries

752103
triggers	insert
if your business logic allows and you have default values you can query from the database for each new parent record you can then use a before insert triggers on the parent table to populate the non nullable child column

752116
system.web	.net
since the .net runtime will only load assemblies when they are actually needed the winforms assembly should never actually be loaded through any usage of system.web

752121
click	mouse
i use a pen tablet to get around wrist issues while click a mouse and it works fine under windows except when i m using java applications

752121
click	mouse
i get hyperlinkevent.activated events on every single click with the mouse but i do not get hyperlinkevent.activated events on every single click with the pen

752121
click	mouse
one big difference between a pen and a mouse is that when you click a button on a mouse it s really easy to cause the button-click without mouse movement

752139
sql-injection	dynamic-sql
using dynamic-sql is very bad practice since it not only may fail because of conversion issues and data length but also allows sql-injection

752171
hsqldb	oracle
i recently used byte in a domain class for storing file it was working fine until i moved my application from hsqldb to oracle express

752182
entity-framework	ado.net
i ve got the following ado.net entity-framework entity data model

752193
droppable	draggable
you could use the data methods on the droppable elements to store a reference to the draggable they ve accepted so far

752193
droppable	draggable
every time you hover a draggable over one of these droppables the system will check to see if that droppable s id is already in its mysite.dropped_items arrays

752196
checkbox	button
but when i check some checkbox and hit the button after postback all checkbox

752208
contains	set
it will contains a file with the execute bit set

752209
attributes	properties
both file version from assemblyfileversion attributes and product version from assemblyinformationalversion attributes contribute to the version resource as seen in explorer s file properties

752230
implements	extends
define class d which extends c and implements i

752230
constructor	object
define a constructor d c c which essentially clones the state of the given c object into a new d object

752248
global-asax	web-config
generate your web-config from global-asax

752253
json	xml
that s not a json object it s xml

752257
required	checked
the main class should do something that checked for the presence of the required library versioning in its static initializer

752269
char-pointer	pointers
or if you know that it s the first 10mb of the file and that your page size for your vm is say 4k then you can just cast the mmap pointers to a char-pointers and just iterate through the pages

752280
constructor	private
you can favour immutability by using private final fields and constructor injection

752313
jqmodal	jquery
update substituted jquery ui dialog with jqmodal and everything works

752323
data-structures	tree
there are good ways to implement immutable balanced tree queues stacks dequeues and other data-structures

752328
children	nodes
as for your graph you could choose to make your nodess immutable and let another class take care of the connections between them or you could make a mutable nodes that takes care of its own children and has an immutable value class

752329
double	int
i tested and the double slash is required to force int division in python 3

752347
put	get
just put a panelgrid in the footer and use style sheets to get the look you want

752365
updating	updates
we have a sales-force system with 100 client and we are updating database at application startup true our is a desktop application. i like this approach it s safe and iterative if we have indeterministic startpoint is the client database new or only updates to versioning x.y.z

752369
contains	elements
either you can create theme based on the role - admintheme will contains admin.css globaltheme will contains global.css or else you can dynamically write the elements in the tag after giving the runat server attributes to it

752388
directory	folder
create a new folder within the dynamicdata custompages directory with the same name as the entityset collection of your entity ex dynamicdata custompages employees for the employee entity

752461
python	perl
naive methods like sed perl python etc

752468
wpf-controls	richtextbox
wpf-controls can be â unparentedâ and â reparentedâ at will so just make the richtextbox instance available in the context shared throughout your wizard and make sure you unparent reparent as you move from page to page

752477
hide	show
if you wish to enable disable show hide controls based on the role this would be nothing more than security by obscurity since switching off styles or setting a browser to a specific css file to override what is actually served would easily display all that is secret

752477
firefox	opera
some browsers like opera firefox happily cache all that is cacheable so the user will have to click reload page

752492
communication	messages
it receives messages over udp and delegates the work to do to a different process by communication to that process through it s published api whatever ipc mechanism that process employes

752496
silverlight	wpf
with wpf you would use a croppedbitmap but unfortunately that doesn t exist in silverlight

752503
numeric	zero
match the numeric portion of the string and then use the features of your language to pad the number out with leading zero

752517
ip-address	proxy
i created a new site in iis reverse proxy the ip-address and voila my intranet application is exposed to the internet

752529
url-rewriting	rewrite
this way the url-rewriting can hook into that methods and rewrite entire urls

752534
http	ssl
use ssl http for login and user management so no plaintext passwords are transfered

752536
versioning	upgrade
another alternative would be to upgrade the versioning of python to a more recent one but you will probably have to regression test your application and upgrade the versioning of visual-studio to 2005 or 2008

752537
constructor	object
reflection based frameworks are complicated by immutable object since they requires constructor injection

752542
shell	bash
see also why doesn t cd work in a bash shell script

752546
constructor	object
object passed to constructor

752561
moss	wss
however for wss 3.0 deployment this is not possible as audiences is a moss thing

752573
solaris	aix
a compulsion of ld_preload on hp platform only and not on other unix flavors aix linux and solaris

752573
perl-module	xml-libxml
i built perl-module xml-libxml common on all of unix flavors.i had to specifically do ld_preload for libcl.2 library on hp platform only

752610
disposable	dispose
in your example above yes if you don t employ a using statement the object will be dispose but only if the recommended disposable pattern that is disposing of resources from a class finalizer if applicable has been implements for the class in question in your example the font class

752617
python	perl
i haven t tried it but inline python lets you call python from perl

752617
python	perl
you should be able to use a thin bit of perl to load your python app and then use the perl python package that comes with i p to access your perl objects

752639
webforms	asp.net
i am using asp.net webforms c#

752668
solaris	linux
it has other spellings on other platforms too - solaris and linux happen to share much the same set of env

752675
disposable	dispose
i find that it s best practice to dispose of disposable objects if you no longer need them unless there is a justifiable reason not to such as you don t own the object

752692
switching	screens
often times i want to look at 2 document maybe the aspx file and the cs file on two different screenss but i can t drag one to the other screens so i have to just switching back and forth

752695
jndi	jmx
to do this use service jmx rmi jndi rmi remote-machine port jmxrmi where remote-machine is whatever machine your trying to connect to and port is 11099 as the remote process

752729
keydown	keyup
so in both examples you would get 3 keydown keyup messages but in the first you get 3 wm_char and in the second you only get 2

752754
vb.net	vb6
edit ant has correctly pointed out that on error goto -1 is a vb.net statement and isn t valid in vb6

752805
global-variables	call
there are a few common uses of unsafe statics -- for example in the singleton pattern -- but be aware that despite any pretty names you call them you re just mutating global-variables

752814
getter	setter
the next step might be to use this struct or class in the object itself...but since you re using getter and setter the decision of how to represent it internally will be transparency to the users of the class anyways so this decision will relate more to how complex the class is than anything

752820
oracle	mysql
as far as i know toad only exists naturally for oracle ms sql db2 and mysql

752822
windows-xp	windows
it just happens in windows-xp in windows vista the email and the inline image are sent just fine

752830
any	set
is there any official set of functionality supported in iis 7 vs iis 6

752843
constructor	object
as code evolves i really like the fact that i can use the compiler to help me find all the places where an object is created when changing the signature of a constructor

752844
32-bit	x86
what would be the negative effects of installing a legacy 32-bit app into the c program files instead of the c program files x86

752847
hide	show
what i wish to accomplish is use the anchor tag to toggle between the two div tags hide the one and show the other and vice versa

752849
.when	ready
the object will stay in memory non-deterministic memory-management for a while longer but the file will be closed .when you say so ready to be opened again right away

752853
.when	ready
the finalizer is called .when the gc is ready to destroy the object and this can occur at anytime in your application

752859
youtube	vimeo
with that in mind what are the main security concerns xss etc in allowing users to embed videos from external sources like youtube vimeo etc

752870
32-bit	64bit
or say you are developing a 32-bit and a 64bit version of an application you could install both of them and run them side by side by putting them in the separate program files folders

752871
methods	extend
you can remove this restriction if you extend the code gen in the methods body to support all expression types

752871
ref	out
it could use a lot more validation and it doesn t work with ref or out parameters because of expression tree limitations

752876
subshell	bash
bash forks and stars a subshell way before it or your kernel even considers what it s supposed to do in there

752878
sftp	ftp
there are many freely available ftp or sftp packages

752884
32-bit	64bit
but basically not all floating point values can be represented by a certain number of bits 32-bit or 64bit or whatever

752886
ifilter	acrobat
i read another post about using the pdf ifilter driver install with adobe acrobat 9 which can be referenced through com

752903
logfile	tail
i basically want to mimic the way may log viewers stick to the tail of a logfile as it is updates

752918
moss	wss
you want to use the an splistitem s createdby or modifiedby value and the openxml api to do this so you do not have to use the word object model on the wss moss server

752942
sql-server	postgresql
if you re looking for something like sql-server management studio but for postgresql how about ems sql manager or lightning admin

752948
malloc	free
and if malloc fails -- meaning it returned null--then you don t call free on the result

752949
click	mouse
when updating the data provider for a menu bar component the state of the menu items fails to update until the user interacts with the menus rolls the mouse over them click them etc

752961
javascript	dom
the end-product of gwt ends up being something similar to what the other js frameworks provide - a javascript solution that for the most part abstracts-away all the browser and dom inconsistencies so you can focus on real workâ

752967
hosts-file	hosts
check the hosts

752968
hosts-file	hosts
check the hosts located here c windows system32 drivers etc

752970
ms-access	mysql
however my host does not support ms sql my host supports ms-access and mysql

752979
hosts-file	hosts
does the entry in the hosts look like this

752985
performance-monitor	perfmon
you want to look at perfmon otherwise called performance-monitor in admin tools off the start menu

752985
any	set
in vista you can t add individual counters any more you add the entire set of counters grouping under an object - so for my example you d add the network interface object then you d see all the individual counters on the graph after you click ok

753003
contains	any
based on one of the suggestions below i enabled the autogenerated in linq for that column and now i get the following error -- the target table of the dml statement cannot have any enabled triggers if the statement contains an output clause without into clause

753014
any	set
the behaviour is as if access 2007 is respecting the lack of option explicit and working as expected but access 2003 thinks option explicit is set even though it never appears in any code files

753026
web-applications	gwt
gwt generates web-applications from java code and javascript libraries can be used as a component within web-applications

753030
sql-server	oracle
i d like to use oracle instead of sql-server for the database.

753032
javascript	dom
you can use this to dynamically load a remote javascript by created a new script element and setting the src attribute then loading into the dom which could set a variable

753033
system.data	.net
the mysql .net connector is basically the mysql version of the system.data namespace in ..net with nearly identical functionality naming except for the mysql prefixes

753049
mousedown	mouseup
as stated in the comments to lucero s question mousedown fires after the selectedvaluechange event so i has to use mouseup instead

753052
formatting	printing
when printing a line in an html file i m trying to find a way to only show the contents of each html element and not the formatting itself

753060
factors	primes
there exists b such that for all c if c is a factors of b and c is primes then c equal 2

753065
32-bit	x86
i get 10 11 on my 32-bit x86 linux system running gcc 4.3.2 too

753072
contains	any
say you re writing a text editor and it needs a does this file contains any digits feature

753083
beautifulsoup	lxml
you can use either a different html parsing like lxml or beautifulsoup -- one that offers functions to extract just text

753087
.when	ready
finally i was ready to deliver it and be done .when they asked if i could just make it run on the web first

753100
external	host
my major concern at the moment is that we use wse 3.0 quite a bit mostly to consume external .asmx web-services but we also host a few ourselves

753114
versioning	upgrade
once you upgrade to a new versioning of visual-studio you will be forced to upgrade your project files as well

753114
versioning	upgrade
once the upgrade is complete the file will no longer be compatible with previous versioning of visual-studio

753118
digits	zero
you can either use a mask and zero test to see if it is even possible if there are any digits in a range or if your simd operations are fast enough on large enough vectors you could do iterate through tests for specific numerical value in a vector of bytes faster than doing character compares

753123
dependency-injection	interceptor
you can get dependency-injection working with nhibernate fairly easily though by writing an interceptor that will build up the object for you via property setter injection

753125
hosts-file	hosts
once we added the mapping of the server name to ip-address via system32 drivers etc hosts everything started to work properly

753130
entity-framework	ado.net
trying to dig into ado.net entity-framework

753134
click	mouse
the panels has a little sizing thumb grip on it that the user can just click and drag with the mouse

753147
protected	public
make _s a protected search type expose it as a public property and assign searcha to it in class a and searchb to it in class b

more info is at the w3c - element identifiers the id and class attributes the html 4.01 specifications

753205
sftp	ftps
i don t remember offhand if it supports sftp or ftps but it likely does

753211
selected	cells
apparently in excel you can selected a set of cells and name them with the name box

753211
numeric	zero
however if you have sample data that has a value of zero but is formatted as the first row it treats that column as text and inserts numeric value with a single quote in front 123.34

753211
any	set
any ideas on how to set this up properly so that data is formatted correctly the metadata read from excel is proper to the real data and formatting inherits from the first row of data not the headers in excel

753213
any	set
it s not needed to set provider handle or any of that stuff

753224
windows-xp	windows
i want to set up a replication between two different computers that run ms sql-server 2008 the master runs on windows vista and the slave will run on windows-xp

753235
access-control	authentication
this is normally used for things like inserting database transactions performance logging logging statements so you can drop the calls from the source code and make it a lot cleaner access-control so you separate the implementation and authentication etc

753262
msbuild	nant
you could create a custom msbuild task or nant if you are using that which checks the assembly through reflection after it is built and then fail the build if it doesn t have the required attributes

753272
distance	polygons
to trap this case calculate the perpendicular distance of ab and xy to each polygons center points

753283
document	editing
if you open the document in an sdi application then every createprocess call returns a process handle for an application which you can wait for - this will return when the application editing the document closes

753285
sqldatasource	gridview
if i bind gridview to sqldatasource then the first time page will be created gridview will display columns retrieved from data source

753285
any	set
basically what is going on is once you have set the datasourceid to null or an empty string the control takes this as an indication from the consumer of the control that they do not wish to bind any data at all even viewstate data

753285
contains	set
so if you set datasourceid to null inside page_load but gridview only checks datasourceid moments before binding which happens much after page_load then until datasourceid is checked viewstate contains data from previous data source should still be available inside page_load and still available for example inside an event handler subscribed to an event that caused a postback

753287
insertion-sort	quicksort
in java the arrayss.sort methods use merge sort or a tuned quicksort depending on the datatypes and for implementation efficiency switch to insertion-sort when fewer than seven arrays elements are being sorted

753287
python	java
a recently accepted bug report indicates that the sun implementation of java will use python timsort in the future

753323
uisegmentedcontrol	uiswitch
uiswitch is the only thing that does this at the moment though some have had good experiences using the uisegmentedcontrol for this as well

753334
any	set
basically what is going on is once you have set the datasourceid to null or an empty string the control takes this as an indication from the consumer of the control that they do not wish to bind any data at all even viewstate data

753337
contains	set
it is contains inside of a splitcontainer and the picturebox is set to fill the side of the panels that it resides

753374
constructor	object
if you have such a constructor then the compiler will very likelt construct a single object and not make any copies at all to perform the return

753386
grouping	sorting
what it comes down to is that the dictionary you have already gives you a natural grouping which linq won t be able to help any more with unless you are dealing with an operation other than grouping sorting projection filtering

753389
webforms	asp.net
the integration between jquery and asp.net webforms is rather problematic and not so natural because asp.net is built on different concept.

753389
webforms	asp.net
so if you are working with asp.net webforms i would suggest you to use server-side components instead it can be microsoft s own asp treeview or other 3rd-party webforms-aimed components

753389
webforms	asp.net
i am not saying that the integration between jquery and asp.net webforms is totally impossible

753389
webforms	asp.net
but this won t work with asp.net webforms as i ve explained before

753397
selected	cells
the first column has cells which have a drop down validation with names and the second will activate only if a certain name from the adjacent cell is selected

753400
getter	setter
but if the data is non-trivial enough that you really do need setter getter then it is non-trivial enough to need error-handling as well

753400
getter	setter
so in those cases your getter setter should be returning some kind of error code or doing something else to indicate something bad has happened

753409
insertion-sort	mergesort
the algorithm at present is a mergesort with an insertion-sort once you get down to a certain size of sublists n.b

753789
identity-column	sql-server
what would be the fastest way in sql-server 2005 to pass this document into a stored procedure which would insert the parent and child records into a set of tables where the parent table has an identity-column and the child table refers to the parent by a foreign key

753800
codedom	.net
there are several tricks you can use to turn strings into code in .net codedom reflection.emit or even scripting the compiler in the shell

753832
png	gif
i save my frames as png files and then invoke imagemagick s convert.exe from python to create an animated gif

753847
methods	extend
it looks like the correct mechanism to do this is to extend mylocationoverlay then override the drawmylocation protected methods

753866
json	xml
as for web service performance use json scriptmethod instead of xml to move data back and forth

753869
aes	des
it s either storing them unencrypted run run screaming or encrypting them with a 2 way encryption des aes public-private key et al - trust them a little more

753872

reverse-dns	dns
to nfs mount the storage nfs wants to do a reverse-dns lookup but the dns server is a vm that can t start until the storage is nfs mounted

753898
installation	environment
make the perl5lib shell environment or the equivalent command-line -i option for perl include the installation path of the module

753917
put	get
if i did a redirect to a completely different application so i can t carry session etc and i use a get with the username and password in the querystring i could even use basic encryption if that helps but regardless and then when it gets to the page i check to make sure it came from the page i expected it to come from pull the values from the querystring put them in a session variables and then do a redirect back to the same page removing the querystring values so they can t be viewed by user

753919
versioning	migrate
i don t want to migrate to a certain versioning i just want to run a specific one

753921
canvas	scale
the following xaml is simply a polygon on a canvas that is scale x2000

753926
put	get
it s not really a good idea to put username and passwords in a get request even encrypted because

value	field
and if there is no piece of that sort on that field the value is 0

754000
selected	button
right-click on the windowss start button and selected explore to open windowss explorer windows will open

worksheet	excel
â left-click to highlight the xls excel worksheet file extension and click on the advanced button

754021
vb.net	vb6
if your already familiar with vb5 and vb6 and your just building small desktop utilities then i would recommend vb.net

754023
vb.net	vb6
i think that if you have used vb6 and access in the past picking up vb.net should be a breeze

754032
python	ruby
if you wanted something specifically for creating simple desktop applications you could look at a scripting language with tk such as ruby or python which also might also give you a change to learn a new language with different features

754034
vb.net	vb6
compared to the conceptual differences between com vb6 is based on com and .net the syntax differences between vb.net and c# are minor

754045
vb.net	vba
if you have used vb5 6 and vba before vb.net should feel pretty familiar

754047
project-management	project
which is free for one project and comes with other cool things to help with project-management

754048
httpresponse	request
if it returns an httpresponse object django won t bother calling any other request view or exception-handling middleware or the appropriate view

udp	rtp
the other answers cover good options re udp or a real protocol like rtp

754163
put	get
get it into php as a string binary data and then you can put it in the session

754166
scala	java
for example given the following code from scala by example pages 46-48 how would the equivalent java code for the eval method look like

754193
emacs	vim
i know of etexteditor and vim emacs

754206
any	set
the reason you were unable to set textwrapping on a button via a style is that button does not have a textwrapping dependency property or indeed any textwrapping property

754220
getter	setter
that new class should not have setter but getter only to make it immutable

754235
println	output
here s the output after adding a few println statements

754252
forwarding	port
ssh port forwarding

754252
forwarding	port
in this instance one could port forwarding db_server 3306 to web_server 3306

754253
aggregate	grouping
once you fix that you ll likely get some more errors like columns x y z not in an aggregate or grouping by

754253
aggregate	grouping
to your grouping by or perform some kind of aggregate on them

754258
tunnel	vpn
use a vpn tunnel such as openvpn to encrypt the communication

754263
thinking-sphinx	sphinx
what s happening here is that by default thinking-sphinx tells sphinx to use an english stemmer which allows for similar words by characters not by meaning to be considered matches so it puts baltimor and baltimore in the same basket

754263
put	get
if you want to get any part of any word matched then you need to put something like the following in configuration sphinx.yml

754290
order	join
i always try to put the expressions in join s in the following order

754330
required	checked
i keep checked if any of the arguments that my methods required are null as show below

754343
linux	unix
for the record posix-compliant systems including unix and linux support all characters except the null character 0 and forwards slash in filenames

754346
contains	any
consider the word there is no substring that contains all s and not any other character

754360
environment	building
no its not a fork as in different code - its building from the .org versioning and put through various tests qa environment certified if necessary etc.

754361
select	union
for instance if you have a supertype table with three subtyping tables and you need to display all three in a single form at once and you need to show not just the supertype date you end up with a choice of using three outer joins and nz or you need a union all of three mutually exclusive select statements one for each subtyping

754367
stdin	pipe
anything resembling being in a pipe of programs or closing and opening stdin stdout or stderr is my biggest area of concern

754368
value	field
i believe the following scripting will trace the text value of all dynamic text field in a fla unless there s some nasty nested case that i missed

754380
required	checked
i have not checked if either of them has a buffering though and it would required you to switching apis

754398
google-chrome	safari
there does not appear to be a way to do this in webkit thus safari and google-chrome

754399
hide	show
roothidden this show child elements of a collection but hide the root element itself

754404
logout	login
if it s likely that they will change so often as to make a logout login inconvenient you ll have to go with another approach

754409
selenium-ide	selenium
i definitely recommend getting selenium-ide if you don t know what you re doing because it does most things automatically and gives you an intro to how you would use selenium remote control

754410
queue	fifo
i m really not sure how to approach this but i am subscribing to events fired within a custom class and ideally i wish to queue them and handle them fifo as they come in

754410
contains	elements
this should effectively hit myqueue and iterate as it contains elements and do what i want though

754422
udp	tcp
i m creating a c# library and am going to be prefix most of the public classes with the protocol they use tcp udp etc and i came to a little dilemma should it be tcpxxxx or tcpxxxx

754439
data-structures	tree
it s been quite a while since i took data-structures and algorithms in college so i was surprised recently by a suggestion that recursion may not be the way tm to do tree traversal

754467
javascript	dom
references from javascript objects to dom objects are fine on their own but when a dom object has a link back to such a javascript object usually through an event handler you ve got a reference cycle

754467
arrays	map
for complicated long-running apps you might have to work around the problem for example by indirecting every event handler through a lookup map arrays so there is no direct reference from the dom object to the real event handler

754502
selected	button
that is it displays a list of items as usual but when the user selected an item in the list a clickable button should appear next to the item text

754502
selected	button
when the user selects a item in the list the ondrawitem method just re-positions this single button so that it appears next to the selected item

754502
selected	listbox
i have it 99 working the problem now is that when the listbox is scrolled and the selected item goes off-screen the button is still drawn to its previous position so it draws on top of the wrong item

754510
getter	setter
the readwrite variables will exist as properties with both a getter and a setter

754520
internationalization	localization
localization and internationalization whatâ s the difference

754529
breadth-first-search	depth-first-search
actually you should use queue for breadth-first-search and stack for depth-first-search

754543
rollback	commit
it s also good practice not perform any commit as part of the testcase and then you can rollback on teardown

754545
cassini	iis
perhaps testing it on iis if not cassini with a 64bit application-pool is causing a context switch somewhere which causes the mock identities if they get assigned as a thread s identity to get marshalled across a boundary like that - the lack of a serializable attribute will probably cause a typeloadexception

754545
32-bit	64bit
does it still throw if you set iis to use a 32-bit application-pool on your 64bit server

754556
quirks-mode	firefox
note that the the way the diggbar does it works only in quirks-mode in firefox

754556
quirks-mode	firefox
edit 3 it looks like you have to be in quirks-mode for this to work in firefox

754557
internationalization	globalization
according to the w3c globalization is another term for internationalization

754558
windows-xp	windows
let me give you an example you develop and test an application on windows vista 32 bit and then it fails at a coustomer site where they are running 64 bit windows-xp

754570
tuples	any
we ll do that as a linear transform such that it sorts the same as y m and such that for any y m tuples there is one and only value and all values are consecutive

754570
tuples	any
now what we have to test is inherent in our spec namely that for any tuples y m there is one and only one am and that am s are consecutive

754570
case-statement	case-when
the case-statement is just case-when test statements then passed else false end

754573
internationalization	globalization
g11n - globalization - doing both internationalization and localization steps

754574
any	set
part of the problem with html you can t just set an element of any thing to 100 height and have it take up the whole windows space

754574
any	set
one way to do this is by making the body have a pixel height of the windows and any thing inside the body set to 100 will be the size of the windows

754585
hash	md5
you can hash the url provided into something unique md5 or some other repeatable hash and store that in your db as a much shorter string

754602
sql-server	mysql
this would work in sql-server not sure what the exact mysql syntax would be.

754606

754693
type-conversion	int
you need to force a type-conversion to int from string

754694
octal	hex
you should provide a base argument as paolo mentions for otherwise it may be interpreted as octal if it has a leading 0 or hex if it has a leading 0x

754698
hash	md5
if not just use a standard hash function like md5 or sha1 and store the resulting data

754701
javascript	dom
ibm wrote a very good paper on differences throughout the browsers including javascript at most differences are in the dom and not necessarily in javascript

754702
submitchanges	datacontext
note also that if the common code relates to things like audit who when you can also do this by overriding the datacontext s submitchanges methods and calling getchangeset

754704
python	ruby
since you don t know how to program i agree with recommendations here that you start with python or ruby etc

754704
python	ruby
if you love to write programs then continue playing with python ruby but at the very least make yourself familiar with c

754723
innodb	myisam
plus you have to make your tables myisam which is generally less suitable than innodb

754724
ubuntu	linux
portable ubuntu would allow you to run a linux environment directly from within windows without any messy x windows setups or having to set up a virtual machine

754729
copy-constructor	constructor
do copy-constructor likewise call the copy-constructor of the members or do they also call the default constructor

754746
random-seed	generator
well you could generator a random-seed when doing the first query in your app-code and then keep that seed between requests - and supply this seed to the function

754764
32-bit	64bit
is this compatibility issue a major enough issue for me getting a 32-bit os or is 64bit windows-vista still better despite the compatibility issue

754789
32-bit	64bit
if you have 8gb ram or more definitely go for 64bit as if you run a 32-bit operating system you will be throwing 4+ gb away windows 32-bit operating systems can only address some value around 3.4gb

754791
daemons	systemd
i m working on a c daemons that monitors a configuration file updatess using a web interface and then uses the linux tc traffic control command to updates the systemd traffic shaping configuration

754793
startup	launch
i have both of these projects with the same solution i have set the class library as the startup project to launch autocad

754797
python	ruby
i believe it can be done in languages like ruby and python with a usage of mixins

754798
shuffle	unique
in a situation like that i might see if there s a way to create a list of the product ids i m assuming each product has some sort of unique id and shuffle it

754802
daemons	systemd
why don t you look at the source code of the tc program and figure out how to modify the systemd traffic shaping configuration directly from your daemons

postgresql	oracle
especially nasty is the fact that some mvcc-based databases oracle and postgresql use mvcc and i know the postgres lists were recently discussing these issues with their dbms don t really implement serializable perfectly going instead for what should be called snapshot isolation -- this gives 99 of the benefits of serializable with minimal performance hit but that s no good if you fall into that 1

754810
authentication	logout
i have login and logout actions on my authentication controller

754824
nsstring	nsdata
imagine the following scenario i have defined a parent class which just extends nsobject that holds an nsstring a bool and an nsdata object as attributes

754833
constructor	object
in this case arrays is a native constructor which will create and return a new runtime arrays object

754833
required	checked
is vastly slower than as the javascript semantics required in enumerator to build up a list of all properties on the object including the prototype chain and then checked to make sure that each property is still on the object before sending it through the loop

754838
bazaar	git
we ve looked at git and bazaar

754846
shell	tcsh
the best way to do what i m after if you re using tcsh as your shell is using the external rename command see eddie s answer

754859
version-control	git
a common misunderstanding is that distributed version-control systems like git or mercurial are no good for centralized repos

754864
put	get
also check this when serialization data classes are put in an assembly check your project or file reference in visual-studio to be sure you get the right one

754867
instance-variables	accessor
do you mean instance-variables properties methods that look like accessor

754867
python	ruby
alternatively you could just write a ruby python script that just reads a header file and looks for whatever you d consider attributes for the class

754870
order	add
every time you add a new friend colleague or delete them if they cause you too much trouble you update this index which stores just the name in sorted order along with the line number of the full entry the index pages in your address book are magic and auto-sort everything you write in them

754892
put	get
have added the reference put the msado15 interop.adodb dll in the bin directory and debugging directory added assembly key in web.config but still get the following error

754895
dialog	pop-up
i am using yui s dialog control to show a flash movie on my site in a pop-up

754902
hide	show
on form load you can add javascript to populate the date part with a constant value then hide it so that it only show the time part

754903
highlight	cell
can i use highlight the table view cell without default blue color in objective-c

754926
subtract	add
each time a line is added or removed from the file you can add or subtract one from the file

754930
toolchain	gnu
there is a tool called nm on the gnu toolchain

754933
bug-tracking	trac
a reference to your bug-tracking system is good if it isn t handled otherwise trac svn integration for example

754959
logout	login
the standard default one tracks high levels calls and login logout

754959
profiling	trace
that is are you using profiling or a scripted trace lots of sp_trace_set statements

754960
32-bit	64bit
i found out that in order to use the microsoft jet oledb or foxpro oledb provider i had to set the properties of my .net project to specifically target 32-bit processors since there is no 64bit version of these providers

755002
treeview	listview
i have some controls on a winform namely checkedlistbox listbox listview treeview textbox

755007
superclass	subclass
i would like to have more detailed logging debugging logging output on a few superclass so the subclass name will not actually be effecting real-time performance nor application logic

755007
superclass	subclass
suppose i have a simple class structure as below how do i pull the name of the subclass into the superclass without having to explicitly pass a reference

755009
interpreter	runtime
expensive checks that would otherwise have to be performed to verify constraints at runtime for each interpreter instruction can be eliminated

755011
triggers	insert
a triggers on insert update of the main table would do a check on the summary table and insert a new record when a new type is found

755014
environment	execution
it is a process when sql-server s execution environment sniffs the sp s parameter value during compilation or recompile to generate faster execution plans

755021
callable-statement	jdbc
i m using the official sybase jdbc driver to connect to a database and call a stored procedure by creating a callable-statement binding the parameters to it and calling .execute on it

755021
sniffing	traffic
i can verify that the failure is propagated back to me by sniffing the traffic to the database with wireshark and observing the error messages coming back

755021
sqlexception	jtds
updates i ve tried jtds and it behaves correctly as in it throws the sqlexception in both cases - with .execute and with .executeupdates

755038
http-post	post
as fret says you need to build an http-post request with the image data in a post form

755046
firefox	safari
they have plans to add support for firefox and safari too and charge for it

755050
firefox	safari
it has redering engines from ie6 to ie8 and also support firefox and safari

755079
value	field
for each field a link inside the document lists its value if applicable

755097
any	set
another thing you could do is set up a .htaccess file with some rewriterule s so that any call to gets redirected to

755112
any	set
do you perform any other processing on the 2nd set of words before joining them

755112
strchr	strcat
if you must use c-strings you could use strstr strchr strpbrk strcpy and strcat or use just strstr strchr strpbrk and join them in place

755115
nsinteger	int
both keys and values in the dictionary have to descend from nsobject and nsinteger is i m surmising here just a platform-safe typedef of int

755125
environment	execution
i imagine the purpose is to create separate python execution environment

755125
environment	execution
this is an almost totally separate environment for the execution of python code

755139
double	int
we can t tell bind_param that a parameter is a boolean the format string only understand string int double and blob so bind_param will convert the boolean to an int which works for us

755150
getter	setter
by doing this your saving yourself tons of lines with getter and setter in your backingbean

755152
signals	sigpipe
now you probably will get in trouble with the read twice in order of the input because as soon as zcat is finished reading the input file yout program will get a sigpipe signals

755161
google-chrome	firefox
the users are using ie6 ie7 firefox mozilla and google-chrome so i don t think it is client-related

755172
value	field
after digging through the source code it looks like the where-clause of generated queries restricts the results to those where the field name being retrieved has a locale value for the current locale

755202
select	union
select distinct table.column from table where column like union

755222
observers	listener
or register the gui as a listener observers of the player

755225
ref	out
you can use ref and out params with wcf services but under the hood they re wrapped up

755225
ref	out
anything passed to a webmethods or service has to be serialization - you can make it behave as if it is a ref or out by wrapping it in something that sets the value back but this is messy

755231
integer	zero
i need to import 6 fields from the worksheet and increment a string field containing an integer padded to 5 characters with leading zero

755243
northwind	dbo
i left dbo as just northwind so all the tests would compile without a lot of editing

755264
expression	evaluation
the fact that the expression happened to be just evaluation a variables is unknown as far as your methods is concerned

755282
object-reference	instances
when i run this code i get an object-reference not set to an instances of an object error

755289
instances	private
an instances methods will automatically have access to all private instances fields properties and methodss

755289
instances	private
this might seem irrelevant at first glance since the op is obviously talking about refactoring which can not go wrong in this scenario and create any new bugs however this refactored code must be maintained in the future and modified which makes your code have a bigger attack surface in regards to new bugs if it has access to private instances members

755296
methods	extend
you basically use a virtual methods when you want the inheritors to extend the functionality if they want to

755303
python	c++
you can find an implementation library in matlab c++ python called fastica here

755336
exception-handling	try-catch
as i said i had just started wcf exception-handling and i realised ierrorhandler is a better way to handle my exceptions rather than method-level try-catch

755349
any	set
is there any way to determine whether a chart in crystal-reports 2008 using either the ras sdk or the older rdc api is set to display values for each record or for all records

755380
associations	model
i created the habtm associations in the post and the tag model

755410
droppable	draggable
this draggable can be dropped on my droppable time and time again it doesn t get consumed if that makes any sense

755410
droppable	draggable
when a draggable is on top of two droppable currently the jquery behaviour is that the draggable will hit both droppable

755410
droppable	draggable
my expected behaviour the draggable should fall on the first droppable only and should not get triggers for any other subsequent droppable which is around

755410
droppable	draggable
the basic idea is that when a draggable is dropped on two droppables the event timestamp of each droppable event are very close to each other

755411
32-bit	64bit
these unmanaged dll s work under 64bit xp when called from 32-bit unmanages application writetn in c++

755412
versioning	packaging
it also means that some features in the community versioning are disabled removed or have a slightly different configuration default and slightly different packaging

755428
implements	extends
if a tag is not supported you can right click it and add a templates for it or you can extends the supported tags by implements the extension points

755433
shell	bash
if you are using a bash or zsh type shell such as git bash or babun on windows or most linux os x shells then this is a much nicer more succinct way to do what you want

755435
return-value	arguments
it sounds like you ve used a control or component in the web-service interface as a return-value or methods arguments

755440
httpd.conf	.htaccess
put the rewrite rule in var www .htaccess instead of httpd.conf

755487
build-server	nant
on our build-server we explicitly delete the bin and obj directories via nant scripting

755490
32-bit	64bit
it sounds like your dll is only compiled to 32-bit but you try to call it from both a 32-bit and 64bit process

755503
python	c++
i would still suggest using a very recent symbian phone mostly because of the sheer diversity of development runtimes available nsbasic .net ruby python j2me c++ c webkit opera widgets.

755513
export	report
i have a rave report with 5 pages inside it we need to export to excel two page from those 5 report pages each page is a report itself.

755513
export	report
hi maybe i was not clear enough i have 1 report which consists of 5 pages page1 page2 page3 page4 page5 each page work as a differente report i can export the entire report without a problem bu we only need to export page1 and page2

755525
keydown	keyup
ideally something which doesn t involve me having to tracking the state of keyup keydown for each and every textbox although if there is no other way i ll do it like that

755530
perl	awk
i completely agree that calling awk from perl is just silly

755562
create-table	insert-into
one option is to wait for a down-time period when you can be certain no-one will be accessing the database rename the current table then use create-table and insert-into .

755564
any	set
your build configuration platform is set to any cpu that means on a 64 bit os it runs as 64 bit and you can t load the dll

755564
32-bit	x86
set it instead to x86 this will force it to run as 32-bit regardless of os and your dll will load fine

755565
webserver	host
assuming you want to do the processing in c# you should probably host a wcf or asmx wse service in a webserver such as iis - and add a service reference between your client app and the service

755574
contains	any
it means that it does not contains any folders files

755580
javascript	dom
i have no clue why you would want to do something like this - which is basically re-parenting javascript code to live within you document s dom

755586
contains	set
my understanding of your question is that you want to conditionally set the text colour of a row to red if a description field in the report contains the value others

755586
selected	cell
in the layout tab of the report designer selected the row you want to format conditionally by clicking the box outside the left-hand edge of the leftmost cell

755586
attributes	properties
on the properties of this row set the value of the color attributes selected expression... from the drop-down

755593
firefox	safari
it looks the same in firefox 2 3 safari 2 3 and ie 6 7 8

755612
contains	any
i m not aware of a methods that will succinctly tell you if a given folder contains any other folders or files however using

755613
directory	folder
i d like to do a search for folder directory from java and go into those folder directory in java

755625
buffering	streaming
the buffering size of these streaming is limited

755643
textbox	button
the form is an about us form so has nothing on it only a textbox and a ok button

755644
unsigned	short
when converted to a 16-bit unsigned short will be

755655
numeric	zero
the 0 tells the system to preserve this numeric placeholder even when the value is zero

755667
hide	show
after the show methods is called the visible property returns a value of true until the hide methods is called

755671
click	mouse
what s the easiest way to modify a winforms track bar so that when a user click on it the track bar jumps to the location of the mouse

755671
click	mouse
by default the track bar moves to half way between it s current location and where the mouse was click

755673
iprincipal	iidentity
i would recommend using forms-authentication with perhaps a custom backend using iidentity and iprincipal

755676
unsigned	integer
any integer is converted to a given unsigned type by finding the smallest non negative value that is congruent to that integer modulo one more than the largest value that can be represented in the unsigned type

755687
callback	methods
of course the callback methods from the server should use invokelater when modifying visible components

755689
google-chrome	firefox
i m testing this page in ie6 ie7 firefox and google-chrome and it works in everything but ie6

755695
password-recovery	login
it also mentions using the various asp.net membership controls login loginview loginstatus password-recovery for example

755695
credentials	account
using these controls along with the built-in asp.net membership providers for example asp.net provides a sql membership provider to work against sql-server as the data store for your user account and credentials will allow you to implement a complete membership and authentication system with virtually no code at all all the functionality is provided by the built-in membership controls and declarative mark-up

755695
administration	credentials
it s starts at the very beginning of the membership topic and goes right the way through to touching on the implementation of a custom membership provider and administration interface for managing user credentials to round out the whole subject

755699
value	field
and in javascript i want a value of that field by

755719
database-table	unique-key
autonumber fields identity in sql-server are a common method for providing a unique-key for a database-table

755736
for-loop	loops
in java this involves separating out a piece of code to do the grouping a few lines of for-loops and then another piece of code to do the summation another for loops

755747
click	mouse
i ve never done it but i would start by looking at the location of the mouse click

755751
versioning	upgrade
where i work we have an install scripting for each new versioning of the app which has the sql we need to run for the upgrade

755758
digits	base
octal is base 8 using digitss 0-7 so each digits is 3 bits

755758
digits	base
hexadecimal is base 16 using digitss 0-9 a-f and each digits is 4 bits

755761
integer	zero
they use a backslash followed by the digit zero just as octal literal integer constants

755767
display	width
it s because the width of the site is set to the native resolution of the iphone display

755771
base-class	inherited
use a abstract base-class and inherited a and b

755775
fwrite	fread
are you talking about fread and fwrite

755780
value	field
not declaring them speeds you up by a trivial amount but it also allows you to store illegitimate value in those two columns field

755781
png	gif
how can i convert a single jpg image into 3 different image format gif png and bmp using php

755787
updatepanel	gridview
currently i m using javascript to __dopostback on a button that pupulates the 3 gridview but unfortunately this forces a full page load even when using an updatepanel

755799
json	xml
you should also consider switching from xml to json if you re not just updating the innerhtml property of an element with data

755799
json	xml
surprisingly the parse time for both xml and json is pretty much the same

755799
javascript	dom
traversing a javascript object is easily 2 to 3 times faster than traversing a dom tree for the same set of data

755806
protected	public
const-ness like access restriction public protected private benefits the programmer more than it assists with optimization

755823
include	ssi
alternatives include dynamic page generation ssi php ruby-on-rails and so on and using javascript ajax to change contents of a

755829
perforce	git
regarding the merge feature perforce or git are better than subversion because they allow you to merge any subtree you want while memorizing the merge information and with many merging strategies ours theirs ...

755830
global-asax	web-config
i have a solution with a worflow project and a website project and the web-config and global-asax have been set up to work with wf

755855
asp.net-mvc	wcf
mostly because you may in the future decide to add some method of access to your repository which does not go through asp.net-mvc a wcf interface to the data

755857
value	field
how do i remove the field b from the admin so that each object cannot be created with a value and rather will receive a default-value of 0000000

755861
contains	elements
that is a document elements can contains either one or more extract elementss or one or more structure elementss or it can contains a single extract elements followed by one or more structure elementss

755863
default-value	default
set editable to false and default to your default-value

755869
textbox	button
- drag drop a few controls on it button textbox

755902
perl	ruby
so the javascript approach that we ve taken is i think a model for how we re going to do static analysis and when i say we i mean the industryâ how we want to do static analysis for languages like perl and python and ruby and so on

755910
contains	elements
if your arrays size really is fixed at compile time then you may be better off looking at a 2d arrays rather than a 2 elements vector contains 2 2 elemnet vectors

755932
order	add
i like to add them grouping into tables with the naming xx_tablename.sql - the xx is a number that tells the order they need to be runned since sometimes you need the modification runned in a certain order

755934
flac	mp3
i am looking for something to control playback of either raw sound or mp3 ogg and flac

755934
linux	osx
edit linux osx and if possible windows

755937
wait	hang
the thing about automatically detecting a hang is that its difficult to decide when somethings hung and when its just slow or blocked by io wait

755937
wait	hang
i think you ll find that the hang will be due to a deadlock of synchronisation objects which will be difficult to track down as all threads tend to wait on a waitforsingleobject call but look further down the callstacks to see the application threads rather than framework threads like background notifications and network routines

755944
document	element
error line 90 column 1587 document type does not allow element br here

755953
python	ruby
here s an example that evaluates a python ruby script via a markup extension

755957
oracle	mysql
i don t know if there exists any for mysql but for sql there is sqlcmd and for oracle there is osql

755974
windows-xp	windows
and i also would like to know if a sapi 5.3 application can work on windows 2000 windows-xp and windows vista if coded with c++ mfc

755975
expression	evaluation
my preference is to use const whenever i can which as mentioned above is limited to literal expression or something that does not require evaluation

755985
jquery	.post
the jquery example on jquery.com has the following line .post test.php func getnameandtime

755991
treeview	gridview
but i was wondering if there is a framework available for asp.net that offers the normal asp.net controls treeview gridview etc with all the functoinality they have but that doesn t use javascript and doesn t require the programmer to program massive amounts of logic

755997
contains	any
since you seem to want your list to only contains ibase values and you don t have delphi 2009 where a generic would be helpful you can discipline yourself to always explicitly add ibase values to the list never values of any descendant type

756021
attributes	properties
and when i add the attributes newproperties a properties i have added can be seen in intellisense in visual-studio as expected woo

756033
selected	checkbox
i need some c# code to selected deselected all checkbox in a datagrid in wpf 3.5 framework

756034
attributes	properties
in order for the properties to be visible you need to add the persistencemode attributes to your itemplate properties as follows

756044
directx	bitblt
i know the typical p invoke solutions using bitblt or printwindow work most of the time but those fail i only get black transparent pixels when dealing with an directx or opengl application that draws directly to the graphics device

756058
selected	button
this should selected only elements that have the class button and also have a class that start with icon

756066
gnome	xfce
and then it seems that every windows manager - gnome kde xfce or other - also has a keymapping utility

756118
any	set
if option compare text is set at the module level is there any difference

756136
any	set
if option compare text is set at the module level is there any difference

756137
any	set
is there any way to set a timeout on oracle oci calls ocistmtexecute for example

756145
python	c++
c++ and python have built-in next_permutation and itertools.permutations functions respectively

756158
arrays	loops
i ve also considered using a string arrays in the code to specify which values should be nulled - and then could just loops thru the string arrays instead of over all of the values

756179
versioning	packaging
it s not just a matter of packaging the latest versioning of x with the os because every other part that depends of x has to be tested with the new versioning

756182
command-prompt	cmd
you can try and run the cmd below in a cmd-prompt windows

756198
order	join
as the orderdetail table is always part of an order and each detail always references an item you can replace the left outer join by inner join

756202
sftp	ftp
and same code works for reading zip or jar files ftp sftp .

756237
base-class	inherited
in a class that inherited from this base-class i try to raise the event

756239
contains	elements
in the xhtml code of your page a can only contains text #pcdata and you cannot nest any xhtml elements within the

756247
base-class	inherited
it s customary to provide a protected function onxyz or raisexyz for each event in the base-class to enable raising from inherited classes

756249
base-class	inherited
then in classes that inherited from this base-class you can just call the onfinished or onloading methods to raise the events

756252
.when	ready
and still in the background the methods in the page load are populating the gridview or whatever and .when ready show the result

756297
rollback	commit
this class starts commit and rollback transactions

756310
webforms	asp.net
when using an asp.net webforms listview control to display data in an html table i use the following technique in to stripe the table rows

756310
jquery	.post
if jquery or equivalent is in your opinion the best or most appropriate .post i d be interested in knowing why

756311
.when	ready
my vim scripting skills do not go far enough to have a general solution ready but what you can do .when editing a utf-8 file

756325
dialog	pop-up
i have a jquery user-interface dialog pop-up that displays a form

756327
gridview	datalist
gridview has much more bells and whistles than datalist

756332
click	mouse
how will i be able to put a pin using a click of my mouse

756335
callback	methods
to catch this problem you ll have to put break points in all callback methods

756338
malloc	free
on a non-gc environment for each allocation you would end up calling malloc and that requires locating in the list of free memory fragments the most suitable one according to the specific malloc implementation

756371
common-lisp	lisp
common-lisp s asdf another system definition facility is analogous to make ant but not a full analogue â it is aimed at building lisp programs not generic systems like make or ant

756377
value	field
where selected value is in hidden field

756377
value	field
you can return any number of field but if any of them will have a null value then it will not converted in json object

756377
value	field
at that time states table was having field called deletedby and it was contains null value

756393
machine-code	disassembly
you need a disassembly which will turn the machine-code into assembly

756407
hash	md5
these are md5 hash returned with the json structure to be sent with a following request

756409
oracle	mysql
for the gui thing oracle s sql developer can connect to oracle mysql sql server ms access and sybase

756411
16-bit	8bit
in reality there are many different mov instructions ones for handling 8bit 16-bit 32-bit data ones for moving data from different registers and so on

756413
data-structures	dictionary
you d probably want to implement them on top of existing data-structures such as list and dictionary

756418
temporary	copy
as far as i know you have to create a temporary table with the id field created as identity then copy all the data from the original table

756421
machine-code	disassembly
you can use a disassembly to view the machine-code directly

756421
intermediate-language	cil
and then there s msil exe the .net executable holding microsofts intermediate-language these do not contains machine specific code but .net cil code

756441
put	get
if you can get them to put it on the server you won t need to translate anything

756449
any	set
in order for this to work you cannot set any height for the dialog

756449
any	set
so if you set a fixed height in pixels for the dialog in its creator methods or via any style the autoresize property will not work

756452
hash	md5
however this can be remedied by having the client sent the md5 hash with each request if it is different than what the server expects an entire list will be sent instead of a list of changes

756466
textbox	button
the html form has just one textbox and a submit button

756494
machine-code	disassembly
and then since most machine-code is generated by compilers you ll need to understand how compilers generate code - the simplest way to write lots of small programs and then disassembly them to see what your c++ is turned into

756503
filtering	grouping
i m assuming i need to grouping by course and filtering where enrolmentdate max enrolmentdate or something similar

756529
any	set
since i have autocommit set to false i can t commit any changes in the event handler

756536
uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller and each tab handles a different uiviewcontroller that pushes on the stack new controllers as needed

756539
classnotfoundexception	noclassdeffounderror
in our experience a noclassdeffounderror can sometimes mean that more than one version of a class are found as there is also a classnotfoundexception that s normally thrown if a class cannot be found

756541
protected	public
see also framework design guidelines section 4.4 do not define public or protected internal constructor in abstract types

756563
row	col
you could use an index based on the row col of the cell

756563
order	add
if you want to iterate in sorted order you can start to add linq into the mix and or use a sorted list with an inner class that encapsulates an entry which would have to store the row or column and implement for sorting to work

756581
blacklist	whitelist
its usually better to whitelist characters you allow rather than to blacklist characters you don t allow

756583
protected	public
they must be protected since public constructor does not make sense either

756583
constructor	object
since you re passing in an already instantiated object of class b the ib interface doesn t need to have a constructor signature

756588
json	xml
use json instead of xml

756596
blacklist	whitelist
do you really want to blacklist specific characters or rather whitelist the allowed charachters

756606
document	element
in theory you would use the element to add foreign objects to your document but browser difference and limitations have made this a nonstarter for many developers

756611
midl	idl
the idl files i have compile fine with linux tools but when i try to compile using midl i get an error

756633
expression	brackets
the brackets define a character class and the is necessary before the dollar sign because dollar sign has a special meaning in regular expression

756656
glib	gtk
instead of a glib mainloop receiving the events is it possible for a gtk main that runs my windows to accept signals

756720
onsubmit	onclick
also if you put your ajax code assuming that s what you re doing in the onsubmit handler instead of onclick on a button you can also make it so that pressing enter has the same effect as clicking on the submit button which the user might normally expect

756735
union-all	union
edit thanks to a commenter whose name is probably not null for pointing out that union-all is faster than union .

756755
value	field
and i would like to discard everything outside the - and the parentheses themselves - and to set update that field with the value inside the

756763
contains	set
the way to add custom configuration if you require more than just simple types is to use a configurationurationsection within that for the schema you defined you need a configurationurationelementcollection set as default collection with no name which contains a configurationurationelement as follows

756763
show	next
next we need to know how to updates them at run-time the following code show an example

756765
ethernet	packets
it seems like a packets won t be fragmentation until it reaches the ethernet at the network layer limit of 1500 bytes

756777
where-clause	sql
sql why are null values filtered out within this where-clause

756780
ethernet	packets
if a 3000 byte packets enters an ethernet network with a default mtu size of 1500 for ethernet it will be fragmentation into two packetss of each 1500 bytes in length

756790
priority-queue	heap
say i have a java priority-queue which java implements as a heap that i iterate over to remove elements based on some criteria

756792
constructor	object
the only way to do that i think is to implement the activexobject constructor to proxy open calls to the real constructor object

756800
hash	md5
i also tried comparing the hash of the suspicious site s url md5 methods in php

756815
iteration	elements
when remove is called during this second phase of iteration the iterator calls priorityqueue.removeeq lastretelt where lastretelt is the last elements returned from the special queue

756861
contains	set
a heap is a tree data structure where higher levels of the tree always contains greater or lesser if it s set up that way values than lower levels

756875
short	zero
short answer set the value of the exportselection attributes of all listbox widget to false or zero

756875
python	tcl
the definitive documentation for tk widgets is based on the tcl language rather than python but it is easy to translate to python

756887
testng	junit
completed junit testng test

756889
getter	setter
choose source- generate getter and setter

756889
selected	button
press the selected getters button

756889
getter	setter
another idea is to define your bean with getter and setter you can use the above technique but include setter then you can create a wrapper class for it that only has the getter

756894
jprofiler	jvm
with something like jprofiler all you need to do is add certain parameters to the jvm

756894
profiling	debugging
jvm ti supports the full breadth of tools that need access to jvm state including but not limited to profiling debugging monitoring thread analysis and coverage analysis tools

756894
profiling	debugging
note jvm ti replaces the java virtual machine profiling interface jvmpi and the java virtual machine debugging interface jvmdi

756899
ubuntu	linux
fwiw my local machine is running ubuntu 8.10 and the remote machine is running red hat enterprise linux es release 4 nahant update 1 so there is a bit of a difference in versions but all i m really looking for is a few pointers on where i should be looking for problems

756904
sniffing	packets
no one s sniffing packets or trying to hack into your machine to read your source code

756933
double-buffering	doublebuffered
i can successfully achieve flickerless movement by either using automatic double-buffering setting the form s doublebuffered property to true or implements a back-buffer myself

756936
export	csv
a consultant employed by my client has asked for an export of the the first n rows approx 30 or 40 of all the tables in one of our sql-server 2000 databases in csv format including column names on the first row

756941
ruby-on-rails	django
it seems most of the frameworks in use follow that pattern- ruby-on-rails django and now asp.net mvc

756948
webforms	asp.net
for a good comparison between asp.net mvc and asp.net webforms

756954
operators	keyword
the generic type t is constrained with the where keyword as you can see but i need a constraint for number types that have arithmetic operators iarithmetic

756954
primitive	int
t will be a primitive number type such as int float etc

756956
lisp	let
some other tools walk over the component graph tree and return a representation for actions - which is then a proposed plan - the user then can let lisp execute the whole plan or parts of the plan

756957
progress-bar	progress
you create a progress bar control using progress-bar constructor

756957
progress-bar	progress
after creating instance of a progress bar you set the range of the progress bar by using minimum and maximum properties of the progress-bar

756960
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i ve been using webforms for the past few years but after reading the sample asp.net-mvc chapter scott guthrie published i am really excited for this new technology

756966
firefox	safari
this would prevent the enter button and remove any newlines and carriage returns that got in anyway only tried this on firefox and minimal thought put into this - it might not work on safari or ie as-is

756974
backgroundworker	winforms
i d recommend implementing the backgroundworker object in your winforms application

757009
windows-xp	windows
it went to the windows style not the windows-xp style which is the default since i m developing under xp

757011
variables	boolean
here s an alternative to jared s solution - it s pretty much the same but using a foreach loop and a boolean variables to check whether or not this is the first iteration

757026
perforce	cvs
currently supports svn perforce and cvs

757039
windows-xp	windows
whereas writing shell extensions in windows-xp was possible in c# it is next to impossible to write shell extensions for vista and windows 7

757047
repository	entity
extracting out some subsection of a repository as its own separate entity while maintaining version history is difficult in git and so it s a good idea to plan ahead

757053
boost	stl
no does not inherit the members of myclass but you can use stl s and boost s facilities to perfrom operations on the vector without explicitly coding an iteration for each operation you need

757066
specifications	w3c
the ubiquity-rdfa project makes use of the w3c fresnel specifications which is complex way to add simple annotations to client markup

757067
entity-framework	ado.net
does anyone know how to delete many-to-many relationship in ado.net entity-framework without having to load all of the data

757088
mouseover	mouseout
css contains display none for all submenus and my optimistic idea was simply to show proper ul elements when mouseover is fired on first level entries then to hide them when mouseout is fired on the submenu the ul element

757088
mouseenter	mouseover
no change using mouseover or mouseenter

757093
any	set
you could check if any of the lower order bits are set

757093
any	set
32-bit int - check if any of the first 16 are set

757093
any	set
if so check if any of the first 8 are set

757093
any	set
if not check if any of the upper 16 are set

757115
implements	abstract
it is a little confusing that c# asks us to override abstract members when we implements an inherited relationship but in this case it really means that we are overriding the empty concept with a concrete implementsation

757115
implements	abstract
for example babyhuman must implements the abstract speak methods as an override

757127
stored-procedures	ado.net
it is performed outside of nhibernate using ado.net for batch loading sets of stored-procedures for diff ing merging they re autogenerated by a custom tool

757135
richfaces	tomahawk
we are currently using myfaces + tomahawk + richfaces + some of our own components but we are at a point in which we can move away from richfaces if needed

757149
shell	bash
technically aliases in the bash shell language are so limited in capabilities that they are extremely ill suited for anything that involves more than a single command

757160
library-project	libs
it was the only difference i could see between a class libs and windows control libs-project

757161
json	xml
do i send it back to the server in javascript arrays json or xml

757161
webforms	asp.net
i am using asp.net webforms

757162
value	field
there are no useless empty field for any rows and there will be more and more useless value if you introduce new subclasses into a table per class hierarchy mapping - this is a consequence of the low normalization of the table

757165
python	php
this is a working php version of john fouhy s python solution

757172
user-controls	ascx
some things from traditional asp.net won t be used with the asp.net-mvc model user-controls ascx and aspx files but it is a good thing to still understand these

757172
httphandler	httpmodule
the rest of asp.net is still useful httpmodule httphandler the web-config file the membership provider etc when you re doing asp.net-mvc and i d say likely a prerequisites to really using asp.net-mvc well

757184
realloc	malloc
however if you are stuck with an arrays you can always malloc the memory and then realloc if you need to make the arrays larger

757184
realloc	malloc
do a search here on so there is information about malloc and realloc

757204
any	set
also if you update or delete the value in the referenced table you can set it to automatically update the value or delete in cascade any row containing that value

757233
dictionary	arrays
the idea is that you return an object that is directly convertible to json an arrays or dictionary

757239
debugging	trace
we ship release builds with debugging symbols so that the performance is right extensive use of debugging output and assertions can slow things down a little but they still report meaningful stack trace if an exception occurs

757259
mouseover	mouseout
i had some crazy issues with mouseover and mouseout events

757283
common-lisp	lisp
if all you want to do is generate ant xml files using lisp code you could use something like clj-html for clojure or cl-who for common-lisp

757287
remote-debugging	debugging
we use lab manager to test on multiple platforms and do remote-debuggingging by creating a windows account with the same name and password on both the local dev box and the vm in lab manager causes the vs debuggingger to think that the same account is being used on both boxes so it allows the debugging server to be seen on the dev box

757287
administration	account
the dll is in the specified folder and the folder allows full control by administration of which the debugging account is a member

757288
rendering	redraw
if the text is long enough to change the canvas height it will only be resized if i manually change the width of the windows forcing a redraw of all rendering

757288
any	set
any ideas on how to force the re-measurement of the renderer when i set it s data

757308
firefox	opera
the most you ll be able to get is msie firefox opera x.x

757319
windows-xp	windows
according to this kb article ie 6.0.3790.3959 is internet explorer 6 sp2 for windows server 2003 sp1 and windows-xp x64 and ie 6.0.2900 is ie6 for windows-xp 32 bit sp2 or sp3 i m guessing your users have sp3 from the rest of the string so it s not just the build it s the os it s running on

757356
n-gram	words
for performance reasons index all these words as trigrams or bigrams so that when you are performing a lookup you convert to n-gram and lookup via hashtable or trie

757356
metaphone	soundex
use a phonetic key soundex metaphone to index the words and lookup possible corrections

757371
base-class	inherited
these classes all inherited from a common base-class but that base-class doesn t define a couple methods that are common to all subclasses

757379
comma	words
dw delete all chars to the beginning of the next words possibly comma + spaces

757382
versioning	upgrade
we could make the code into a library and allow apps to remain on an older versioning of the library until they re ready to upgrade

757396
comma	words
will swap the first words with second in a comma separated list

757398
mips	x86
at my university the assembly programming x86 and mips class is drawing to an end

757399
entity-framework	ado.net
of course if you re going to be creating objects that directly map to your tables you might as well look into linq to sql or the ado.net entity-framework

757413
display	width
for example if i want to display the width of column a i could use the following

757423
key-value	key
you can add an invisable tag to the pdf by adding it as a metadata property with a key and value by using pdftk dump_data to write all metadata to a text file then append the new key and value to the text file then use pdftk update_info to put back all the metadata including the new key-value pair

757424
protected	public
a minor point about function-declaration keyword in php if you ve got a class methods that s static should the static keyword come before or after the visibility keyword public protected private

757432
push	pull
i can t git push pull to github from my corporate vpn

757432
push	pull
or am i stuck disconnecting from the vpn when i need to push pull

757435
revision	svn
for example svn info test.txt 1234 will give information about test.txt as it existed in revision 1234

757435
revision	svn
svn syntax error parsing revision .txt

757444
put	get
it was discovered that when using flash to produce visual assets using stateful skins and exporting them to swc with the flash flex asset toolkit you get runaway flash movies presumably something internal to the way this is implemented say forgetting to put stop commands in frames

757444
stateless	stateful
and a jsfl scripting that you can use to convert stateful skins to stateless skins

757460
return-value	arguments
in c the caller is responsible for maintaining the stack frame so the cast is necessary when you invoke the function arguments and the return-value are pushed onto the stack

757476
python	perl
is the problem area but what exactly is the difference in regular expression rules between perl and python that i m missing

757489
iteration	set
the originality of my approach is using the first half of the examination of a row or column to determine if it contains a 0 and the last half to set the values - this is done by looking at x and width-x and then y and height-y in each iteration

757501
subclassing	base-class
problem #2 your subclassing have different function signatures than your base-class

757501
virtual-functions	base-class
you ll have to add an empty body to the base-class virtual-functions if you don t want them to do anything

757510
revision	svn
svn cares only about the last at sign in the argument and it is not considered illegal to omit a literal peg revision specifier after that at sign

757512
any	set
if i have thing how can i set it up to refer to my 2 instances of whazit by name for the record the business rule is that any thing will always have exactly 2 whazits

757519
value	field
i am trying to get the value o fthat field to evaluate if the document is approved or not

757524
32-bit	64bit
even for shifting from 32-bit pc to 64bit you will basically have to rewrite everything

757550
unsigned	zero
evidently char is unsigned for you so it s always greater than or equal to zero and thus the compiler warns you

757554
python	perl
sounds like a job for a higher level language like python or perl -

757589
nsnotifications	observers
is is possible to post an nsnotifications to a sibling view s nsnotifications observers before the sibling is activated or a way to load the sibling views in a manner that they can observers notifications without first activating them

757607
pdf	xmp
pdf supports xmp metadata

757616
value	field
profiling all stored in one field as comma seperated values - not easy to find all users who ve got a value set

757626
.when	ready
the view controllers are initializer .when the tab bar is set up so they should be ready to receive notifications right away

757643
continuous-integration	build-process
in the last year we have added continuous-integration with cruisecontrol and automated our build-process

757651
contains	any
also remember that style changes are inherited so if any widget contains the tree on the right has a different style than any one contains the tree on the left that may cause the changes as well

757658
digits	base
the width calculation computes log base 10 + 1 which gives the number of digits

757672
json	xml
twitter s api gives you the option to have the feeds in xml or json format

757672
myspace	twitter
if they start at twitter they ll have to do myspace facebook friendfeed etc

757688
treeview	grid
ui-wise it has a treeview on the left a list view grid on the top right and an html view embedded ie on the bottom right

757698
decrement	increment
increment decrement the counter myself avoids a call to bigdatastructure.size

757714
decrement	increment
increment decrement are probably faster as it avoids a function-call but there may be a risk of the recorded size versus actual size going out of sync

757714
decrement	increment
if you feel confident they wont then i d say just use increment decrement

757725
python	c++
which of those is right depends on your needs and programming experience but i d take a look at lazarus free pascal c++ or python with py2exe

757737
constructor	private
otherwise if the member or constructor is declared private then access is permitted if and only if it occurs within the body of the top level class â 7.6 that encloses the declaration of the member or constructor

757741
decrement	increment
increment and decrement requires additional care if the adding and deleting is being done from multiple threads

757758
javascript	dom
the error only occurs if you try to manipulate a dom element via javascript before the element you are trying to manipulate is loaded

757758
javascript	dom
and yes as far as i can tell all javascript that manipulates the dom is at the end of the markup not the beginning

757766
decrement	increment
and even if the call is o 1 it may be faster to increment and decrement the external counters

757779
decrement	increment
why don t you keep the counters internal to bigdatastructure and then you can increment or decrement whenever you do an add or remove inside those functions

757781
google-chrome	firefox
one of the great things about web development is that most often when you see a site and think how did they do that it s very easy to look at the code and find out and also to test it out - tools like firebug for firefox the developer tools in ie 8 f12 and google-chrome will all display nicely formatted source and css and will let you modify it in situ

757798
python	java
you can do anything in c# c++ java python lisp or almost any other language finally all of them turing complete

757798
gnome	kde
in fact most of desktop applications web browsers word processor desktop environment itself like windows-explorer kde or gnome are written in compiled languages with careful thinking about resources.

757812
base-class	subclass
let s say i have a base-class a and one subclass b that i m mapping with hibernate perhaps using the table per subclass strategy

757818
persistence	hibernate
if this is to be used in anything approaching a production environment then you will want a database and i can recommend the hibernate object-relational mapping system especially using annotation-driven persistence for automating much of the database retrieval storage cascading deletion query pooling strategies etc

757821
vb.net	vb6
i have converted a vb6 project to vb.net and am left with a large number of inline warning messages such as upgrade_warning couldn t resolve default property of object varjonskeet that i would like to get rid of

757835
default	reset
the solution was to export the settings using then using the same wizard to reset the settings to the default and then when re-importing the saved settings file uncheck the windows layout item in the import list

757854
contains	any
you could create a new .net program to iterate through each .vb file in your source directory and read them in using a streamreader and then write them out 1 line at a time to the same file and as you go omit any lines contains upgrade_warning

757868
sqldatasource	gridview
if i bind gridview to sqldatasource and also set autogenerateeditbutton to true and if i then try to update a field this field being a primary key in database then database should return an error and thus sqlexception should be thrown

757868
value	field
instead all gridview does is setting all field in that row back to their original value

757868
identity-column	sql-server
when i executed same update statement with the following code i got cannot update identity-column employeeid exception so iâ m assuming sql-server did report same error when gridview tried to update but for some reason exception wasn t raised

757872
.net	wcf
is .net remoting a requirement or could you consider moving to wcf instead

757880
bibtex	latex
then i removed the line and compiled the bibtex again hoping to have a working latex file again

757886
put	get
note in the past the option of ndoc may have seemed more appealing - and some people still use it - but sandcastle seems to be the official and recommended methods at this moment especially given that it s reasonably stable and complete enough for almost any purpose. see the sandcastledocs website to get started this was unofficially put together by one of the developers at microsoft i believe

757895
player	movie
the apple quicktime standalone player can manage itunes drm scheme well enough to play movie downloaded from itunes with no problem

757909
silverlight	wpf
instead of c# wpf you could give silverlight a look

757911
bibtex	latex
i think you are tripping over the multi-pass nature of latex plus bibtex

757911
bibtex	latex
that s why the complete set of steps include an initial latex call a bibtex call and two follow-up latex calls

757918
value	field
how do i specify constraint on my field that allows null but if value exists it should be one of values of primary key within existing table

757957
put	get
is there any way to put the main.col2 condition in the sub-select which would get rid of the full table scans

757977
duplicates	elements
finally you have id attributes in the html that is being cloned and this will result in duplicates elements with the same id

757978
append	input
in which case you can append .txt to it to open the input file

757983
revision	svn
for svn this is just a normal global revision of the repository

757983
revision	svn
in that revision there will be only changes in one subdirectory but for svn it s still a new version of the whole repository just like any other commit

757987
google-apps	gmail
i am able to send and receive email successfully through google-apps when i use the gmail interface

758016
selected	checkbox
if it is a multiple selected checkbox choice field you can set the field through the object model from the sharepoint site or through the web service by using

758018
perl	php
i m looking for something similar to __file__ in ruby perl php but of course the __file__ macro in c is determined at compile time

758037
superclass	subclass
it s all about the contract of superclass and about subclass implementing this contract

758037
superclass	subclass
in short words it comes to the question if you really can safely use your subclass as superclass taking into account that superclass is defined by its contract which is not only code

758062
associations	model
you can define your domain model and dsls very concisely then you can extend them with the necessary features notification associations handling

758062
scala	java
you can mix java and scala in both directions

758062
scala	java
there is not much penalty nor compatibility problems when switching to scala after having experienced the annoyances of java which make code hard to maintain

758086
queue	fifo
the simplest way of implementing it is not by recursion but rather with a fifo queue where you add the neighbor elements to the one you are testing at the end and extract the first element from the queue to perform the next check

758089
system-tray	trayicon
as of java 6 this is supported in the system-tray and trayicon classes

758091
rollback	commit
each thread should read data from the database operate on it by mutating creating objects and then commit rollback the transaction

758115
driver	kernel
kernel driver memory process daemon file user a shell vs

758154
glew	.lib
i ve set .library_search_paths to opt local .lib and verified that the .library in question is there i m linking to glew

758155
database-design	business-logic
so we have high contention over database-design areas and it s easy for a small database change to disrupt the lower levels of business-logic

758168
probability	poisson
if you merely want to find the probability of an event occurring after n days given prior data of its frequency you ll want to fit to an appropriate probability distribution which generally requires knowing something about the source of the event maybe it should be poisson distributed maybe gaussian

758194
double	int
in c the solution is simply to cast the int to double

758218
integer	zero
once you ve got the biggest number and you have to determine that in advance you can determine the number of digits with an integer logarithm algorithm how many times can you divide by 10 before you get to zero or by using snprintf with the buffer length of zero the format d and null for the string

758225
iprincipal	iidentity
i notice some of the types specifically iidentity and iprincipal you are implements are not located within a assembly

758237
environment	building
i am trying to building a self-updating .net application that will run in an environment with limited user account

758237
binaries	install
so far i have tried a system where the application checks a manifest and downloads updated binaries which worked great in development but not so much when the app was install

758248
put	get
otherwise you need a way to get your linux-side client to put them into the environment with setenv 3

758256
hide	show
i ve already worked with the qsystemtrayicon class but now i would like to minimize or hide my app windows and show only the tray icon

758257
perl	awk
in addition to all of the other great suggestions i would recommend discussing regular expressions in detail with examples in sed awk perl vi etc

758263
order	add
building on carl s answer you could easily add the ability to use all the order fields and even detect the ones that are in reverse order

758280
onchange	onkeyup
it seemed quite simple at first but i can t use onchange onkeyup on the iframe

758287
getdate	dateadd
to see the results replace dateadd hh -1 getdate with dateadd mi -15 getdate and you ll get the results for the last 15 minutes and 0 for other minutes

758305
visual-studio	sharpdevelop
including sharpdevelop eclipse and pydev wing visual-studio and ironpython studio

758305
emacs	vim
komodo spe vim emacs are all editors ides with python integration and will all work very well - which you prefer depends on your tastes and workflow

758309
licensing	gpl
syntax - its really broad but i think it has some licensing concerns syntax is gpl

758312
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
i prefer to minimize dependencies on 3rd party libs so it s usually boxlayout for dialog and gridbaglayout for complicated layouts

758330
authentication	login
authentication once via form login and naturally the login token would carry from server to server

758340
subclassing	base-class
the above seem slightly convoluted since they both pollute the base-class as i add an increasing number of subclassing each with their own unique functions

758352
hide	show
in your system tray icon event handler call show or setvisible true on your windows and optionally hide your tray icon

758354
subclassing	base-class
this is just what subclassing does adds functionality not present in a base-class

758354
subclassing	base-class
ultimately subclassing takes everything available in the base-class and adds new stuff to it

758358
instances	self
here s a snippet from an nsstring extension where self is the nsstring instances

758393
revision	svn
if the particular libraries have a public svn repository you can add them in as an svn external - though i would add them in as particular known versions on revision number or a tag branch rather than just the trunk

758395
entity-relationship	diagram
this would produce a class or entity-relationship diagram with traceability back to the domain model

758406
compact-framework	.net
if your are talking about asp.net on a embedded device you will find that .net compact-framework has not built in support for asp.net

758413
directory	folder
one reason is that the app.config file is in your app s folder under the program files directory and everything in program files is read only for standard users by default

758421
delphi	c++
the only other tool apart from raw c++ is delphi

758421
delphi	c++
so if you are serious in provide no-hasle app for your customers and that customers are not tech-oriented like developers so could be confused because which one of the 4 .net runtimes install want minimal support easy downloads click-click-install-go apps that work instanly like skype topstyle made with delphi and others then delphi c++ is are your only option

758427
methodology	waterfall
in scenaios where an rfp is issued by a customer for a vendor to be selected based on a certain technical and financial criteria in a fixed scope fixed price projects is there any methodology can be used other than waterfall

758442
postgresql	mysql
a couple of virtual machines or even a single virtual machine for all the products perhaps an ubuntu box for postgresql mysql and a windows 2008 server machine for the remaining products - i like one or two vm s because this is a more portable environment for running the tests when on the road off-site as my laptop would probably crawl to a halt running 8 or 10 small vm s

758448
delphi	c++
i think it works quite well and being familiar with similar gui building tools borland c++ builder jigloo for java delphi i found it easy to use

758448
derived-class	base-class
the base-class derived-class paradigm can make a reasonably clean separation of your gui and business logic code

758448
derived-class	base-class
potentially the base-class derived-class paradigm could sometimes get in your way if you are doing something too sophisticated with your gui otoh that could indicate that you may need to re-think your approach.

758452
eclipse-rcp	swt
with eclipse-rcp you get java cross-platform development see delta pack native look via swt and a great framework collection for desktop development declarative user-interface plugin management etc.

758471
look-and-feel	swt
swt provides the native look-and-feel for multiple platforms and windows systems

758476
python	tcl
the reason i choose this instead of other systems i prefer coding in python for instance is because deployment with tcl tk is close to unbeatable

758485
seam	jsf
you might find it easier to use jsf with seam which simplifies much of how you work with jsf and replaces jsp with facelets which is a great improvement

758491
contains	elements
when an inline box contains an in-flow block-level box the inline box and its inline ancestors within the same line box are broken around the block-level box and any block-level siblings that are consecutive or separated only by collapsible whitespace and or out-of-flow elements splitting the inline box into two boxes even if either side is empty one on each side of the block-level box es

758491
contains	any
when such an inline box is affected by relative positioning any resulting translation also affects the block-level box contains in the inline box

758491
contains	elements
the p elements contains a chunk c1 of anonymous text followed by a block-level elements followed by another chunk c2 of anonymous text

758493
selection	cell
the best way to set the selection is to set the selectedbackgroundview on the cell when you construct it

758501
ip-address	hostname
if you are connecting to other sites besides localhost the host field will have to be updated usually hostname ip-address or www works

758503
subclassing	base-class
he she is asking about subclassing implements functionality that is not a natural fit for a base-class and the resulting mess that can ensue

758503
base-class	subclass
there is also the matter of whether it is valuable to be able to treat a base-class like the subclass in every case to avoid casting and use them interchangeably

758584
ruby	php
i am looking for a very robust datetime parser similar to ruby s chronic but for php

758585
factory-pattern	singleton
maybe you could use the factory-pattern and create a factory that hands out only one instance effectively your singleton

758585
constructor	private
in c++ you may overcome this by making the constructor private and the factory and the unit test friends

758615
inner-classes	nested-class
inner-classes can t be static - a static nested-class is not an inner class

758616
anonymous-class	static-class
so an anonymous-class in a static context is roughly equivalent to a static nested class in that it does not keep a reference to the enclosing class even though it s technically not a static-class

758638
alpha	rgba
i m trying to load a textures with rgba value but the alpha value just seem to make the textures more white not adjust the transparency

758654

i know how to do this for braces but can t figure out how to do it for parentheses

758714
base-class	superclass
the specific issue occurs if i want to handle wm_notify messages for custom drawing from the base control in the superclass i either need to reflect them back from the parent windows or set my own windows as the parent passed inside createstruct for wm_ nc create to the base-class

758726
double-pointer	pointers
this is only possible if it has the address of the pointers in question so it must be a double-pointers

758734
contains	any
matches any string with that contains at least two occurrences of the same nonzero digit

758734
contains	any
matches any positioning where the contains pattern doesn t match

758734
contains	any
this is a negative lookahead as it only matches a positioning in the string and doesn t consume any of it - just looks ahead to compare it with the contains pattern

758734
contains	any
matches any string that exactly matches the contains pattern rather than contains a substring that matches the pattern

758734
perl	ruby
the above is a pcre supported in perl ruby and a bunch of different other languages

758735
linux	unix
note that on linux and most unix systems your binary does not necessarily have to exist anymore while it is still running

758754
msbuild	nant
i have a c# project for which i need to automate the build and i am trying to choose between nant and msbuild

758755
textbox	button
however if there are more than one textbox ie doesn t auto postback the form on enter press instead it fires the button s onclick event

758761
onscroll	onresize
so far two non-optimal solutions have been to set or to call invalidate during onresize and onscroll

758762

click	mouse
how do i check if the user click with a mouse or with a pen stylus on a c# control

758782
button	popup
if the user clicks a text box with a pen button then i want an input panel to popup but if he clicks with a mouse then it shouldn t

758786
msbuild	nant
nant or msbuild which one to choose and when

758788
dialog	pop-up
a dialog will pop-up where you can selected which sites to enable firebug the whitelist

758798
background-color	display
from what i can tell unfortunately it is not possible to customize the color of the text display in the index the closest i ve been able to come is being able to modify the background-color and the font of the index

758815
downgrade	upgrade
a good framework should have some tools for performing migrations which allow you to upgrade and downgrade your database easily and automatically

758819
host	root
db mysqldb.connect user root passwd port 3000 host localhost db pyneoform

758840
put	get

now that said there are people who absolutely thrive on spring hibernate jsf mvcjammer joomajamaventilate things with x in them etc etc

758849
conditional	operators
what is the need for the conditional operators

758849
conditional	operators
if the conditional operators is more efficient than the equivalent if-else assignment why can t if-else be interpreter more efficiently by the compiler

758865
arrays	loops
the result is we can access each element in turn of a general n-d arrays using a single loops

758879
implements	extends
i am using asp.net-mvc so i was thinking about just extends the jsonresult type and then extendig controllers so that it also implements a jsonp methods

758889
versioning	upgrade
as you say checking a new versioning and updating the references allows instant upgrade for the team

758890
relational-database	schema
i wish it were easier to explain how there is in fact a conceptual basis for relational-database schema design

a single conceptual domain modeling tool that emits an rdbms schema and matching classes for the oo language of your choice

758991
python	java
when using dynamic environments like common lisp python or even c++ applications using edit and continue i m struck by how much more rapidly i can work when compared to c++ c and java applications where you have to bring the system down to make small changes

758997
click	mouse
when i get a warning after i click on the little warning symbol i have milliseconds to try to read the warning message before it disappears like a very quick and cautious mouse

759012
boolean	int
and occasionally this mixing of int with boolean can come out really handy like this build_assert.h

759024
profiling	debugging
a profiling debuggingger for analyzing code running on a distributed system allowing you to debugging step through these hosts and there network interactions from a single runtime would be really neat and with the popularity of distributed systems is going to be a must

textbox	button
this is an example using multiple textbox and browse button to collect the paths of up to 5 files and then uploads them at once

759069
webforms	asp.net
we have an asp.net webforms application that is probably vulnerable to cross-site request forgery csrf attack

759090

see this question - writing a c# program that scans e-commerce website and extracts product pictures + prices + description from them

759095
culture	locale
see this question too does sql-server consider culture locale when converting value to from strings

759114
stderr	stdout
i just redirect stderr and stdout to dev-null so your

759120
oracle	mysql
the example above works in mysql and microsoft sql server for example but not in oracle

759145
decimal	octal
the 377 is octal - its decimal value is 255

759150
double	int
as the others have pointed out comparing eg 1.0 1 will work out because the int 1 is type cast to double not float before the comparison

759154
button	slide
i have a slide and have a command button on it

759160
panels	grid
how do i move drag a grid panels inside a wpf windows

759160
panels	grid
the grid panels does not have a position or location or x and y coordinate porperty

759201
double	int
can an eight byte double fully precisely hold the range of numbers of a four byte unsigned int

759210
button	slide
if you re having trouble copying the slide to a new presentation you could try using a templates or a powerpoint add-in that allows you to insert the button and code in one action

759218
32-bit	64bit
an ieee754 64bit double can represent any 32-bit integer simply because it has 53-odd bits available for precision and the 32-bit integer only needs well 32 -

759218
32-bit	64bit
it would be plausible for a non ieee754 double precision 64bit floating point number to have less than 32-bit of precision

759223
double	int
a float or double is guaranteed to exactly represent any int that does not need to be truncated

759223
32-bit	64bit
for a double there is 53 bits of precision so that is more than enough to exactly represent any 32-bit integer and a tiny statistically speaking proportion of 64bit ones too

759232
hexagonal-tiles	tile
well lots of people have made the point that you can t tile the sphere with hexagonal-tiles - maybe you are wondering why

759256
radio-button	button

759291
hosts-file	hosts
put the ip-address of the nfs clients in the etc hosts of the nfs server with a comment like

759291
hosts-file	hosts
then add to your runbook when changing the ip addresses of a machine do not forget to updates the hosts of the nfs server

759293
digits	radix
it s easier to assume that first element of the arrays is the right digits of out floating radix number

759298
macros	vba
is open excel start macros recording do what i want do programatacily stop macros recording and then look to vba and copy the code to my project

759304

compact-framework	.net
available in .net 2.0+ compact-framework 2.0+ and xna framework 1.0+

759327
delphi	vb6
classic crud apps built using tools like vb6 and delphi have user interfaces persistent storage and don t use asp.net-mvc

you could loops over the html string to detect the angle brackets and build up an arrays of tags and whether there was a matching closing tag for each one

759366
execution	exit
after execution the same process several times the child process starts to exit with status 127

759370
double	int
use of double for intermediate calculations will push all rounding and precision loss out to the conversion back to float or int

safari	opera
they say that it works in ie opera and safari

759422
beautifulsoup	mechanize
i do a lot of scraping using excellent python packages urllib2 mechanize and beautifulsoup

759432

for .net webforms i am assuming web since you didn t say thick or web client which is not asp.net-mvc it was a nightmare maintaining them

759432
asp.net-mvc	webforms
even then developers discovered ways to use asp.net-mvc with webforms

759432
webforms	asp.net
ironically the lack of mvc architecture in asp.net webforms was one of the driving complaints that lead to the development of asp.net mvc framework

759438
child-process	spawn
the way the code reads suggests that you are only spawn one child-process at a time otherwise there d be no need to call waitpid within the loop

759448
logout	login
but if the condition is changing not appearance the negative numbers shall be red but behaviour if the user is logged in s he must see the logout button instead of the login button then it s controller s to decide

you can do this fairly easily in either a controller base-class or an action-filter that is applied to the controllers actions

759551
logout	login
i would like to get the total number of hours and minutes between all login times and logout times for the rows displayed in the datagridview

759557
typedef	struct
the most common way i ve seen this solved is to bundle the struct declaration with a typedef like this

759567
environment	execution
in any case it sounds like you re going to need a careful testability design and testing strategy since you are introducing variation along two simultaneous dimensions inherited hierarchy execution environment

759578
hide	show
create a methods or property on your view that enables you to hide or show the appropriate controls

759589
ubuntu	linux
we are developing on ubuntu 8.04 but our production servers are running linux centos and we are also using sql-server 2005

759594
export	csv
the profiling i m tempted to say is nicer than firebug s - simply because it lets you export the results directly to csv

759598
triggers	insert
create an insert update delete triggers on the other table so that when a row is changed every keyword is extracted and put into or replaced in this table

759612
priority-queue	queue
the second problem can be solved with keeping a queue for each client or perhaps using a priority-queue and attach a priority to each message depending on the clients activty

759621
any	set
means i am not setting any datasource to gridview.i have to populate gridview by adding footerrow.i have given visibility of footerrow as true.so one error is coming as object not set to an instance of an object .what may be the reason for this

759642
.net	wcf
i think you really should be looking at wcf for 3.5+ but for .net 2.0 look at something like wscf web services contract first which defines the contracts in xml and generates a set of libraries reusable across services

759645
rewrite	rule
i have a simple rewrite rule that writes to an external domain using the helicon isapi_rewrite 3 rewriteproxy derictive

759647

we have chosen to show the payment user-interface inside an iframe inside out checkout page even though we now realize the payment solution provider recommend using a top-level windows

759724
python	ruby
if you need to run interpreted code why not use a modern interpreted language like python or ruby

759734

759766
children	nodes
a leaf-nodes is basically any nodes that doesn t have children

759766
spaces	output
the spaces in the stream is just to separate the tree from the encoded data and does not take up any spaces in the final output

759769
forms-authentication	credentials

759776
internet-explorer	opera
tested internet-explorer 8 and opera 9 and it works

759791
macros	vba
the way i resolved the import as this was a one-off task and not something that was going to hang around was to create a simple macros vba from excel that would simply call a stored proc using each row as the parameters

759791
macros	vba
the vba macros had code similar to

759795
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

759813
attributes	properties
instead of setting a navigateurl properties declaratively handle the selectednodechanged event and set the iframe s src attributes there conditionally depending on which node was clicked the selectednode

759814
python	perl
you can use example git-fast-import based tools distributed in git.git repository import-zips.py in python or import-tars.perl in perl or use those script as a base of your own import script

759821
subclassing	superclass
1 factory-pattern - assume you have one superclass and n number of subclassing

selected	cells
the .net effect is that clicking on the partially drawn row starts selected cells in a vertical column spinning all the way to the bottom or until you release the mouse

759832
google-chrome	firefox
on ie6 and firefox it works fine google-chrome opera etc etc

759840

759863
webforms	asp.net
there are lots of articles and discussions about the differences between asp.net webforms and asp.net mvc that compare the relative merits of the two frameworks

759863
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i have a different question for anyone who has experience using webforms that has since moved to asp.net-mvc

759863
asp.net-mvc	webforms
what is the number one thing that webforms had that asp.net-mvc doesn t that you really miss

759867
.when	ready
that function will be execute .when the document is ready

759891
xml-serialization	xml
one not read only is for xml-serialization it has xml attributes and the other one which is read only is as i think for post compile use - so it s more or less static information

759897
hide	show
i would get to grips with a javascript library like jquery as it will take care of all the cross-browser issues for you and has such useful methods as toggle to show and hide elements

759897
hide	show
also if you wanted to hide previously show submenus you would use this

759902
revision	svn

759962
revision	svn
something like 9.0417.yyyy.xxxx would be the 17th of april 2009 release with the build number of yyyy and xxxx as the svn revision

759963

759973
google-chrome	firefox
my application s javascript is working on firefox and ie but it is not working in google-chrome

759995
revision	updates
so you say you have many products that each share the same revision number if the deployed field versions - i m assuming this means if you updates your embedded libraries that the office products do not use the libraries for the office products still get a new revision number even though no code has changed in them

760039
environment	restart
after much tinkering sticking profiling in various places and getting familiar with pastescript insides i discovered that the constant cpu load goes away if application is started without --reload parameter this flag tells paster to restart itself if code changes handy in development which is fine in production environment

760058
associations	model
if user is an activerecord model where i have loaded an associations contacts ahead of time with how do i refresh the contacts associations when it has changed in the database

760061

the value of the two form field are submitted when the button is pressed and the two local variables firstname and lastname are set but the function associated with shtml.submit isn t called

760119
python	java
i know that java can execute python and ruby dynamically if you include the relevant jars and i can t see why someone wouldn t have thought to port these systems to c# and .net

760126
sftp	ssh
sounds like you should use an sftp ssh server it s firewall nat safe secure and already does what you want and more

760140
sftp	ftp
i would suggest not to use ftp or sftp or any other connection oriented technique

760142
perl	ruby
work in this area i was wondering would a scripting language like perl python ruby etc allow me to do such

760166
hash	md5
i am taking the md5 hash of an image file and i want to use the hash as a filename

760187
icollection	ienumerable
the for-loop is a nice alternative but if your ienumerable collection does not implement icollection it is not possible

760207
stderr	stdout
basically you need to redirect both stdout and stderr to your file

760233
hide	show
listing works i extended it to a foldable solution to show hide directory contents

760235
database-metadata	grant
you could automate that by generating your grant statements from the database-metadata

760236
iteration	set
if you detect the break condition simply set a flag in your functor and then for each subsequent iteration simply return without doing your functor s thing

760237
selected	button
after i selected the item with a single click a second click just flashes the item button down turns text background to white button up turns it back to blue and the edit control never appears

760264
dictionary	arrays
for example a collection dictionary will involve multiple objects for the items the arrays hash-buckets indexes etc - but the raw data when serialized will typically be just the data - so you might see less volume when serialized

760301
ostream	std
if i implement a custom std streambuf that output to nowhere i imagine that the std ostream layer will still do all the formatting

760301
ostream	std
can anyone suggest a way to have a truly null std ostream that avoids doing any work at all on the parameters passed to it with

760302
environment	execution
in the two different environment i am seeing two different code execution paths despite the same urls and the same code base

760312
mergetool	meld
i git-rebase use mergetool meld to resolve my conflicts and when i get to the end of all that i try to do a dcommit and i get a merge conflict during commit error

760334
webforms	asp.net
is there a way to do this using asp.net webforms

760350
configuration	logging
for example you cannot decide the logging level at runtime from a configuration file

760390
duplicates	contains
assuming however you need the content to be fully functioning asp.net code then i would suggest a user-controls for each contentpage that contains the content itself and then you only need to duplicates one line of code

760402
installation	uninstall
supports calling java code as part of the installation at multiple points in time such as when a certain page is displayed files being copied at uninstall time etc.

760402
configuration	installation
we support copying and moving files substituting values in configuration files unpacking files and most other common installation functionality

760416
swing	swt
i would use eclipse rcp when you really need a platform to built on top not just widgetery like swing or swt

760417
moss	wss
i think this has to do with caml queries being a wss thing and audiences being a moss shared service

760418
detect	move
i am doing ping pong game where i have to move ball and detect collision with outside boundary and also with moving paddle

760448
methods	extend
you could use one of there other methods to supply data or extend the adddatafromdatabase function yourself

760458
mechanize	hpricot
try its hpricot mechanize

760483
implements	abstract
another basic example is the decorator pattern where you are coding towards an abstract superclass although this is for type matching and not for implements an is-a relationship

760487
enterprise-architect	visio
i haven t used it in a few years but microsoft has an enterprise-architect versioning of visio which allows for data modeling

760494
py2exe	exe
however if you do not bundle the entire package into a single exe py2exe website example - bottom of page you can get away with smaller updates by just replacing certain files like the exe file for example

760504
perl	lua
the formula is implemented in objective-c iphone f# autoit fortress lua apl sas mathcad j mel postscript vb.net clean ruby lisp prolog pl sql lyme coldfusion k c# hp48 transact sql o caml rebol real basic icon squeak haskell java javascript vba c++ perl maple mathematica matlab s-plus idl pascal python fortran scheme php gnu gnuplot

760506
selected	cell
now i need to always keep the last cell of the table view always selected

760514
getter	setter
i had students in my design-patterns class doing it for an assignment adding removing javabean getter and setter

760536
base-class	inherited
i think the biggest reason why composition is easier to test is that implementation inherited tends to create very coupled classes that are more fragile fragile base-class and harder to test in isolation

760543
default	reset
how do i reset the backcolor property after it has been changed previously so that the behavior reverts to the default

760561
dictionary	map
i would also strongly recommend that you reorder your type parameters - pretty much every dictionary map whatever i ve ever seen with key and value type parameters has put the key type parameter first

760565
value	field
this would be view code that constructs a css link based on the value of the database field

760575
boolean	int
you could implement these either as boolean flag columns or have an int column that acts as a bitmask

760593
temporary	copy
the standard allows a copy to occur when binding a temporary to a const reference

760634
asp.net-mvc	webforms
one difference which i am sure will be rectified over time is the expansive amount of reference material and examples online for webforms versus the relatively sparse amount for asp.net-mvc

760634
asp.net-mvc	webforms
however one could argue that a lot of the material on webforms covers topics such as the page life cycle which asp.net-mvc no longer makes necessary thank goodness

760655
versioning	migrate
this way i ll be able to make a simple scripting to migrate my static page to the dynamic versioning

760657
menuitem	button
after that you make it a child of the menuitem and the button by setting icon and content properties therefore it is not a tree anymore

760657
menuitem	button
i don t know how menuitem escaped that exception may be it is smart enough to remove the image element from button s children this is how it disappears before it adds the image to own logical children collection

760665
postgresql	mysql
i m testing out dblinq-0.18 and dblinq from svn trunk with mysql and postgresql

760667
button	popup
i have a page that has 3 button on it when a user clicks on a button it displays a model popup where the user inputs data etc

760667
postback	ajax
the main page also has a button below the dropdown that when clicked performs a ajax postback that sends the value of the selected item to the database

760667
postback	ajax
sending alert blah on the events stop workign after the postback ajax postback not entire page refersh

760669
codeigniter	cakephp
is this achievable or should i go with cakephp or codeigniter

760678
joomla	drupal
you can try looking at drupal or joomla

760686
click	mouse
it has a built-in recorder to record your keystrokes and mouse movements click which you can then dump into a scripting and playback

760700
joomla	drupal
i think if you are looking at creating a website with such a strict deadline you d be better off trying to use a pre-built cms such as joomla drupal or a host of other ones out there that are php

760720
python	php
not in php but if you need that with such short deadline you can get a social networking site ready for free with django and pinax python

760721
any	set
after your ajax to you make any calls to location.href set a hash or anything

760737
linkbutton	onclick
first you add the onclick attributes if not possible for hyperlinkfield try a simple hyperlink or linkbutton

760738
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i definitely miss asp.net-mvc every day at work while i look at the ugly webforms code i want to wipe it all out and now make everything transparent clean and beautiful

760748
order	add
in order to setup eventlisteners you need to add this code when initializing nhibernate

760748
web-config	app-config
your web-config app-config file must be changed in order to include the following

760753
contains	elements
of course this doesn t work because it is expecting a single elements from the list which itself contains 2 elementss

760755
append	input
so when you try to append this object to the string your selector ends up being something like object htmldivelement input which is obviously not right

760759
stderr	stdout
the server writes stdout and stderr to files maybe in logs

760760
any	set
now tmp has a bit set if any of the bytes below has a bit set in the related positioning

760801
value	field
it tends to be a bad idea to make non-const field public because it then becomes hard to force error checking constraints and or add side-effects to value changes in the future

760838
export	csv
i have a export to csv button on the flash component

760872
hide	show
of course i could put the 4 steps in one page and show hide but that s not my point with the question

760876
value	field
i have to refresh calls the query then reload loads value into field to get the new value to display

760877
getter	setter
as an aside in c++ it s an especially good idea to give both the getter and setter for a member the same name since in the future you can then actually change the the pair of methods

760888
innodb	myisam
no database guru but have you tried using a different db engine innodb is slow try myisam and making sure the data you are selected is indexed

760891
document	element
attach the event handler to the document itself then conditional execute your methods if the sender of the event was element you expect

760910
sql-server	oracle
it should import from excel access sql-server csv tab-separated flat file xml oracle etc

760910
silverlight	wpf
we may also want integration with wpf and silverlight

760913
expression	evaluation
that said the system of ienumerable + lazy evaluation + lamdba expression + closures on which linq depends on is significant enough by itself to warrant it s own buzzword

760927
callback	methods
a callback is when an ajax control calls a methods on the page as part of an ajax request

760929
darcs	svn
if you need to micro-manage simultaneous but in some sense unrelated changes then you may care to investigate darcs which has a reversed emphasis when compared to systems like svn git or mercurial

760932
gethashcode	equals
with nhibernate entities you are meant to override equals and gethashcode

760972
put	get
the above code means get me text of first syslistview32 control hence 1 at the end from application which title starts with windriver and put it in ouputvar variables

760972
click	mouse
in order to get the type and number of control in question simply open windows spy right click ahk tray icon and hover over control with mouse to see its details

760978
logfile	tail
i want to run a tail -f logfile command on a remote machine using python paramiko module

760984
java.util.date	to-date
if you still need to use java.util.date objects before after this conversion the joda datetime api provides some easy to-date and tocalendar methods for easy translation

760985
value	field
create a field in the db for this value and check this unique value against this field

760992
value	field
create a unique field in your table that holds this cookie or control value

760999
updating	updates
when i ve a page that does inserting or updating i typically do a response.redirect to another page after the updates is completed even if you just response.redirect to same page

761028
document	element
is there another html element i can use instead that will allow me to access a particular portion of the document using the id attributes that will not cause linebreaks

761038
compile-time	hardcode
using selected does not work beyond the hardcode maximum file-descriptor limit set at compile-time which is hopeless normally 256 or a few more

761046
pixels	line
apparently drawline draws a line that is one pixels short of the actual specified length

761046
drawrectangle	draw
there doesn t seem to be a drawpoint drawpixels whatnot but instead you can use drawrectangle with width and height set to 1 to draw a single pixels

761051
controller	routes
i have a set of routes that are generated dynamically at runtime but that all point to the same controller

761051
controller	routes
these all work fine producing routes like authors 1 books books 55 etc and then all end up being processed by the main controller

761059
wordpress	blogs
well it is definitely not entirely correct since wordpress blogs generate tons of seo and are written in php

761059
any	set
if any page happens to have the right http-headers set it will prevent it from getting indexed well

761077
foundation	cocoa
is foundation cocoa leaking that much from such a trivial example

761078
children	nodes
here we rely on the fact that the only non-white-space nodes in the document are the ones that are children of nodes for which we have a matching templates

761093
tableofcontents	latex
i d like to use latex s tableofcontents command or some equivalent to automatically generate a table of contents but i d also like to add a sentence or two to each line in the table of contents that describes what the referenced section is about

761095
derived-class	base-class
assignment conversion of a base-class to a derived-class makes sense if you consider assignment or conversion to be a value by value copy

761095
derived-class	base-class
if it were doing a copy of value then copying to base-class to a derived-class would

761100
private-members	private
the reason private behaves like it does is similar to c++ s friend - it allows certain classes or procedural code to access private-members

761163
postgresql	mysql
in mysql or postgresql

761170
value	field
i currently have a table in mysql that stores value normally but i want to add a field to that table that stores an arrays of value such as cities

761172
restart	reload
it should almost always reload when the web-config is changed or replaced but i have seen times when it won t you can then restart it in iis or try editing the web-config locally

761199
value	field
i would go with the idea of a field contains your comma or other logical delimiter separated value

761208
put	get
i know its something simple i just don t know about so i put up a bid on elance to get someone to solve it for money even

761214
inherited	subclass
edit on another note i wouldn t even use the phrase subclass or the inherited phrase to describe classes that are defined to implement an interface

761215
abstract-class	pure-virtual
an abstract-class is a class with both implementation and interface pure-virtual methods that will be inherited

761216
arrays	loops
the i would walk through the arrays using a loops

761237
jlabel	jlist
i abhor visual-based gui creator editor software but am getting a little tired of manually instantiating jpanels and boxes and jlabel and jlist etc.

761238
perl	ruby
google also doesn t index java ruby perl python or any other backend code

761247
any	set
applications that use wi-fi for any period of time must set this key to true

761253
groovy	java
if you re willing to step slightly outside plain java groovy s builder concept works pretty well with guis

761253
groovy	java
of course you can interop between groovy and java fairly easily

761272
value	field
now while my test can_add_currency and can_add_country succeeded i export the schema i have null value in the table country on the field currency_id

761281
foundation	cocoa
the implementation of many cocoa classes is based on core foundation types

761283
.when	ready
qa gets to decide .when the product is ready to ship

761286
progress-bar	progress
i can download stuff just fine with it i just can t get the setup to show the progress on the progress-bar

761296
expression	evaluation
expression templates allow to intelligently remove temporaries and enable lazy evaluation when that is appropriate -- eigen takes care of this automatically and handles aliasing too in most cases

761298
any	set
be sure to use the attr methods to set any dynamic attributes

761305
oracle	mysql
it s a commercial system to manage study abroad programs for large universities and they had installations on oracle mysql and sql server

761306

or something to updates the persistent object with the use of an transient object

761308
sqldatasource	gridview
i have an sqldatasource object linked to a gridview which receives data from a database when executed

761310
push	pull
i pull data in and push data to from the following

761342
abstract-class	derived-class
abstract-class can be inherited without implementing the abstract methods though such a derived-class is abstract itself

761351
attributes	properties
you may also choose to just consume the old class some sort of wrapper as an attributes properties

761371
multithreading	wait
is it worth it to add the extra work and danger of multithreading here especially since the main thread will have to block and wait anyway

761372
richfaces	icefaces
by the way adding ajax to facelets is easy if you use something like richfaces or icefaces

761386
mechanize	hpricot
bankjob uses mechanize hpricot as suggested in other answers to scrape a website with a table in it and produce csv output it also produces ofx which is irrelevant to your need - since it s bank-statement data but the csv should work for any kind of data

761393
credentials	integrated
with integrated windows authentication the end user s credentials will then be used instead of the default aspnet account or account attached to the app pool

761395
click	mouse
if there s an antsy user waiting for a mouse click to do something then saving 5 out of 10 seconds is a meaningful benefit

761396
put	get
to a person all the development managers wish we would get more qa people rather than configuration management because we have found that qa is extremely valuable to us and configuration management only causes projects to get farther behind while we wait for someone to put the new code out on the release schedule rather than when it is ready to go

761402
firefox	opera
why can t ie work as well as firefox or even opera for god s sake

761436
ruby	php
so for your language of choice php .net ruby python java etc. which framework do you recommend

761440
children	nodes
better would be to have the child nodes defined as actually children of the parent td then jquery can simplify things for you

761461
codeigniter	cakephp
i have used codeigniter and cakephp both of which are php asp.net-mvc frameworks

761472
python	ruby
in some dynamic languages like python and ruby there may be additional lookups method calls to implement dynamically generated attributes

761472
common-lisp	smalltalk
other dynamic languages such as common-lisp and smalltalk can compete evenly with static languages in many use cases because dynamic lookups modifications are more controlled

761482
triggers	insert
when an after update or after insert triggers is fired is it a synchronous or asynchronous event

761495
blender	3ds
you ll need to model your 3d object in something like 3ds max or blender and have your engine control the models movements based on inputs received from whatever your outside source is

761499
base-class	inherited
you might want to consider having the base-class define a methods called preparetodrive where inherited classes could put any setup tasks that need to be done before starting up

761504
java-3d	jogl
java-3d or jogl are common libraries for creating 3d graphics in java

761510
python	c++
however if you re thinking about the differences between say python and c++ just for example it s not the dynamic vs

761522
change-password	logout
for instance an account controller should handle the login register logout change-password actions

761536
required	checked
the standard data-structures in java should already implements a relatively fast .hashcode methods for you the hash might be incrementally calculated or might required iterating over each element checked the source of the data-structure you re using to be sure

761536
contains	elements
this way the shape of the tree as well as the contains elements would be compared in o n time where n is the size of the largest tree

761542
nunit	moq
i have been writing unit tests using nunit and moq with my silverlight code for some time now

761544
triggers	insert
for example if you write an after insert triggers to record the insert in another log table you can be certain that the main insert and the insert to the log table happen as an atomic operation

761544
triggers	insert
when the main insert returns all other work done by triggers both before and after triggers is also complete

761567
entity-framework	ado.net
i can t use linq or ado.net entity-framework very easily as it s not coming from an sql db

761570
response	timeout
it looks like this is finding the zzz entry in tnsnames.ora successfully but the timeout indicates that it is getting no response whatsoever from the server

761570
sqlplus	prompt
which makes sense if you are no accustomed to sqlplus but as you can see there is no point where it prompt you for the database name

761571
contains	set
it should be set to the value of the directory that contains your bin directory which in your case i believe would be usr local oracle instantclient_10_2

761573
upgrade	migrate
this also gives you the ability to replicate migrate or upgrade the machine without reconfiguring and reinstalling

761573
ubuntu	debian
also run your lamp configuration on an operating system without a gui debian ubuntu fedora etc

761581
postgresql	mysql
since postgresql is a lot more sane than mysql there are not that many tricks to report on

761596
codeigniter	kohana
and a thing about codeigniter i asked some time ago people about it and most says that kohana based on ci is better

761602
double	int
shorter types are converted to longer types float to double short to int etc.

761613
facebook	linkedin
i go to websites like facebook and linkedin and see that they only use https when they are dealing with sensitive data like passwords and personal settings

761616
contains	elements
my question is how do i serialization portions of a dom tree that i have already parsing and created of out of a xml instance document validated against a schema i wrote so that i can create many new instance documents still contains the root elements of the original document in a way that they remain valid against my schema

761616
contains	elements
to be more specific i have a large instance document with thousands of sets contains within a single root elements that i need to individually place into separate files for later processing

761638
authentication	login
if you just need to check that a login is valid and don t care much about usability you can use digest authentication

761661
xsd	xml
i have an xsd file and have not done much xml manipulation parsing etc

761661
python	java
python or java

761661
xsd	xml
i just want to feed xsd file to some tool and have it generate a sample xml file

761684
benchmarking	profiling
so then i read further and it seems 2.2.2 has benchmarking profiling built in

761687
user-interface	drawing
edit solved it turns out that i had set all of the user-interface elements font properties to be 14pt arial but not the usercontrol itself so when it was drawing it on the form it was resizing it all

761691
jquery	.post
how do i encrypt .post data while using ajax and jquery

761701
put	get
in asp.net-mvc a page is what you get when you put the three together

761714
.when	ready
.when you re ready to generate a test xml file locate the file in the package explorer the navigator view usually on the left side right click on it and selected generate xml file

761725
deployment	install
i want to make deployment easy for the user so that all they have to do is double click on an icon and all of my apps files will be placed into the proper folders on their asp.net website and all the necessary third-party files like microsoft s visual fox pro 9 dll will be install

761736
spring	jsf
i ve tried java jsf gtk spring asp.net-mvc and many other - but still

761749

my case is a bit simpler in my application i needed to export a db diagram to jpeg and to perform an export as well to an html report i used that approach ping pong

761773
msbuild	nant
msbuild nant and you can moidfy some

761793
contains	any
if required put it against all the fields of the table except any date oriented ones that would receive the system date at the time of the insert or fields used only by the back end such as insertedby which would contains the user id of the person doing the insertion except the id

761805
credentials	account
system management tasks such as managing the fdhost launcher service mssqlfdlauncher restarting filtering daemon host process if you change the service account credentials configuring server-wide full-text properties and backing up full-text catalogs.

you can use uigetdir to ask the user for the direcotory contains the image set

761849
hide	show
for the page that initially show the control the javascript in the control works fine but for the page that initially hide the control the javascript doesn t work

761854
protected	public
resharper suggests changing the accessibility of a public constructor in an abstract-class to protected but it does not state the rationale behind this

761864
protected	public
therefore the only types that should have access to a constructor are its derived types and hence protected makes much more sense than public

761879
paintcomponent	draw
did you override paintcomponent in each jpanel to draw the pacman ghost maze

761881
contains	set
set the dll that contains the tests as the startup project i know you don t need to do this was just trying to get it to fail

i would suggest investing your time in learning microsoft sql-server itself data-access application block from enterprise library and ado.net entity-framework

761938
entity-framework	ado.net
ado.net entity-framework at wikipedia

761938
entity-framework	ado.net
the ado.net entity-framework overview at msdn

entity-framework	ado.net
murach s ado.net 3.5 linq and the entity-framework by anne boehm mar 2009

761944
entity-framework	ado.net
edit 3 others would also suggest things such as the ado.net entity-framework

761945
flotr	flot
as an alternative to flot if you are using prototype.javascript as javascript-framework you can use flotr

761946
any	set
when i configure resharper s unit test options to use my testrunconfig in order to utilize my set of deployment items my test runs end without displaying any results or errors

761962
constructor	object
if you really need to dynamically allocate the members i don t recommended if this class owns the data member object you can have a private method doing all the initialization and you can call that method from your constructor

761965
csv	tsv
in a well-formed csv or tsv file the number of commas or tabs respectively per line should be constant no variation at all

761966
authentication	login
some of our customers have asked us to support ldap integration for authentication user account against their existing systems instead of having to create another login account for each of their employees

761966
authentication	login
naturally our system already has a mechanism for maintaining user account profiling and authentication those user account from our login page

761966
authentication	login
our login page will securely forward the login credentials presumably encrypted and hashed in some agreed upon format to the remote authentication url provided by our customer

761966
authentication	login
would it then be required that the customer s remote authentication script must provide that id to our system so we know which user account in our system to associate the login with

761967
value	field
assuming that there are a fixed number of field per line and that any commas or tabs within value are enclosed by quotes you should be able to work it out on the frequency of each character in each line

761979
attributes	properties
in order for it to tell what has changed it can keep a cache in a properties file which updates after each successful build unless you use the delayupdate attributes - so perhaps to test it you can have

761985
contains	set
just when you are finished make sure you tell nhibernate to persist the changes you made to the database either by calling session.save or session.delete on every item you add remove or if you have set cascading like you have simple call session.save on the parent object that contains the collection

761988
business-objects	data-access
this becomes a bit tedious to define - but it can be extensible - and it is a way to get meaningful results back to your clients and for a data-access layer to pass back to a business-objects layer an exact reason for failure i use enums in the business-objects layer for different status conditions

761991
put	get
i m using ibm s .net classes ibm.wmq to put a request message and then get a response message

762012
unmanaged	c++-cli
i prefer to write a managed wrapper in c++-cli formerly managed c++ as it makes it much easier to explicitly do what you want with managed unmanaged interoperability on the c++ side and your c# doesn t get polluted with p invoke style code

762035
perl	awk
you ve still got the batch conversion problem though although it would be a somewhat simpler script quite possible to do with perl or awk

762063
touchesmoved	drawrect
however this is still calling drawrect within touchesmoved which is giving me the effect i want but is way too slow on the iphone

762064
integrated-security	active-directory
generally accessing stuff like active-directory will not work due to the security context that the default anonymous iis user runs in so if you switch to integrated-security you might get further

762067
lighttpd	apache
lighttpd for video instead of apache

762071
value	field
b you could make sure to check for empty char x field values and not convert those or pick a default datetime value for those

762072
groovy	java
grails is written in groovy which allows you to use any java library out there

762080
lighttpd	apache
lighttpd for video instead of apache

762105
rollback	commit
in onactionexecuted i manually pull the isessionprovider out of my containers and call commit or rollback on it depending on whether an exception-handling has been thrown - doing nothing of course if no session is currently stored in the web request

762110
background-color	transparency
while not a perfect solution but would work better in handling your transparency issue would be to not use transparency at all set the label background-color to match that of the background then use the align with margins property and set your margins to positioning the labels on the form

762116
strtotime	mktime
you can look into using strtotime instead of mktime

762145
arrays	loops
you should really look into loops for while etc and arrays

762189
joystick	keyboard
poll the keyboard joystick whatever and cache the last direction entered by the user

762201
contains	set
basically just contains a b that does not inherit from a in a and set it to null until it applies

762201
base-class	subclass
if i have a subclass that extends a base-class by adding additional functionality not just changing the existing behavior of the base-class am i doing something tragically wrong

762211
security	owasp
also take a look at owasp enterprise security api for a collection of security methods that a developer needs to build a secure web application

762212
wxwidgets	mfc
wxwidgets was fairly easy to pick up had everything i needed and was way easier than mfc

762221
hash	md5
function genkey given a string q this may be a md5 or sha hash and a seed string the function must generate a new string p

762229
expression	brackets
i can write an expression that will satisfy this for all of the three declarations but since i am also capturing information after it the actual style info within the brackets i feel like this entire block of text is considered to be accounted for so the engine moves on to the next character following the whole block that just got processed

762229
parsing	comma
i know that i can modify my regex to match the whole line and then parsing it for comma after i get my match but i d like to keep all my logic inside the expression itself if possible

762232
contains	elements
classcastexception if the collection contains elements that are not mutually comparable for example strings and integers

762239
cassini	iis
can anyone explain this and preferably suggest a way i can have the same web.config file to run the service in cassini and iis

762239
cassini	iis
cassini therefore runs under a domain account and iis 5.1 under a local account

762239
cassini	iis
the situation sounds similar as fails when the server is running under a domain account which is my situation with cassini - running as my normal domain user account and works when running under a local account which is my situation with iis

762240
webforms	asp.net
how do you store a file that was uploaded by an asp.net webforms into a sql-server 2005 varbinary max field

762255
void	main

if no arguments are passed it ll just assume port 4000 or whatever port you choose as the default port

762277
stdin	pipe
in the child it reattaches stdout or stdin to one end of the pipe then exec s the child

762296
log4net	nlog
some great ones are log4net and nlog

762300
exception-handling	try-catch
how i approach this need is to use a try-catch on the specific tests do what i want with the exception-handling and then throw again within the catch block so that the test could fail

762301
exception-handling	try-catch
just wrap your tests in a try-catch block catch any exception-handling and save them and the test name to a private member variables in your test class

762321
composite	visitor
see this answer for link to a thorough explanation on the visitor and composite patterns

762338
forms-authentication	security
it supports the usual asp.net security mechanisms such as forms-authentication membership provider and so on so that you can secure your access points based on the user s credentials and for that you can use the client services that can take care of authenticating between your app and your server

762342
dojo	gwt
if you use a cross browser toolkit like gwt dojo and so forth you should not have to neglect anyone

762360

762377
stderr	stdout
or first join stderr and stdout and then grep out those specific errors

762378
cassini	iis
are the iis and cassini servers running on the same box

762383
panels	grid
just put the grid panels inside a canvas rather than directly into the windows - this will then give it x y co-ordinates

762401
any	set
sadly the memorylimit attributes on the processmodel configurationuration element is only allowed to be set at the machine level in machine.configuration - and the way configuration files work there s no way to say this is the maximum memory any one app can have but they can ask for less if they want

762408
derived-class	subclassing
the simulated dynamic binding techniques aka crtp are useful in the c++ world not just in the context of atl com but especially if you are developing a library of reusable classes that you want to subclassing or mixin in situations where only one instance is present at a time a class cspiffyframework that provides mixin functionality that you want to reuse a lot and you have a derived-class that you want to include that functionality and it s not part of a virtual object model so you don t really need a vtable

762416
google-chrome	firefox
when i run this in google-chrome ver 2 it doesn t return the string but it works in firefox ver 3

762433
powerpc	arm
if you want to check portability try your code also on other smp architectures like powerpc an older macpro or a cell blade or an itanium or an ibm power or arm

762447
powerpc	arm
of course there may be some strange architectures that can t handle this but on x86 x64 it should be okay and probably also arm powerpc and other common architectures

762455
revision	svn
svn info | grep revision | awk print 2

762463
decrement	increment
if you want to ensure that every skip results in a skipped call to .work you should change doskip into a counter that is protected by a lock on both increment and compare decrement

762469
versioning	upgrade
not all users will necessarily be in a positioning to upgrade some users may be accessing your site from their workplace where the it department mandates a particular versioning of ie

762477
telnet	tcp
they re proposing use of telnet simply because it s one of the simplest tcp ip clients and because it s installed almost everywhere

762514
any	set
so what i m trying to do is call a single propertywasset function when any property within a c# class is set conversely propertywasgot when it is get

762524
getter	setter
anyhow you can add the intercepting code to getter and setter of each property too

762539
environment	building
i want to write a simple batch scripting that loads the visual-studio building environment using vcvars32.bat and then continue with the building using vcbuilding

762550
interface-builder	iboutlet
you ll need to get a reference to the tableview in your controllers either through an iboutlet or by finding the view in the view hierarchy or you can change the frame in interface-builder

762553
compact-framework	.net
i am using c# and microsoft .net compact-framework 1.0

762593
value	field
and its value is always the same as one of the values in the field name in the table route the destination must already exist in route

762605
32-bit	x86
this assumes 32-bit ints with little-endian storage for everything think x86 processors

762606
text-editor	editor
not to be too much of a tease but looking ahead vs2010 uses a new rehostable editor component you can hear some about it here hanselminutes podcast 147 - the new wpf-based text-editor in visual-studio 2010 - interview with a dev

762614
put	get
to hopefully get around this i put all the data that needed to be decompressed into a memorystream and then read to end with a deflatestream

762640
stderr	stdout
you could read the stdout stderr of which into a variables or an arrays using backticks rather than checking for an exit code

762649
any	set
note that by default this will only affect objects tables created by the user that issued this command although it can also be set on any role that the issuing user is a member of

762652
shell	bash
when writing shell scripts itâ s often permissible to require a bash shell #

762655
flash-cs3	swc
it might not install in the right folder for flash-cs3 but there are the mx.remoting classes that go in the same folder with your other as2 mx packages the netconnection debugger that goes in the windowswf folder and the swc themselves that go in common libraries

762673
jdk1.5	jdk1.4
it seems to be because testng has a jarfile for jdk1.4 and jdk1.5

762673
jdk1.5	jdk1.4
how do i specify either jdk1.4 or jdk1.5

762675
jdk1.5	jdk1.4
in this case the classifier should be jdk1.4 or jdk1.5

762696
joomla	drupal
the only other option i can think of is to simply replace your existing cms with a more robust one like drupal joomla wordpress which you could then extend with modules

762704
selected	button
for instance i have a grid with three rows the top and bottom row have button and the middle row has a datagrid that can change in height based on the page size the user has selected

762704
display	height
i want the app to adjust the host div s height to the height to display the entire app

762707
teamcity	nant
teamcity supports nant msbuild ant and am sure any other build platform you can install on on the buildagents

762720
keyword	term
i d like to provide suggestions for the chosen keyword search term but also limit those suggestions to the country chosen from the dropdown if changed ...is this possible

762735
comet	chat
this is a free comet based chat service by the guys who did the jmvc framework

762752
constructor	private
problem the problem is that the private members lose the information outside of the constructor

762758
dictionary	arrays
1 the format method accepts either a varargs arrays or a map in .net it d be a dictionary

762762
.net	wcf
but my question now is can i expect .net 3.0 to support wcf wpf

762764
put	get
my model expects a blob so when i put in the image as img then it throws a fit and i get

762772
arguments	default
default constructor are those for which all the arguments have default value so your constructor that takes a pointers is not a default constructor

762784
contains	any
will return any event with a driver whose name contains the letters jill

762791
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari which behaves the same is trying to parse it as an html document but fails because it is non-whitespace text content outside the document element html which is not allowed

762791
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and ie manage to apply their â œfix up text outside any elementâ broken-html-rule to save you but google-chrome doesn t

762791
google-chrome	safari
but beware the mimetype parameter is not supported by google-chrome or safari

762799
buffering	streaming
transmitfile writes the specified file directly to an http response output streaming without buffering it in memory.

762801
python	perl
if you don t have to use c then i would recommend perl or python

762805
getter	setter
- i like this pattern for setter getter

762816
contains	any
this created a file called listofpaths.txt on my c folder and this contains a list of all occurences of any file ending with .zip in all subfolders of my harddrive

762817
instances	private
for instances it is entirely legal for private fields to all have the same name - but there isn t a compiler out there that will let you do that

762821
ruby-on-rails	django
i like ruby on ruby-on-rails and am getting into django and like that as well

762850
oracle	mysql
and from experience looking at apache mysql and oracle the amount of threads is about coresx10 for database servers and coresx40 for web servers not saying these are the ideals but they seem to be patterns of succesful systems so if your system can be balanced to work optimally with similar numbers atleast you ll know your design isn t completely lousy

762853
constructor	object
notice that in your copy constructor you simply assign your internal pointers to match the object you re copying from

762876
value	field
this way you can write the conditional to check whether the field value is 0 or 0

762894
having	select
now i am having problems constructing a sql query that will select and display the records in the package_details replacing the sender_state and receiver_state with the corresponding state_name in states table

762895
simpletest	phpunit
phpunit and simpletest are the major xunit systems in php

762895
cakephp	symfony
zend codeigniter symfony and cakephp are the major ones

762905
command-prompt	cmd
if that doesn t work try installing the aspnet_client files again by running this cmd on the visual-studio cmd-prompt -

762923
row	col
in your example you say it is zero-based but it is actually starting at 1 and you count the top-left element as row col 1 1 so you d need to adjust the math

762940
sql-server	ms-access
it is recommended to use the sql-server migration assistant ssma rather than the upsizing wizard built into ms-access

762942
typename	typedef
in c89 a typedef could be redeclared in an inner block with a declaration that explicitly contains a typename

762942
typename	typedef
this rule avoided the ambiguity about whether to take the typedef as the typename or a candidate for redeclaration

762943
netbsd	linux
you could use gxemul which emulates a mips machine among others including dreamcast and is able to run many operating systems included linux netbsd and some more

762965
decimal-point	digits
bascially the .2 represents how many digits to output after the decimal-point

762977
.when	ready
this can be put in an onload ready function if you like but if so the â variables scriptingâ must be calculated at include-time and not in the ready function .when that execute more scripting s will have been parsing

762979
windows-server	windows
windows-server 2003 and windows

762980
yaml	ini
yaml or ini files are used for configuration but game data is stored in xml

762985
javascript	dom
the javascript might have access to the dom if so it should be simple to extract all of the anchor tags and return them

762985
javascript	dom
of course i have only written the tiniest of iphone apps and am not very familiar with javascript or the dom so i could be way off base here

762985
javascript	dom
looking at the dom and javascript it may be as easy as

762989
groovy	java
you could also look at using groovy with your java code as it currently circumvents much of the access level restrictions of java code

763008
directory	folder
the solution is for me to change directory to the icons folder and execute the command there

763011
javascript	dom
of course the best parser available is probably the native html viewing widget and since it gives you the ability to run javascript see my original answer to your original question you should be able to extract the anchors from the dom document.anchors and write rewrite whatever you need to using document.write and the other dom methods

763018
firefox	opera
this was started by microsoft in ie 5.5 as far as i remember and then picked up by mozilla firefox then opera and then safari

763031
parentheses	braces
in particular it handles continuation lines implied by open parentheses brackets and braces correctly and it indents multiline if for while statements differently.

763036
while-loop	loops
take out the comments relating to producer s while-loops and you ll have a working infinite loops that produces the current time at 2 second intervals

763040
javascript	dom
you ll have to do the date manipulation at least the stuff that changes and update the dom using javascript which is client-side

763054
expression	evaluation
when i did the above with your javascript snippet alllinks.snapshotlength was evaluation to 0 indicating that your xpath expression didn t match anything

763054
contains	elements
digging in a bit deeper it looks like gmail s main document is a number of iframes and the iframes contains the actual application elements

763067
json	xml
json can t be used by the silverlight client but silverlight 3 will be using binary xml by default to talk to web services

763075
installation	building
in building components for installation i know that registration units are generally a should be separate thing but what are the guidelines for when one should divide the component installation into two separate packages typically one being runtime and the other being design time

763090
ruby	php
in other words don t try to make php into java c# ruby etc because if you do you ll fail and you ll hate your life

763096
protected	public
class key is a protected inner class of public class keyed

763119
bazaar	git
sounds like a distributed version control system like git or bazaar might be what you are looking for you can keep all of your code locally setup the repository on your external storage device but you still get the option of branching and merging

763131
web-services	api
web-services apis for j2me part 1 remote service invocation api

763136
digits	short
so generally the name of the package should consist of a short letter combinations for the company product one or two digits for the versioning number one of the accepted delphi bcb keys like d5 d2007 or bcb6

763137
order	add
in 32-bit integer math basic math operations of add and multiply are computed implicitly mod 2 32 meaning your results will be the lowest order bits of the add or multiply

763137
modulus	bigint
if you want to compute the result with a different modulus you certainly could use any number of bigint classes in different languages

763137
32-bit	64bit
but i ve been told that there are special tricks for efficiently computing a b mod c when c is of the form 2 n -1 or 2 n +1 that don t use 64bit math or a bigint library and are quite efficient more so than an arbitrary modulus evaluation and also properly compute cases which would normally overflow a 32-bit int if you were including the intermediate multiplication

763166
32-bit	64bit
this can require 64bit computations or you can split a and b into 16-bit parts and compute on 32-bit

763178
mbunit	nunit
and does support nunit mbunit and xunit.net

763179
order	add
in order to put ads on my wordpress site but only every few posts i want to add a simple conditional to the bottom of each post contains my ad code

763180
click	mouse
the latter event will catch a double click using any of the mouse button the button can be queried using the mouseeventargs.button property

763189
malloc	free
this will typically have asked the os for a big chunk of memory up front or at the first request which it then manages via the malloc free interface

763193
document	element
an xml document can only have a single root element

763193
document	element
in theory you could just overwrite the last line you always know how long it will be so you could just seek to the right place but it s more robust to read the file into memory append a new email element and then write out the whole document again

763208
virtual-machine	virtualbox
virtualbox hypervisor will detect out-of-memory errors and gracefully pause virtual-machine allowing user to close some applications to free memory

763215
cvs	git
syncing - merging in git is painless unlike scms like cvs or svn

763225
base-class	inherited
inherited should be implemented for reuse for your derived class to be reused in old code not for your class reusing parts of the base-class you can use aggregation for that

763226
32-bit	16-bit
suppose you want to multiply them mod 2 31 - 1 but you only have a 16-bit multiplier giving 32-bit

763236
required	checked
to avoid having error checked all over your code one approach is to allocate a reasonable amont of memory at the start and sub-allocate it as required

763242
delphi	c++
i m tired of the .net beginread endread stuff.i d love to use wsaasyncselect the way i used to in delphi c++

763249
http	ssl
if you need http or anything else then you can put another reverse proxy or webserver in reverse proxy mode that can handle the ssl before havp

763250
swing	gwt
for example is it possible to take a java swing application using grouplayout and get it to work with gwt

763262
powerpc	arm
it can be any programming language c++ assembly ... any hardware target arm intel powerpc ... any os windows linux s ymbian ... etc

763265
http	ssl
if you need http or anything else then you can put another reverse proxy or webserver in reverse proxy mode that can handle the ssl before havp

763267
swing	gwt
no gwt doesn t support layout managers from swing awt

763267
swing	gwt
swing awt is pixel-based while gwt renders to html

763267
swing	gwt
gwt layouts simply output different html tags div table inline elements ... while swing awt layouts do actually compute position of children components

763268
contains	elements
by default your main div won t expand around floated elements it contains

763275
knopflerfish	equinox
he made it work with equinox and knopflerfish

763277
value	field
alternatively perhaps the validating event is too late in the workflow - have you considered disclosing the controls as soon as the value in the relevant field is suitable without waiting for focus to change

763280
arrays	loops
we are iterating through the j outer rows in the arrays in the inner loops so for each trip through the inner loops the cache line will cause to be flushed and loaded with a line of addresses that are near to the j i entry

763283
arrays	loops
running a tight loops over a large arrays also allows the cpu to cache the code executing in the loops and in most cases allows you to execute an algorithm entirely from cache memory without having to block for external memory access

763284
swt	rcp
1. you are using rcp just for the platform features - swt startup exe auto-update

763284
swt	rcp
-- swt is very well integrated into rcp

763284
swing	swt
i would recommend swt over swing any day as it is very easy for an average programmer to create a responsive and native-feeling swt app while it takes a swing expert to create a decent swing app

763288
double	int
from the online help for imnoise it internally converts the image to a 0 1 double number adds the gaussian noise then converts back to int output

763288
default-value	arguments
you called deconvolucy with only two arguments so it is using the default-value for dampar

763289
stateless	stateful
www is made stateful usually by cookies uri parameters and session management and now that we ve those for a couple of decades we ve mostly gone over the stateful stateless issue of www

763289
swing	gwt
while i don t know about gwt specifically i believe that one could do at least a simple layout manager in jsp or my favorite wicket and make it behave just as the swing layout managers do

763289
swing	gwt
note that i really do mean re-creating the whole concept of layout managers here as a set of specialized classes whatnot just as peter å tibranã½ replied gwt doesn t support them directly in fact i haven t heard anything beyond swing does and i believe it would be more of an effort to create a wrapped adapter for swing layout managers instead of just creating your own properietary ones for www

763315
arrays	loops
the two loops produce different codes even though they are merely parsing through an arrays

763319
swing	gwt
some of them like dockpanel behave a little bit like swing layouts borderlayout but there s no way you ll ever be able to take swing code and compile it into gwt

763319
swing	gwt
the fact that it s written in java has nothing to do with any desire by the gwt team to allow you to port swt awt swing to gwt

763321
malloc	free
problems with malloc 3 does in most cases not arise from out-of-memory but from a logical error in your program that leads to misbehaved calls to malloc and free

763347
semantics	keyword
the keyword semantics lend themselves to this interpretation and i suspect that partly because of that people find that the expression are most readable in that context

763366
convention	standards
from a model standpoint you are correct there is no standards convention

callback	methods
i was wondering if i can only send one object to my callback methods how am i able to access the class member variables to call its methodss

763370
callback	methods
do i pass the customclass to a different callback methods

763380
constructor	private
if you make the constructor of the inner class c private i believe the enclosing class b can still instantiate it while other classes cannot

763380
constructor	private
make the inner class constructor private and then only the inner class c or the enclosing class b can instantiate it

763406
internet-explorer	firefox
most of my testing is on firefox and safari but some clients have expressed interest in using the app on internet-explorer with winxp and vista

763407
.when	ready
.when a user is ready to checkout they are redirected to an ssl versioning of the site

puppet	nagios
we have a number of databases that store bits of server information -- puppet cobbler nagios cacti our load balancers dns various internal spreadsheet and so on but it s all very disparate incomplete and overlapping

763441
security	owasp
a user can use a tool such as owasp webscarab to change values on the fly to subvert your security model

763451
constructor	object
your object constructor should look a little more manageable now

763454
contains	set
i want to write a query that returns one row per file in the database where the first few columns in the result set contains the file details id name size etc and the remaining columns are the flag names with bit values returned to indicate whether the flag is set for the given file row

763469
registration	login
also make sure that the login password boxes have the same max length as the registration password boxes

763477
order	join
and if i m right the order statement causes mysql to join all the records with the tables and after that result only the first 500 instead of order the records first limiting and then start joining it

763478
linux	unix
another option if you are using unix linux is to pass the server socket to the other processes via a unix domain socket via sendmsg and ancillary data

763498
windows-xp	windows
but the thing is i am running on windows-xp pro i know i should not be doing this but my business partner claims she doesn t have the budget to buy a full fledge windows server os

763519
arrays	loops
obviously it screams for arrays and a loops

763519
arrays	map
should be simple to fill two arrays one for the image map areas and one for the swap images

763521
accurev	svn
i m not sure if you are asking anything but you are demonstrating that accurev streams are different tools than git or svn branches

763526
selected	button
selected the add existing image from the add resource combo button

763529
constructor	object
now what happens is that the default constructor is called once and the created object is copied zero or more times

763529
constructor	object
as an exercise you can also do it without by writing proper copy constructors that copy the object over and allocate memory in the copy constructor so that the copy and the respective original object keep distinct pointers

763530
strcmp	strlen
sticking a null in the middle of a character arrays would certainly interfere with the c string functions such as strcmp strlen etc

763555
any	set
any place in your query that you have a comparison you probably should have an index set up on the columns involved

763558
value	field
can i get the value of an object field some other way than obj.field

763558
value	field
same thing for setting the value of the field

763559
thinking-sphinx	sphinx
sphinx with thinking-sphinx plugin or ultrasphinx

763589
value	field
insert into cars field value value on duplicates key update .

763594
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

763597
constructor	object
say you have a custom object called superlist whose constructor takes a variables called initialcount then you can do things like

763611
command-line	cmd
with the a ttach cmd in the cmd-line a pid

763611
selected	button
much simpler use the break button or f9 and selected a row in the deblector il view

763621
postgresql	mysql
but my customers will be deploying to mysql or mssql or postgresql and i can t guarantee that a compatible olap engine will be available

763621
schema	rdbms
so i m stuck using an ordinary rdbms with a star schema

763645
silverlight	wpf
this is one area that silverlight is much harder to use than wpf

763662
postback	ajax
with a view to learning jquery and integrating into my application to replace asp.net ajax extenders and partial page postback can anyone point me in the direction of helpful resource

763669
value	field
what i expected was that i should gets a table with ids coming from test.id and each comma-separated values in test.data gets split up into its own records and its value put into the dataitem field

763673
decrement	increment
in case of user defined increment decrement operators ++i is preferable because it doesn t imply copying the incremented object

763673
decrement	increment
so a good coding-style is to use prefix increment decrement in for loops

763675
getter	setter
sometimes the model object is empty or the viewmodel is just forwarding property getter setter to the model object

763676
constructor	object
i was hoping to use some sort of di just learning about that at the moment so for each object i created a constructor that took in a factory for that dll this factory would create a new instance of each object that the class might require

763695
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
argumentexception argumentnullexception and argumentoutofrangeexception

763698
expression-blend	silverlight
this works fine in xamlpad but not in silverlight 3 and expression-blend 3

763701
hide	show
set up beforesend and complete callback to show hide an in progess image say an animated gif spinner

763702
digits	base
does it help to think of the string as the reverse of the column number in base 26 with digits represented by a b .

763711
environment	building
this is it is optimized for you environment only and is not really a complete building

763720
filtering	grouping
my approach is a bit more generic putting the filtering parameters in tables and then using grouping by having and count to filtering the results

763723
bitblt	gdi
to get the lightening fast drawing speeds you really need gdi and bitblt which is a serious pain in the but to use with gdi+ especially if you are in managed-code hard to tell if you are using managed c++ or straight c++

763724
value	field
preservesig set the preservesig field to true to directly translate unmanaged signatures with hresult or return-value value

763736
post-increment	pre-increment
in c++ objects can overload those pre- and post-increment operators in which case it s usually preferable to use a pre-increment because a post-increment necessitates an extra object copy

763764
webserver	nginx
i m about to deploy a django application on a nginx webserver and want to make sure i m building the system correctly

763764
configuration	installation
specifically will there be different configuration parameters for the static and dynamic content that would make me want to keep the servers separate or can i host it all in a single nginx installation with some of the urls being mapped to django content and the rest being mapped to static content served from the same nginx install

763771
base-class	inherited
microsoft was at one point telling programmers not to inherited directly from exception-handling but instead to use applicationexception-handling as their base-class

763789
callback	methods
because the match object you will be supplying to the repository is created internally i can t think of an easy way to reference it in your test methods to setup a callback for it

763799
restart	exit
i even have to do it every time i exit and restart powershell for some reason as it won t remember the functions.

763801
put	get
if you put on a function which returns something other than a hresult you will get strange results random exception-handling

763801
put	get
if you put on a function which does not set the last win32 error code you will get garbage instead of a useful error code

763803
joomla	drupal
my question is what os projects are out there that have a similar community following as joomla mambo drupal along with a plug in architecture that is somewhat akin to joomla as well

763808
contains	set
views that contains set operators aggregates grouping by distinct and joins in general are not modifiable

763813
implements	final
but wpf offers more of a common base for itemscontrol allowing to implements more independent of the final user-interface elements used listbox listview treeview.

763841
post-increment	pre-increment
the compiler may be able to optimize it like any other function but it can not in general assume that pre-increment can be used instead of post-increment

763841
post-increment	pre-increment
in this case the compiler doesn t know that post-increment and pre-increment perform the same modifications to the object so it can not assume that one can be replaced with the other

763900
sql-server	mysql
so can anyone suggest good resources helping me transfer my ms sql-server knowledge into mysql

763907
client-server	security
a client-server database system sql-server etc. generally provides better performance security and reliability

763910
instances	private
you would have to override the function where the loaderinfo instances is created and that might be in a private function

763942
decimal-point	digits
for our purposes here scale is defined as the number of digits to the right of the decimal-point

763966
arrays	loops
that way for those objects which are most likely to be small key-style composite objects you won t have the overhead of building the arrays to pass to the method the loops any boxing of generic values etc

763985
dictionary	arrays
php print_r is useful to print out arrays and dictionary collection

763994
chip	fpga
i had heard in about 2002 that someone was doing to develop a jvm on a chip a fpga or asic

763995
nstextview	nscell
core-animation would be a great technology for a game but if you want to stick with nstextview for the time being you could create a class similar to nscell that the gameboard view uses to implements positioning and drawing

764010
contains	elements
note that not always country contains elementss separated by commas sometimes is just one single elements

764021
key-value	key
you don t actually store a specific key-value instead you have a function that generates the key on the fly always the same result

764034
if-statement	for-loop
in notepad++ i could roll up plus minus sign if-statement or for-loop as well as methods and classes

764056
javascript	dom
another option is registering dom events with javascript

764067
authentication	login
if you re trying to authenticate instead look at internet based authentication with login to a server or some kind of generated keycode that is used to validate the software

764074
verilog	vhdl
pacoblaze was written in verilog which like adam said less common than vhdl

764094
delphi	c++
a friend once told me about an application that was written in c++ and delphi and had performance issues

764094
delphi	c++
using a profiler they found out that the application spent a considerable amount of time converting strings from delphi s structure to the c++ one and vice versa - no micro optimization can detect that.

764100
alt	src
img src cid header_image alt title

764106
.net	csla
so on the .net-side tools like .net tiers or csla come to mind

764116
teamcity	msbuild
i am trying to get gallio to be called from msbuild in a teamcity build configuration

764116
teamcity	gallio
the agent server for teamcity does not have gallio installed but i do have a distribution of gallio in my source tree

764126
output	cat
the cat command with a here-document has its output sent to a pipe so the output goes into the while read dbs logging loop

764151
selected	listbox
as chuck mentions i might indeed have other state in my view model for example the selectedproduct that might be two-way bound to the selecteditem of a listbox in my xaml and then bind the same selectedproduct as the datacontext of a dataform to show details of a selected product

764175
joomla	drupal
if you wrote a very basic cms for your own use it seems to me that you should have no problem adopting an existing out of the box solution like drupal joomla etc

764175
codeigniter	cakephp
your other option is using an existing framework like others have suggested such as cakephp codeigniter etc

764178
javascript	dom
it s easy to do with javascript because of the dom and existing functionality but in haskell you have neither a big need for it nor is it particularly easy

764178
xhtml	tidy
if you can tidy up the page into xhtml you can parsing it as xml

764178
children	nodes
then you can selected based on if a nodes has children if a nodes has a given attributes what the element itself is and so on

764184
database-table	mysql
a mysql database-table has a column whose datatype is time

764192
hash	md5
i have never checked and compared the md5 hash to the real md5 hash at programs homepages

764193
scheme	prolog
not everybody is comfortable expressing their ideas in an object oriented design say c# or java as functions and closures scheme as logical derivations prolog -- there are some problems for which it fits

764209
trojan	virus
if the download is done via unencrypted http then it s being routed through a number of networks and there most definitely is an opportunity for people to manipulate it and insert a trojan or virus

764210
order	join
results like this make me wonder if i should index a lot of other fields that are commonly used for join or order by clauses

764215
hash	md5
an md5 hash is a form of validation

764223
value	field
it is usually possible to create indexes which will never be used - for example and index on a not null field with only two possible value is almost certainly going to be useless

764226
filtering	sorting
i have a page books that display a user s books and there are a few sorting and filtering options in that page like this

764226
filtering	sorting
when user selects a sorting parameter like title controller sorts books by title and returns to view.then if user selects read filter i want listed books to be sorted by title and filtering by read parameter

764226
webforms	asp.net
i can do this using classical asp.net webforms session way but some people says using session may introduce problems

764259
any	set
it s very hard to set any specific limit about this as sometimes it s just the best way to do it

764262
protected	public
this class would have then access to the protected _rows stored internally and you could add a public methods to applying your filtering

764267
labview	nxt
the standard nxt software is basically a stripped down version of labview and it s reasonably easy to use but a bit buggy

764267
development-environment	platform
we only used the standard nxt software with the kids because of fll contest rules.if you prefer using procedural languages the nxt is still a great platform for learning but you d need to switch to an alternative development-environment like one of these

764298
instances	private
wss must be private because it seems like the application_endrequest is being called using different instances object this

764307
32-bit	64bit
for legacy reasons i have to compile for 32-bit it uses a 32-bit library that i have no 64bit counterpart for

764315
microchip	avr
for new development in c others have already mentioned the embedded systems market where the development is often for software put into rom or eeprom flash memory where it is referred to as firmware for microcontrollers microchip pic avr 80c51 68hc11 etc. where object code size ram usage and performance matters so the usage of a programming language with fewer high-level or generic abstractions or assumptions is desirable

764315
quicksort	mergesort
priority queue binary tree mergesort quicksort knuth-morris-pratt and karp-rabin should be at least vaguely familiar

764315
boost	stl
this is because the c language lacks the stl boost cpan and other standard libraries available in other languages

764315
perl	ruby
perl python and ruby are good potential candidates

764315
haskell	scheme
for programming experience functional languages like lisp scheme prolog ml objective caml haskell and scala are good candidates for making you think different. admittedly prolog is actually a declarative logic programming language but it is still programming experience expanding

764387
groovy	java
i know that there s more than one way to do it including the regular java way - but what is the groovy way of doing it

764396
bison	yacc
i m trying to figure out how i can display a message prompt when using lex yacc flex bison

764399
space	input
regular expressions usually let you build a pretty solid input validation that s fairly readable in a very short space of time

764401
inverse	cosine
this value is |a|.|b|.cos theta but as the two normals vectors should be normalsised it will give cos theta so just take the inverse cosine to get the rotation amount

764408
postgresql	mysql
if and only if you elect to use the more involved blob approach here s a snippet of code from an old project of mind back when i was learning django that handles blob for mysql and postgresql

764412
scheme	lisp
if python had a macros facility similar to lisp scheme something like metapython how would you use it

764412
scheme	lisp
if you are a lisp scheme programmer what sorts of things do you use macros for other than things that have a clear syntactic parallel in python such as a while-loop

764419
python	perl
the post is about perl but it applies to python just as well

764421
wxwidgets	mfc
i ve never used mfc but supposedly the wxwidgets toolkit is somewhat mfc-like

764421
linux	unix
they work on linux unix windows os x and maybe other platforms as well

764427
contains	any
i have inherited a web application where the usual ability to press return in any of the input-field has been disabled for the very good reason that the page contains multiple forms and the application would not be able to determine or so i am told which form to action

764432
message	alert
1.debugged my javascript with nickf s suggestion alert typeof and got the undefined alert message

764432
message	alert
3.reload my page and received the function alert message

764473
tee	cat
tee copies stdin to stdout like cat and additionally writes everything to the named file

764482
instrumentation	trace
if you have access to the source code then you could also instrumentation your own code to do trace

764496
contains	set
basically the designer file should contains nothing but a set of object declarations the objects on the form and the initializecomponent call

764537
administration	account
log on to your computer as the local administration account

764537
authentication	login
if you use sspi aka integrated authentication aka not a different username and password when you start up ssms then just use your windows login as the loginame

764537
administration	sysadmin
also if you are a local administrator your user account is listed under local administration grouping then - by default - you are a sysadmin

764540
contains	any
is there any available c++ or maybe c function class library with only purpose to sanitize a string that might contains html

764545
configuration	environment
your program could read its configuration information from environment variables

764555
debugging	exit
i m working on a big app ns2 and somewhere someone put an exit 1 in there without any debugging or print statements and it is being executed

764563
typename	typedef
that said we do sometimes typedef them if the typename is so long that type const_iterator makes the code look too chunky. don t know of any better way to say it but you probably know what i mean.

764570
textbox	button
i d like to know how does the formview know which updateparameter to populate with which edittemplate textbox when the update button is clicked

764571
freebsd	netbsd
from this wikipedia page i see the following disk encryption methods that are can be used on bsd freebsd or netbsd

764577
rollback	commit
disadvantages once you start a transaction no one else can write to the database until you commit or rollback

764581
communication	messages
with number porting and all the unified communication ideas nowadays you can easily have local numbers redirecting to mobiles non-geographical numbers handling smses and local special numbers rewriting your incoming smses as facebook messages

764588
revision	svn
where repos_path is the path to the repository on the server srv svn repository and n is the revision number 25 and file is a text file containing the correct commit log entry

764590
sniffing	packets
i spent some time analyzing dll entry points parsing raw data files and ip packets sniffing

764595
contains	elements
on the other hand xml lang and the html lang attributes identify the language of the document or the fragment contains within the elements on which the attributes appears

764595
http-equiv	lang
however html 5 changes this and the meta http-equiv content-language is considered non-conforming html which nevertheless defined the document-wide default language and only supports a single language so is effectively identical to xml lang on the html element

764600
bash	zsh
i am trying to move to zsh from bash

764612
selected	button
i have a frameset where i would like to have someone be able to click a button in one frame that does something with the text selected in the other frame

764612
selected	button
the button in frame 0 invokes the following javascript to get the selected text from frame 1

764619
margins	padding
typically you would want to remove things like navigation menus breadcrumbs ads and maybe do some small changes in margins padding borders and fonts compared to the on-screen stylesheet

764628
gethashcode	equals
create a code generator that uses reflection to look through your business object fields and creates a new partial class which overrides gethashcode and equals

764628
debugging	exit
run the code generator when your program starts up in debugging mode and if the code has changed exit with a message to the developer to recompile

764628
value	field
using reflection you know which field are value types or not and hence whether they need null checks

764641
gentoo	linux
but on gentoo it seems that the less command line is a little more powerful than the one i use on other linux distributions or cygwin mac os x.

764642
command-line	cmd
okay if i understand the question in the comments you re asking how to make the cmd windows in which you ve started the bots from the cmd-line go away afterwards

764642
linux	unix
unix linux

764658
environment	building
if it helps the app i am building will run in a kiosk type environment so a firefox only even a nightly versioning solution is fine

764662
onmousedown	onclick
try using onmousedown rather than onclick as the handler for the button

764666
perl	awk
almost everyone i know who uses regular expressions regularly pun intended comes from a unix-ish background where they use tools that treat res as first-class programming constructs such as grep sed awk and perl

764676
youtube	vimeo
the media gallery contains media items from sites such as youtube and vimeo

764697
put	get
yes it will work but by the time you get the hammer i could put 20 tacks in the wall

764707
json	xml
i m looking for a best way that is available for java developers to implement rest services that will be communicating via json or xml

764707
json	xml
i d like to use an open-source package that will allow me so have a similar development experience as wcf.net where i can declare the url templates map get post and get an output either in xml or json

764707
json	xml
the accepted payload should be xml or json as well

764709
value	field
i ve documented it here in the comment labeled use sql value for filtering value on cck integer field

764710
lookup	any
any thoughts on why memory isn t producing nearly instant lookup

764735
linux	bsd
in what ways is it better than either the kernel used in bsd and or linux

764744
nested	order
if you use nested sets the left sequence number will provide you with the order to visit the nodes

764750
implements	extends
list implements ilist which extends ienumerable

764751
dockpanel	scrollbar
does that mean my grid control should have a dockpanel with the scrollbar then another control for the content area so that my gridusercontrol would have a dockpanel with 2 docked scrollbar and a gridcontentframeworkelement control

764751
dockpanel	scrollbar
it has a dockpanel with 2 docked scrollbar objects

764760
robot	nxt
i haven t had any experience with the nxt robot but if nqc sounds interesting there s an equivalent for the nxt nbc nxc

764768
selected	button
it may seem complicated but basicly it does what you want user selected something clicks a button editor reacts onclick and executes function from this javascript

764781
constructor	object
you could say oh i will always pass objecta to object s constructor and wind up with .

764795
linux	unix
i think you will find that it is very difficult to write code that uses only the native win32 api that compiles on any unix or linux system

764802
constructor	object
sounds like there s an object b constructor that takes a single parameter an object a

764809
command-line	cmd
so the cmd set only operates on the initial cmd-line argument list

764817
asp.net-mvc	wcf
the application constists of asp.net-mvc wcf and some windows services

764824
constructor	object
the textures context for these object are loaded in their constructor

764824
arrays	loops
these objects will have different types so i can cast the pointers to get them in the arrays but i want to later have a renderobjects function that will use a loops to call an objectn.render function for each existing object

764862
enumerator	any
the series enumerating enumerator has a series of things you can do with enumerations such as asking if a statement is true for any member of a grouping or if it s true for all the members or searching for any or all members meeting a certain condition

764868
double	int
in java everything except byte short int long float double and char is passed by reference

764868
deep-copy	object
if you want a copy by value you need to make your own method in the object that will return a deep-copy of itself

764871
any	set
how can i avoid having to set any environment variables

764879
selected	button
if you had a button you had to name rather than the menu to store this would export is shorter than save as be sufficient criteria to selected one over the other

764888
export	csv
i would use export for file formats where major loss of fidelity or information is expected for example export a spreadsheet to txt or csv

764892
multiplication	division
three is out because the conversion to binary would require expensive multiplication or division with remainder

764914
perl	c++
i am particularly interested in perl but c# c c++ and java are coming up

764920
internet-explorer	firefox
for now i m tweaking it like crazy and if it appears fine in firefox it gets all messed up in internet-explorer 7 ahd sometimes is halfway up teh page

764927
mac-address	lan
should i encrypt using lan mac-address

764972
bash	zsh
you can t expect zsh to be able to run the bash commands in your .bashrc so you should convert it into a new .zshrc instead of trying to run .bashrc from .zshrc or copying the former into the latter

764972
bash	zsh
though - and i d first misread this part of your question - you shouldn t experience errors from bash when running your .bashrc unless you put zsh commands in there

764972
bash	zsh
sounds to me like you ve added zsh code into your .bashrc and bash obviously doesn t understand

765015
configuration	environment
but its a bit complicated and most administrators turn off the ssh environment variables pass-through in the sshd configuration anyways

765028
postgresql	mysql
use an r to postgresql or mysql etc. interface

765098
linux	bsd
iconv should be avaible on any posix system by default those include gnu linux bsd mac os x...

765112
directory	folder
i want my repeater datasource to point to an image inside my image folder in my root directory

765126
python	ruby
ruby s yield is not an iterator like in c# and python

765127
assign	add
in case of no images you can just load a image with text no images and add it to your olist and assign it to repimages.datasource

765156
subtract	add
you can subtract the begin iterator from the const_iterator to obtain the position the const_iterator is pointing to and then add begin back to that to obtain a non-const iterator

765173
error-handling	try-catch
i have come accross to this function below and i am wondering wether this is the right way of using the error-handling of try-catch

765183
hide	show
and when a user click on the tab it hide the other two and show the one click

765195
exception-handling	try-catch
if you are not sure of the type of the error and occurance but want to continue the execution of the code although an exception-handling had occured then a try-catch block will help

765210
exception-handling	try-catch
codewise it is correct works however the power of try-catch is that when an exception-handling is thrown from deep down in one of the functions you re calling

765234
binary-operators	operands
in brief all integers are promoted to at least int size which may be 64bit before any arithmetic operations and to the size of the larger operands for binary-operators if this is of greater rank than an int

765250
value	field
the problem is that the value i need to extract for the text and tag properties are identified by differents field name in the db

765255
spaces	output
this wastes spaces in the database and also i need to later convert the output using content-type so

765268
deprecated	javadoc
in java the deprecated javadoc tag can provide notes in the documentation that a feature has been deprecated or from java 5 the deprecated annotations can be used to raise compile-time warnings on calls to deprecated apis features

765269
compatibility	legacy
if on the other hand the community has tons of legacy code and no resources or desire to bring it up to the latest versioning you must keep backward compatibility or all of their stuff will simply not work on the new api

765289
lgpl	gpl
gnutls please note that it is mainly lgpl not gpl so you can link to it

765304
versioning	upgrade
i was using s#architecture fluent-nhibernate to create this mapping i have upgrade to the latest versioning and it seems to be working fine

765320
rewrite	rule
the first rewrite rule changes all files in below a certain uri static to a directory from which those static files are served directly without proxying

765322
boost	stl
in my opinion the only folks that need to stay on top of absolutely every nuance of the language are the library writers -- people implementing boost stl loki etc

765322
python	c++
if python is more readable and more maintainable than c++ for your job and you don t need what c++ offers then certainly stick with python

765323
python	c++
use python for w e you want possibly c# for apps then use c++ 0x when you need to do something powerful

765341
cassini	iis
the app includes a global.asax file that should run some code - it works fine in cassini but in iis the debugger never hits the function

765342
repository	entity
i think you would want to put it on the irepository repository if you are going after just the list of tickets you could also add a ticket collection to the project entity and have that lazy-load the tickets

765348
put	get
if you put a breakpoint on the event handler in the debugger does that break point not get hit

765367
arguments	undefined
first the simplest if your operations take the arguments as const even if internally apply const_cast i believe it should work directly in most implementations even if it is probably undefined behavior

765403
image-processing	imaging
the python imaging library pil adds image-processing capabilities to your python interpreter

765406
constructor	object
no parameterless constructor defined for this object

765409
dictionary-comprehension	list-comprehension
generator-expressions list-comprehension s and in python 2.7 and higher dictionary-comprehension s are basically ways of rewriting loops

765427
children	nodes
if the div can have html tags in it you re going to have to traverse its children looking for text nodes

765430
delphi	c++
you ve gotta remember that this article was written for c++ which is nowhere near as advanced as delphi on the memory management front

765430
delphi	c++
the uninitialized pointers issue is a lot less of a mess in delphi than in c c++ for two reasons

765433
background-color	transparency
your best bet is to enable transparency for the replacements and set the background-color on the html element replaced by sifr the

765435
constructor	object
the default binder creates the object using a constructor that takes no parameters then uses reflection on the public properties to set values from the form query parameters

765446
16-bit	x86
when an exception-handling occurs windows first looks for a handler for the exception-handling by following the registered exception-handling handler chain the head of which is stored in fs 0 on x86 the first dword in the segment pointed to by the fs segment register - all that ugly 16-bit segment-offset logic didn t go away in 32-bit it just became less relevant

765446
pointers	stack
the search is done by calling a function with a particular flag a pointers to which is stored in each exception-handling frame on stack

765446
dialog	pop-up
ultimately the last frame on the list is one that has been provided by the os this handler will pop-up a app-crash dialog if an unhandled exception-handling reaches it

765459
constructor	object
2 allocate and find some hack to call the constructor for object once i have allocated the space for them

765466
switching	screens
what i tend to do these days is temporary switching the media of the print stylesheet to screens while i m developing and then switching it back before going live

765522
value	field
note i think it s necessary to implement property procedures instead of directly exposing the internal field value in order for the properties to show up in a property grid.

765524
buffering	streaming
then around that methods it calls into the inflater to actually turn the buffering of raw bytes that it pulled from the underlying streaming into the actual bytes that are written to the caller s arrays

765524
methods	extend
so long as you can define your inputstream to take another underlying inputstream and in all the read methods s you read from that underlying stream bearing in mind that in theory you only need to define the byte read methods then specifically making your class extend filterinputstream doesn t really buy you very much

765526
floating	margins
according to the css 2.1 standard the vertical margins of floating elements should not collapse with any adjacent elements

765526
google-chrome	firefox
but actually this is not what happens in all browsers firefox safari opera and google-chrome except ie6 didn t try with ie7 or ie8 though

765552
margins	padding
with the general confusion surrounding vertical margins and collapsing compounded by the still-extant browser bugs i d recommend avoiding vertical margins and using padding instead wherever possible

765553
any	set
one of the great things about this is that you can set it up this way initially and then change your mind later by switching the location block to pass through to a backend server without any of that being visible to the outside world

765557
required	checked
also the functions assume that the inputs are sets and therefore don t do any duplicates checked beyond what s required for union

765562
parentheses	braces
examples include -style comments unnecessary parentheses and braces excessively-specific variables names and hungarian notation warts

765597
where-clause	sql
with a reference to the microsoft.scripting.core assembly my test dblinq app would compile and run fine but would have the where-clause missing on the sql

765636
contains	any
also be aware that you have to make sure that any values you use don t contains the delimiter

765636
contains	any
so if you know your strings might contains then you might have to do a replace operation of them to escape any nested delimiters

765647
inline-code	code-behind
in your code-behind or in your inline-code where ever you have your functions defined add this methods

765649
python	c++
also the c++ bindings are more reliable and in my experience the fastest out of all the langauges available python in particular really can t do opengl

765655
value	field
one way to do this is to put hidden field on your page set the value of those field in code-behind with the dates using your methods then tie the data source parameters to the hidden field

765664
json	xml
my question s are thus should i go for json or xml

765670
swing	awt
part of my answer seems to be here but i m wondering how to get a blur effect in swing awt

765672
python	ruby
from what i ve seen there is a lot of resource overhead that goes into using the jvm to support languages such as groovy jruby and jython instead of straight ruby or python

765672
python	ruby
ruby and python can both be interpreted on just about any os so i don t see any write once run anywhere advantage.

765676
priority-queue	heap
i use one of the vectors as a priority-queue using the heap functions make_heap and push_heap

765680
any	set
i found a partial explanation on this question but it is still not clear how i would be able to set my component roles or any other thing i need to use a switch without a configuration file

765682
perl	ruby
java is a much much more mature platform with a lot of existing class libraries that could be dropped in and used than say ruby or python or even perl for that matter

765682
python	ruby
for example recently i ve been looking for something like jaxb for python or ruby

765687
delphi	basic
i have done some basic opengl development in delphi and java as well

765687
delphi	c++
i used jogl as mentioned in others replies and i must conclude that although there is very little difference in programming opengl in java using jogl and programming opengl in other languages delphi c++ etc... it just doesn t feel right

765689
json	xml
after using tojson you could use this to convert json to xml from goessner.net source file

765699
.net	wcf
i m using .net 2.0 with nhibernate activerecord and wcf

765717
communication	messages
windows communication foundation wcf is a framework for building services that process xml messages

765717
configuration	environment
configuration of nettcp binding focuses on creating a channel stack that will perform better in windows environment giving you a great option for replacing your various com+ and .net remoting investments

765717
basichttpbinding	was
basichttpbinding was designed for scenarios where interoperability is of utmost importance

765722
unsigned	integer
warning negative integer implicitly converted to unsigned type

765731
unsigned	integer
-10 is parsing as an integer value and assigning int to unsigned int is allowed

765743
python	ruby
but there s the maturity issue jvm has a lot of work done there while jits for ruby and python aren t anywhere near

765757
excel-vba	vba
i remember seeing most of the excel-vba tutorials using range a b when i was doing some vba work and this wasn t elegant to use with loops

765779
http	ssl
on my www.example.com domain you can register for the service over ssl using http s www.example.com

765795
change-password	login
using sql profiling audit login change-password event class

765811
constructor	object
in addition the object should be fully initialized when the constructor finishes

765817
security	owasp
implementing and monitoring security - sql injection certainly but other issues covered by owasp sans.org or books like 19 deadly sins of software security . this is a broad topic not specific to sql but i think it s every software developer s duty to learn this stuff

765823
folder	dir
i want to list all the folders inside dir that have inside them a folder called foo

765832
groovy	java
as someone else put it the best thing about groovy is that i don t have to use java

765832
groovy	java
the second best thing about groovy is that i can use java

765836
uitableview	uiview
i m working on trying to obtain the uiview that uitableview scrolls over if scrolling is enabled

765841
reference-type	generics
you can restrict generics to be reference-type or value types and you can initialise an empty variables with the default keyword

765859
groovy	java
the groovy compiler produces jvm bytecode that runs inside the jvm just like any other java class

765859
groovy	java
in this sense groovy is just like java simply adding syntax to the java language that is meaningful only to developers and not to the jvm

765859
groovy	java
developer productivity ease and flexibility of syntax make groovy attractive to the java ecosystem - ruby or python would be as attractive if they resulted in java bytecode see jython

765859
python	ruby
as a matter of fact many quickly embrace groovy or jython both close to ruby and python

765863
contains	sorted
i would like to sort the whole arrays by value starting from the smallest negative value to biggest positive value which means if there are 32 elements the first 16 n 2 sorted elements should contains the values of second 16 elements of the original arrays and the second 16 elements of the sorted arrays should contains the first 16 values of the original arrays

765882
background-color	transparency
have you tried making the uitableview s background-color transparency and setting the color of the superview to white

765913
memcheck	valgrind
if you ve used memcheck from valgrind you ll probably be familiar with this message.

765916
primitive	int
according to their documentation there s three types of variable-length int primitive - int32 uint32 and sint32

765916
value	field
in their documentation they note that int32 is inefficient for encoding negative numbers â if your field is likely to have negative value use sint32 instead. but if you have a field that has no negative numbers i assume that uint32 would be a better type to use than int32 anyways due to the extra bit and decreased cpu cost of processing negative numbers

765929
installation	upgrade
as for production side of things upgrading your database in transaction msi-style installation is much better than attempting to upgrade at each app startup since you can potentially end up with desynchronized database-application versions

765953
silverlight	wpf
the first place i felt like i really strayed into the over-verbosity regime is upon implementing the model-view-viewmodel mvvm pattern in silverlight and wpf apps

765955
loading	gif
contains the flash video player code and its background-image is the animated gif a loading spinner in the css

765960
put	get
finally the only way i had to assuredly get the dll to update was to remove the copy of the dll from the gac remove the copy of the dll from the bin directory run the site so that it would fail and then put the new version of the dll into the gac

765971
assign	add
to add to this what if i assign the pointers to a reference

765984
selected	button
i can t use the listbox.selecteditem property because the item does not become selected when clicking the button

765984
click	mouse
so either i need to figure out how to properly set listbox.selecteditem when the mouse hovers or when the button is click

765986
return-value	return-type
actually doesn t compile - it could be any delegate type with no parameters and either no return-value or the same return-type as _mymessage which is presumably string

765992
logfile	tail
another options is to send me an email or at least tail into a logfile

766002
constructor	object
note that there are three constructor calls but only two destructor calls -- indicating that you have leaked exactly one data object

766023
integer	numeric
an arrays is a grouping of entities of the same type say integer or character len 1024 or bank and they are one after another so you can access each of them with a numeric index

766033
administration	account
i have the local administration account for every computer...is there a simple way to copy a file to a computer using it s local administration account rather than a domain account

766050
communication	messages
where possible communication in advance what exact affect the action is going to make on the system for instances stack overflow show messages preview above post your answer button

766061
subclass	nsobject
in order to subclass nstextfield you would want to create a new objective-c class file file - new fileâ but edit the header so that the class inherits from nstextfield instead of nsobject

766088
any	set
i can t find any methods for making a tab invisible or otherwise hidden in an swt jface application --- i want a second tab to be available or not based on some other preferences set by the user

766093
perl	ruby
is a vim dictionary like a hash in perl or ruby or an object in javascript that uses for lookups

766147
stderr	stdout
i run this program remotely and lose handles to stdout and stderr if that information helps at all

766169
httpresponse	request
b i also assume that regardless of which asp.net http handler processes the request all http handler eventually pass data back to httpresponse

766169
httpresponse	httprequest
q2 - when request is received by asp.net application when in the life cycle of that request do httpresponse and httprequest objects become available

766170
loading	png
in my silverlight application i am trying to get the actual dimensions of a png image that i am loading into an image control

766207
double-quotes	single-quotes
i need to escape both single-quotes and double-quotes and escape them so that bash does not misinterpret them

766232
keyboard	mouse
the windows manager also registers for raw input events from the input devices keyboard and or mouse and it generates messages for those input events

766241
pointers	stack
alternativly if the texture is of a constant size you can pass a pointers to an arrays that is on stack

766244
nunit	moq
testing nunit and moq standard install for the templates

766244
nunit	moq
it would be helpful to link premade install for these things like the standard install for nunit and moq linked above

766258
sendmessage	message
for example sendmessage action is located in the message controllers

766258
sendmessage	message
in sendmessage action i would like to set the message that i want to show to the user and then forwarding the user to showrequirements action

766261
value	field
the problem with a datetime field is that you can t really use it a compound index since the value is fairly unique

766282
.when	ready
so in summary professional programmers should do the job themselves and write code that specifically satisfies their clients needs and only take in ready made parts of the .net .when that is in fact exactly what they need

766286
mouseover	mouseout
i have an unordered list with mouseover and mouseout events attached to the li elements

766286
mouseover	mouseout
when i mouseover the li the mouseover event is fired but when i mouseover the link contained in the li the mouseout and the mouseover events are both fired in order

766294
linux	unix
linux or unix server

766299
value	field
is there a performance advantage to using enum in situations where there are only 5-10 different possible value for a field

766301
shell	bash
further this works with bourne korn bash and posix shell in general

766309
value	field
i have a text field and a selectedbox users can selected multiple value by ctrl in a form

766313
mouseleave	mouseover
alternatively use the mouseenter and mouseleave events instead of mouseover out

766317
constructor	private
example 3 using private constructor

766317
constructor	object
the problem is that this object has to be declared in the com application which is what the declare method is doing before any other method can be called but if i hide the constructor and then add more work to the declare method i think it will make the rest of the class hard to test becuase i have to go through the declare method first

766387
python	php
an ide with great intellisense code completion for dynamic languages like python and php

766407
contains	any
this meant that one could add any type of object to the list - even if you only meant for the arraylist to contains strings

766407
type-safety	generics
all generics do is add type-safety

766424
profiling	trace
i would run your app underneath a profiling i like jet brain s dot trace personally to see where the time is actually being spent

766450
slidedown	slideup
it seems to use target s initial positioning where it was before the expansion contraction which makes sense since both events are initiated at the same time but even when i try to pause scrollto and wait until the slideup slidedown transition is over it still behaves the same

766451
safari	opera
if i remember correctly some older versions of safari and maybe opera didn t support todataurl but the more recent versions do

766459
google-chrome	firefox
normally if you get the style to work in both firefox and google-chrome safari ie is only a few corrections away of being correct

766475
global-variables	call
so for example to handle an uiactionsheet call i have to declare another methods in the same class which seems a bit silly if i want to pass it data because i d have to store that data as a global-variables

766477
solaris	aix
however the function is only available on linux and i need equivalent implementations on windows aix solaris and hpux any suggestions

766478
put	get
when you take the object out of the collection you get the integer that you put in

766478
primitive-types	reference-type
autoboxing and unboxing blur the distinction between primitive-types and reference-type but they do not eliminate it

766491
firefox	safari
there is a great site position is everything that details how firefox ie and safari conform to standard css

766495
methods	extend
although it is nice to extend fields and methods from multiple sources imagine a modern mobile phone which inherits from mp3 players cameras sat-navs and the humble old school mobile phone clashes cannot be resolved by the compiler alone

766500
low-level	hardware
the kernel has a more low-level view of the hardware each cpu is a separate object very different than how it looks like for user-space processes in user-space cpus are almost invisible

766511
specifications	w3c
aside from that the only permanent solution i see to this recurring situation is for the w3c to prioritize different parts of newly introduced specifications so that the new features can be implements in discrete phases synchronized across all the major browsers

766521
code-coverage	cobertura
something similar be done with code-coverage tools like cobertura

766522
fileoutputstream	writer
writer w new outputstreamwriter new fileoutputstream test.txt utf-8

766544
eula	gpl
the eula makes no reference to redistribution rights so i assume in this negative freedom society that it s permitted yet the microsoft research page says redistribution is not permitted but it s ambiguously worded from what i can tell it might be referring to commercial redistribution which wouldn t apply to me since this is a non-profit gpl project

766561
moss	wss
install of wss sp1 and or moss sp1

766562
treeview	grid
these apps have treeview tabs grid forms panels..etc

766574
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
updates i deleted the clientaccesspolicy.xml file and kept just the crossdomain.xml file in-place and bingo everything worked

766580
constructor	object
i use varargs frequently for constructor that can take some sort of filtering object

766581
linked-list	hashmap
this is a very newbie questions but does the iphone api provide any data structures to work with linked-list hashmap etc.

766582
deprecated	javadoc
it also creates compiler-warnings when you use a deprecated methods or class just like the old javadoc deprecated tag

766589
deprecated	javadoc
if you mark something as deprecated then you indicate to a user via the generated javadoc that this methods class should not be used

766595
http	ssl
for example you could tell the ssl tunnel to listen on port 443 https and forward all decrypted packets to port 80 http

766614
gridview	listview
the listviewupdatedeventargs object that s passed in to the itemupdated event handler for the listview does not have a keys collection like the gridviewupdatedeventargs object passed into the rowupdated event handler for a gridview

766629
instance-variables	class-variables
i like how groovy makes all of your instance-variables and class-variables public and writes getters and setters on your behalf

766629
groovy	java
is there a way to achieve the conciseness of groovy in java without having to use groovy or some other framework add-on

766629
groovy	java
so what i m looking for is a solution to the excessive verboseness of java without using groovy or something like it

766642
groovy	java
essentially when you write a class in groovy it compiles down to java bytecode

766642
groovy	java
groovy and java mix very well together since they use the same set of core libraries

766646
getter	setter
i use netbeans which has tools to write getter setter auto implements abstract-methods and various other shortcuts

766648
versioning	upgrade
the lack of backwards compatibility makes 3.0 a much harder sell than a seamless upgrade because you have to adjust your thinking and discard some programming techniques to use the new versioning

766649
getter	setter
in this kind of situation an ide which can write the getter and setter for you can be your friend

766649
getter	setter
i find that having to write the getter and setter are the most repetitive and un-interesting part of writing new classes

766649
getter	setter
with an ide like eclipse which can automatically generate the getter and setter for you it can reduce the pain of writing the redundant code

766656
matplotlib	wxpython
wxpython matplotlib numpy etc.

766661
value	field
the only time i have ever had trouble with access autonumbers is when in error i set the value of an autonumber key field to a number lower than the current maximum using an append query

766661
value	field
access allows you to force a value into an autonumber field and sometimes not always and i don t know why the autonumbering gets reset to the lower number

766664
getter	setter
but as others mentioned eclipse and netbeans will easily create the getter setter so if you don t have to do anything special with them then it should be pretty easy

766664
equals	getter
i tend to put my properties in their own class which is just getter setters then i don t have to look at the verboseness as well as equals and hash methods if needed then in my other classes i just use that and hide the boring extra coding

766666
python	ruby
i m a python programmer not a ruby one but browsing the examples in the ruby docs for this i d say the default behavior as you have it is to act as a boolean

766683
getter	setter
no getter no setter no hassle

766694
tasklist	cmd
for 1 one of the other developers was playing around with using the tasklist cmd and parsing out the executable names

766700
arrays	loops
for example it s the classic old school way to traverse a 2d arrays - one loops goes down the y axis and the other loops goes down the x axis

766701
parallels	vmware
so we went out bought imacs for everyone and loaded parallels a vmware like product for osx on them

766702
exception-handling	try-catch
you could also put a try-catch around the main entry point of the application to catch and try to handle any unhandled exception-handling from the code

766721
data-structures	tree
so avoid self-balancing or self-sorting data-structures heaps hashtables or move-to-front tree splay tree for example. then again you could use one of those structures but then you have to keep track of its insertion order in each node

766721
value	field
if this is a c program then the pointers to that node is unique i guess this applies in java as well. if the node s pointers is not sufficient to maintain uniqueness then you need to add a field to each node which you gaurantee to have a unique value

766728
triggers	insert
create a database triggers on that table that fires on update and on insert and stores sysdate into the new field

766749
puppet	nagios
i think the tools you ve pointed out form something of an ecosystem that could work together - cobbler can install from bare-metal and hand over to puppet which has support for generating nagios configuration and storing configuration in a database

766749
nagios	cacti
then work out how to get the information you need into the db whether it s from facter nagios cacti or direct snmp calls

766750
tasklist	cmd
if you go with tasklist it might actually be faster to just run the cmd once and get back all of the results rather than running it for each of your executable names

766750
linux	unix
you ll probably have to runtime.getruntime .exec tasklist.exe to get the results on windows or exec ps on unix linux

766761
triggers	insert
i have triggers that manipulate and insert a lot of data into a change tracking table for audit purposes on every insert update and delete

766764
rewrite	rule
1 rename the pdfs to have a different extension so that they re not caught by the rewrite rule

766795
syntax-highlighting	gedit
gedit uses gtksourceview for its syntax-highlighting

766804
textbox	button
update ok well since the user might want to open more than one file to save i wanted to take off my button savefilefrom and instead make the textbox run through the openfiledialog when clicked

766806
compact-framework	.net
for example the .net compact-framework is a subset of full .net

766810
libjpeg	libpng
so far i ve made sure i ve installed libpng and libjpeg with darwinports i m running on os x leopard but that doesn t seem to do the trick

766831
restart	daemon
also are you sure both daemon s were restart on boot

766844
selected	checkbox
which is essentially trying to selected all rows in a grid check a box when a selected all checkbox is clicked

766849
value	field
as for getting the value of your field trying var_dumping row before your while-loop and see if you can figure out what s going wrong with that

766852
methods	extend
you could extend this rule to include methodss with a argument provided that this argument is for input only ie the list is not modified by the methods

766860
radio-button	selected
does anyone know the correct syntax for a selected radio-button in nhaml

766861
any	set
for any unicode character set

766862
linux	aix
consider for example needing to run on ncr hp sun linux and aix

766881
.when	ready
i want my new language to be successful and i want to eventually create a community around it .when it s ready to release

766887
constructor	object
the foo class should contain another constructor that takes a bar object as a parameter

766892
scala	java
groovy and scala target the java platform therefore allowing the use of and interoperation between existing java code

766892
python	ruby
many dynamically-typed languages have gained popularity such as ruby and python to name a couple

766892
groovy	java
more concise and clear code can be written in languages such as groovy as opposed to verbose languages such as java

766904
document	editing
once logged in if the user does something that requires the browser to pass their authentication through to a client app such as click on a microsoft office document in a document library in order to open it for editing it appears that invalid credentials presumably domain_b are passed automatically thus forcing the user to manually enter their domain_a credentials again

766904
credentials	account
the users in domain_b unfortunately have to use shared computers that are logged on using generic kiosk type account that have no permissions in sharepoint -- thus the requirement that the domain_b users must provide their credentials on demand when accessing a given page in sharepoint

766904
integrated	manual
i would like to preserve the convenience of the integrated windows-authentication for the static users of domain_a while minimizing the amount of manual authentication that the kiosk users in domain_b have to endure

766908
expression	evaluation
and c# s operator use short-circuit evaluation so if the first expression returns false the second expression will not be evaluated

766912
unsigned	short
i could just pass the number pf_packet represents it s an unsigned short

766917
versioning	upgrade
i ve found that vendors generally provide a reasonably straightforward upgrade path from versioning to versioning and upgrading becomes more problematic if the upgrade must skip a few versionings .net 1.1 - 3.5 sp1

766917
versioning	upgrade
if these upgrade are not done the new application being developed is limited to using old versioning and consequently will add to the time and cost of future upgrade

766936
subtract	add
client application has some field number a and number b and label for result and some possible actions represented by the button add subtract multiply divide etc

766956
click	mouse
i m currently creating a right-click context menu by instantiating a new jmenu on right click and setting its location to that of the mouse s position.

766957
highlight	selected
how do i highlight the selected item in my case a custom user-controls in a flowlayoutpanel

766984
apache-tiles	sitemesh
i would suggest using something like apache-tiles or sitemesh over the standard jsp include functionality

767000
worksheet	excel
i ve had worksheet that processed individual cells that sped up by many factors of 10 when you use the more complex excel functionality think using sum a1..a999 instead of adding up each individual cell in vba and putting that value somewhere

767000
macros	vba
as to how to do the import from vba i always rely on the record macros feature to get a baseline which can be modified for those i m not intimately acquainted with

767014
python	perl
perl and python are prime examples

767023
payment	billing
i was in the process of implementing your solution and noticed that it was only returning the first value for all the foreign keys such as billing address shipping address payment etc.

767027
python	java
then take on a language like python java or .net

767060
boost	stl
however if your class methods uses modern c++ programming techniques such as boost shared pointers and stl containers then it is a very different story

767066
order	join
in order to join a workstation to the domain you can use the netdom utility include with resource kits and support tools

767070
pointers	stack
the important things to understand are how a computer actually operates the difference between stack and the heap pointers the basic of garbage-collection recursion and it d probably be helpful to understand at least extension mechanism

767070
perl	php
i mean if you understand shared libraries on unix or dlls on windows or classpath and jars on java or how to create a library in php ruby perl or python any one of those will be fine

767077
any	set
this will run when any shell exits - well any shell in which you set up the trap that is

767079
logging	daemon
another solution which is a more general solution to the problem is to have a logging daemon that accepts your logging information and just en-queues it to wherever it has to go

767099
if-statement	for-loop
is it good form to compare against std vector iterators it iter for my last two if-statement if the for-loop might change them on its next pass

767107
innodb	myisam
personally i d use the innodb plugins and the file per table option but you could also use myisam if you fully understand its characteristics and limitations

767144
decimal-point	digits
how to decrease the number of digits before decimal-point in action scripting

767147
git-status	gitignore
now when i type git-status gitignore file appears in the list of untracked files

767161
value	field
i d like to populate both field at once using a stored procedure to compute the base 36 equivalent of the value id receives on insert

767168
type-safety	generics
generics can be and are used in many different places to ensure static type-safety not just with collections

767185
cvs	git
based on your experience of a scm tool svn git cvs etc can you please tell me what features from below list is supported by that scm tool

767185
bug-tracking	bugzilla
plugins for bugzilla or any other similar bug-tracking software

767190
decimal-point	digits
unless of course you meant decrease the number of digits before the decimal-point but keep the 1 amounts

767213
git-status	gitignore
the gitignore file should be in your repository so it should indeed be added and committed in as git-status suggests

767213
git-status	gitignore
however in that case it s probably better to add the ignores to .git info exclude a special checkout-local file that works just like gitignore but does not show up in git-status since it s in the .git folder

767220
document	element
suppose i have the following xml document which has no default namespace defined and information element is not prefixed with any namespace prefix

767230
value	field
in a nutshell the advantage of an auto increment field is that the value is guaranteed unique the disadvantage is that the value doesn t exist until the insert has already been executed

767230
triggers	insert
there s a way you could theoretically pretend that you re only executing one query by attaching a triggers on insert that adds your alternate representation of the id field after the fact

767231
keyword	term
replace the term with my search keyword will get it work

767250
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
however on vista it throws argumentexception s and invalidoperationexception s on certain files and on win7 it throws fileformatexception s and ioexception s

767289
selected	listbox
but when you set up the list that you re binding your listbox to you re just selected the imagedata properties into a list

767316
authentication	login
however each time i try to declare a reference to the soap api the web app returns to the login page - the default action when you request something that requires user authentication

767324
command-line	cmd
the variables you set on cmd-line is for that cmd shell and any other processes it starts

767324
any	set
when you set it from system advanced environment variables it affects any other process you start including command shell after setting it

767324
any	set
depending on where you set it it will be available to the same user or any other use who logs in as well

767335
compact-framework	.net
i m quite simply going totally bonkers with the omission of the autosize-property for the label and textbox controls in .net compact-framework

767352
show	next
next up is all the advert details fetched out image location as an url height and width of the advert - and lest step calls a separate stored procedure to test if the advert is allowed to be show is the campaign expired by either date or number of adverts allowed to show

767352
blacklist	whitelist
and if the customer has access to it we got 2 access systemd running a blacklist and a whitelist one and lastly what type of campaign we re running is the view unique and so forth

767354
long-integer	integer
first your identity autonumber in access column must be integer long-integer in access as opposed to uniqueidentifier replication id in access must use the increment algorithm as opposed to the random algorithm for generating new values and assuming your seed and increment values respectively are both the default value 1 then if you delete all the rows in the table and compact the database then the idenitty column should be reseeded at 1

767354
long-integer	integer
note that when the maximum positive value for integer long-integer in access would be exceeded by the next auto-generated value then it will wrap into the negative integer range and will continue to cycle through the positive and negative ranges generating duplicate values where necessary unless the column is additionally covered by a unique constraint

767363
type-safety	generics
generics adds compile-time type-safety to your program which means the compiler can detect if you are putting the wrong type of objects into your arraylist

767367
reflection	runtime
custom attributes are meant to be accessed at runtime using reflection

767371
mstest	nunit
nunit or mbunit instead of mstest

767371
rhino-mocks	moq
moq instead of rhino-mocks

767371
mbunit	nunit
with the given oss alternatives subversion nunit mbunit i don t see any disadvantages using them

767387
json	xml
the response can contain encoded data typically xml or json or javascript to be executed by the client

767393
show	next
next you want to show list of all the users so you create another methods public list getallusers

767398
gridex	janus
i ve been working with janus gridex for web for a few days

767432
contains	elements
user- and first names are usually not meant to contains those so better use the input elements

767447
order	join
join is many to one ie think of table_one as order and table_b as contains information for the item

767453
benchmarking	profiling
if you re trying to measure your code execution there are profiling or benchmarking for java

767454
modifiers	final
you just need to use reflection to remove the final modifiers then you can modify the field

767461
expander	grid
the reason that you can t simply use a grid or dock panel with the textblocks in to control the alignment is because the default templates of expander left aligns the header content instead of allowing it to stretch

767466
compact-framework	.net
autosize for label textbox in .net compact-framework

767511
decrement	increment
increment when the ajax call starts then decrement when it finishes

767516
defined	declare
you can declare the explicit specialisation in the same way you d defined a member function outside of its class

767519
python	ruby
can you elaborate on the current state of blocks in the ruby sense in python

767521
any	set
these can be set up to run at any desired frequency

767541
contains	elements
my xml file contains some namespace in header so i have used namespacemanager to add namespace-prefix and i have used prefix to get that particular elements

767549
factors	primes
you don t need to know the answer - just whether there is any common factors - so factorsise the smaller number from the list of primes and test each term against the larger number

767551
driver	kernel
it prevents me from unloading the vbox kernel driver to load a newer one

767573
triggers	insert
while updating deleting inserting main table insert old values of record deleted pseudo-table in triggers into history table

767585
web-services	webserver
the fact you are hosting web-services implies that you are using a webserver of some kind so webclient.downloadfile should be available

767588
value	field
the sitecore docs say use the sc functionality to access field value but i need to get the field names first

767605
any	set
unfortunately swing doesn t seem to provide any methods to learn or set z-order of a windows even relative to other windowss in the same vm

767609
rollback	commit
enclosing your queries in a transaction will either be a complete commit or rollback

767621
multicast	packets
it s possible that your switching is multicast aware but if igmp is disabled it won t notice if any attached hardware subscribes to a particular multicast grouping so it wouldn t forwarding those packets

767633
listbox	textbox
i wrote this article back in 2005 about doing intellisense with a listbox and a textbox control or it might have been a rtb

767650
margins	padding
as others have pointed out another good idea is to start off your stylesheet with a snippet that removes all padding and margins like so

767651
versioning	upgrade
having put a lot of faith in jquery already especially their techniques for cross-browser compatibility i will either upgrade to versioning 1.3 and use their function providing that upgrading doesnâ t cause too many problems or use this suggested methods directly in my code

767655
operators	keyword
with new keyword like new string i am string literal the equality operators returns false because both of them are different instances of the string class

767665
decrement	increment
also while increment decrement a counter you ll have to obtain a lock on an object like this -

767672
decrement	increment
the increment and decrement task should be done in an atomicity way using interlocked.increment and interlocked.decrement methods rather than ++ or --

767684
zipfile	archive
i need to create zip archive on demand using either python zipfile module or unix command-line utilities

767697
rtsp	rtmp
afaik it is not possible to consume an rtsp feed in the flash player so i m thinking that we would need some sort of a converter on the server that takes the rtsp stream and converts it to rtmp so we can consume the feed in our flex app

767703
firefox	gecko
only applies to the current trunk builds of firefox minefield 3.6a1pre gecko 1.9.2

767710
string.format	stringbuilder
i d consider using a stringbuilder or string.format to place the details into the body of the email

767719
downgrade	upgrade
upgrade to tomcat 6.0 or downgrade the servlet jsp jstl versions

767720
environment	building
each time there is slight difference in building environment the project reference breaks and show an excel missing error

767740
interpreter	runtime
in those languages code and data are essentially the same thing even at runtime but our chip cannot understand that form of code so we have to emulate such a machine by building an interpreter on top of it that understands it the choice made by lisp like languages or sacrificing the power code will no longer be exactly equal to data to some extent the choice made by c#

767764
decimal-point	digits
and in the case of number how you want to handle digits after the decimal-point

767814
click	mouse
you can map certain actions to mouse left click and right click

767818
google-chrome	firefox
use the title attribute to get your desired result on ie firefox google-chrome

767849
contains	lookup
if a switch contains more than five items it s implemented using a lookup table or a hash list

767865
value	field
i have already implemented this storing information about each data field in a static arrays and storing only the changed value in the objects

767866
show	next
i ve tried showing a form and loading the image but when the preview form show i lose focus for the listbox which means that when i move the mouse the preview image does not change when i go to the next item in the list

767909
selection	highlight
i saw someone demoing jquery and they used some form of console that returned an arrays of items for every selection they could then mouseover each item and it would highlight it in the browser

767917
textbox	button
a textbox and a search button

767922
automake	gnu
i m having trouble with step 9 which is causing automake to emit a warning about the use of -style pattern rules being a gnu make extension

767931
firefox	opera
do different browsers firefox safari ie opera have different limits on the length of the name attribute of form elements

767952
value	field
i was creating a form and i added listeners to all the field which should mean that the ok button is only enabled if all the field in the form have valid value

767956
any	set
there doesn t seem to be any properties that i can set within the xaml or code behind

767969
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can use the mouseenter mouseleave events to do this

767980
png	gif
does it become a gif png etc

768009
vb.net	vb6
this served as well when ms decided to axe vb6 in favor of vb.net

768017
url-rewriting	rewrite
we recently added url-rewriting for nicer urls so i set a rewrite rule for the public page

768048
value	field
in my experience with linq to sql i have concluded for a few reasons that linq is using reflection to set and get field value in entity class instances

768048
value	field
if i recall correctly linq does not call any property procedures but directly sets and reads all the private field value directly which can only be done via reflection as far as i know

768048
attributes	properties
the names provided by the metadata in the attributes on the entity class properties provide field name information in string form if the database column and properties name are different for example

768048
value	field
i think it does this to enforce simplicity -- you can rely on the value in the field in the entity class directly mirroring the database column value and there s not much overhead in retrieving the object from the database populating a newly created entity to correspond to value retrieved from the database should not be routed through property procedures

768082
reflection	runtime
note that in almost all cases with linq-to-sql and ef the expression or the create and set members part is going to be compiled to a delegate before it is invoked - so at runtime there is no huge reflection cost

768104
any	set
if you set the visibility of a server control to false in page_load it will not render at all and nor will any space it might have taken up

768107
tablelayoutpanel	numericupdown
the program consist of one form with one tablelayoutpanel tablelayoutpanel1 one numericupdown coins and one button flip

768111
command-line	cmd
the build-process should be automated so that you can do all those with one cmd on the cmd-line

768111
command-line	cmd
it might take a couple of hours to configurationure the automated build-process using maven more if maven is new to you less if you can copy a configuration templates from one of your other projects but after that it s just one cmd on the cmd-line

768113
buffering	streaming
both the serial-port s streaming and the uart will do buffering

768147
linked-list	arrays
the simplest option is probably to extract the data sort it in a mechanism that already supports sorting arrays or via linq and re-build the linked-list with the sorted data

768157
checkbox	listbox
i would like to add a checkbox control to a listbox control

768160
toolchain	platform
i wrote a test program and i am able to statically compile it with my toolchain and run it on the target platform

768160
toolchain	buildroot
i built my toolchain using buildroot

768160
pkg-config	glib
the dependencies that mono rely s on are glib pkg-config and gettext

768160
pkg-config	glib
i believe glib is a direct dependency and glib depends on pkg-config and gettext

768170
contains	any
the datatable contains 2 columns and i never ask for any columns to be removed in my code

768189
any	set
i m trying to allow for any valid character within the ascii extended set to be recognized by the resulting compiler

768215
markup	tidy
as you may have guessed i don t want to use the tidy extension as a it does a lot more that i need it too the markup is already valid and b it actually makes changes to the html content such as the html 5 doctype and some elements

768217
delphi	c++
i maintain software that is implemented in c++ but must have interfaces in multiple languages including java and .net but also including delphi and vb6

768217
delphi	vb6
then your jni .net vb6 delphi code implements language specific class wrappers but call these c dll functions

768221
itemtemplate	itemscontrol
then you can use an itemscontrol that binds to the query result displaying the data with an itemtemplate containing a header and another itemscontrol which has an itemspaneltemplate set to a wrappanel or a uniformgrid

768237
portrait	screens
for example a device may be designed with a portrait square or landscape screens

768243
contains	any
how to escape the strings a and b so they don t get interpreted as regexes if they contains any regex characters

768254
constructor	object
the only thing you can do is to define a constructor on myobjectcollection that takes an ienumerable as a parameter and initalizes itself with the data in the other one but that will make a new object containing the same data

768268
hash	md5
is there a way to calculate the md5 hash of a file before the upload to the server using javascript

768272
quicksort	mergesort

768278
icefaces	gwt
there are a couple of frameworks which implement this securer server driven ria one is it mill toolkit based on gwt and icefaces should also be one to my knowledge

768287
firefox4	firefox
firefox 3.6 supports filereader firefox4 supports even more file based functionality

768288
hash	md5
there is a couple scripts out there on the internet to create an md5 hash

768290
search-engine	seo
search-engine optimization seo seems to be a topic i m running into more and more and i would like to know a little more about it

768298
form-submit	onsubmit
if a form-submit is performed you can put a hidden input in the form and fill out its value with javascript from onsubmit and check that on the server side

768304
lookup	any
since the resourcedictionary can be manipulated programatically i m wondering if anyone has managed to regex.replace the whole thing away so the lookup is automatic and any new view viewmodel get resolved by virtue of their naming convention

768318
short	base
in short it s impossible to guarantee consistency with a large enough code base

768336
32-bit	64bit
we are currently transferring our websites from windows 2003 32-bit to windows 2008 64bit and have hit a problem

768353
32-bit	x86
however since you can t mix 64 32-bit code you d have to create a c# service running in x86 see the project properties platform target that you can then use from your x64 web app via wcf

768374
arrays	loops
why do you do that while loops if you can access the returned arrays directly

768381
32-bit	64bit
observation if you can answer the above question for 32-bit case then you can also answer for 64bit case 100 bit case etc

768394
g++	gcc
you can use make to compile your c and c++ programs by calling gcc or g++ in your makefile to do all the compilation and linking steps allowing you to do all these steps with one simple command

768401
any	set
some compilers let you set warnings as errors so that you ll never leave any compiler warnings behind because if you do the code won t build

768401
linux	unix
what s the shortest simplest unix linux shell script you can write that meets the explicit requirements above as well as the following implicit requirements of otherwise behaving just like the compiler

768401

noclassdeffounderror	classpath
a noclassdeffounderror indicates that you re missing a jar file from your classpath specifically the one that is holding serialporteventlistener class

768447
primitive	int
given java s write once run anywhere paradigm and the fact that the java tutorials give explicit bit sizes for all the primitive data types without the slightest hint that this is dependent on anything i would say that yes an int is always 32-bit

768450
instances	private
for all public or private instances and static properties

768455
16-bit	8bit
the integral types are byte short int and long whose values are 8bit 16-bit 32-bit and 64-bit signed two s-complement integers respectively and char whose values are 16-bit unsigned integers representing utf-16 code units

768476
average	min
then look at min max and average recordsize columns

768483
hotmail	gmail
for example if you have say 50 aol users 20 gmail users 20 hotmail 5 yahoo 5 misc

768483
hotmail	gmail
- you could argue you are willing to risk that 5 of your email are rejected - so take the minimum size allowed by aol gmail hotmail and yahoo

768483
communication	messages
the other thing you might consider is ensuring that you have a way to monitor the messages that are rejected due to attachment size - then communication with those people to let them know they need larger attachment limits to use your service

768489
click	mouse
when i click the combobox down arrow without moving the mouse and apply the scroll wheel the list scrolls as expected

768502
export	report
how do i export the first 3 pages of the report to excel

768507
32-bit	64bit
while the behaviour of java s primitives is specified completely and exactly in the language spec there is one caveat on a 64bit architetcture it s possible that ints will be word-aligned which means that an arrays of ints or any non-64bit primitive type could take twice as much memory as on a 32-bit achitecture

768512
deployment	install
what are the steps needed to create a vs 2008 msi setup and deployment file to install a custom created certificate key onto a client s machine

768524
contains	set
if the returned string contains a single line you may use for f to set the value of an environment variables

768527
push	pull
your other option would be running a database server on the machine creating web-services that run locally and push pull the data from the database and then call those services from your flash application

768555
jquery	.post
no need to ajax jquery or any other magic unless you want to stay on the same page and .post in the background

768560
keyboard	mouse
therefore if your event handler is intensive when the index changes it will slow down the scrolling as it will run each time the selected index changes each time your scroll with the mouse or keyboard

contains	set
i m trying to add a new set of columns that contains a date and shows the total number of records for that date automagically

768585
administration	account
the setup.exe prompts my users to install .net 3.5 sp1 which is often a 15+ minute install and only allowed to administration level account

768587
callback	methods
instead of having the setfp set the callback to lbdatabindingsource.addnumber create a private methods in your code to handle the callback and then call lbdatabindingsource.addnumber from that callback

768594
append	input
i m now going to selected the newly-created form element using its id and i m going to append a new hidden input element to it with the appropriate name value pair

768602
compact-framework	.net
are there any easy and free methods of showing a map of a location starting from an the address in .net compact-framework

768620
defined	declare
that is the const and volatile type-specifiers for each parameter type are ignore when determining which function is being declare defined or called

768626
contains	set
sumif range criteria sum_range i think you could set range the set of cells contains dates in your first listing criteria would be the cell contains the date in the second listing and sum_range would be the counts in the first column of your first listing

768641
compact-framework	.net
i m trying to do an asynchronous http s post on .net compact-framework and i can t seem to get it working

768643

768665
document	element
how would i take this xml and create a table with a column for each section element and then display all the document elements in that column using xslt

768688
default-value	arguments
what s important is that stop is defined in scope but the caller didn t have to pass it explicitly only that it has taken it s default-value altering the semantics of the arguments which in effect causes the first argument to be optional instead of the second even where the language does not allow that without this clever trick

768706
value	field
if classwithlongname.otherlongname is a public data-members a field of a value type than changes to simplename will not change classwithlongname.otherlongname

768708
solaris	linux
this is all fine on windows and linux but on solaris and hpux i am less confident regarding how advisory locking works there

contains	any
oh and never use os.system for any strings contains any input coming from a user

768723
java-3d	jogl
it allows applets to use extensions like java-3d jogl and joal very easily with just a few additional parameters to the tag on java se versions as far back as 1.4.2

768723
java-3d	jogl
jogl has a sample applet here and java-3d has two samples here

768750
export	report
you can export the report to any of our various formats including pdf html and excel and it also include an end user designer control that you can embed into your own applications to let end users modify or create their own report

768750
web-services	webserver
run on windows ideally invoked from code within a webserver - you can use data dynamics reports in client-based or asp.net applications it even support medium trust asp.net applications web-services are fine

768750
export	report
export again through code to pdf or similar - data dynamics report supports export to pdf html excel word images and xml

768777
python	tcl
if you choose a language like tcl or python and tk for your application development it becomes fairly trivial to write your own dsl for describing the interface

768783
decrement	increment
i want to be able to increment and decrement both without going through a setters and getters

768783
getter	setter
getter and four setter and maybe a couple resetter too

768783
value	field
for dryness i have started encapsulating the logic of messing with those stats in field classes so that i could write code such as intelligence.applybonus 10 or hitpoints.get which takes care the value returned is in range etc

768783
getter	setter
now i hit in this problem while plugging field into gamecharacter most java textbooks say that each class should have private fields with public getter and setter

768783
getter	setter
are the advantages of encapsulation so massive that i should go ahead and have getter getters and setter getters and so on.

768785
any	set
even when i set the function to always return false it allows any user

768790
google-chrome	firefox
i have a fairly simple crud web application c# asp.net that runs fine in firefox ie7 and google-chrome

768797
getter	setter
for example if you have strength you could have a strengthmanipulation class that is initialized to a specific player object and then provides getter setter all with appropriate validation and exception-handling and perhaps things like calculating strength with bonuses etc

768797
getter	setter
when you access a field in vb at least in old vbs you usually call a property getter and setter and vb simply hide the call for you

768804
entity-framework	data-access
for data-access i am using entity-framework with sqlite

768810
selected	button
i am using zedgraph and i want to zoom to a selected area by holding down ctrl and dragging the box with the left mouse button instead of clicking and dragging with the middle mouse button

768818
linkbutton	onclick
i assume i will add a linkbutton control to each row somehow set the onclick event handler to point to the same methods and somehow pass in the unique identifier on the row as a parameter

768826
getter	setter
it sounds like your main complaint isn t so much with the abstraction of setter getter methods but with the language syntax for using them

768826
getter	setter
direct field access is fine until you need to switching to a getter or setter and then you will have some refactoring to do possibly ok if you control the whole codebase

768838
value	field
the value of those field are paths relative to media_root if you need to you can set media_root in your test setup methods in a custom test_settings.py to ensure that your test files are found wherever you put them

768840
protected	public
as long as types remain unchanged in their public or protected layout and methods signatures are not changed adding methodss or types is fine the jit should be able to link the dll just fine

768850
udp	tcp
indy delphi is a library tcomponent for delphi representing the true power of winsock.it provides components for tunelling tcp udp connections and much more

768851
selected	cells
however when multiple cells are selected i am capturing the keydown event and manually calling beginedit

768869
buffering	streaming
your only choice then is to read the streaming manually into a buffering and pass it to tinyxml s parsing

768881
value	field
for options with a value you must provide a field that takes the option s value

768905
order	add
in order for me to use the code in root.account i would need to add using root.account to my code

768911
perl	ruby
i would use perl but ruby or python would probably be good choices as well

768924
concatenation	comma
if the ids of the rows you want are in a spreadsheet then you can add an extra column to the spreadsheet that concatenation a comma on to the end of the id so that the column in your spreadsheet looks like this

768946
value	field
this char 50 field allows nulls and in that case a null value is considered to be the same as a non-null zero-length string for my purposes

768958
display	width
the problem i m encountering is when you do an auto-resize the width property doesn t show you the actual width it display the width before the auto-resize i guess

768959
python	php
asker is most fluent with php and python

768961
temporary	copy
you may find on large datasets that it is quicker to create a temporary copy of the data reprocess it index it then do the required matching

768970
webforms	asp.net
i believe that constructor injection is far more commonly used right now and property injection is widely seen as a fallback for cases where it is not feasible to get the di container to perform object construction for you asp.net webforms

768973
environment	building
i think you need to tracking down what s different between your tfs building environment and your local vs machines

768986
triggers	insert
how about adding an insert update triggers to the table to guarantee that there is no whitespace on that column

769017
getter	setter
create a class with those members protect the setter or set them from the constructor and provide getter methods

769034
defined	declare
it uses a long instead of an enum or at least a declare constant to defined a type which is most likely not to be understood as a numeric

769042
detect	move
however the problem i am having is that if an element becomes too big for the remaining page spaces or pushes something else off the bottom how can i detect this and move the element myself to the right positioning on the next page

769043
value	field
you could define a bean to hold the value field with getters setters or use a map for the value

769093
specifications	w3c
by the way the multipart forms request for comments and the w3c recommendation for mulitpart form-data are a couple of useful resources in case anyone needs a reference for the specifications

769129
stderr	stdout
redirects â stderr â to â stdout â at the end makes the command run in background

769130
stderr	stdout
if you want to pipe stderr or stdout to a file you can do that easily

769158
stderr	stdout
every unix program has two output streams stdout and stderr

769158
stderr	stdout
the 2 redirects stderr file-descriptor 2 to a file represented in this case by 1 which tells the shell to use file-descriptor 1 which is stdout

769166
derived-class	base-class
it s been a while but i believe that you should be able to specify that the derived-class should be persisted as an object of the base-class in the hibernate mapping file

769175
hide	show
is there a way to force a gtk.windows object to ignore the windows manager s show hide commands such as iconify and show desktop

769179
swing	gwt
but gwt designer by instantiations is a pretty good equivalent to flex builder in the gwt world and for a java programmer with swing skills the architecture of gwt doesn t take much figuring out

769181
arrays	loops
obviously each computer is going to benchmark this differently but i was able to make this run approximately 50x faster on my machine ruby 1.8.6 by removing the loopsing on the arrays with an each block and by causing the inner loops to check less numbers

769191
triggers	insert
insert updates and deletes can potentially hit the database from various sources - triggers will catch all these

769195
javascript	dom
you can find out the calculated height of a given dom element using javascript

769195
pixels	line
then if you know the number of pixels in a given page you can add line breaks as needed to push it down if it will be too big

769209
required	checked
it s simple for simple cases data type checked and required fields and easy to add custom validation for more complex cases

769243
listbox	textbox
way back when i designed the software i decided how the user-interface going to work for textbox listbox combo boxes etc

769255
convention	standards
if you use the function approach is there a typical or standards naming convention for this type of function

769265
getter	setter
are the advantages of encapsulation so massive that i should go ahead and have getter getters and setter getters and so on.

769265
getter	setter
the problem with getter setter is that they create overly tight coupling between the object with those methods and the rest of the system

769265
getter	setter
one of the advantages of real encapsulation is that it reduces the need for getter and setter decoupling your object from the rest of the system in the process

769267
research	metrics
as part of a internal research project we are trying to collect some metrics from a bugzilla database

769268
administration	account
to complicate my project most customers use a service account which means i need to bind with an administration username and password before i can authentication a regular username and password

769291
alter-column	alter-table
alter-table t_name alter-column expiration set default current_timestamp + 2592000

769291
triggers	insert
i am sure i can do that with a before insert triggers but i was just wondering if there is a trick for doing arithmetics in default clause that i just don t know about

769292
attributes	properties
i assume the compiler deployer uses reflection and properties of the sqlfunction attributes so i m also using reflection to gather a methodinfo list of the static-methods that have the sqlfunction attributes

769300
telnet	ftp
indy is a winsock wrapper that provides blocking socket behavior for network internet programming ftp telnet http etc.

769314
credentials	account
i m not sure i entirely understand the question but in some situations i ve found it easy to authenticate a user by simply doing a search for their account and using their credentials as the username and password

769319
nsmutablearray	nsarray
i have an object in objective-c at runtime from which i only know the kvc key and i need to detect the return-value type i need to know if its an nsarray or nsmutablearray of this property how can i do that

769322
java-3d	jogl
jogl and java-3d are very different

769362
initializer	getter
i put the lazy-evaluation initializer into the getter for a given function

769374
windows-xp	windows
the only nasty problem i have run into so far is that some opengl windows scribble on top of layered windows on windows-xp and vista without dwm

769403
integer	zero
else i agree with adam robinson s answer - if you just want to hold the day of a week stick with the dayofweek enum zero is sunday instead of using an integer

769413
value	field
the complete value can be stored or stored and indexed if other queries use the whole number in the original field

769417
getter	setter
in this way the backing collection is never instantiated if the getter is called without the setter ever being called

769422
value	field
an field which has unique value is essentially a key

769427
page-fault	kernel
the os catches the page-fault figures out that that address corresponds to a memory-mapped file and reads the appropriate disk sector into an internal kernel buffer

769427
page-fault	kernel
then it maps the kernel buffer into the process s address space and restarts the user instruction that caused the page-fault

769432
httphandler	httpmodule
i ve used both httpmodule ihttpmodule interface and httphandler ihttphandler interface and it occurs to me that i could implement this using either mechanism

769433
sql-server	oracle
and of course the difference between a unique constraint and a primary key is that the unique constraint allows at least 1 null value 1 on sql-server more than one on oracle

769446
revision	svn
is there a way to filtering the tortoise svn revision graph before you open it

769448
httphandler	httpmodule
as stated here httpmodule are simple classes that can plug themselves into the request processing pipeline whereas httphandler differ from httpmodule not only because of their positioning in the request processing pipeline but also because they must be mapped to a specific file extensions

769473
multiplication	modulo
constant spaces with no additions subtractions multiplication divisions modulo or arithmetic negations

769481
background-color	transparency
instead of subclassing nstextfield just make the background-color transparency nscolor clearcolor and put the image behind it

769484
rollback	commit
transaction count after execute indicates that a commit or rollback transaction statement is missing

769486
value	field
for example when field a hits value 10 you want to get informed on that event without actually getting coupled with the implementation details of this complex object you want to observe

769491
private	self
if you don t want the underlaying collection to be exposed which is a very good idea you have to make it private make it final as in the sample above and provide an iterator to access the elements of the collection not to pass the collection it self

769494
contains	elements
the list tries to call the destructor on contains elements when they re deleted and if the destructor doesn t actually exist anywhere you get a linker error

769503
rollback	commit
you can check xact_state in your code and then commit or rollback check it out here use xact_state to check for doomed transactions

769505
external	root
if it doesn t work you have to specify all the modified files and folder separately not just the root folder of the external

769510
arrays	loops
suppose i ve got a method that accepts an arrays and processes each element in it using java s built in for-each loops like this

769513
gethashcode	equals
you only need to override gethashcode on reference-type if you override equals

769513
gethashcode	equals
if two objects are equals as per equalss you need to guarantee that they ll have the same hash code with gethashcode so you should override it

769516
value	field
where some_other_table would have just one field ids and all value would be unique

769517
defined	declare
the error clears says std _lockit is declare but not defined

769529
subtract	add
so if i hit 8 on the number pad i don t want numpad8 i want the int value 8 that i can add or subtract or whatever

769546
selected	button
in my app i want to have certain button that are inactive when there is no row selected in my table view

769547
gethashcode	equals
as for the other questions reed actually beat me to the punch re gethashcode and equals

769550
output	cat
but the output from my cat is a little bit slower than the real cat

769588
key-value	key
the key-value represents the character code for the key that was pressed

769596
panels	grid
maybe hte isue can be on the grid try to do that in a dummy stack panels just to check whether you have to play with auto or .

769619
adplus	dump
i know this because i ve run adplus in crash mode and analyzed the crash dump post mortem using sos

769619
remote-debugging	debugging
i m not a windbg expert and short of installing visual-studio on the live system or using remote-debugging and debugging using that tool does anyone have any suggestions as to how i can get a stack trace out of the offending thread

769624
subtract	add
so i create two classes add and subtract

769642
subtract	add
you can expose an interface imathoperation for example with a single methods such as compute and then specify types implementing the interface add subtract etc in the di framework configuration file

769646
firefox	safari
also i m not sure if text-indent works in ie--i m currently on a mac and it works with firefox and safari

769647
callback	methods
so my callback methods was expecting a parameter and i was not passing one when calling it from javascript so i guess it was just failing silently

769650
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
i am wondering if there are any tools that you guys use to kick-start a codeigniter project similar to ruby-on-rails

769656
spring	jsf
i have a fairly typical javaee application composed using ejb3 seam components spring beans and jsf all packaged into several jar and war files inside an ear file

769657
ruby-on-rails	rspec
i upgraded my application to ruby-on-rails 2.3.2 without any problems then freezed it to vendor ruby-on-rails and worked through all my specs after i also upgraded rspec to 1.2.4

769658
scheme	prolog
what is the general idea of using breadth-first over the default depth-first search scheme in prolog

769662
base-class	inherited
if you use an abstract base-class where the dinners object is populate and inherited from that it will always be available but you ll have to be aware that it s there always even when you don t need it

769677
methods	extend
ps also - extending an existing service with additional methods while not changing any of the existing interfaces can be done very easily and without any change to the clients too - so you can always easily extend your service as your requirements grow without breaking backwards compatibility

769683
postgresql	mysql
what s the alternative to show tables from mysql in postgresql

769684
ruby-on-rails	codeigniter
i m not sure how ruby-on-rails does it but if you have unpacked codeigniter in a directory you can pretty much start creating your site

769692
value	field
batch_jv_csh_max is used to test the maximum value of an amount field

769730
debugging	trace
you won t be able to debugging but you would get the stack trace

769737
value	field
if the value of a field is not actually changed but reassigned the same value will that reassignment be marked for update when submitting to database

769764
stream	send
a performs http call i don t know if it can be soap or should be something else b starts searching and when new results are available it send them over http stream and fflush it so they may be available on the a side immediately

769764
buffering	streaming
and the rest is handled by framework including reestablishing connection when it is dropped falling to polling pushing if streaming can not be done because of buffering proxy calling callback.requestfinished when serverb finishes work or throws the exception-handling etc

769765
spaces	output
while in blairhippo s example the output of your first attempt at a novel would be comically bad your first web code could potentially be dangerous to your users and folks unlucky enough to share server spaces with you

769768
extends	super
there s some restrictions on what you can use extends and super for in this fashion

769780
comparator	sortedset
a sortedset is a set elements are unique that is kept order by the natural order of the elements or using some comparator

769807
csv	xml
don t use csv use xml with a library to read write the xml file instead

769807
fgetcsv	fputcsv
for php use build in fgetcsv fputcsv functions

769814
oracle	mysql
i am using oracle and it has functions which emulate mysql s group_concat

769816
exception-handling	try-catch
one option you have is to use a try-catch block at a high level and then print or log the stack trace provided by the exception-handling

769818
command-line	cmd
msbuild can be run from the cmd-line i find msbuild to be easier to work with that way with the following cmd

769820
contains	any
any field can be quoted but only fields that contains commas cr nl or quotes must be quoted

769820
mime	rfc
the rfc that was mentioned elsewhere is not a standard for csv it is an rfc for using csv within mime and contains some unconventional and unnecessary limitations that make it useless outside of mime

769844
versioning	upgrade
does anyone who has already been down the upgrade path from older versioning of browserlauncher have any advice on potential gotchas

769852
perl	ruby
it s like a form builder compatible with all sorts of scripting languages python perl ruby shell

769870
debugging	trace
once you ve hit a stack overflow you re pretty much out of luck for debugging the problem - blowing your stack space leaves your program in a non-deterministic state so you can t rely on any of the information in it at that point - any stack trace you try to get may be corrupted and can easily point you in the wrong direction

769888
.net	wcf
not sure how you d implement something like that in java but in .net you can use a duplex contract for a wcf service

769899
textbox	button
then add a textbox then another button labeled add

769899
textbox	button
then for the add button button3 i pull the text from the textbox store it in my datalist and then refresh all the observers

769920
for-loop	loops
one of the most obvious primitives there is the parallel for-loops - looks sort of like a for-loops but tries to execute the loops in parallel

769935
iteration	set
the only reason i can think of for using a numerical index in a set would be for iteration

769941
joomla	modx
imagine an emap plugin for both joomla and modx

769941
configuration	environment
if i understand correctly you are in a configuration where the development environment the set of files you are working on is quite the same than the distribution environment the same set of file is copied on the release platform

769943
put	get
finally get a computer and take it apart and put it back together again

769950
document	editing
i need to manage xml document in subversion but don t want to manage the formatting which may turn out differently depending on who is editing the file

769970
value	field
that default-value can be increment or random but as it is only a default-value you can append any long-integer value to the field as long as it doesn t violate the index

769970
value	field
i can t imagine why you d want an autonumber field with duplicates value but the point is that you can do it if you don t add a unique index

769982
button	slide
on slide complete activate button

770009
vb.net	vb6
for the same reason vb6 programmers needed to understand the windows api to get anything done and vb.net and c# programmers need to at least know what msil looks like you should be familiar enough with javascript to understand what jquery is doing

770020
value	field
1 user enters field value

770020
any	set
2 onblur value is set with ajax a4j support at this point the validators fire and the div is re-rendered if any validation errors occured they re now visible on the page

770028
perl	php
if you dive into javascript with the idea that it is similar to java c# perl php etc then you ll end up thinking javascript is a bizarre inconsistent mutant language that makes no effing sense whatsoever

770044
simplemodal	jquery
it opens a client-side jquery popup using simplemodal the popup itself still needs some work

770044
button	popup
when the popup opens a textbox and a submit button are shown

770044
contains	elements
the methods returns an instance of the methodsresult class that contains the id of the user-interface elements to update and the actual result a random number

770090
python	c++
a popular c++ based information retrieval library that is often used with python is xapian

770100
configuration	logging
i have a logging component that generates an xmldocument with a basic log4net configuration using variables defined as appsettings filename for a rollingfileappender default logging level maybe connection string name if you want to use an adonetappender

770146
python	java
is there a way to upload database contents to google app engine for java like the bulk uploader script in the python version

770152
python	ruby
most tutorials for ruby and python frameworks with which i am most familiar will include instructions on how to start a development server like this

770161
nested	order
i have a nested arrays which basically represents a list of all the nodes from a category tree in no particular order

770163
linked-list	arrays
internally it s an arrays or a linked-list or something

770164
compact-framework	.net
pure-managed code and compact-framework support would be a good thing as i am attempting to produce a unified msil binary that runs unmodified on cf armv4i .net x86 and .net x64 though something that only works for .net x86 is useful in the short term

770172
.when	ready
this code will attach the onclick function to the onclick event for all input elements of type submit .when the dom is ready

770173
ref	out
getactiveobject ref _guid _ptr out objapp

770175
compression	streaming
iis http compression and streaming pdf s don t work well

770197
contains	elements
in order to contains the clear and keep it from interacting with elements from elsewhere in the page you need to float the containser as well

770206
webforms	asp.net
i mainly build asp.net webforms so this is a bit of a departure for me but that s a good thing

770207
any	set
the form s keypreview property is be set to true to let the form react to key presses before any other components

770230

in excel 2007 vba how do i print the worksheet to a specific printer tray

770265
rewrite	rule
i have seen this happen with an apache rewrite rule

the construct is shorthand for that is it redirects both stdout and stderr into the pipeline

770281
moss	wss
i ve got a sharepoint moss 2007 development setup on to which i install the wss infrastructure updates

770281
credentials	account
i enter valid credentials for my site collection admin account and i see the box again

770285
cygwin	gnu
since the original question referenced cygwin which is windows specific i ll mention that luis answer works just as well using the gnu utilities for win32 sort

770285
cygwin	gnu
i use the gnu ports off a usb key when i m working on a machine that i don t want to install cygwin on or downloading and installing cygwin seems like too heavy a solution for the problem i m trying to solve

770331
oracle	mysql
it s out of this world and certainly out of mysql chasing by ibm or oracle

770334
webserver	upload
however if it s a webserver with something like cgi or php enabled you could leverage that by upload a cgi or php script in a place it can be run and then calling it through a browser thus doing whatever file manipulations you need.

770344
porting	linker
i m in the process of porting a large c++ application from linux gcc to windows visual-c++ 2008 and am having linker issues with plugins

770361
perforce	git
writing a wrapper is a good idea anyways as it gives us the option flexibility to swap the vc system out with svn or git why you would if you can use perforce i don t know...

770364
build-process	ant
is there an about box version number library or set of ant related tools that i can just drop in place in my build-process

770372
command-prompt	cmd
it s all green screen text-based screens typing three letter cmd at a command-prompt and using the cursor to move around the screen

770374
dlopen	dlsym
do you mean dynamically loading libraries using dlopen and dlsym and so on

770387
revision	svn
it s good idea to grab the revision # directly from svn

770387
revision	svn
we usually have major and minor versions set as parameters to ant scrpt while revision is managed automatically by svn and gives consistent build number for the references

770394
temporary	copy
edit if i create the file in the website then copy the contents from the temporary site i created it seems to compile just fine

770401
profiling	debugging
to get the dissassembly windows go to debugging | windowss | dissassembly i m using the c# developer profiling

770411
selected	listbox
you could then hook up the animals table to a combo listbox control on your form to selected a record from that table

770420
decrement	increment
one also needs to be careful that changing from pre post- increment decrement operators doesn t introduce an undesirable side effect

770420
any	set
for example if you re iterating over a loop 5 times simply to run a set of code multiple times without any interest in the loop index value you re probably okay ymmv

770420
arrays	loops
admittedly this is a bit of a contrived case but i have seen this sort of loops iteration 3rd case when going through an arrays in reverse order from end to start

770428
flash-cs3	swc
generally you just make a swc inside flash-cs3 or cs4 and then import that swc inside flex builder or flex sdk or flashdevelop or ...

770436
hide	show
i thought about a bunch of panels or divs that i could hide show but not sure i really like that solution

770437
constructor	object
i d rather not just pass in these values to each object s constructor as i would like the added type-safety of multiple classes since it never makes sense for two objects with different constants to interact

770438
inherited	subclass
the com.xxx.domain.model.scheme class is a mapped subclass entity of the abstract fund entity on a single_table inherited hierarchy and i m getting this error for all entities on the hierarchy

770438
annotations	mapping
i m using both annotations classes and xml metadata to define the mapping for my persistence classes

770442
internet-explorer	firefox
document .ready works just fine for firefox but sometimes connection to the server seems to be a major issue in this it lags a little behind in internet-explorer

770455
default-value	arguments
so how do i set test for an undef in the arguments list and replace with the said default-value with params validate

770474
serialization	marshalling
i know that in terms of several distributed techniques such as rpc the term marshalling is used but don t understand how it differs from serialization

770478
any	set
failing that if you are dead set on seeing it run just use any general nn library for the network itself

770483
serialization	marshalling
the term marshalling is considered to be synonymous with serialization in the python standard library 1 but the terms are not synonymous in the java-related rfc 2713

770483
serialization	marshalling
you can marshalling any object that is serialization or remote

770483
serialization	marshalling
marshalling is like serialization except marshalling also records codebases

770483
serialization	marshalling
marshalling is different from serialization in that marshalling treats remote objects specially

770485
serialization	marshalling
so when marshalling data between processes for example you may wish to merely send a reference to potentially expensive data to recover whereas with serialization you would wish to save it all to properly recreate the object s when deserialized

770486
pointers	stack
createtoolhelp32snapshot with th32cs_snapshot to get threads in the target process then getthreadcontext and check if the resulting stack pointers is within the segment

770489
any	set
one business grouping doesn t want to feel any less important than another especially with identical priorities set at the top

770508
value	field
aren t the field value captured and put in the viewstate when the postback occurs

770508
value	field
edit when i break the debugger on page_load before any code executes after the postback the form field value are empty

770509
serialization	marshalling
marshalling and serialization are loosely synonymous in the context of remote procedure call but semantically different as a matter of intent

770509
serialization	marshalling
in particular marshalling is about getting parameters from here to there while serialization is about copying structured data to or from a primitive form such as a byte stream

770509
serialization	marshalling
in this sense serialization is one means to perform marshalling usually implementing pass-by-value semantics

770511
value	field
it sounds like you have something else going wrong perhaps an onload handler that isn t checking the ispostback field and therefore overwriting your changed value

770523
double-quotes	single-quotes
single-quotes and double-quotes

770528
groovy	java
attempting to use groovy makes no sense as the gwt compiler only understands the java language syntax along it it s subset of java libraries

770531
decimal-point	digits
to reduce the number of digits before the decimal-point simply divide by a multiple of 10

770534
windows-mobile	windows-ce
these functions are available on windows-ce and windows-mobile platforms see links although i don t know at what version they added support

770534
compact-framework	.net
however i don t think .net compact-framework implements this yet so you ll have to use p invoke if using .net

770536
listbox	textbox
very useful for main control type of things such as a dominant listbox tree control or multi-line textbox

770537
value	field
if you re doing a callback the form field value sent back with the callback are the ones the page first sent to the client

770537
value	field
for some reason asp.net-ajax pickles these value and sends them with every callback instead of reading the form field afresh

770543
typedef	struct
the library allocates and frees memory for an internal struct - which is hidden from the client using a typedef

770545
scp	ssh
using rsh also prepares you for the day you will finally enter the 90s and start using ssh since you can mostly just change rcp to scp and rsh to ssh and everything still works

770552
png	gif
the problem sounds like the image is too big in terms of file-size have you tried other image formats mainly gif or jpeg or the other png format png-8 or png-24

770554
configuration	logging
i know this isn t what you asked for but i just want to draw your attention to the fact that you can turn logging off in your configuration file

770559
erlang	scala
actually scala a jvm functional language uses what is called an actor model that is very similar to and as i understand it borrows heavily from the erlang model of shared-nothing concurrency

770566
typedef	struct
we can treat them as abstract data types or objects if you like and define a typedef ed struct disc program track say to represent each one

770567
command-line	cmd
if you just want some quick results from the cmd-line or to use in a shell script you can also use the notify-send cmd

770597
inherited	subclass
another option is to subclass page and then make your pages inherited from it so you ve got one place with all common functionality

770611
linux	bsd
you could just as easily install a linux or bsd on the boards and just use ssh to manage and run jobs across all the nodes

770626
tapestry	wicket
for java take a look at struts2 spring asp.net-mvc tapestry wicket etc

770627
ado	jet
i don t know if ado is constructed over jet oledb engine which i suppose if it is this way the jet engine doesn t support execution of multiple statements in one single batch we tryed separating with

770642
superclass	subclass
in objective-c if you are subclassing something and are planning to override a methods on the superclass should you re-declare the superclass methods in your subclass interface

770690
contains	elements
you have to maintain a stack contains all vertices in the current depth first traversal with its first elements being the root node

770691
postgresql	mysql
one thing i like about postgresql over mysql is that it has a slightly more open licensing policy

770709
groovy	java
i m reading this book and the author states that any groovy class can take the place of a java class just changing its extension

770743
json	xml
i would agree that json may be an excellent approach for passing data but to go from php to .net you may want to use xml only because then you can use xml linq which may make parsing simpler

770743
.net	wcf
you can then communicate back and forth via http connections or webservices depending on which way data flows but i expect that it will flow from php - .net so you could experiment with wcf to pass data using a rest architecture though php can do webservice client calls also

770745
compact-framework	.net
i am using .net compact-framework 1.0

770749
python	perl
for a .net website you could use perl or python

770750
stored-procedures	ssis
on my current project i have pulled a number of sql queries out of ssis packages and into stored-procedures

770750
stored-procedures	ssis
in order to distinguish between these stored-procedures and those that should be of general use i have prefixed the names with ssis

770752
python	perl
i would also recommend you to get familiar with a good scripting language such as perl or python

770790
directory	folder
unfortunately that directory where tomcat is located is in another user s home folder 1 to which i have ony read access

770809
procedure	records
i know how to do this with functions procedure and classes but not with records

770839
opensolaris	linux
you can choose between several operating systems various linux distributions opensolaris windows if you pay extra and you can use pre-existing machine images or create your own

770845
value	field
this scripting sorts the sortclass objects according to the value of each instance s x field

770847
http-post	post
the full data to post in a http-post operation

770847
value	field
this can either be passed as a urlencoded string like para1 val1 para2 val2 ... or as an arrays with the field name as key and field data as value

770875
attributes	properties
use properties or plain attributes

770883
hash	md5
you need to md5 hash the email address and then put it into a gravatar url

770883
hash	md5
if you want those random drawings that appear you can use an md5 hash to get them

770921
hash	md5
md5 was only broken in the sense that there are algorithms that given a bunch of data a additional data b can be generated to create a desired hash

770923
hash	md5
if you care at all about security it would be better to choose an unbroken hash algorithm such as one of the sha-2 family sha-1 has also been weakened though not broken as badly as md5 is

770923
hash	md5
while the current attack against md5 may not work against the protocol you describe md5 has been severely compromised and a hash will only ever get weaker never stronger

770925
python	perl
does python have an equivalent to the output_record_separator or in perl

770928
shell	bash
learn the shell sh ksh bash or whatever they are going to use

770948
hash	md5
md5 provide more collision than sha which mean someone can actually get same hash from different word but it s rarely

770952
shell	bash
overall a decent knowledge about the most commonly used linux shell bash should be a fundamental requirement

770953
telnet	ssh
explaining that ssh and telnet are available to access those remote boxes might help if telnet port is disabled

770962
contains	any
i want to know whether there is quick way to find whether an xml document is correctly encoded in utf-8 and does not contains any characters which is not allowed in xml utf-8 encoding

770964
glassfish	weblogic
in an app server such as glassfish weblogic etc spring can use the jta transaction manager

770969
logout	login
so in your opinion are auth login johndoe login and auth logout johndoe logout good options

770969
logout	login
i m now thinking of using the uris session johndoe put for login delete for logout

770987
emacs	vim
edit of course some text editor vim emacs mcedit etc is needed

770995
any	set
you won t need to set any environment variables

770997
groovy	java
both groovy .groovy and java .java source files will compile to bytecode .class files

771012
mersenne-twister	generator
i have a simple wrapper for an mersenne-twister random number generator

771012
multiplying	addition
the scaling multiplying by begin-end seems to work correctly but the addition of begin does not seem to be returned

771022
header-files	makefile
make sure your makefile has the proper dependencies the source files need to depend on the header-files that they include

771024
return-type	arguments
in general the cache would be a map from a tuples representing the input arguments to the return-type

771026
common-lisp	scheme
it uses common-lisp which is slightly different from scheme in some aspects but you should be able to get by with it

771032
instrumentation	profiling
a profiling should do the trick or you could build a test version with some instrumentation

771036
ruby	php
bonus question if ruby and python got jealous of php s party-favors what english terms would they search for in php s documentation in order to talk about it behind php s back

771037
hash	md5
presidential election in a file with the md5 hash value 3d515dead7aa16560aba3e9df05cbc80

771037
hash	md5
the md5 hash value is worthless as a checksum because too many different files give the same result

771039
command-line	cmd
in windbg i can use the .childdbg 1 cmd to tell it to break when a child process is spawned or i can launch it with the -o cmd-line option

771044
hash	md5
in your example the hash would be of md5 message + time + md5 password and you could safely store md5 password in your database

771049
create-table	alter-table
i don t think there is as the language reference gives both for create-table and for alter-table

771061
execution	restart
in order to listen to the broadcast messages i am calling the sleep function and once again restart execution of the thread

771069
linux	unix
specifically about windows hacking and web hacking iâ m not interested in linux unix stuff

771078
any	set
i have managed to add my own custom control to the tooltip a tableviewer but i can t see any methods ways to set the tooltip to be resizable and only dissappear when user clicks on a key esc key

771106
perl	ruby
it s pretty good for web applications out of the box well compared to things like perl python ruby i guess

771126
for-loop	loops
even if you re not familiar with ruby s c internals it s pretty clear that this function has a for-loops iterating upward to check that the type of all the arguments is t_module and then uses a while loops iterating downward to actually include the modules - so the modules in include x y z would actually be included in the order z y x

771139
ubuntu	linux
i usually prefer linux for programming i program in django on ubuntu

771147
synchronous	.when
synchronous thread aborts are .when the thread aborts itself rather than being aborted by another thread.

771149
virtualbox	vmware
using vmware or virtualbox you could set up a shared folder so both the virtual instance and linux can look at the same file to test the website locally

771152
virtual-machine	virtualbox
use a virtual-machine such as virtualbox

771153
python	perl
even python perl et al can be made to work

771161
linux	bsd
it supports the linux windows os x and bsd operating systems and a large number of major and minor browser including several versions of each

771163
emacs	vim
i will admit my bias i use os x i like linux i use vim i like emacs sometimes

771163
emacs	vim
the definitive text editors for linux are vim and emacs both of which are quite often used from the command-line but both of which have quite wonderful graphical versions

771163
emacs	vim
i personally am a vim man but with a gui that suits my native environment os x i really like emacs well aquamacs especially for perl

771163
emacs	vim
i personally find vim easier to use both as a command line editor and as an ide whereas i never got the feel for emacs as a command line editor

771163
emacs	vim
as a bonus both emacs and vim are readily avaliable for windows and are almost ubiquitous on unix-based platforms

771163
emacs	vim
emacs is open source under the gnu gpl and vim is open source under a charityware license that asks you to feed the children in uganda but that is still very gpl-like

771163
emacs	vim
eclipse is a full-blown ide unlike vim and emacs which have little overhead and allow you to write a quick shell script as easily as a large application and some find that a bit cumbersome for their work but it suits others very well

771163
perl	c++
expect good c and c++ highlighting and possibly good perl and php highlighting

771165
directory	folder
put the appengines_utilities folder in your application directory the directory that contains your app.yaml file

771171
any	set
it doesn t need to be complicated a simple variables which can be set by any thread and is read by another thread periodically will do this isn t really in any language but you should get the idea if you know c

771177
python	java
it s a multi-platform windows linux .. multi language scheme java python c++ ..

771183
ruby	php
you might want also to evaluate some web programming frameworks like zend framework in case you want to program in php or ruby on rails if you decided on ruby

771188
codeigniter	cakephp
moreover you could learn using framework if you have a time be it css framework blueprint 960 etc php framework cakephp codeigniter etc and ajax framework mootools yui ext etc

771206
frame-rate	fps
i am writting a simple game and i want to cap my frame-rate at 60 fps without making the loop eat my cpu

771236
children	tree
when i tried this very reluctantly see below as to why it really fell over there were relationships in my l2s entity pointing to children and then the child pointing back to the parent and obviously when enumerating for building the wcf object it could not traverse the tree infinitely in this fashion and to the best i remember it resulted in an overflow exception-handling so what i am basically saying is beware if you go down this road

771237
debugging	trace
honestly i don t need it because i have the full stack trace and i can look up the invoking query but it definitely speeds up my debugging by having it be the first thing that i see in the error logs

771240
32-bit	64bit
it works fine on 32-bit but apparently it doesn t work on 64bit systems and i don t know why because i do not have access to a 64bit system

771241
wamp	php
i have a wamp installation on my machine and i am developing a php website in that

771244
debugging	trace
edit after comment if your sql query is complex and dynamically generated from previous parts of the code then you could log level trace or debugging these statements before executing them

771244
configuration	logging
in the logging configuration you could enable logs only for the dao s

771246
firefox	opera
use as many browser platforms for testing as you can under linux firefox opera konqueror

771267
getter	setter
so what you might do is on your own custom subclass of exception-handling databaseexception-handling add a triggeringsqlstatement member with a getter and setter and then at the place where you attempt to execute the statement catch the original exception-handling from postgresql create a new databaseexception-handling set the triggeringsqlstatement to be the statement you just executed and call initcause on the databaseexception-handling to set the exception-handling caught from postgresql as the cause of your exception-handling

771272
object-reference	instances
i m getting a object-reference not set to an instances of an object error with the following at the top of the stack in the logs c# asp.net application

771274
32-bit	64bit
first of all there is nothing i know which would be different for batch files on 64bit windows compared to 32-bit

771279
sql-server	oracle
i don t know about oracle but for sql-server this option is probably going to be fastest of all

771288
javascript-framework	dojo
i recommend dojo at the current moment it is the fastest javascript-framework on most browsers

771297
response	timeout
communication with external processes or devices which need immediate response to not run into a timeout

771301
where-clause	sql
now as i said the complicated part is writing the where-clause for each sql statement but that s pretty easy to figure out

771302
wamp	php
i would start with wamp windows apache mysql php installation and teach yourself php and some basic sql

771315
3des	des
update a couple of years later as rasmus faber points out 3des encryption was added to extend the life of des encryption which had widespread adoption

771332
profiling	debugging
this allows you to build a nicer api improves testability and add hooks for debugging logging profiling

771337
value	field
you could then maintain a unique index on name and deleted at with a non-deleted record having a null value in the deleted_at field

771341
python	php
i m setting up a new environment for myself and i m interested in configuring my lighttpd server to support both php and python

771348
triggers	insert
the only possible solution database wide is to add a triggers that checks that the insert updated data is valid

771396
virtual-machine	vmware
i advice using virtual-machines if you have a server at hand or even better multiple servers you could try and install vmware server version 2.0 so that you and other people can use the same virtual-machine for testing

771397
document	element
only one top level element is allowed in an xml document

771401
data-uri	data-url
you can t generally inline data-url s notwithstanding have one scripting produce more than one page component

771422
response	timeout
use timers and signals rather than function response codes to handle that timeout

771425
duplicates	elements
an xml document must have a root elements that is not duplicates

771437
row	col
your row and col attributes are incrementing numbers that define the positioning of the record in the table and they cannot really contains the string n

771437
row	col
every row and col combination is unique

771442
python	java
the virtualbox sdk comes with samples in java python perl

771449
contains	set
each project has it s own main .cpp file - always contains a minimal set of functionality everything else tends to be more or less reusable in src folder

771466
mapping	unique
the mapping should be unique

771479
ado	jet
ado isn t the issue the ace jet engine simply does not support multiple sql statements within a single operation

771486
stderr	stdout
see how do i save or redirect stdout and stderr into different files

771505
put	get
put the names in both places clarity is the reward you get for the task of maintaining the signatures in two places

771535
credentials	security
i m using wshttp probably basichttp in the near future with message security and username client credentials type

771536
selected	button
i made two radio button instead of a selected and put a page reload to the onchange which contains the needed params

771558
32-bit	64bit
hklm software wow6432node is the correct registry key for 32-bit software on a 64bit installation of windows and this code works on my machine

771589
compatibility	platform
well it is a public property get only and the reason could be to maintain compatibility across different platform

771593
any	set
any time user wants to undelete a record you need to set the end_date column to null and if this violates the unique constraint then you show a message user to user that the same name already exists

771605
checkbox	textbox
the added controls all more or less contain a textbox name of the displaying element checkbox active-state of the displaying element and a save-button which fires a method inside this webcontrol

771623
google-chrome	opera
we use a couple of different machine images with ie6 ie7 ie8 ff2 ff3 google-chrome opera safari for windows installed on them

771662
expression-blend	silverlight
have a look at jesse liberty s silverlight video tutorial series which includes a couple of videos on expression-blend

771701
click	mouse
and you can use then ctrl+v on windows or cmd+v on mac os or middle mouse click on linux to paste the text

771721
duplicates	elements
i have a link which duplicates a file upload elements on a form

771721
duplicates	elements
the code which duplicates also append a hyperlink to the duplicated upload elements which is supposed to remove the duplicated elements a simple remove this link

771747
populate	row
we filtering our valuations list used for a specific day but to populate the trade against each of the valuation rows nhibernate fires single row selected on the trades table for around 50k rows in the valuation table

771765
twitter	last.fm
for example try out the flickr twitter or last.fm libraries written by eliot haughin

771776
reflection	runtime
using reflection you could then at runtime extract information from the attributes

771776
attributes	properties
a simple example would be to create an attributes to specify what kind of input-field to use in a html form when displaying an object s properties

771779
contains	elements
oh and my list contains short of 2 thousand elements which stores numbers in strings

771788
webforms	asp.net
i d like to create a wizard in asp.net mvc similar to the wizard control functionality found in asp.net webforms

771793
attributes	properties
attributes are used to mark code with properties which are usually designed to specify behavior during execution

771794
quicksort	heapsort
so this comparer can be used with bubble-sort as well as with quicksort heapsort or any other sort algorithm

771807
python	java
you can use the python uploaders to upload data for your java app

771807
python	java
since multiple major versions can run simultaneously and all versions of an app share the same datastore you can use the python bulk uploader while still running your app in java

771818
versioning	upgrade
you didn t mention your visual-studio versioning but if it s 2005 you might want to consider an upgrade to 2008

771819
textbox	button
the view that must be shown contains following controls 2 textbox 3 labels a button and linkbutton

771825
double	int
the call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties system.math.round double int and system.math.round decimal int

771829
double	int
the problem is that you make an int division results also in an int and a int can be implicitly converted to both double and decimal

771850
comparator	sortedset
if you need both use either a sortedset for data order by comparator or an orderset uniquelist for data order by insertion

771853
virtual-machine	parallels
i m a happy user of codecharge studio but sadly it s the only reason to have a virtual-machine with parallels everybody here use a mac

771857
teamcity	nant
i have a nant build file set up which works fine from the cmd line but not in teamcity

771892
quicksort	heapsort
average asymptotic order of quicksort is o nlogn and it s usually more efficient than heapsort due to smaller constants tighter loops

771897
git-checkout	git-add
i m envisioning an option for git-checkout that works a lot like git-add -p it goes through the file hunk by hunk and asks if you want to keep it or not

771911
oracle	mysql
2.supports all popular databases such as oracle sql server mysql

771911
sql-server	oracle
7.unique cross-different-type-database testing which means target and reference result set can come from two databases even one is sql-server another is oracle

771939
wxwidgets	mfc
why mess with broke never maintained mfc or even win32 when their is wxwidgets and qt4 out there way better than mfc could ever be and you you can even use the free additions of visual-studio 2005+

771946
noclassdeffounderror	classpath
typically if it s a classpath problem you would get a noclassdeffounderror

771951
contains	any
it might be worth checking if your -- long html field -- containss any formatting issues does it contains any apostrophes for example which would be interpreted as prematurely ending the field

771980
player	movie
i have post this question before but cannot get a answer so i post it again.is about the movieplayer sample download from iphone developer site when i press the done button come with the movie player control mode the movie was finish and exit to main view at the same time the movieplaybackdidfinish function have been called however when i play the movie again the player screens keep blinking how to prevent this

771995
handler	service
create i know how to do this correctly in java a dispatcher service which registers handler to the specific event class and use generics typesafe container as in effective-java to dispatch event to handler

771999
where-clause	sql
most of sql queries have no math operation on where-clause

772003
ubuntu	debian
ps yes i know it just works with debian ubuntu distros -

772009
contains	any
a where-clause can contains any expression that uses column names functions or constants as long the expression is a legal predicate

772009
getdate	dateadd
selected date from table where date dateadd d -7 getdate

772009
getdate	dateadd
selected date from table where dateadd d 7 date getdate

772009
getdate	dateadd
ck s correct but it should also be noted that the first can be faster because dateadd d -7 getdate is a constant expression it only needs to be evaluated once no matter the number of rows while dateadd d 7 date in the second needs to be evaluated for each row

772011
account	api
we currently have a website that has user account functionality but we are looking to provide an api to allow users to manage their account perform actions via other devices websites by providing an api for common tasks

772011
access-token	login
if i can sort that out then i would have the login return an access-token

772017
document	editing
the document wq after editing it

772017
output	cat
be to cat the output from aegis

772025
double-quotes	single-quotes
edit regarding your variables name expansion problem change the set of single-quotes enclosing the whole sed substitution expression to double-quotes

772031
vlookup	named
you could define a named for the vlookup part of the formula

772031
highlight	cell
highlight the cell that contains this formula

772031
vlookup	named
in your original formula replace the vlookup parts with the named you just defined

772047
packets	ping
ping measures the round-trip delay the time it takes for network packets to go from the sending hos a to the destination host b and back again

772054
key-value	key
this can be easily implemented with key-value pairs dbm hash dictionary where the key is the word to look up and the value is the stemmed word to replace the original

772058
unmanaged	c++-cli
you have two options you can compile the c++ library as an assembly an expose the unmanaged code with a c++-cli wrapper

772085
configuration	environment
php java and ruby-on-rails all have environment that let you run independent servers and save complex configuration

772089
command-line	cmd
i would like to create a cmd-line mode when i start it with the --nogui cmd line argument then the gui is not presented but a simple cmd-line program is run

772089

since the linking uses subsystem windows the command-line mode doesn t show any of the std cout output unless i link my executable with subsystem console

772094
scrollbar	widget
i have a wxtreectrl widget with scrollbar where i want to drag and drop items on other items

772100
environment	building
if spring doesn t work with your environment i m sure other framework will or at worst you can building a small one yourself but that will take much more time

772102
any	set
is there any better way to do it than by using set foreign_key_checks 0 and three updates in a transaction

772107
getter	setter
i m trying to get all properties from a type but using typedescriptor.getproperties thistype will only supply me with properties that has both setter and a getter

772111
postgresql	mysql
i am contemplating a switch from mysql to postgresql

772111
postgresql	mysql
see also how different is postgresql to mysql

772111
postgresql	mysql
see also migrate from mysql to postgresql

772125
internet-explorer	firefox
this issue exists on internet-explorer and firefox on windows and linux

772138
web-config	app-config
in that case keeping the connection strings in a configuration file works app-config or web-config

772138
web-config	app-config
if you don t mind exposing the entire connection string to the consumers then allow the entire string to live in app-config or web-config

772162
postgresql	mysql
also converting from mysql to postgresql on the postgresql wiki

772170
aggregate	grouping
postgresql will only allow in a selected list columns that are in a grouping by or are aggregate

772170
postgresql	mysql
basically postgresql is pretty strictly ansi mysql isn t

772170
postgresql	mysql
i d strongly suggest getting your mysql to as strict an ansi compliance as possible before converting to postgresql then checking for any warnings when you run your applications

772186
where-clause	sql
depending on your index and table structure that might lead to more efficient sql than or-ing together the clauses in the where-clause or using case statements although it would purely be gaming the optimizer

772196
postgresql	mysql
although bad form in mysql in postgresql an inner join without an on clause can t happen use cross join or the like

772201
.net	wcf
in case you could go only with .net it s better to choose .net 3.5 and wcf framework instead of .net 2.0 remoting the last one is dead and unsupported technology

772202
ruby-on-rails	grails
it runs on the jvm use the groovy language that in many aspects is more close from scripting languages while it s not and the grails architecture will remind you the ruby-on-rails one

772207
ruby-on-rails	grails
you could also checkout groovy grails which is a ruby ruby-on-rails type solution built specifically for the jvm

772211
ruby-on-rails	grails
there is a ruby-on-rails like framework for the java virtual machine actually a port of ruby-on-rails called grails

772211
groovy	java
it does not use java but a ruby-like language called groovy

772211
groovy	java
you are however free to mix groovy and java classes in your grails projects

772214
put	get
you have to put the inotifypropertychanged in the viewmodel to get commandsink to work

772221
any	set
for each element found it would display the all history for all versions of that element without any possibility to refine that set of versions displayed

772225

how do i get countifs to selected all non-blank cells

772226
directory	folder
allow directory browsing in iis and download the root folder

772261
object-reference	instances
- i get a classic object-reference not set to an instances of an object exception-handling

772265
oracle	mysql
mysql has the limit keyword for this ms sql server 2005 and up have the row_number function and oracle has a rownum special column

772300
having	select
a user can select a photo from their library using the image picker - i want to remember this selection and display this picture in future without the user having to pick it

772352
authentication	login
alternatively you may not need any authentication at all if you could redirect to a login when some get request comes in

772352
twitter	tweets
for example any site can link to an url to add a tweets to twitter

772355
ostream	std
i want to define myostream which inherits publicly from std ostream

772360
contains	set
the rendertransform is also set to a transformgroup contains a scaletransform and a translatetransform

772381
oracle	mysql
my application should support multiple databases it should work with ms-sql server mysql and oracle so i would appreciate any hints or links to relevant lecture on how to design a provider independent dal

772392
linux	unix
it s not clear what platform you are operating on but for unix linux you can discover the ip addresses assigned to the interfaces on your system with the ifconfig command you may need to be root to get to this it s often found in the sbin folder on windows ipconfig will get you the same information

772393
lightbox	jquery
if you are using a framework such as mootools or jquery i d suggest a lightbox clone that uses them milkbox or mediabox advanced for for mootools

772400
entity-framework	ado.net
i think ado.net entity-framework available since .net 3.5 sp1 is a great choice as it pretty much abstracts away database-dependent sql with its entity sql language

772401
security	owasp
a good starting point for a web developper would be the open web application security project owasp

772408
contains	any
does the file mapping contains any embedded pointers

772411
buffering	streaming
however derivation from a streaming may not be what you want you may want to derive from a streaming buffering instead and then use this class to instantiate an existing streaming class

772421
methods	extend
extension methods are best used to extend types that you did not create

772438
webforms	asp.net
because asp.net mvc is not webforms so you should stop thinking webformy and start thinking the mvc way

772474
value	field
i also understand that it s possible to do it all through section but i need to create a custom one since key and value field might not be enough for me and i will need to extend them

772495
required	checked
the type of constraint you required is a table-level checked constraint a checked constraint consisting of a subquery which tests not exists or equivalent for the table

772503
average	min
then look at max min and average record size

772521
double	int
if it does the string is converted to int or double

772524
affinity	cpu
the tsc isn t guaranteed to be synchronized on all cpus so if your thread process migrates from one cpu core to another the tsc may appear to warp forwarding or backward in time unless you use thread process affinity to prevent migration

772546
revision	svn
i m planning to change from the label incrementer to the svn label incrementer and then use the svn revision number that way

772550
contains	set
i d like to audit a set of stored-procedures to check that they contains all contains some common code

772559
directory	folder
i just needed to copy the include file to a folder on my hard disk and set visual-studio tools|options|vc++ directory to point to the copied folder

772576
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i think originally i was biased toward webforms because i worked with them from several years but after working on a few asp.net-mvc projects i prefer it

772576
asp.net-mvc	webforms
aside from that i can t think of any situations where i d prefer webforms over asp.net-mvc at this point

772593
ivalueconverter	icommand
you either need to modify your myhyperlink class so that viewmodelcommand is also an icommand or write an ivalueconverter that will find the correct icommand implementation given the command name in your viewmodel

772606
push	pull
i d suggest grabbing a free chat scripting from elsewhere or if you want to roll your own for fun experience then go ahead but start with a db and build a page that will push and pull messages from the server

772614
constructor	object
for example if you want to create an object with a different constructor than the normal tobject.create such as tcomponent.create aowner or a custom overloaded constructor you can get problems because your override is not called and in this case your vectornames variables will be nil

772624
show	next
look up word from dictionary and next to selected text show tooltip with word s translation

772624
hide	show
one of my first ideas was to convert this example into library that i can call from .net application basically my library would contains 2 methods show and hide tooltip

772631
webforms	asp.net
based on my own experience i can tell you that if you don t have any winforms or webforms background you may feel more comfortable under the mvc umbrella because you are not expecting anything from the asp.net webforms world

772631
ruby-on-rails	django
on the other side as a recommendation i encourage you to check out other mvc frameworks like django or ruby-on-rails that are more mature to be water on the mvc way of thinking

772653
silverlight	wpf
i have a silverlight wpf form in which you edit the car entity

772654

in case you are ok with online solutions you could take a look at the latest .net services sdk for windows azure which has queue service bus it relies on wcf messages and supports routing etc

772667
python	java
for the backend i d recommend java or python because they are multithreading and nio-capable

772667
push	pull
if you just want to learn it start with a simple ajax pull app then try to program one using ajax and push

772668
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i would say one very compelling scenario to use asp.net-mvc is if you have a group of experienced .net developers who dont have experience with webforms

772668
asp.net-mvc	webforms
coming from that situation myself very little web experience i found it i was much more productive and comfortable using asp.net-mvc over webforms

772668
asp.net-mvc	webforms
using asp.net-mvc actually allowed me to use my .net and software experience without needing to heavily invest in learning the webforms framework

772668
asp.net-mvc	webforms
imho asp.net-mvc allows you to factor code much better than webforms so i think developers with lots of patterns experience will be more comfortable in asp.net-mvc

772671
value	field
getinstancescount is a static function that returns the value of your integer static field

772674
superclass	subclass
they are inherited from the superclass and since they are not declared private they are visible to the subclass

772694
derived-class	base-class
suppose you ve got a base-class base and a derived-class derived which the author of base has no idea about

772700
c++	lua
also while lua isn t as fast as c or c++ it s pretty quick for an interpreted language

772710
installation	upgrade
i upgrade perl from perl58 to perl588 on suse linux.it looks that even though the config.pm exists for the older version the newer version installation breaks the older version.while the upgrade of perl on other oses like hp and aix does not disturb the older version

772710
versioning	upgrade
i am not sure could this be because now the older links after upgrade is been pointed to newer versioning and just linking is not sufficient and need to modify something more on linux

772711
hide	show
as an alternative since you are simply doing a show or hide option you could just use button which might provide a better user-interface

772715
firefox	safari
also they look much better in firefox and safari than in ie

772729
instances	private
i have a base-class that declares a private non-static reference to the database handler instances dbh

772731
schtasks	cmd
the way i resolved it was to add the v1 switch to the schtasks cmd

factors	primes
edit also note that totient x has a particular structure namely totient x x the product of 1- 1 p where p are the distinct primes factors that divide x

772754
linked-list	arrays
under the hood most hashtables are backed by a large arrays which usually points to another structure such as a linked-list

772760
fopen	fread
ghttp - an http stream wrapper that lets you treat remote http resources as files using functions like fopen fread etc

772774

772876
double	int
i ve created the following structure which maps unique double values to one or more pairs of int

772881
temporary	copy
you can make a copy of your git-repo to a temporary place simply using cp -r as all data is in the repo itself

772885
abstract	extends
one is abstract dao and second is coutsedao which extends abstractdao

772886
web-services	api
no wcf web references are generated by the ide very similarly to references to asmx or other web-services which means that it breaks things down into a method inventory such that the client calling code operates as though it were invoking a remote api

772894
updating	updates
it doesn t prevent me from updating just interrupts updates process so that i have to repeat updates several times before it is complete

772905
callback	methods
for example i have myobj1 and myobj2 that take a callback methods fncallback but for some reason does not set the this context when executing this functions to themselves

children	nodes
perhaps iterate the children of your tag nodes and see what types are there

773061
textbox	button
i am using jquery user-interface dialog to show a dialog box with some asp.net textbox and a button in it

773068
for-loop	loops
i don t know whether it will be faster than the two options you present but it is more standardized than the qt foreach and avoids some of the problems that you may run into with a regular for-loops namely out of bounds indexing and difficulties with translating the loops to a different data structure

773078
double	int
unfortunately much of the data is in strings where it should be int s or double etc.

773078
double	int
i thought i d use an extension to the string class and generic s to pass in the type this is because it could be a double or an int or a long

773092
webforms	asp.net
web ui tier is implemented in asp.net webforms and will be deployed on server a under iis

773113
factory-pattern	singleton
in such case i d use factory-pattern which would create loggers for anyone interested or giving away existing instance if it s singleton

773134
webforms	asp.net
if you have a background as asp.net webforms developer your answer is natural

773152
udp	tcp
udp connections are not like tcp connections

have you looked at the mina project

773193
linux	osx
i m looking for a fast and reliable way to read parse large pdf files in ruby on linux and osx

773236
bufferedimage	graphics2d
using graphics2d and bufferedimage i will have to do this which is neither readable nor easy to write

773259
superclass	inherited
you can use virtual inherited to force the counting base class constructor to be called by every superclass constructor and only that constructor

773271
quicksort	mergesort
see quick sort vs merge sort for a comparison of quicksort and mergesort which are two of the better algorithms in most cases

773277
mergesort	heapsort
if you re looking for something with good worst case performance i d look at mergesort and heapsort since they are o n log n algorithms in all cases

773277
mergesort	heapsort
heapsort is nice if all your data fits in memory while mergesort allows you to do on-disk sorts better but takes more spaces overall

773285
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is usually the fastest but if you want good worst-case time try heapsort or mergesort

773289
event-log	logfile
you can also change the type of the trace listener in the logfile from systemd.diagnostics.consoletracelistener to any other trace listener to log to the systemd s event-log or to trace to a custom application

773290
cpu	irq
so when a peripheral triggers an irq line the pic interrupts the cpu and tells which vector to jump to as if the corresponding int instruction was executed

773293
vb.net	vb6
dos to vb3 vb3 to object oriented design in vb6 and vb6 to vb.net

773293
vb.net	vb6
finally it is straight forward to make a design in vb6 that is ports over to vb.net readily

773307
rollback	commit
i would like one task the database upgrade to begin a transaction and another task the web site upgrade to commit or rollback the same transaction so the web site and db are always in sync

773319
value	field
add a locked bit field to each table and when locking the parent cascade that value

773334
rollback	commit
the two methods defined on idbtransaction are commit and rollback

773352
coff	elf
there are lots of different formats out there coff omf elf the list goes on..

773373
constructor	object
one way to get around the double-counting when counting object in the constructor is to count the object at the point of need rather than in the constructor using rtti

773378
.when	ready
if so maybe you can work around it by playing a different unnoticeable sound earlier so that the speaker is ready to go .when you request the real sound

773379

the windows has a uiscrollview that contains a uitextview which is the title a uibutton which opens a gallery and a uiwebview with the body

773393
rollback	commit
i could create a simple transaction interface with begin commit and rollback methods and pass an implementation to my business layer...but...i m not sure.

773406
boost	stl
my own guess speculation but it makes a lot of sense is that phobos will become analogous to stl a truly standard library of core functionality and tango will become a utility library kind of like boost as more of its core functionality is absorbed into phobos and or druntime

773409
any	set
you ll need to set these up by hand to make your subclass or any instance of nsuserdefaults other than standarduserdefaults work properly

773412
modulus	digits
this will get the modulus of 10 000 which will return the last four digits of the int

773414
boost	stl
my implementation is c++ so any stl or boost would be excellent

773417
aggregate	grouping
instead of doing a min or max on my aggregate grouping i wanted to do a first

773420
repository-pattern	lazy-loading
mapping straight to tables gives your all the awesome stuff like lazy-loading and the repository-pattern

773525
breakpoints	hang
placing a breakpoints there simply show that the line in question is called over and over and never advances beyond it which hang the app

773525
while-loop	loops
stepping in again to advance into the body of the loops simply returns to the while-loops line

773543

cannot contains any of the following characters

773585
button	popup
be sure not to put the button that is supposed to close the popup inside of the updatepanel

that said you could either have those images in a hasharray imagename- alt and get the alt from there or you could put the alt in the value of the radio concatenated to the filename with a separator like | and then parsing them out in the function you use to display the image

773604
pointers	stack
the object on stack will be freed when the function ends so you are returning a pointers to an invalid place in memory

773606
pointers	stack
you re returning a pointers to a local object on stack

773607
selected	checkbox
i create an additional templatefield column with a checkbox control to allow the user to selected a sub set of records from the result set

in wcf you are in the different world about web services and this is the best technology in .net so far to expose services can you see the difference.

773668
communication	messages
with wcf you can use ssl to encrypt the communication to do that in asmx you need to use wse - web-services enhancements and it is quite easy to implements it you can send big files and securely to do that in asmx you need to use mtom - messages transmission optimization mechanism

thickbox	jquery
i am using what i got from the thickbox page - jquery 1.3.2 and thickbox 3.1

773897
put	get
i have a few ideas that may work but thought i d put it up here and perhaps get some better ideas from the php gurus

773905
attributes	properties
unfortunately as far as i know vb uses a very simple properties syntax for interfaces that does not allow you to specify attributes on the get or set

773913
order	add
how do i change what instance it tries to connect to in order to add and use the database

773920
forwarding	port
you will note that to use bittorrent effectively you have to enable port forwarding for nat and unblock port ranges for firewalls

773921
constructor	object
you could just add the object to the constructor of the paintlistener

773931
hashtable	set
there isn t one as far as i know and set by its mathematical nature is meant to be unordered or at least implementationally meant not to guarantee order - in fact its usually implemented as a hashtable so it does mess up order

773934
selected	cell
.screenupdating does ensure the user has to wait before selected their next cell but not quite what i had in mind

773941
any	set
is there any way to control the set statements that linq to sql emits

773951
constructor	object
use inner classes instead of an anonymous inner class and pass the object into the constructor

773962
spaces	output
i am fine with over-allocating spaces if it can save me the trouble of having to annotations my output file with an integer declaring how much spaces the decompressed data should take

773973
diffmerge	winmerge
for another example of external tool diffmerge and winmerge

773977
windows-xp	windows
i heard about a few things though they don t work on all computers not on my windows-xp nor the windows nt at college

773980
installation	environment
2 use a virtualized environment for development need to develop and test a complex set of installation packages

773980
installation	environment
with a virtual environment its much easier to reset back to a base point when the installation go haywire

773981
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox safari google-chrome it works fine but in ie6 7 the browser page jumps down to the top of the form when the dialog box is displayed

first a is restricted in which elements it can contains

774116
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
i like to use argumentexception argumentnullexception and argumentoutofrangeexception

774133
value	field
for example if you have a score field that is only meaningful with value between 1 and 100 then you have no business storing it in an int class whose range is -2 147 483 648 to 2 147 483 647

774165
membership	guid
i ve been looking at implements a custom sql server-based membership provider and one of my problems is that the membershipuserobject is keyed on a guid

774177
constructor	object
how object got deserialized and a instance is created from serialized date without a call to any constructor

774181
static-classes	inherited
but it seems i can t declare inherited for static-classes

774182
constructor	object
it s a backdoor that uses native code to create the object without calling any constructor

774182
value	field
cloning and serialization don t interact well with the use of final fields if you need to set the value of that field to something different than what is returned by clone or the deserialization process

774200
double	int
otherwise you specify what class or primitive you return int double string whatever

774205
static-class	inherited
there seems to be no good reason to inherited a static-class

774205
static-class	inherited
there may be reason to consider mechanisms to bring static-members directly into scope and we will in fact consider this after the orcas product cycle but static-class inherited is not the way to go it is the wrong mechanism to use and works only for static-members that happen to reside in a static-class

774225
abstract	sealed
the main reason that you cannot inherited a static class is that they are abstract and sealed this also prevents any instances of them from being created

774236
selected	textbox
a hack i ve used in the past for textbox is to leave the control enabled but capture the onfocus event and immediately set the focus to some other object on the form preferably a label since it doesn t show as being selected

774245
python	ruby
at the moment though we re not quite sure what changes will actually be requested by sales department and so forth so i m thinking about hosting the dlr and having an iron python or iron ruby script file that contains a lot of the price calculation

something i ve experimented with to some good result is doing the domain model in python and then building a simulator with it instead of implements the final system

774403
authentication	login
login can be created in two ways depending of the configuration of the server using the windows authentication or the sql-server authentication method in wich you need to create them manually

774421
triggers	insert
a triggers only kicks off when one table is updated insert or deleted

774421
triggers	insert
if you havea specific order the tables must be insert you could put the triggers on the last one

774421
triggers	insert
they should always be written to handle multiple row insert updates or deletes or sooner or later your triggers will cause data integrity problems

774426
binary	octal
i have found that this is simple for binary octal and hexadecimal

774426
lookup	any
i was curious if anyone had any clever way to figure out how to generate a generic lookup table for base x - base 2

774426
digits	base
i know that for base 10 you can t just give it one digits at a time so the solution would likely have to lookup a grouping of digitss at a time

774451
.net	wcf
take a look at entity framework as there are a couple oracle providers available for it already in conjunction with .net 3.5 sp1 which enables built-in wcf serialization of your ef generated classes

774453
variables	boolean
at the same time i m calling setneedsdisplaywithrect i m setting a boolean variables in an arrays of boolean so i can keep track of what the current image is and therefore display the opposite

i don t have full control over the server as i am using a hosting company i have a plesk administration for the hosting though

774470
combinations	permutation
in short permutation means that order is relevant ie 12 is different from 21 whereas a combinations means order is irrelevant 12 and 21 are equivalent

774473
contains	elements
for all possible materials as contains in we output one or more elements with attributes class the value of which is determined in two separate cases

774473
spaces	output
then for every such color a separate element is output and its class attributes is produced as the concatenation of the material and the color separated by a spaces

774474
hide	show
i like to hide the splash screen when it auto starts but keep splash screen show if users manually run the app

774483
cross-join	inner-join
as was answered on the mailing list sqlite3 only supports three joins cross-join inner-join and left outer join

774484
defined	declare
when you declare a static member you must also defined it in one compilation unit and only one

774487
decrement	increment
when ever you create a reference to an object an internal counter on that object is increment when you chance the reference or it is no longer in scope the counter on the former target object is decrement

774490
hosts-file	hosts
and how does it compare to writing client application that modifies the local hosts

774516
value	field
in our case we have a search criteria object that consists of a field and a value and several such objects can be added to a list

774528
static-classes	static-class
if you can t inherit static members and if static-classes can contains only static members what good would inheriting a static-class do

774536
value	field
also how are people storing those value in the sql-server - as two field of bigint

774550
value	field
is using a varchar2 2000 byte any less efficient than using char 1 byte if i never put any value longer than one character in the field

774564
decimal	octal
octal abc 8 2 a + 8 1 b + 8 0 c decimal

774564
lookup	any
you ll notice that the multiplication never gets simple so you can t have any lookup tables and do bitshifts and ors no matter how big you grouping them

774583
for-loop	arrays
open up reflector and look at foreach on the list foreach doesn t exist on an arrays but all foreach does is a for-loop over the elements

774585
any	set
if many links exist on the page for the given set of attributes name pairs the link which matches the most left-most attributes s should be returned instead of any others

774586
value	field
try to use #eval instead of if you aren t updating the value of that field

774596
json	xml
it also generates xml and json

774603
any	set
depending on your character set char 1 byte may not be able to store any particular character so there may be difference between varchar2 2000 byte and char 1 byte if we re talking about multi-byte characters

774613
selected	listbox
you could also use a double listbox which handles multi selected by moving items back and forth between two lists

774622
project-management	scrum
one safeguard we used was to contract a very experienced independent scrum master to work for us and handle the software project-management duties on behalf of our team lead architect usability guy

774644

774692
cursor	row
it seems to me i remember that my datagrid was once able to take me to the first row of a sorted column with the text starting with the same letter as a pressed key type k and the cursor would be located at the row with kenny as the contents

774702
put	get
this allows you to authentication not just post and get methods but put head and delete so you have the full complement of rest methods

774705
promise	future
i almost dare to promise it will save you from at least one headache at some point in the future

774706

i have put my code into production and what ever i do i can t seem to get an api key to work

774717
xsd	xml
is there a tool that will take a series of c++ headers and generate a xsd and a class that will serialize the c++ to xml

774742
synchronous	.when
the reason is that .when begin...async is called it gets a thread from the threadpool and typically executes the synchronous versioning of the methods on the worker thread

774764

in the release notes a deprecated interface called mysql_old was added for compatibility with older versioning of mysql-python

774774
selected	cells
i want to selected only the first level of td elements in a table and not the cells of any nested tables

774777
value	field
you will either have to create your own custom field to allow this behaviour or add a choice with the value blank as the default and make the field required

774782
sql-server	oracle
i think identity is not supported by oracle it is a sql-server feature an auto-counting primary key

774788
manifest.mf	ant
you can generate such scripts by right click on the manifest.mf or feature.xml and pde tools - create ant build file

774791

like others on the web i am having issues around needing my wcf implementation to use a different configuration file than that of my hosting application which is a .net 2.0 windows service

774823
hide	show
the only way that i know of is to dispose the ctabitem for the tab you want to hide and then create a new ctabitem when you want to show it

774826
openrowset	oledb
edit again you may want to give the sql openrowset methods a try it will let you insert directly to any oledb provider

774869
parsing	comma
don t be fooled by their names - they can parsing with any separators not just comma

774878
arrays	loops
return this to a record set then simply loops through the record set adding items to an arrays for storage and future use depending on what you need

774898
copy-constructor	constructor
the default constructor or the copy-constructor or none at all because it s not calling new

774898
constructor	object
when i try to define an overriding default constructor that takes 3 fields and sets the fourth to a default value 0 i get errors in the instantiation part of the code not the constructor definition complaining that my object must be initialized by constructor not by ...

774898
constructor	object
so it seems that if i do override the default constructor i can no longer use curly braces to create my new object

774906
reflection	runtime
but you could add some code to the instance constructor or to a static constructor that checks this via reflection at runtime

774923
base-class	inherited
by decoupling your raw database access code from your classes it will reduce duplication and avoid requiring all your data-access classes inherited off a base-class

774958
author	posts
from the perspective of the blog author previewing posts is a great opportunity for ajax

774966
python	ruby
ruby and python can both be

774966
python	java
mostly because you want to take advantage of the huge existing ecosystem of java libraries apis and products which dwarfs anything available for ruby or python especially in the enterprise domain

774970
oracle	mysql
also you re going to want to learn a database technology like mysql ms sql server oracle etc.

774974
coalesce	isnull
then outer-join that to the student table table 1 in your question and take the test score in table 1 where there is no row in the view using isnull or coalesce

774979
scala	java
is it advisable for scala libraries to use the same package naming conventions as java

774981
scala	java
lift one of the larger projects in scala uses the inverted domain name convention which actually makes a lot of sense as scala and java can interoperate it stands to reason you d want to keep things as painless as possible and i really can t think of any worthwhile advantages of doing it any other way

774985
copy-constructor	constructor
it has got a class tracked b that can show us when constructor copy-constructor or destructors copy assignment operators are called

774985
constructor	object
many people believe that object that are member of arrays must have a type that has a default constructor

774989
plugins	add-on
you should not confuse the plugins with the firefox add-on it s the latter that are written in javascript

774995
function-call	inline
but again this is inline in the calling function not a function-call

774999
exception-handling	try-catch
i have the webmethod code wrapped in a try-catch and the exception-handling are logged to the database

this instances of abcresponseinfo goes back with just the error message and all other data-members set to null

775019
required	checked
if checked i need to disable the required field validator and cc validator for the credit card number both on the client and on the postback

775039
getter	setter
those property setter getter should be private anyway

775066
hide	show
do you have a methods that hide everything except the background do the thing that make the page shift and show everything now at the right place

775094
controller	routes
this will give you routes like admin controller action users controller action etc

775094
controllers	routes
without custom routes or some other shenanigans actions are mapped to controllers by the url

775096
testng	junit
junit 4 doesnt seem to support the description attribute for the test annotation like testng does

775106
postgresql	oracle
should i use for a web application postgresql or oracle xe and why

775115
controller	routes
second i could possibly build custom routes and controller methods that allow me to access the previous url

775117
oracle-xe	oracle
well with oracle-xe if you hit the limits you have to either buy oracle or migrate your entire application to a different database

775121
postgresql	mysql
if those limitations aren t an issue for you and you like the oracle approach then give it a shot otherwise consider an opensource server like postgresql or mysql which have none of the aforementioned limitations

775121
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql will allow you to scale your application without any cost other than hardware obviously

775127
buddypress	elgg
buddypress seems a little eaiser to develop for when it comes to db than elgg

775142
value	field
as a note to your particular case the struct has grown from 3 to 4 elements the field not present in the initialization list between the curly-braces will be value initialized which in particular for scalar types is equivalent to zero initialization which is itself the same as assigning 0

775142
value	field
if you use the syntax above you are asking the compiler to initialize the given field with the provided value

775142
value	field
any extra field in the aggregate shall be value initialized

775145
controller	routes
you can still create a misc controller which receives any random url you just need to define some custom routes

775146
textbox	button
i add a context menu property to shapes and when user clicks to properties in the context menu a new windows opens that has a textbox and a button

775146
textbox	button
what i want is when user enters a text into textbox in the property windows and clicks ok button the textblock on the shape changes to the text that user entered

edit2 the above fnh mapping generates hbm with bag not a set - i edited it

775147
fflush	gets
the session gets fflush and closed at endrequest

775148
scala	java
scala basically inherits most of java s conventions in almost everything

775148

for example scala getter and setter are actually done in the following way

775158
processor	cpu
threads allow you to utilize multiple processor or cores in a cpu so they offer tremendous speedups when used properly on specific machines

775162
directory	folder

775257
postgresql	mysql
if it s windows i d go with oracle or mysql as i have heard only bad things about running postgresql on windows machines

775257
postgresql	oracle
if you are not prepared to eventually spend money on oracle better go with postgresql -- safe option

775263
value	field
the proc takes in the field name being updated and the new value sets a bunch of declared variables does a bunch of validation and creates a dynamic sql statement to do the update

775268
lighttpd	apache
if the public facing apache is left only to serve static content then consider replacing it with something lightweight such as nginx or lighttpd

contains	any
i m referring to any controllers that is contains in the library windows in interface builder.

775313
configuration	environment
it is typical of any udp tcp or configuration attribute work in any language or environment

775313
.net	wcf
completely agree wcf is way too bloated and much slower in comparison to .net remoting which is slower than managed socket code which is again much slower than native iocp code to hand rolled code

775314
cursor	row
no rs.last will actually send the cursor to the last row in the resultset which is definitely not what you want to do

775316
postgresql	oracle
you haven t provided much information but unless you re already an oracle expert i see no reason to choose oracle xe over postgresql

775331
deployment	install
in addition if deployment is an issue then writing a windows service with an install gives you much greater control of the installation process

775339
ironpython	ironruby
the lastest release 0.9 stable of the dynamic language runtime containss ironpython and ironruby but it doesn t contains managed jscript

775355
shutdown	restart
generally though since the program is running without direct human intervention we usually designed it to run as a service -- the service control manager takes care of startup and shutdown can restart the application when it fails and does a lot of good stuff that is difficult to do on your own when writing a desktop application

lookup	any
to optimize this you could build a lookup table at each of time t store the stores that are open at t and the store openings closings between t and t+1 for any grouping of t

775365
command-line	cmd
i am currently working on a cmd-line executable application where i have a cmd to set permissions for pre-defined users but i would also like to be able to add an option to append a custom user s to add to the default permission along with our predefined default users list

775365
binary	hex
i was able to decode the hex portion in python but i am left with some sort of binary data which i don t have a clue what to do with as i don t even know what kind of encoding was used in the first place to know what to use to decode it

775365
windows-xp	windows
i guess it would also be useful to mention that this application is primarily used on windows-xp professional and most windows server versions so i am not worried if any possible solution will not be compatible with earlier windows os version s

775370
selected	checkbox
encode the id of the product that is selected into the name of the checkbox

775383
pointers	stack
as others have noted this will result in a pointers being stored which will point to stack

775383
pointers	stack
edit removed note that your compiler should have warned you about taking the address of a stack allocated object newnode . your compiler will warn you if you attempt to return a reference to a stack object but not if you just attempt to take a pointers

775385
latex	tex
basically i extract the latex code from each wiki section and put it into a .tex file whose filename is an md5sum of the latex so if the same code is used again the same tex and therefore the same image will be used

775385
latex	tex
the tex file is then latex compiled by a cron task every minute to produce first a .ps then with the convert program a .png named again with the original md5

775398
unsigned	short
if it is 16-bit use unsigned short

775442
buildpath	libs
i know how to include external libs set up my buildpath etc

775458
http	ssl
so there s no problem with passenger handling http or ssl

775462
order	add
you re changing the templates view in order to add the javascript so i don t really see any advantage to sending the browser the wrong feed address and then using javascript of all things to correct the address

775463
duplicates	elements
the first one shows the arrays as it s supposed to and the second one has the same count but it s fourth elements is a duplicates from the last one

775493
margins	padding
you can then use padding and margins to pad the text and put a margins around its containers

775510
value	field
how do i write the query to allow null value into the lastnote field

775514
inlining	inline
however f# supports inlining which allows functions to be more generic because they are inline into each callsite

775519
value	field
the field value in the second example though is declared at a module level

775575
getter	setter
as these are property getter and setter using get and set are appropriate

775576
perl	php
python php ruby erlang perl

775580
ubuntu	debian
i m looking for a way to interact with the gnu libparted library from python but so far what i ve found a gsoc project from 2005 and an ubuntu debian package that s been dropped from the archive have been disheartening

775585
json	xml
if former it s possible to use base64 encoding with json or xml too

775596
click	mouse
just make sure you always get the handle of the windows immediatly under where you want to click using windowsfrompoint and convert the mouse coordinates from screen to client coords using screentoclient

775599
expression	evaluation
i found this article about creating a function for evaluation regular expression on tsql internally uses vbscript check it out here

775607
tuples	any
on the off chance a user of the collection wants to sort on a tuples instead of numbers or strings or dates or any other obvious thing it might make sense to just require some extra cruft

775612
response	timeout
there is no timeout setting on the response but if you re consistently getting sent data then it should be fine

775625
datamatrix	barcode
i am attempting to generate datamatrix barcode from within itext

775634
logging	trace
if you cannot find anything obvious you should move to doing a network trace or using http logging depending on which is easier for you

775646
getter	setter
property getter and setter don t have names starting with get and set because it s some convention reserved for naming getter and setter

775674
contains	any
i m in the process of writing a python scripting and i want to find out information about a file such as for example a mime-type or any useful depiction of what a file contains

775675
average	minimum
but to make it more accessible to the average person who isn t used to bothering with markup of any type then the most basic solution may be best so there is absolutely minimum difference between what they see as they type it in and what it turns out to be on the site

775688
denied	temp
c users malcolm document temp myproject.domain.ingredient.hbm.xml is denied

775690
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms + asp.net ajax versus asp.net mvc and ajax framework freedom

775690
webforms	asp.net
should i pursue asp.net webforms or asp.net mvc

775690
webforms	asp.net
how long would it take to get a whole team of developers comfortable if not enamored with webforms to become well versed in asp.net mvc

775693
32-bit	64bit
also if you re writing a value that s larger than the native word size 32-bit on an x32 processor the writes are not atomic - so the high 32-bit of a 64bit write will hit the bus at a different time from the low 32-bit of the write

775703
windows	ms-dos
so i m kinda into ms-dos and such again but i came to ask myself how can i minimize a dos windows

775711

don t reference the parent process in any way and set most things to null

775713
expression-blend	silverlight
i ve been using silverlight 3 and expression-blend 3 since the day they became available about a month now and haven t had any real issues

775715
selected	checkbox
whenever a checkbox was clicked add another class to it to denote it was physically selected

775715
selected	checkbox
now when a user clicks on the selected all checkbox let s call it selectedall on top iterate through all the checkbox and toggle the status while checking the checked class

775717
latitude-longitude	location
that way if the user enters an address that can t be geocoded then you can ask them to re-enter the address or perhaps let them selected the location on a google map and get the latitude-longitude from that

775719
queue	fifo
the main question is if this low-level sharing is really needed - i am not an expert on linux but i would consider to use for instance a fifo queue for the master shared memory segment so that the os does the locking work for you

775730
value	field
if you use the nil value constructor then there are no field

775730
value	field
if you use the cons value constructor there are 2 field which must be provided

775730
value	field
if you use the nil value constructor then there are no field

775730
value	field
if you use the cons value constructor there are 2 field

775730
value	field
so that means this line says the cons value constructor has 2 field one of type a and the other of type list-of-a .

775730
value	field
however it also determines that the value of the first field of the cons is 0

775730
value	field
yet it determines nothing about the value of the second field .

775730
value	field
so my question is why does a in the first field mean the type of this field is a and the value of this field is a while a in the second field means only the type of this field is list of a

775730
value	field
in the snippet cons a list a we are saying that the cons value constructor has two fields and that the first field is of type a and that the second field is of type list of a

775730
value	field
this explicitly tells the cons value constructor to use 0 for the value of the first field and to use nil as the value for the second field

775739
put	get
my strong belief therefore is that i need additional fu to parsing my eval statement to get the same time i put into the field

775750
python	java
if however you are hiring someone who knows java php and has some experience with python then this indicates they have a good range of programming experience already and it s much more likely their skills will transfer easily to asp.net

775766
value	field
if you use the cons value constructor there are 2 field which must be provided

775766
value	field
and it also means the first field has the same value as the value they passed in for a

775766
double	int
it also occurs to me that the instance of list in the specification of cons is also confusing you be really careful when parsing that whereas cons is specifying a constructor which is basically a pattern that haskell is going to wrap the data into list a looks like a constructor but is actually simply a type like int or double

775766
value	field
so my question is why does a in the first field mean the type of this field is a and the value of this field is a while a in the second field means only the type of this field is list of a

775771
hide	show
the same way you could also maximize or hide show your windows

775772
callback	methods
the success methods is a callback that happens after your call is complete just create your treeview inside that methods or break it out into a seperate fumction if you need to for clarity

775779
jmonkeyengine	java-3d
some of the higher-level apis jmonkeyengine and java-3d have sophisticated apis built in for handling this sort of thing

775781
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i ve just dove into asp.net-mvc from a webforms background

775782
value	field
the first field of a cons is a value of type a

775786
filesystems	fat
but otherwise the most common filesystems windows ntfs fat linux extjs 2 3 mac os x do not store any metadata or other information about files

775789
asp.net-mvc	webforms
if you feel you can be successful with webforms why change to asp.net-mvc

775789
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i m not pitching webforms over asp.net-mvc by any means but as an architect you need to be able to come back very strong to the question of why you decided to go away from a very well-known quantity to a relatively new one

775791
haskell	lisp
i m definitely not there yet but so far learning haskell has been much more enlightening than say lisp was in college

775797

775884
ruby-on-rails	django
are there any good ruby-on-rails tutorials that explain things in terms someone used to django would understand ie is there a polls tutorial for ruby-on-rails

775887
credentials	account
i am using windows authentication in my asp.net-mvc application and i am prompted to enter credentials on my webserver which is a domain member i have domain credentials and can authenticate fine however when my controller action calls user.identity.name in an attempt to check a database value against the currently logged in user this is returning the sam account from the local machine and not the sam account from the domain

775891
value	field
on my view i have one field that captures the title and another field that captures the content value

775906
execute	prepare
you prepare a statement such as an insert and then execute it with just the relevant parameters

775907
arrays	loops
technical background foreach requires an arrays therefore reading in the whole file at once while the expression in the while loops is scalar context and is only checked for false values like the one eof produces

775962
postgresql	mysql
this will reduce the risk of conflicting configs and also increase the flexibility of running a custom set of vms oracle + mysql + postgresql and not the others etc.

775965
checkbox	textbox
does anybody know why could some html form controls be rendered using system.web.mvc.htmlhelper hidden checkbox password textbox and some couldn t and should be explicitly written in html file submit

775991
click	mouse
everything is an extra mouse click away

775999

along with the folder hierarchy into my working directory

776000
wordpress-plugin	wordpress
if you are using wordpress you can use latex for wordpress-plugin

776004
derived-class	base-class
the problem is when i manipulate with pointers to derived-class objects through pointers to base-class objects the set of methods i can call is restricted by basebankaccount public interface - no matter what type the real object is

776005
subclassing	inherited
they occur when a persistent class is inherited by two or more subclassing

776011

776021
xsd	xml
i am starting from an xsd file and i want to create the java classes and in run time load xml file that has a list nodes

776027
derived-class	base-class
if the case is the latter then you have to ask yourself why you would want to handle specific subtyping differently and whether you could change the implementation of the base-class to somehow invoke the relevant stuff in the derived-class via a derived methods

776030
development-environment	publishing
i want to start working on creating some basic rdf document and publishing them to get a feel how it works.i found a lot of information about the concepts vocabulary etc but i couldn t find any thing related to development as what is the development-environment required what are the tool required

776040
subclassing	base-class
if you want to call methods of subclassing of basebankaccount you would typically need to add those methods as virtual to the basebankaccount base-class

776043
tiff	bmp
the exception-handling to this rule would be uncompressed image formats like uncompressed bmp or uncompressed tiff but i doubt you re using that

776054
php-extension	imagick
magickwand for php a native php-extension to the imagick magickwand api

776054
php-extension	imagick
imagick is a native php-extension to create and modify images using the imagemagick api

776057
any	set
things that set haskell apart from almost any other even-semi-mainstream language

776058
embedded-resource	resx
if one is very keen keeping xml content as embedded-resource you can create xml file and keep it as file resource inside resx

776064
tuples	set
you can t create a set with invalid members--that would create invalid tuples and nothing would work properly

776071
shell	bash
i noticed that the bash shell can suggest command line switches for your command

776075
put	get
we get paid a lot of money to put them in the right order and make magic happen

776086
derived-class	base-class
a solution to accessing more derived-class features from a base-class is the visitor pattern

776086
pure-virtual	base-class
you define a pure-virtual methods acceptvisitor in your base-class which takes an object of type ivisitor as a parameter

776102
bibtex	latex
however i d like to learn some more advanced features of latex such as editing or even creating my own class files and bibtex styles

776118
rdfs	owl
start with this you ll then later learn rdfs owl the ontology stuff

776133
versioning	upgrade
if that s not an option then you have to go with the oldest versioning otherwise if you upgrade and don t maintain backwards compatability you ll break existing clients

776148
constructor	object
crebarinfo and crebarbandinfo are programmer-friendly c++ versions of the c structs rebarinfo and rebarbandinfo with constructor that initialize the object to all zeroes before setting the cbsize member appropriately

776158
3-tier	n-tier
i don t have the impression the link you mention is telling something about 3-tier or n-tier

776162
callback	methods
i now have to alphabetically sort an asp.net treeview and i m surprised i cannot find any similar property or callback methods

776165
subclassing	superclass
where ichild is the interface for subclassing of superclass

776174
pointers	stack
i know what it does in the technical sense i ve been programming assembly before so it manipulates stack pointers

776180
swing	awt
i m using swing components to make the gui but when i looked for the way of making the canvas i only found the class canvas from awt

776180
swing	awt
i have read that using the class canvas from awt with a gui made with swing won t work correctly is that true

776182
constructor	object
first a genome object is created then a reference to it is passed to population class constructor which creates its own vector of genomes based on passed one

entity-framework	ado.net
how to map stored procedures using the ado.net entity-framework

776197
drawimage	draw
by using the drawimage methods of the graphics object other image s can be draw onto image s

776197
swing	awt
as for the question on awt and swing yes it is true that you do not want to mix components from the awt and swing as they differ in the way they render gui components

776197
swing	awt
awt is based on heavyweight components meaning they native windows for painting the gui while swing is based on lightweight components meaning the gui is drawn by java itself without using native components

776197
swing	awt
a good guide on the difference of awt and swing is provided in painting in awt and swing article from sun

776223
put	get
now what i know so far is that i have to use a dependencyproperty to get the value from the usercontrol and then put it inside a public string

776255
attributes	properties
afaik unity does support properties injection but it requires you to put attributes onto the properties

776265
parentheses	operators
in essence it supports all the standard stuff boolean operators parentheses a few functions etc. but the syntax for writing it is quite verbose and uncomfortable for everyday use

776289
ironpython	ironruby
the dlr may be the complement for this since it can dynamically generate execute code from abstract syntax tree it s used for ironpython and ironruby

776291
javacc	bison
bison or javacc or the like will generate a parsing from a grammar

776326
having	select
i would think the input controls input select are wrapped in html helpers so they can maintain their own state via tempdata without the user having to write a lot of code to achieve that

776326
input-field	textbox
and here s one that i use that wraps that label helper and a textbox to produce a uniform text input-field complete with label

776334
selected	button
this occurs when i click the configure button and attempt to reconfigure a specific selected check rule on the user-interface

776347
rar	zip
if the file is an exe check whether it s a sfx and if it s a zip rar or 7z sfx check the embedded archive

776384
ip-address	hostname
instead of localhost use the ip-address or the hostname of the machine which is running the server

776399
linux	unix
the faq also says the software that provides this service is open source and can be downloaded and installed on your own web-server or desktop machine unix linux only at present . since you can definitely get tex python and dvipng for windows you just need to replace whatever unix infrastructure mathtran is using with similar windows parts

776399
windows-server	windows
most likely the developers of mathtran just haven t had the need to use a windows-server themselves and the wording at present suggests that they would likely accept a patch to make it work on windows too

776408
contains	any
you should first check that this superglobal contains any data

776413
value	field
if this wouldn t work you need to tell me more about the reason why you need to know the previous value of this field

776431
mbunit	nmock
we use visual assist x for refactoring support acceptable mbunit gallio for unit-testing the managed classes and nmock or rhinomocks for our mocking framework

776467
telnet	tcp
you can also test your tcp connection i m assuming you re using tcp by telnet n from the client to the server

776476
procedure	records
create a methods that calls the stored procedure and returns multiple records refer to blog post above

776479
order	join
an example of the data with only the join selected customerid orderid deptid from customer left outer join order on customer . customerid order . customerid will return this

776487
value	field
that default-value can be increment or random but as it is only a default-value you can append any long-integer value to the field as long as it doesn t violate the index.

776487
keyword	term
the identity keyword is creates an autonumber for want of a better term with an increment algorithm to generate value

776487
default-value	default
something i do not know is whether there exists a special default-value equivalent to genuniqueid and genguid to create an auto-increment column using default and without using the identity keyword or its synonyms

776501
getter	setter
there are ides that support code-generation of getter and setter methods

776510
if-statement	while-loop
i m not sure if it s because of my overuse of strlen but for some reason while the program is running within the first while-loop none of the characters are actually converted to code none of the if-statement are actually run

776513
any	set
where any string that contains commas will be bounded by double quotes - things could potentially get interesting if you ve got commas inside quoted strings so you may have to set limits to how clever you want to be what the provided data can contain

776513
concatenation	comma
for the second case you have to do more work - either a split the line on each comma and then process through the results stitching adjacent items back together where an item starts with a double quote but doesn t end with one you concatenation fields - not forgetting to include the comma - til you find the corresponding item that ends with a but doesn t start with one or b loop through the string at each iteration you pull the first item from the list if it starts with then you re looking for to end it otherwise you re just looking for a comma on its own and allowing in both instances for the boundary case of the delimeter not being found because you re looking at the last column

776523
16-bit	x86
current x86 compilers still use an extra instruction to mask a variables count for 8 and 16-bit rotates probably for the same reason they don t avoid the and on arm

776523
clang	icc
icc but clang doesn t seem to provide them anywhere except in msvc compatibility mode with

776523
16-bit	8bit
gcc and icc not clang also provides __rolb __rorb for 8bit rotate left right __rolw __rorw 16-bit __rold __rord 32-bit __rolq __rorq 64-bit only defined for 64-bit targets

776523
64bit	x86
for narrow rotates the implementation uses __builtin_ia32_rolhi or ...qi but the 32 and 64bit rotates are defined using shift or with no protection against ub because the code in ia32intrin.h only has to work on gcc for x86

776523
32-bit	x86
the old version of this answer suggested msvc-specific inline-assembly which only works for 32-bit x86 code or for a c version

776523
compile-time-constant	constants
a carefully-written gnu c inline-asm rotate would allow the count to be an immediate operand for compile-time-constants shift counts but it still couldn t optimize away entirely if the value to be shifted is also a compile-time constants after inlining

776529
post-increment	pre-increment
the post-increment ps++ and the pre-increment ++ps have different associativity in c

776531
contains	elements
temp_gridtypetable and column numbers are data not structure they should not be contains in the elements names

776549
pointers	stack
since ps is just after s on stack i believe the pointers will most likely be pointing to itself although this i m not sure of and is not important

776554
contains	set
i have got to the point where i have my data set which contains all the data i need and is a mixture of the 3 row types i mentioned above

776584
duplicates	contains
if a contains duplicates too simply use distinct as in the op

776605
persistence	hibernate
if i require a hibernate session or a persistence manager i just declare that

776609
procedure	records
which of the call records are the ones that should remain after the procedure

776613
versioning	upgrade
we also use release branches and we do ocassionally check things into them usually critical bugfixes for customers who cannot upgrade to the latest versioning immediately

776633
json	xml
on the face of it xml would be perfect for this job or possibly json

776633
.when	ready
the fly in the ointment is that i need the format to be incremental program a append data to the file from time to time then program b slurps the whole lot .when it is ready

776633
json	xml
from what i ve read neither xml nor json can do this because they both require exactly one top-level element in a file

776633
csv	xml
i need structure of the kind xml provides and csv doesn t

776656
pixels	line
comes out at about 3 pixels short per line

776659
json	xml
in this case both xml and json are fine since there s a distinct point where a is working and b doesn t start consuming the file until it is processed as opposed to something like an always-open stream that continually feeds data

776676
spring	guice
of course there other alternatives guice for example but i would say that spring is now an industry standard

776685
value	field
if an accept header field is present and if the server cannot send a response which is acceptable according to the combined accept field value then the server should send a 406 not acceptable response. -- rfc2616 section 14.1

776690
icollection	ienumerable
this is sometimes confusing to people especially if you have something modifiable like an icollection returned rather than an ienumerable

776692
iframe	popup
i d say you can run this code inside an iframe or you can open a popup for triggering the file download

776713
value	field
it is the center of a volumetric light intensity field of scalar intensity value

776736
webserver	upload
to pre-compile the website from a command line i do the following however i do this on the webserver rather than before upload it

776756
output	mode
output in release mode

776762
division	modulo
the modulo operators is the compliment to the div operators and returns the remainder of a division of two whole numbers

776770
apache-mina	mina
i would suggest to take a look at the mina framework for network communication

776779
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
instead of datainputstream you can use objectoutputstream to write and objectinputstream to read

776787
hibernate	liquibase
liquibase is a perfect alternative to hibernate s hbm2ddl_auto property if you are using xml-mapping

776796
subclassing	superclass
return value are no problem as long as they are more specialized in subclassing than in superclass

776801
alpha	rgba
packing order is rgba in memory the offset is 3 to the alpha byte from the start of the pixels

776816
default	reset
the only consideration is to have some way to reset the windows to the default windows standard size menu item for novice users who accidentally resize or reposition the windows to something bizarre and donâ t know how to get it back

776818
actionscript	mxml
now when you create thelist either in actionscript or in the initialize event handler of your mxml component make a new yourcustomeventdispatcher give to it a reference to thelist and add it to itemrenderer

776820
directory	folder
how do i add new views to the site adding in a new folder to the application views scripting directory seems to do nothing

776850
codeigniter	cakephp
here is codeigniter s and cakephp s for starters

attributes	properties
check the aggregationusage cube dimension attributes properties

776915
entity-framework	ado.net
is this something that ado.net entity-framework can do

776922
constructor	object
you ll need to specify the type of the object datetime in this case and the parameter s to pass to its constructor

776922
constructor	object
if you want the generated declaration to use the value that was returned from your datetime method then that value needs to be passed into the datetime object s constructor somehow

776928
javascript	dom
if you are showing 100 records page use json to pass the data from the server as javascript can parse it quickly and then use innerhtml to put the html as the dom is much slower in rendering tables

776939
publishing	release
if you make a release build or publishing the application then you should have a complete set of assemblies your application needs

776939
global-assembly-cache	gac
however it can still rely on assemblies which reside in the gac global-assembly-cache of your machine

776943
credentials	security
in the security area of your local intranet zone make sure that the option to forward your windows credentials is checked i don t believe that it is natively

776950
google-chrome	firefox
for example safari 5.1 firefox 7 google-chrome 20 etc

776952
websphere	ibm
i ve also used the rules engine that comes with ibm websphere process server and found that to be quite good as well although pricey

776961
python	perl
python and perl both have a module called mechanize www mechanize for perl that makes it easy to do browser behavior programmaticly filling out forms handling cookies etc

776961
beautifulsoup	mechanize
so python + beautifulsoup great html xml-parsing + mechanize browser functions super easy fast scraper

776969
union-all	having
try putting a union-all component before your script component and rather than having the columns match up add columns to the output so that each element coming in winds up in a unique column

776976
instances	private
the class has a pointers to some data and i want the instances to exchange the pointerss as part of some private function s algorithm but without compromising the data to everybody else by giving a direct access to it through a public function

776985
constructor	object
the constructor is the first function that is run when the class is instantiated into an object

776990
pascal	delphi
i m new to c# been a pascal lover until i found c# in depth.in delphi there is a try statement that is also implemented in c#

777002
exception-handling	try-catch
try-catch and finally handles exception-handling

777071
sql-server	mysql
if they had spent three months maintaining a small php mysql site then they d be in a much better position skills wise to at least start looking at informix sybase sql-server etc systems

777071
vbscript	perl
more recently i ve had to switch between c# perl and vbscript quite a bit and it just isn t an issue - you follow the rules of each grammar without thinking about it

777090
json	xml
would it be faster and acceptably low in loc to reimplement the storage in xml or json in a simple spec of my own or stick with the simple html route

777092
space	input
so the input space of software vis-a-vis a house is mathematically larger meaning the representational techniques must be correspondingly more computationally powerful

777099
jar	war
now as you said preferred ed way to do it using war or jar file

777104
value	field
httpresponse.redirect will send a 302 response to the client telling it to issue a new request for the value of the location field

777107
multiple-projects	subproject
assuming that your solution consists of multiple-projects the only time this is necessary you need to set up the project dependencies so .when you debugging the main application all the subproject are built-in the correct order

777119
json	xml
storing as xml and json but still using a flat file probably is very comparable in performance

777126
triggers	insert
you could create an audit system via triggers that makes log entires anytime someone does an insert update delete to a table tables on your db server but this doesn t stop a hacker who s gained sa access from just nuking your audit tables or master db

777126
ports	dmz
concentrate on security putting good code in place to prevent sql-injection attacks making sure you use sql login account in your application with only the permissions they need ensuring your database is behind a dmz and not publically accessible proper firewall and port security on the outside to ensure that only your web public facing service ports are open

777142
telnet	ssh
expect over telnet rsh or ssh

777153

as a site-builder i don t need to create graphicsâ i only rearrange the layers hide ones and show others pick colors widths heights and so on

777177
any	set
any property of the ajax methods s first parameter can be set as a default in .ajaxsetup

777179
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i shouldn t be doing webforms inside of asp.net-mvc i completely agree

777179
asp.net-mvc	webforms
edit to further clarify i have a webforms user control on my asp.net-mvc master page which can initiate postbacks

777183
ironpython	ironruby
managed jscript been really hard to find relative to ironpython or ironruby

777193
hosts-file	hosts
given the other answers what if you set up a dummy domain name in your client s hosts to fool internet-explorer in thinking it s not a local address

777193
show	next
next a second dialog would be show which would then work fine

777193
internet-explorer	firefox
so are the prompts the same in internet-explorer and firefox

777198
fireworks	photoshop
i think the more affordable fireworks can also work in my experience however the only reliable way to open the psd as the designer intended was using photoshop

777204
input-field	checkbox
so i switched to assertvalue command which works smooth with input-field and checkbox

777204
value	field
even though test passes with specified dropdown list id as a target and blank field as a value i still can t get rid of a feeling something is wrong

777208
selected	button
i ve put a delete button on my form and i want it to delete the currently selected row when clicked something like this

777208
selected	button
if the user selected that row and then clicks the delete button then it deletes the last data row ie the one above the new row

777208
selected	button
i know users could just selected the row and press the del key but i want to give them a delete button also

777219
windows-xp	windows
i ran test.exe on vista x64 my main dev machine windows-xp sp3 x86 virtual machine windows server 2008 x64 virtual machine and it works everywhere

777227
ip-address	proxy
otherwise they re going to have to choose a proxy that doesn t change their ip-address so frequently

777231
asp.net-mvc	webforms
the asp.net-mvc framework doesn t support the classic postback and viewstate used in the webforms

777231
.when	ready
.when the new site is ready put it in production

777261
required	checked
but it required too much typing isn t easy on the eyes and causes the conditional to be always checked yes the compiler may optimize the check away but still

777262
scaletransform	panning
in response to this question about zooming and panning in wpf i made the suggestion to use a scaletransform and updates the rendertransform origin in the mousemove event

777264
perl	php
it supports a bunch of dynamic languages javascript perl php python etc and has vi and emacs key-bindings

777280
scp	ssh
ability to transfer code to server via sftp ssh scp

777301
frame	width
my uiimageview s frame is 300 wide and filled with an image that is exactly 300px width

777302
contains	any
i know about the cdata trick but i can t use that if the inner xml document itself contains a cdata segment and i need to be able to embed any valid xml document

777321
selected	cells
i am using a uitableview to display a list of cells when the user selected a cell then a new view appears by using the following code

777321
selected	cell
by using the code above the view is displayed correctly but when i return back to the root table view then the cell is still selected

777337
hash	md5
if your only purpose is to be able to validate the contents of your business transaction log table you could store a hash value md5 or sha in say an xml file on the application server

777360
button	popup
this input-field has a button attached that popup a file-chooser-dialog

777388
json	xml
xml imposes more overheads than json yaml

777406
moss	wss
the official announcement of service pack 2 for wss 3.0 and moss 2007 contains the following text

777421
data-access	ado.net
if you can t understand the basic fundamentals of ado.net and data-access you ll probably screw up

777428
value	field
i would like to set this time field to a value but c# only accepts a datetime type and not just time

777430
web-applications	webserver
it was specifically designed to help deploy web-applications and updates to those web-applications to production iis 6 and 7 webserver and it does a better job of the task than msi windows installer imho

777434
multiplication	polynomials
polynomials multiplication as the operators is not that trivial

777437
keyboard	mouse
machines the result being that once refit is installed the refit menu does correctly get displayed at boot time however is unusable because it receives no keyboard or mouse input no usb drivers loaded

777444
ubuntu	debian
under a debian system i m on ubuntu with apache2 and the deflate module already installed which it is by default you can enable deflate compression in two easy steps

777453
web-testing	selenium
i would suggest to start from an overview automated web-testing with selenium presentation on scribd

777461
getter	setter
setter and getter enables you to add additional abstraction layer and in pure oop you should always access the objects via the interface they are providing to the outside world .

777461
getter	setter
consider this code which will save you in asp.net and which it would not be possible without the level of abstraction provided by the setter and getter

777466
callback	methods
is it possible from within myservice to start several instances of myexe on a different same computer have it do some task and return a true false result to a callback methods in myservice

777480
communication	messages
can someone give me a link to a very reliable asynchronous communication library created using sockets which can simply send text messages from client to server and vice versa

777480
.net	wcf
edit wcf is part of .net 3.5

777481
hide	show
you can hide it and then show it again w o any problems though

777538
interop	tlbimp
i want to create an interop assembly from a type library using the tlbimp tool that is include in the .net sdk

777552
communication	messages
after adding this reference weâ ll be able to create messages to communication with the web service defining the type as a web message and choosing the appropriate schema

777555
stderr	stdout
in this case you could even just use system and check its return-value for being zero while redirecting the stdout and stderr to dev-null

777564
any	set
the database engine because it isn t perfect does not want to go to the trouble of checking the length of all possible rows a query might return to find out how long to set the maximum so it doesn t check any rows - it just takes a default of 30 which is an arbitrary rough guess as it doesn t know better

777575
ip-address	hostname
the problem is that i don t know ahead of time under which hostname the application will be deployed and it is quite likely that it will be deployed in a virtual hosting environment where several hostnames are mapped to the same ip-address

777575
ip-address	hostname
i ve tried using httpservletrequest.getlocalname but that returns the resolved hostname 1 for ip-address on which the request was received usually what is set in the local hosts file and not the hostname from the url that the client specified in the http request

777579
webforms	asp.net
standard asp.net ajax updatepanels etc. should be used in the webforms world not in mvc

777585
configuration	environment
then those files can be kept in your source control configuration management system for each of the environment to which you deploy

777595
pixels	line
this would essentially be a rectangular gradient a black line around the frame fading to white about 10-20 pixels in

777595
gradient	clipping
but for this to work i think i d need to set up a trapezoidal clipping area for each side first so that the gradient would be mitered at the corners

777600
udp	tcp
you will probably have to contact the people there for more information but it basically behaves with tcp reliability but runs over udp

777603
any	set
since it doesn t set any public flags and the onlayoutsuspended methods is internal there doesn t appear to be anyway to find out when the control is suspended

777610
integer	digits
assuming the poster wants to pack a large integer as a binary string not use one byte of storage per digits in the number

777618
postback	ajax
asp.net ajax it s based on the postback server-side mechanism it s mission it s to make more easy to integrate ajax features in a server-side mode

777618
webforms	asp.net
using asp.net webforms asp.net ajax it s the right choiche

777633
thinking-sphinx	sphinx
ferret is buggy i m using sphinx thinking-sphinx plugin

777643
datagrid	listbox
you should probably look into the listbox or datagrid

777644
value	field
a value of type list int if it was constructed with the cons constructor has two field an int and a list int

777668
dictionary	arrays
after your edit the only way i could see of doing it would be to add them to a list arrays dictionary and iterate through that although the principle is the same

777682
webforms	asp.net
use asp.net ajax with webforms and jquery with asp.net mvc

777687
logout	login
flex does offer a way to tell the server to logout and the flex login code could invoke this every time before sending credentials but that seems like an ugly workaround

777696
python	php
also there are other uses like to distinguish between constants and regular variables which you ll see in a lot of languages like php python etc. even though jeff for some reason doesn t like that and it is apparently against the c# code style guidelines

777699
convention	standards
for c# the standards is to use pascalcase as noted here c# naming convention for constants

777707
any	set
i can t think of any reason why you d want to have a set of variables as shown in your question

777715
findcontrol	webforms
assuming we re talking about webforms here there s a findcontrol method you can use

777719
canvas	scale
what i dont get is how to scale a canvas inside the templates

777725
value	field
if the value inserted into the date field by the datepicker calendar is subsequently deleted or if the default date that is in the form on page load is deleted and the form is submitted i get the following error

777739
value	field
who else will you be able to say that a user set the value 0 on purpose or if he didn t set the field

777745
credentials	security
message security - to encrypt your messages client must provide credentials usernameauthentication with server providing servicecertificate for message encryption

777764
boost	stl
general purpose boost loki stl

777767
google-chrome	opera
ie opera safari and google-chrome all support this behavior

777784
internet-explorer	firefox
does anyone know a way to disable or override xml-stylesheet directives provided inside an xml document using internet-explorer or firefox

777804
build-server	publishing
we are setting up some automated builds and have run into some issues with the publishing of click once apps that seem to require additional installs on the build-server

777826
button	slide
just wondering when using the jquery cycle plugin if for the next prev button it can be configured so that clicking the next button would slide right and clicking prev would slide left

777843
selected	button
however i have a situation where i need to selected the button that was previously clicked to effectively do a refresh on the uri

777847
any	set
if you want to set the width to any other value just put the number in the place oof the double.nan

777863
instances	private
so it can access the private member variables of another instances of the same class

777870
data-members	private
an alternative would be to use accessors and private data-members

777879
postback	ajax
for very simple things i wouldn t bother with a regular postback but would use an ajax approach

777883
any	set
nothing is ever equal to null and nothing is ever not equal to greater than or less than null so you have to set nulls to a placeholder value if you want do any bulk comparison

777883
value	field
not recorded value on code field with a fk against a reference table

777884
put	get
they communicate via a duplex wcf channel which when i run from within a single network domain runs fine but when i put the server on a separate network domain i get the following message in the wcf server trace.

777888
attributes	properties
i am trying to access the public field of an attributes that decorates a properties of an object from the dll

777892
gradient	clipping
but for this to work i think i d need to set up a trapezoidal clipping area for each side first so that the gradient would be mitered at the corners

777907
margins	padding
try margins instead of padding

777942
host	dns
configuring the client so it looks up the dns service records instead of the standard hosts and uses the lists of host by priority keeping track of which hosts are up

777980
contains	any
i need to create a regular expression that allows a string to contains any number of

777984
detailsview	gridview
currently i have a detailsview attached to a gridview

777984
detailsview	gridview
when you selected an item from the gridview the details show up in the detailsview duh

777995
contains	elements
a more generic way to solve your sorting problem would be to have the selected attributes of the xls sort elements contains a string which is sortable according to the sort rules that you expect

778038
linux	unix
therefore my suggestion is linux on the server and another unix on your laptop so to have better compatibility

778042
order	add
the problem is that in order to achieve the results i had to include the subsonic source in my solution alter the generation templates for the data objects and add entirely new templates for a super type that could serve paged sorted and filtering strongly typed collections

778046
stderr	stdout
that s like backticks but gives you stdout and stderr separately

778071
binary	hex
this is a bit hacky but you could go via the hex string representation and there to binary with the hex codec

778081
uniq	grep
we use grep cut sort uniq and join at the command-line all the time to do data analysis

778095
background-image	transparency
i have the same effect if i use the form s background-image property and set the panels s backgroundcolor to transparency

778095
bmp	png
i even tried converting it to png jpg and bmp to see if that makes any difference

778119
onmouseover	onclick
the trick is to suppress the onmouseover event and the subscribe to the onclick event

778131
perl-module	dbd
you might also be able to use dbd anydata a perl-module which lets you access text files like a database

778139
binary-search	big-o
even with that ugly big-o notation i think it s a binary-search problem because you have the sorted lists

778161
solaris	sunos
taken from sunos 5.9 aka solaris 9 usr bin false

778164
filtering	sorting
this is more of a subsonic 3 solution but have you seen rob s screencast using subsonic3 t4 and the jquery grid to do pretty much most of what you are asking above paging sorting filtering

778170
worksheet	excel
i ve got an excel 2007 spreadsheet and i d like to write a vba procedure to print particular worksheet by name

778183
postgresql	mysql
which is incorrect - the postgresql databases contain schemas and those are the equivalent of the databases in mysql

778185
groovy	java
would it be correct to say that java and python support templating but not interpolation but groovy does support interpolation

778194
fckeditor	wysiwyg
while you could use a wysiwyg editor like fckeditor there are many lightweight markup languages you could use

778195
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox google-chrome opera and safari so it s an ie bug

778219
unix	bsd
bsd unix has also a pthread_set_name_np call

778229
fadeout	fadein
there is a known bug with ie and the fadein fadeout functions and their effect on text elements

778238
python	ruby
i really like komod for ruby and python development

778262
any	set
i will occasionally clone this repository onto my laptop but the clone does not include any of the aliases i ve set up presumably because the clone does not copy the git configuration file where the aliases are stored

778277
getter	setter
getter and setter methods

778283
updating	updates
we had the same pains with updating schema which requires dropping the publication on all servers performing the updates and then reinitializing replication and hoping for the best

778287
serialization	casting
casting does have a cost associated with it but it is insignificant as compared to the cost of serialization

778292
python	java
google version java python c++ good overall docs

778292
.net	wcf
marc gravell s port good for wcf arguably more idiomatically .net

778295
defined	declare
in the c language and in javascript all references in code must be declare and or defined above where they are referenced because everything referenced must be already known

778311
sql-server	oracle
that ll work at least on sql-server and oracle

778341
web-services	api
is this a web-services api or a jar file that you ve been provided

778350
order	add
so i decided to add a order by clause

778352
pointers	stack
there are some protections against specific types of invasion you would often get a stack overflow rather than go over other material but any time pointers are involved it is quite easy to go over memory or code that you weren t expected to access

778356
space	input
the standard c library is full of functions that blithely assume that input won t overflow the allotted buffer space

778357
keyboard	mouse
the actual behavior of the control is split in two parts where one part is the atl gunk that interfaces with the ole host and the other part is the real meat which just receives callback for windows attach sizing drawing and mouse keyboard events

778357
firefox	gecko
i have downloaded and used the gecko sdk to buser-interfaceld an xpcom component and that seems to work but i can t figure out which interfaces to implement to make the component available as an embedded native user-interface component in firefox

778361
directory	folder
i m looking for the easiest solution to implement a folder browse dialog with checkbox in front of the directory in my c# winforms project

778367
checkbox	button
what i want it to do is that when the checkbox gets checked it deletes the row instead of people having using the remove minus button

778381
methods	extend
you re going to extend the basic query_set methods to include logic similar to this

778396
python	perl
1 records in the database are like python dictionaries or perl hashes

778411
user-controls	treeview
write a new user-controls which wraps the treeview and defers all calls to it but maintains the suspended state

778439
environment	execution
i get this error when execution my code on my laptop and straight from my shared-hosting environment

778454
g++	gcc
mixing gcc and g++ isn t good

778455
checkbox	button
i can add a style for each type by change the targettype to button checkbox etc

778456
attributes	properties
to save typing you can use declarative programming syntax attributes to declare the commitable properties and a main class in middleware can use reflection to extract the values of these commitable properties and prepare a icommitableenumeration implementation from it

778461
functional-programming	imperative-programming
many programmers who were first taught imperative-programming styles find it very difficult to learn functional-programming because it is so different

778461
functional-programming	imperative-programming
i began to wonder if programmers who were taught functional-programming first would find it hard to begin imperative-programming

778461
functional-programming	imperative
so my question is should functional-programming be taught in school before imperative and if so why is it not more common to start with it

778467
version-control	cvs
we migrated our version-control system from cvs to perforce and our java dev team is using the perforce plug-in in eclipse mac

778467
perforce	cvs
is there a way to configure perforce to continue the versioning where cvs left off

778468
return-type	arguments
also i d like to do a similar thing with functions identify the return-type whether they re static and the type and name of all of their arguments

778468
contains	any
the keil compiler seems to produce a .crf file for each source file that s compiled and this appears to contains all of the variables declared in that file but it s a binary format and i can t find any information on how to parsing this file

778472
progress-bar	progress
whenever i set a indeterminate progress-bar in a modal pop-up via popupmanager there is no progress displayed

778476
perl	php
finally small footprint is important as it is intended for an embedded application and high level languages such as perl python php are avoided

778486
functional-programming	imperative
so my question is should functional-programming be taught in school before imperative and if so why is it not more common to start with it

778486
haskell	lisp
others may start with lisp haskell etc

778498
any	set
vwd will now open up any time you have a scripting error or if you set a breakpoint in one of the javascripting files

778508
output	mode
i d like to display the output of getenv hostname somewhere in my mode line

778523
functional-programming	imperative
in any case i don t think functional-programming is that difficult to learn for people coming from imperative languages

778523
haskell	scheme
a lot of people think the reason languages like haskell and scheme haven t gotten wider adoption is because people are ruined from them by imperative programming

778524
value	field
however it also determines that the value of the first field of the cons is 0

778524
value	field
yet it determines nothing about the value of the second field .

778524
value	field
no it determines that the second field s value is nil

778524
value	field
and in cons 1 it the second field s value is it

778531
g++	gcc
you just have to make sure you use g++ not gcc

778547
order	add
in all things you want to learn in the order that such knowledge is required such as learning how to add before learning how to multiply

778568
functional-programming	imperative-programming
functional-programming declarative programming of any kind really on the other hand is a completely separate paradigm that requires a whole new set of considerations performance and otherwise many of which are much easier to visualize if you understand imperative-programming first

778570
perl	php
php is unique among the major languages in that although regexes are specified in the form of string literals like in python java and c# you also have to use regex delimiters like in perl javascript and ruby

778570
double-quotes	single-quotes
be aware too that you can use single-quotes instead of double-quotes to reduce the need to escape characters like double-quotes and backslashes

778579
aggregate	grouping
when you use grouping by any column that you are not groupinging on must have an aggregate clause f.e

778582
panels	grid
use the other panels types such as grid and dockpanels

778602
bison	yacc
if you insist then f lex and yacc bison are the tools likely used by your compiler-writers

778617
contains	sorted
and the function takes care of counting the number of columns determining by searching for id 1 in the table header whether to set the column to sorter false or if it does need to be sorted determine the type of data that is in the column if the column contains dates then add the uslongdate parsing etc

778628
textbox	button
have whatever you want to trigger the change register to some event you have defined with your button textbox page

778630
cursor	row
a cursor over the result set so the function can be called one row at a time

778647
ivalueconverter	icommand
i can work around this with a fairly ugly hack that involves using an ivalueconverter to initializer the icommand i need

778647
ivalueconverter	icommand
the hyperlink binds to the name of the icommand it needs from the alert object and the ivalueconverter swaps the name for a new instances of the icommand itself

778656
restrictions	userid
1 formatting - are there any restrictions on userid like all users below 500 are admins or something of that nature

778705
value	field
personally i try to avoid using stored-procedures as much as i can but for this case i see them as the best option loading all the entities just to increase the value of 2 field seems pretty much an overkill especially if the call is going to be made through ajax

778710
show	next
do the same sort of thing to delete a particular line by using next to skip the lines you don t want to show up in the output

778712
put	get
you can also use the remove tag to get rid of things you don t want or put everything in a location and tell it not to inherit

778720
deep-copy	object
deep-copy object trees

778737
websphere	ibm
disclaimer i am an ibm consultant and specialise in websphere esb

778737
websphere	ibm
ibm certainly markets both websphere message broker and websphere esb as products that make it easy to build an esb along with the datapower hardware appliance

778750
pointers	stack
what you ll want to do instead is to actually reserve space on stack and save a pointers to it

778773
instances	private
if i run it thru fxcop it complains about not declaring visible instances fields and recommends changing it to private and exposing it as a protected property

778775
value	field
for example if you have a percentage field in your anonymous type you may not be able to calculate that until you know the max value or total depending on how you want to define percentage

778782
derived-class	base-class
the state managed by the base-class should be managed by the base-class - never directly modified by any derived-class

778788
contains	elements
now the odd elements of etc contains what was between those boundaries

778790
postback	ajax
what you can do is have the server-side validation logic being run by web services that your client-side validation can call via ajax and also when you postback to your server

778797
stderr	stdout
with system both stdout and stderr will go the same place as the scripting s stdout and stderr unless the system command redirects them

778797
stderr	stdout
to capture a program s stdout but discard its stderr

778797
stderr	stdout
to capture a program s stderr but discard its stdout

778797
stderr	stdout
to capture a program s stderr and let its stdout go to our own stderr

778797
stderr	stdout
to read both a command s stdout and its stderr separately you can redirect them to temp files let the command run then read the temp files

778797
stderr	stdout
you can also use file-descriptor redirection to make stderr a duplicates of stdout

778797
stderr	stdout
note that you cannot simply open stderr to be a dup of stdout in your perl program and avoid calling the shell to do the redirection

778797
stderr	stdout
this fails because the open makes stderr go to where stdout was going at the time of the open

778797
stderr	stdout
the backticks then make stdout go to a string but don t change stderr which still goes to the old stdout

778797
stderr	stdout
to capture a command s stderr and stdout together

778797
stderr	stdout
to capture a command s stdout but discard its stderr

778797
stderr	stdout
to capture a command s stderr but discard its stdout

778797
stderr	stdout
to exchange a command s stdout and stderr in order to capture the stderr but leave its stdout to come out our old stderr

778797
stderr	stdout
to read both a command s stdout and its stderr separately it s easiest to redirect them separately to files and then read from those files when the program is done

778802
defined	declare
is it possible to make a c++ header file .h that declare a class and its public methods but does not defined the private-members in that class

778802
defined	declare
i found a few pages that say you should declare the class and all its members in the header file then defined the methods separately in you cpp file

778802
constructor	object
but that should be fine as long as the compiler is smart enough to use the constructor and just pass around pointers to the location in memory where my object is stored and never let me run sizeof myclass

778802
defined	declare
this wrapper class will be so simple that i might as well just declare it and defined it in the header file

778807
turbogears	django
you ll want some kind of framework i d recommend django or turbogears

778808
textbox	button
i have a simple form on my page with a textbox and button that calls this javascript method

778810
derived-class	base-class
your exposing protected members like this means that changes in your base-class will affect how your derived-classes work in ways that are unpredictable without comparing the code of each base and derived-class

778810
data-members	private
if you really want to expose internal data-members like this wrap private data-members in protected properties as gisresearch suggests

778811
rewrite	rule
in the simplest case a rewrite rule simply redirects every address by adding .php or whatever other file-extension on the end of the url

defined	declare
the rules of forwarding declaration say that you can defined a pointers or a reference to something that has been forwarding declare

778875
derived-class	subclassing
if you re making a derived-class you should probably be implementing ilist t directly rather than subclassing list t anyway

778907
put	get
note that because web browsers generally only support get and post ruby-on-rails uses a hidden-field to turn these into put and delete requests as appropriate

778922

the declarative approach is taught very early on in math class so functional-programming provides some new concepts that declarative-programming does not

778965
python	java
i m looking for a python solution - i forgot that gae also supports java now

778976
value	field
probably your best bet is to have a hidden iframe with the real form that gets submitted and when the user click the button on the visible form some javascript copies the field value to the hidden form and submits it

778983
dialog	pop-up
after switching to ie8 i was able to determine the cause was the ajaxcontrol toolkit s modal pop-up dialog

778991
hash	md5
i m looking for something to do this that is nice and simple as in having a text file with username md5 hash pairs

778995
uiimage	nsdata
the next step is to create an nsdata object using the data and then a new uiimage using it s +initwithdata methods

778996
javascript	dom
do you have any javascript that is manipulating the dom as the case is described at

778996

the java platform enterprise edition differs from the java standard edition platform java se in that it adds libraries which provide functionality to deploy fault-tolerant distributed multi-tier java software based largely on modular components running on an application server

779069
abstract	super
inherited is more to do with inheriting members and or member implementations from parent to child aka base to derived super to sub abstract to concrete class

779075
progress-bar	progress
however it is displaying it using the ugly old-style blue boxes progress bar instead of using the new-style progress-bar which presumably varies depending on the os

779083
integer	zero
matches an optional integer number with possible leading zero

779088

779112
object-reference	instances
object-reference not set to an instances of an object

779138
swing	awt
for examples some schools teach people to build guis using the awt or swing class library that are supplied with java although there are other options

779148
persistence	hibernate
it s quite possible that you ll do server-side java development without ever needing to learn most java ee technologies like enterprise java beans ejb - especially with the rise of alternative lightweight approaches such as favouring pojo s with hibernate for persistence layer

779148
wicket	jsf
you may not even need to know all lower-level servlet and jsp stuff thoroughly as higher-level frameworks such as struts jsf or wicket have become popular

779166
ellipse	angle
finally set the rotatetransform.angle to the angle of intersection of the ellipse major-axis and the x-axis the arctan of the major-axis slope

779172
i2c	spi
acted as communication translators for board-level i o spi - i2c - rs232 - usb

779178
put	get
so sql says yes i have a value for you but it can t put it anywhere so you get an exception-handling

779184
boolean	int
value types are primitives such as int and boolean or structures and can be identified because they inherit from system.valuetype

779184
variables	boolean
boolean variables when declared have a default value

779184
object-reference	instances
which is the same as object-reference not set to an instances of an object

779186
nested-loops	loops
some time ago i asked a question about nested-loops on so and as it was there were queries inside the loops of my example and i got a clear answer

779189
rewrite	rule
i have a .htaccess in my site www folder that has this rewrite rule

779208

following the instructions on how to configure a port with an ssl-certificate in this link i entered this cmd on the cmd-line duh

779230
value	field
i would like to insert a new row into data_tracking anytime data_table is updated and record the old updated value as well as the field changed

779246
webserver	host
before you tell me to just use httpd i already have a java application running on my webserver at host myapp

779256
decrement	increment
i have an aop aspect that already intercepts all backend traffic so i figured i could increment decrement an atomicinteger and throw an exception-handling when there s too few threads left but that gives the problem of determining current thread pool size

779283
swing	awt
is there a functional equivalent to swing or awt in c#

779293
url-rewriting	rewrite
nginx has good handling of url-rewriting look into the rewrite module

779294
compatibility	platform
there is no predefined run anywhere file for c# apps yet like java has with jars though you re best bet is to recompile for each platform if you want to ensure compatibility

779300
value	field
the text field do not have any value

779339
curly-braces	conditional
either way i am a fan of wrapping every such conditional body with curly-braces

silverlight	wpf
wpf on the other hand is is conceptually new library for now it is fully supported mainly on windows only and just a subset of it supported by mono by their silverlight implementation - moonlight

779367
constructor	object
i created a business object plain old class with properties nothing fancy that has an empty constructor and i am using it as a strong type in my view for member create see code

but after that is done the create view is display again and the field that are guid- and datetime-types raise a validation error a value is required - unless they are readonly properties

779371
google-apps	gmail
gmail and several of the other google-apps natively support vi-like motions

779375
attributes	properties
using reflection you can test that the action or controller has the attributes that you expect it to have and that the attributes has certain expected properties values

779407
authentication	logout
to logout then you d simply send in a request to invalidate that guid perform the necessary cleanup on the server and inside your flex app and all should be fine the next user can sit down log in authentication and the process continues

779407
any	set
for example if you send in a urlrequest with a username and password and the server responds with a cookie of any kind each request you make thereafter will package and send the same cookie so in most cases all you need to do is parsing the initial response from the server to set the state of your flex app assume the continued presence of the cookie and when it s time to logout send a urlrequest to logout kill the cookie on the server on status 200 do your flex-app cleanup and so on

779410
data-members	private
the pimpl idiom adds a void private data-members to your class and this is a useful technique if you need something quick dirty

779410
subclassing	base-class
sometimes you might want an abstract base-class and subclassing of that base-class collect pointers to all the different types in a vector and call methods on them

779410
subclassing	base-class
these classes derive ultimately from the abstract base-class you declared in your header file and the factory methods would actually initializer one of these subclassing

779413
shell	bash
for bourne-like shell ksh bash ... try set -o vi to make your command line use vi keys

779416
subclassing	base-class
in object-oriented programming terminology polymorphism refers to the ability of subclassing to change or specialize the behaviour defined in the base-class

779441
checkbox	button
however there are checkbox in my gui and i can t figure out how to deselect these checkbox when the reset button is pressed

779446
python	ruby
are there any web frameworks in python or ruby which follow the fp style

779455
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome don t have any problem with this but for some reason ie seems to be ignoring the session cookie through jquery but the response works fine besides that

779458
postgresql	mysql
linq to mysql oracle and postgresql dblinq

779469
document	element
i m using the system.windows.forms.webbrowser control in a .net 2.0 application and would like to insert a bit of javascript code into the loaded document right before the end of the body element

779480
ref	out
i think the part you are looking for is the in out part and since it s being passed via ref you should be getting the same data back

779493
web-services	api
i am trying to create products using either the v2_soap api and the xml-rpc api web-services

779497
internet-explorer	firefox
i m using firefox for most of my testing but it appears to behave the same way in internet-explorer 7

779499
ref	out
if it were a parameter you could create a managed versioning of the structure using the pinvoke interop assistant then pass it via ref or out

779504
dwarf	elf
a quick scan of keil s web site seems to indicate that they abandoned their proprietary arm compiler in favor of licensing arm s realview compiler which appears to use elf objects with dwarf format debugging info

google-chrome	safari
the strangest thing though is that this error only occurs in google-chrome and safari

779517
firefox	opera
firefox ie and opera all post the form without a problem

779523
constructor	private
just clone it along with some package private stuff from swing then you can do whatever you want like add a flag for cancelability and use it in progressoptionpane s constructor

779541
arguments	default
you could redefine your function with default value for the arguments required like

779542
selected	button
then on your sendemail.php you look at the value of which will be either male or female depending which one of the radio button they had selected

779545
selected	button
you get the value of the selected button with

779547
buildpath	libs
additionally if another jre system libs appears in the buildpath when adding scala nature you can safely remove it to avoid the requiredexecutionenvironment warning.

779551
asp.net-mvc	webforms
given the lack of webforms smoke and mirrors going on in asp.net-mvc you sometimes need a firm control over the dom to do certain things the css selector engine offered by jquery really helps you do this

779551
jquery	.post
in terms of what ms ajax offers you in mvc it can do a lot for you in terms of giving you a quick way to ajaxify forms and links but as far as i m concerned adding 90kb worth of javascript to do that isn t really worth it when the equivalent calls in jquery e.g .get .post element .load are relatively easy to use

779561
value	field
value of the first field of the cons

779561
value	field
the value of the second field .

i m using gedit as my text-editor so how can i get the following to be included in the syntax-highlighting

779580
boost-test	cppunit
i ve used both cppunit and boost-test for c++ unit-testing

779580
boost-test	cppunit
any suggestions for how to best achieve the same thing as cppunit s protectors in boost-test

779580
boost-test	cppunit
i haven t really looked into boost-test s implementation yet but if it s anything like cppunit it must use something very like protectors itself

779585
perl	ruby
both of them are much bigger pitas than using something like perl or ruby

779585
cherokee	lighttpd
there are however several very lightweight http servers like cherokee and lighttpd

779594
ruby	php
makes php ruby etc snails in comparison because with tntnet you are running compiled c c++ code

779621
methods	extend
do they extend override the setauthcookie string bool methods to accept the user object setauthcookie user object bool

779622
javascript-debugger	developer-tools
although ie8 will no longer cause that error to crash the rendering entirely instead logging an error it is unfortunately not caught by the javascript-debugger found in the new developer-tools and the error message doesn t tell you where the error really occurred

779622
button	popup
a workaround which is certainly tedious but could locate the issue is to use ie8 s debugger to put a breakpoint on the very first piece of javascript code that is run and then continue hitting the step button until the error icon popup in the bottom left corner of the browser

779624
windows-server	windows
i want to use the windows eventing 6 api from a c# application to log messages to a specific channel in windows-server 2008 event log

779637
curly-braces	conditional
microsoft c# best practices state to use curly-braces for single line conditional

779639
autocad	cad
what are cad applications rhino autocad of today written in and how are they organized internally

779643
communication	messages
a third idea is to have a central server somehow dispatch instructions to a given slave server to attempt a processing job but i do not know of ways of invoking that kind of communication beyond a very hack-ish approach of having the master server pass a messages via http

779645
put	get
in safari the only way i can get it to not submit is to put onsubmit return false

779661
constructor	object
when constructing an arrays of object in c++ only the default constructor can be used unless you re using the explicit arrays initialization syntax

779665
highlight	selected
i have two div s and when i put div #2 inside of div#1 and then view my page when i put my cursor over div #2 it changes the cursor to the selected highlight cursor

779694
linked-list	tree
as you pointed out the resulting worst case for a tree is worse than o log n and could end up looking simply like a linked-list

779702
google-chrome	firefox
between ie6 7 8 firefox 2 3 google-chrome safari and the other lesser known browsers and versions it sounds like an nightmare to support across the board

779704
desktop-application	web-applications
i have seen it done in flash silverlight web-applications where the user has an expectation of being more like a desktop-application

779707
highlight	cells
for example it makes sense in google spreadsheet - where the right-click acts more like excel and gives you options such as allowing you to copy the highlight range of cells - you would not be able to do this with the regular right-click menu

779710
order	add
ok that being said here is what you need to do in order to use late binding remove the reference to the office 2003 pias and instead add a com import of the interface required by accessibleobjectfromwindow the excel.window interface

779724
click	mouse
also mac users traditionally do not have 2 mouse button and not all mac users know how to right click by using the option click combo or whatever it is these days

779726
linked-list	tree
in fact if you add sorted data to a bst you can quickly degenerate your tree to single linked-list performance which has an insert of o n assuming an insert is at the end

779734
firefox	safari
it is most noticeable in firefox and least noticeable in safari with ie being in the middle

779746
implements	extends
you can achieve this behavior by implements your custom membership provider or extends an existing one

779752
linked-list	tree
the degenerate case for an unbalanced binary tree is a linked-list which has a search time complexity of o n

779754
contains	set
does anybody else have this same problem when you import data from excel file to mssql server 2005 if some column contains mostly numeric data but even if you set the column type to varchar the wizard fails to import those fields that fail to parsing as numbers

779768
xsd	xml
jaxb allows you to convert an xml schema xsd file into a collection of java classes

779795
xsd	xml
it s great if you have a handful of classes you want to serialize and deserialize to xml without the heavy-handed-ness of needing to create a xsd run jaxc to generate classes from that schema etc

779796
webforms	asp.net
despite my experience with asp.net c# and experience with mvc in ror it still took my awhile to match the velocity i had with webforms

779797
dictionary	arrays
right now it reads the whole dictionary file into an arrays and picks n random elements from that arrays

779805
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and safari will pass a field s value even if the field lacks a name while ie firefox and opera do not

779811

779898
constructor	object
how can i pass a arbitrary number of arguments to the class constructor using the object function defined below

779917
denied	root
running mysql command-line prompts me for the root password and upon entering it i get error 1045 access denied etc

779926
instances	private
i d also have a look at javascript the prototype property of your classes - if they re getting large and you re creating multiple instances of them you ll start to see significant performance gains by putting your public and optionally private privileged methods into the class prototype

779930
silverlight	wpf
that s why wpf silverlight was made

779964

on sql-server you can get this type of thing to work if the subquery does select top 1 ... not sure if mysql will also accept it if you add a limit 1 to the subquery

780033
python	java
references are sufficient and that s the way java python and ruby all work

780033
python	java
class objects exist at run-time in java python and ruby and can be manipulated

recvfrom	datagram
if sendto and recvfrom only guarantee that 1 byte will be sent or received at a time and datagram can be received out of order how can any udp protocols remain coherent

780044
udp	tcp
but since you can implement all of tcp with udp it has to be possible

780044
udp	tcp
metaphorically think of udp like sending postcards and tcp like making a phone call

780046
arrays	loops
if you have lots of columns to put together and one or more are very long you could also build an inner loops to do the same thing and use implode to assign the values clause to the outer arrays

780064
.net	wcf
hell wcf alone makes .net the correct enterprise soa choice

780066
sql-server	mysql
also are there any differences between database transactions in sql-server and mysql

780076
sql-server	mysql
re differences between sql-server and mysql i wouldn t know at the lower level - they may well do vastly different things

780091
stderr	stdout
inside that scripting i d ensure that i trapped stdout and stderr to a known or knowable file

780111
printf	scanf
scanf is faster than cin printf is faster than cout etc

780152
directory	folder
once the user has specified the directory i want to be able to delete it so that when i launch the installer it can create the folder itself such that it gets flagged for uninstall

780152
directory	folder
while it does let the user browse for a directory it s not as intuitive as folder browser dialogues that i ve seen in installers in the past

780156
malloc	free
i am wondering if there is a cross-platform allocator that is one step lower than malloc free

780175
interlocked	atomicity
interlocked instructions provide atomicity and inter-processor synchronization

780186
sql-server	mysql
tstamper already provided a link to sql-server vs mysql but if you interested in general transactional behavior check out these links

780220
contains	elements
i have an xml document which contains an elements that is over 90 000 characters in length

780222
ip-address	hostname
you ll need to make sure that both the user account and its granted permissions are set for the appropriate hostname or ip-address you will be connection from

780228
malloc	free
c gives you malloc and free c++ adds new delete and and the placement forms in addition to what c provides

780228
malloc	free
you could implement your own malloc free without worrying about the underlying os

780244
javascript	dom
then within the javascript loop each copy could be customised as needed before being appended into the dom

780251
udp	tcp
unlike tcp this does not mean that the peer closed the connection because with udp there is no connection

780280
hide	show
i don t think you need the show hide since it happens so fast

780316
buffering	streaming
what s the optimal buffering size to use with a streaming from httpwebresponse.getresponsestreaming

780353
buffering	streaming
sure if you use really small buffers you may have to make a few extra calls down through the layers to get the bytes though the streaming is likely doing at least some buffering -- i don t know what it s defaults are

780376
postgresql	mysql
if windowing functions ever get added to mysql they re in release 8.4 of postgresql option 2 might become palatable or even preferable

780380
buffering	streaming
basically you want a buffering large enough so you are not needlessly reading data from the streaming but not so large you diminish returns

780402
any	set
are you trying to find out if a specific set of 60 columns are null or do you just want to find out if any 60 out of the 100 columns are null not necessarily the same 60 for each row

780417
stdio	gets
for example in windows a line ends with r n and this gets translation to a single n by stdio since that is the c convention

780417
fseek	ftell
because of this the c standard only defines fseek in text files in a few cases to the very beginning to the very end to the current positioning and to a previous positioning that has been retrieved with ftell

780427
document	element
- report from disco document is root element is missing.

780428
spaces	output
tabs make things messy use spaces instead since then the output doesn t rely on terminal settings and you don t need to worry about misaligned tabs

780428
spaces	output
line 9 creates a string of the right size for output by adding 50 spaces then cutting off all at the end except for 15

780438
arrays	loops
also as nickf points out it is best not to use the for in loops for iterating over arrays

780444
markup	xhtml
i would like to know the best way to markup scientific names in xhtml

780445
attributes	properties
there are many properties but i want to match the one with name foo and then replace its value attributes with something else as so

780446
tostring	indexof
these include all built-in methodss of objects such as string s indexof methods or object s tostring methods

780448
c++	lua
how do you debugging lua code embedded in a c++ application

780478
postback	ajax
the main idea of the ajax framework is to eliminate full-page postback

780490
web-services	api
it must be open source have a pluggable identity manager eg ldap db openid etc. and provide a decent range of api access options eg web-services rest etc.

780497
constructor	object
so as you can see i am trying to dump contents of a table into an object via passing a datarow to the constructor and then add the object to collection

780498
python	java
he wrote the core engine in java but the program logic in python javascript

780501
stubs	tdd
but for tdd friendly designs consider strategy injection so that slow bits can be removed for testing and replaced with stubs and mocks

780502
mocking	tdd
one answer for the tdd part is learn mocking

780513
administration	integrated
iis7 runs in integrated mode and i do not have access to its administration only via web-config files

780518
c++	lua
then in the lua code make a call to the debugger api in c++ this is debuggerbreak i think - see here

780561
contains	set
answer i settled on the following set up where the designtime namespace contains mocked up versions of the viewmodel for testing and design time support

780564
git-rebase	git-merge
i d recommending using git-rebase instead of git-merge

780599
order	add
however this add an order of magnitude of complexity

780602
order	join
the join command is powerful but requires the data in the two files in sorted order on the joining keys

780602
perl	awk
this is run through tr to make the data all lower case and then formatted with awk which demonstrates its power and simplicity nicely here you could use perl or python instead but frankly that would be messier

780607
hashmap	arrays
i have saved in hash table in this format hashmap key arrays where

780608
constructor	object
when you call sort_by_polar_angle in the sort function you are creating a temporary object of type sort_by_polar_angle its constructor is called

780639
having	select
my database is having mostly select s but very

780639
average	min
but the logswitch is taking place on an average every 5-10 min

780642
bellman-ford	dijkstra
others include dijkstra s and bellman-ford

780655
rollback	commit
you should create the session at the beginning of the business operation create a transaction then perform all the operations you functions within that transaction and commit or rollback them all together

780671
any	set
i m having problems with our mssql database set to any of the turkish collations

780671
any	set
any help would be appreciated even suggestions of other collations that could be used instead of turkish but would support their character set

780676
file-descriptor	pipe
one suggestion has been to create a pipe feed it the string and open the file-descriptor and send to the lexer

780711
python	java
first things first i am a python beginner with a typical c++ java background for object oriented stuff

780727
scala	java
this means for example that reference equality comparison eq in scala and in java gives the same result as normal equality comparison in scala and equals in java abcd eq abcd will return true while abcd eq abcd might not depending on jvm s whims well it should for literals but not for strings created dynamically in general

780727
erlang	lisp
other languages which use symbols are lisp which uses abcd like scala ruby abcd erlang and prolog abcd

780737
configuration	environment
of course you would like to use the standard propertyplaceholderconfigurer mechanisms to externalize configuration that has to be touched by admins or will change through various environment

780737
configuration	environment
for integration tests we usually have additional config files in src main test that get loaded additionally to the normal config files overriding the critical beans that tie the configuration to the environment

780744
constructor	object
you should have one entity dataset and instatiate the entities object using the constructor that takes a connectionstring which you can read in from

780747
contains	elements
if you are using html then you must not represent them with entities as scripting elements are marked as contains cdata

780759
alpha	hsv
alpha is easy but others become time consuming because you have to go off and fine all the right mathematical equations for hsv and hsb and all that fun stuff

780832
contains	lookup
if that vector contains many values and you have no reason to believe that testval appears near the start of the vector then this will be slow -- consider using a container type with faster lookup instead std map or one of the nonstandard but commonly implemented hash_map types

780839
constructor	object
another clear one is the default constructor in c# this does not create a new foo object

780839
ref	out
make sure you understand out and ref parameters

780840
disposable	dispose
the basic rule is when you use an disposable type idispose then you as the programmer should release the resources used by that type as soon as possible by calling dispose when you do not longer need to use that type

780853
ubuntu	debian
current limit is 32768 which is standard for new debian and ubuntu installations

780859
data-members	constructor
if all the nonstatic data-members of the struct have trival constructor your class has a trivial constructor that is going to intialize members to their default values

780872
disposable	dispose
the idisposable interface is used to implements the disposable pattern which helps when you are working with objects that should be dispose in a deterministic way

780888
primitive	int
there are no primitive datatypes even an int is an object

780890
contains	any
the title attributes can contains any arbitrary string in any human language symbols foreign characters smart stuff you name it

780894
shell	bash
shell bash in mine case should set your process as group leader if you run on background

780911
google-chrome	firefox
webkit safari and google-chrome but firefox and opera have plans to implement similar in upcoming releases

780918
required	checked
avoid serialization objects serialization is required to checked for changes

780920
windows-xp	windows
i need a code snippet for reading the mainboard uuid in c in windows-xp and windows vista if there is a difference else just for windows

780937
decrement	increment
if the counter is not 0 we increment or decrement the counter

780950
swt	rcp
it looks feels behaves and performs like a native application much like an rcp thanks to swt

780951
selected	checkbox
the component with the list has a selected all checkbox

780951
selected	checkbox
when the selected all checkbox is checked it dispatches an event that each item should listen to in order to selected its own checkbox

780951
selected	checkbox
the eventlistener is added on creationcomplete of each item and the event is dispatched correctly when the select all checkbox is selected but the listener in the custom itemrenderer does not listen

780966
return-type	arguments
polymorphism only works for different arguments list not for identical methods only different by the return-type

780966
subclassing	superclass
jon in the comment below is correct you can narrow the scope but then you would still follow the protocols that you will return a one should you return a three from three.foo because subclassing will all implements the superclass interface

780969
silverlight	wpf
and now i read that ms is now putting it s force behind wpf silverlight

780969
silverlight	wpf
should i switch to wpf silverlight

780989
contains	elements
i m currently working on some setting screens most of which contains a 2 column form with a preference question on the left and a form elements on the right

780990
selected	checkbox
your custom itemrenderers should not register an event listener with their parent but with your selected all checkbox

780997
exception-handling	try-catch
you should try-catch unsupportedencodingexception exception-handling

781007
subclassing	superclass
overriding a methods and trying to return a less specific type is a violation of the liskov substitution principle which says that subclassing must fulfill all contracts of their superclass

781031
selected	checkbox
we created a list derived control called exlist which has a property selectedallcb which we bind it to existing checkbox which will work for selected all logic

781031
selected	checkbox
when checkbox is checked we manually set selecteditems arrays to arrays of dataprovider and all items are selected

781040
checkbox	button
i agree that checkbox have more of an implicit true false meaning another point is that for radio button you can force the user to make an active choice by having neither option selected

781043
reflection	runtime
you can define the type at runtime in c# but that s getting into crazy reflection territory

781045
checkbox	button
we had an experience with customer base of older age grouping they understand yes no radio button better then checkbox

781045
checkbox	button
and we were forced to remove checkbox and put radio button everywhere

781051
32-bit	x86
edit actually i just checked in windbg and the size is 12bytes on x86 32-bit

781065
active-directory	adam
i am not sure for adam but for active-directory while the full dn of course must be unique the samaccountname must also be unique within the domain

781081
attributes	properties
however when i try to map my linq to sql class to use this udt with attributes defintions not xml and i setup the properties as the enumeration

781083
checkbox	textbox
control textbox multiline textbox dropdown radiobuttons checkbox clickbutton

781100
getter	setter
there is a workaround presented there but it requires me at least if i get it right to write a custom interface ifileinfo and provide it with a lot of getter and setter which i want to avoid

781104
constructor	object
in this scenario base class has static method to instantiate object of its derived classes using constructor that accepts tablerow

781110
rollback	commit
if an exception-handling occurred rollback the transaction else commit

781128
ruby-on-rails	django
options may include django ruby on ruby-on-rails joomla cakephp codeigniter

781128
joomla	drupal
drupal and joomla are cms products which can be used in a wide variety of ways

781147
malloc	free
then you will have to use your own malloc and free functions to do the actual mallocing and freeing but also keeping the allocation table updated

781149
any	set
if it is a dedicated database machine you can easily set the first 3 of these to half the ram just be carefull under linux with shared buffers maybe you have to adjust the shmmax parameter in any other cases it depends on how much ram you would like to give to postgresql

781155
filtering	sorting
pulling large amounts of data into a web application and doing sorting filtering there is always going to be slow depending on your definition of large

781155
filtering	sorting
if you can apply any sorting filtering on the database server before you pull the data to your web application that should speed things up

781179
moss	wss
sharepoint 2007 wss or moss logs are not easy to read even on a large screens has anyone come across a log viewer that is able to

781179
filtering	sorting
wss moss log file reader - access to individual log files from central administration standard datagrid filtering and sorting options

781179
filtering	sorting
sql integration services - all reporting sorting and filtering options provided by mssql blog post with etl package download time consuming to setup

781183
button	popup
how to close or cancel the popup windows in button click

781191
spring	jsf
jsp struts wicket jsf jboss seam spring asp.net-mvc to name just a few - all this countless frameworks out there try to address the same issues

781202
reflection	runtime
you then load all the dll s in your plugins folder at runtime and use c# reflection more specificly the activator class

781205
url-encoding	url
get url url-encoding of base-64 encoding of the der encoding of the ocsprequest

781221
arrays	loops
finding all bookings in may condense them into one arrays of 31 booleans representing days and loops through looking for slots

781238
c++	lua
remember lua is not as complicated language as c++ so doing this is a lot easier than making a real c++ debugger like say gdb

781250
button	popup
1.how to close or cancel the popup windows in button click

781254
haskell	erlang
what you describe is usually called specification-based testing and has been implemented by frameworks such as quickcheck haskell scalacheck scala and quviq quickcheck erlang

781289
spring	jsf
and this may solves your problem of learning curve and technology changes as you will only need to be good at modeling as there are some frameworks that implements the mda specs such as andromda as it have cartridges that take the class diagrams use cases sequence diagrams and activity diagrams and generate database creation script pojos hibernate mapping spring ejb jsf struts .net code

781342
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
they are the superviews of a uitableview which is inside of a uinavigationcontroller which is inside of a uitabbarcontroller

781390
execution	restart
application pools do recycle and they do restart after achieving some limits in terms of execution time or number of requests etc that can be set on iis

781395
nsdatecomponents	nsdateformatter
to convert a string to a date you use the nsdateformatter class or maybe nsdatecomponents if you already know the hours minutes and seconds

781395
nsdatecomponents	nsdateformatter
you can then use either nsdateformatter or nsdatecomponents to get the new time back out again

781400
implements	abstract
does the base-class implement the property or is it intended to be implements by the inheriting class is it abstract

781413
deployment	install
this could be because you re using grouping policy to install it in which case change user-interface under advanced deployment but might be a conflict with your domain policy

781423
linux	unix
also i can use this software under windows as much as under linux unix

781448
stream	send
should i just make the producer send a series of bytes with a magical number signifying an end of stream

781455
persistence	hibernate
here s a great example of where it will burn you you probably want your annotations for hibernate validator persistence in the same place either fields or properties

781465
any	set
i haven t tested but make sure you set the rdp - option - local resources - remote computer sound to live at remote computer otherwise you can t find any audio randers

781472
optional-arguments	arguments
arguments returns only optional-arguments

781491
pdf-viewer	scribd
scribd has their own proprietary flash pdf-viewer called ipaper

781492
selected	button
to get a regex that works as intended with matches you need to edit it until the whole test subject is highlighted in yellow or if you turn off highlighting until the find first button selected the whole text

781498
string.format	stringbuilder
there are loads of references if you google c# string.format vs stringbuilder or something like that

781507
background-color	transparency
remove the borders of the input and set its background-color to transparency

781516
duplicates	contains
in any case the call to super.getinvalidvalues contains the duplicates messages one matching the message property passed into the annotation and a second with the stock value of the annotation message

781540
convention	standards
my concern with this solution is that you are exposing a methods of unknown complexity with possible side effects as a property but since you can rummage through the .net code and see that this convention is used quite often if you are looking for a standards this may be as close as you ll get

781543
web-applications	webserver
i disagree with your implied assertion that web-applications can t be written without locking at the webserver level though

781561
buffering	streaming
methods 1 reading from regular streaming in to byte buffering and mapping byte arrays to individual bytes of struct

781578
children	tree
it is perhaps the only viable choice when the hierarchical depth varies arbitrarily by object for any object on the tree there can be children grandchildren great-grand-children and so on to an indefinite number of â œgenerations.â

781578
attributes	properties
you need to show multiple properties or attributes with each object

781594
command-line	cmd
i want a simple straightforward way of sending arbitrary cmd to it via the command-line

781599
any	set
assuming you set a class disableme on the fieldset you want to disable any input elements then the following code should do what you need

781604
implements	abstract
if the viewmodel needs to interact in some fashion with the view you can abstract the requirements into an interface and have the view implements that interface

781610
enterprise	platform
going the enterprise route the system center virtual-machine manager can do this mostly automatically but then it s not a free solution anymore this platform can of course also do physical to virtual migrations for you.

781610
virtual-machine	vmware
...but alas you can prepare a physical machine the same way as before converting a vmware image and then use normal imaging tools to clone it into a virtual-machine

781615
instances	destroy
add functions to the wrapper to create and destroy instances of the library

781615
temporary	copy
best to create the copy in the temporary directory so that it is obvious that it can be removed in event of a crash although i am not sure if there are restrictions in vista and later on loading dlls from the temp dir

781623
stderr	stdout
it is related writing stdout stderr to syslog

781632
windows-xp	windows
classic.xaml â â œclassicâ windows 9x 2000 look on windows-xp

781679
sql-server	mysql
this should work for ms sql-server but it should be a trivial task to convert it to mysql once you understand the idea behind it

781681
fopen	fread
you could of course use fopen and fread in chunks in a loop as well that could do the trick but you need http support in streams turned on

781683
lisp	lua
lua also has many features that are very easy to implement in lisp so why doesn t it take that as a basis

781683
c++	lua
lua is a different building and if it had to use c++ abstractions it would have to bend its intent around the existing c++ structure

781686
value	field
the document could contains doc property reference field that get updated with the value stored in the doc property

781691
selected	listbox
when the user selects a different item in the drop down i do a postback and reload the listbox with data related to the selected item

781698
directory	folder
have a search in your project directory and delete the obj files possibly in a folder called intermediate and try again

781709
export	csv
i think the closest you will get to a text file is to export as csv

781709
export	report
so you would need to make a minimal report to get a good csv export

781760
constructor	private
copying is initially necessary for this code so i would like to keep the copying possibility i won t be hiding the copy constructor as private

781766
authentication	login
we ve noticed that it s possible to recreate a copy of an asp.net forms-authentication cookie on another machine allowing the second machine to authentication without needing to login

781774
contains	elements
i think about a designerview designerviewmodel that contains an observablecollection of idesigneritemviewmodel that is my base class for all the elements

781785
constructor	object
then in the copy constructor again you have to allocate the memory for the copied object

781811
debugging	trace
the code is deep inside a 3rd party control library where though i have the source code i don t have the assemblies compiled with enough debugging information that i can trace it through c# code only through the disassembler and then i have to match that back to the actual code

781812
revision	updates
plus if it modifies the document with the current revision number it still need to be committed meaning the stored version would be in a revision number different than the one updates by your macros

781812
any	set
microsoft.office.interop does not allow property modification but the vba api does allow you to access any customproperty you want to set for a given smarttag

781812
revision	svn
so one could imagine a smarttag able to recognize the string revision for this document with the custom behavior being i will query the right revision number to svn and display it

781829
javassist	cglib
in practice you can use something like cglib or javassist

781841
sql-server	oracle
on investigation i can pull all the information i require out of the database and create an email with attachments and send them using the database s built in mail functionality both oracle and sql-server

781894
webforms	asp.net
guis - certain environments and platforms specifically windows forms and asp.net webforms suffer from practical untestability because there is no easy way to isolate or mock their behavior

781898
click	mouse
file-access right mouse click ease of db access

781902
groovy	java
if you want java and metaprogramming use groovy

781915
linux	osx
then multiple frontends for each platform i.e cocoa for osx windows specific code and gtk for linux

781929
zend-amf	amfphp
weborb is also a very good choice but they are mainly focused on .net that s what i m using it for so you would have to compare amfphp zend-amf and weborb

781954
selected	checkbox
once it is attached enable the access violation exception by going to debug- exceptions selected access violation and selected the checkbox stop always

781964
controller	routes
in your links controller should solve the issue without having to change your routes

781966
internet-explorer	firefox
however...when i do view the â in the pdf file it appears as ã â this only happens in firefox not in internet-explorer

781972
constructor	object
pass on this object in every form constructor and you re done

781975
callback	methods
asyncstate is just a value for matching in callback if you use same callback methods in several places

781984
javassist	cglib
for more power many have mentioned javassist i haven t used it - cglib and assembly have been good for me

781996
web-config	app-config
open app-config web-config and locate the system.servicemodel section

782001
selected	button
i want to make a delete button on a form so a user could delete selected row

782001
selected	button
if i select the new row and then try to click delete button the grid loses its focus and changes the selected row

782001
selected	button
so in delete button handler there is another row is selected already not a new row

782042
selected	button
you could disable the delete button when an invalid row the special new row is selected

782098
temporary	copy
currently the only way to do this would be to use cffile and make a copy of the file in a temporary directory rename it and then attach that

782120
json	xml
then your links are generated as xml json html and the flash displays them

782123
ironpython	cpython
can be used with either cpython or ironpython

782135
factors	primes
my answer above fails in the case of two distinct primes factors as pointed out by cory walker

782159
annotations	mapping
but what are the alternatives if your are using hibernate annotations for mapping

782163
margins	padding
you should also put eric meyer s css reset on the top of your stylesheet so you won t be biased by the browser of your choice when setting margins padding and fonts

782163
radio	click
and don t forget to put labels next to your radio button so it will be an easier target to the user click the associated label is like click the button itself

782164
punctuation	words
using w+ as the delimiter will stop punctuation amongst other things from counting as words

782188
font-size	width
does the cgcontextsavegstate save the current drawing i made or does it save the drawing settings i currently have like color line width font-size etc

782189
value	field
any idea how to get the real value of the field

782191
convention	standards
those languages do it by enforcing some sort of convention for how files are stored for example the class foo.bar.quux might have to be in some standards location at foo bar quux.py

environment	building
then you re either going to building the same kind of code to deal with logging authentication authentication remote communication and similar recurring issues exactly what depending on your business and it environment

782224
versioning	migrate
most apps migrate by loading a new versioning but then updating the old database or preferences to work with the new versioning of the application

this could be accomplished by maintaining a boolean value which is set to true whenever the user edits any fields

782343
32-bit	64bit
in my scons build the objects live in parallel directories to the source to enable multiple builds like combinations of 32-bit and 64bit release and debugging

we are considering switching our source control repository at my work from perforce to either cvs or subversion

782375
perforce	git
i am really only familiar with using svn perforce and git

782380
order	add
note that the order of the routes matter when you add routes to the routecollection

782383
cvs	git
svn vs cvs vs git

782405
version-control	cvs
cvs was once the mainly used version-control but in that time all the alternatives of today didn t exists

782405
bazaar	git
subversion git mercurial and bazaar were developed later

782405
bazaar	git
these vcss namely git mercurial and bazaar have recently got a lot of love by some projects

782406
entity-framework	data-access
i have played around with linq to sql dynamic data strongly typed datasets enterprise library data-access application blocks and a tiny bit with entity-framework but none of them have jumped out to me as the one

782436
numeric	digits
i don t know about all encodings but at least in ascii and shudder ebcdic the digits 0-9 all come consecutively and in increasing numeric order

782449

internet-explorer	firefox
this is one solution to the problem tested in opera firefox and internet-explorer 7

782452
push	pull
i commit push go to another place pull commit push

782461

if you re selecting a new version-control system cvs shouldn t even be considered

782462
python	c++
i can t speak for python but it s fairly easy in c++

782462
python	c++
that s how you do it in c++ shouldn t be too different in the python api

782465
any	set
due to this the procedure that is expensive to call is called for every result result in the result set before any results are returned from the cursor

782480
authentication	login
i have a login form for the admin and the inventory sections in the root which calls the appropriate membership provider for authentication and redirects to the corresponding page upon successfuly login

782480
authentication	login
since i can have 1 authentication form entry in the web config how can i set up the app to send to the correct login form

782480
authentication	login
my first thought was to have an httpmodule that checks the path and if the inventory or admin folders are in the path and the user is not authentication then redirect the user to the login page

782498
attributes	properties
i ve applied a typeconverterattributes attributes to a properties on my wpf frameworkelement subclass

782498
attributes	properties
the error message never makes mention of my typeconverter class suggesting that adding the attributes to the properties has had no effect

782512
hash	md5
also as a bit of ghost debugging it s very possible that your passwords are md5 hash in the database since you should never store them in plain text

google-chrome	firefox
i have tested this in firefox webkit safari google-chrome and it works

782537
button	popup

however what i would also like to do is specify optional-arguments to the caller function so that caller calls func with the arguments specified if any

782606
pixels	line
if you mean drawing it without padding each line to a multiple of 4 pixels you can do it by drawing each line one at a time

782639

782655
postgresql	mysql
should i use postgresql mysql oracle or sqlserver for storing documents binary files

782675
jquery	.post
if this is not what you wanted but rather extend jquery you should have a look at the .post by alex barrett

782693
execution	exit
it means you are not even attempting to continue execution you are simply going to log every possible bit of information at your disposal and then try to exit gracefully

782693

i m used to running my own djb dnscache on all unix-like systems i have linux and mac osx

782725
any	set
any ideas on how i should set this up

782727
duplicates	elements
the image flickering is a sprite but it will change on certain javascript-events so i can t really use duplicates the image hacks it is also fairly small so the hack pixel area of elements doesn t work

782730
constructor	private
if you can t make the class default copyable assignable maybe you can make it non-copyable assignable by declaring but not implementing a private copy constructor and assignment operator

782744
swing	awt
since every swing callback like button listener comes in on the awt thread you normally don t have to think about this but for an active rendering situation you have to pay close attention

782757
animation	rotation
we have a moss 2007 installation where we rely on jquery to handle automatic rotation of tabs in webparts animation of sliding menus and tool panels

782762
value	field
either none or all of the value in a data field are enclosed in quotation marks

782763

infinity	minimum
in this case i want to be able to store in the database that the maximum cost of the event is infinity and minimum 0

782785
http	ssl
moodle supports enabling ssl for login but then reverts to regular http after login is established

782785
http	ssl
if my users do an ssl login and the system then reverts back to http for the remainder of their session how vulnerable is the data that is transferred back and forth between the browser interface and the database

782786

it sounds to me like you re actually after a build-server such as cruisecontrol.net or teamcity

782805
value	field
i have done this before where you can pass it a list name and caml query and set of field and it will return rows of name value pairs

782809
value	field
if the field type is a double it seems that you can store infinity value

782811
traffic	packets
anyone on your network would be able to see everyone else s traffic with a network packets sniffer like wireshark

782814
webserver	security
if you are this concerned then i would also look at the security of the db and the communications from db to webserver

782822
sql-server	oracle
we finaly just moved the whole thing to sql-servers mail que and it has been running like a champ - the real lesson in my opinion is is do all the processing however you need to into your program but once you know the emails are to be sent and to whom pass that off to something that specifically handles email sending cdo sql-server mail oracle whatever

782837
frame-rate	fps
20 ms frame is a frame-rate of 50 fps which also coincides with the electric frequency in european territories and is just noticeable by the human eye

all you need to do is to add a new dotfuscator project to your solution add the outputs from your other projects as inputs to the dotfuscator project using the add assembly add project output functionality set any necessary obfuscation settings and then change the input for your setup project to be the dotfuscator project

782873
any	set
jetty can also use jk so you could easily set up your certificate in apache instead to serve any http requests through it.

basically i want to be able to hand it some key or other string s and get back strings or collections of key-value pairs

782960
textbox	button
i have a database driven textbox that needs to be repopulated when the user hits the back button a back button that i have created on the form

782962
getter	setter
otherwise you could separate out the getter and setter for the property so that the type required is very clear

782966
if-statement	loops
you can go lambda all the way by chaining select map and where filter instead of multiple for loops and if-statement

782977
textbox	onblur
it is a javascript function used on a textbox client-side onblur event to validate that the entered text represents a correctly formatted and valid date

782984
command-line	cmd
i have a package i ve just deployed called cursive.tools and i wanted it to make available a cursive cmd that someone could run from the cmd-line like

782997
couchdb	hbase
google s bigtable and other similar projects ex couchdb hbase are database systems that are oriented so that data is mostly denormalized ie duplicated and grouping

782997
oracle	mysql
in an orm like mysql or oracle when you start adding more nodes if you join two tables that are not in the same node the join cost is higher

783010
arrays	map
each value in the map is an uninterpreted arrays of bytes

783017

i know how to have an editable gridview along with a sqldatasource in which each edit update insert delete is immediately persisted to the database using the sqldatasource s updatecommand insertcommand etc

783018
pixels	line
i have a rectangular picture that stores it s pixels color line

783028
any	set
any time you want a watermarked autocomplete box just set the attached property value and apply the style you defined

783052
constructor	object
that being said however i personally do not believe that the constructor of an object is part of that object s interface and as such adding a constructor to an interface would inhibit the natural flexibility that interfaces afford

783078
decrement	increment
since you are using your own derived-class then just increment and decrement a counter on add and remove

783081
constructor	object
constructor must return an object or throw an exception

783098
select	union
it s also equivalent to a union all select on the individual values

783103
constructor	object
although interfaces can t have constructor in most languages the factory pattern provides a contract for constructing object similar to an interface

783126
hosts-file	hosts
or put an entry in your hosts for anything you want pointing to localhost

783127
any	set
y can be any number of fields and the resulting data set will contain one record for each distinct combination of the y fields

783131
any	set
if i set this value the value of the appdomain.currentdomain.setupinformation.configurationfile property is correct but any calls to that configuration file while debugging yield no results

783141
nunit	moq
although they do not have one bundled with the framework here is a link to post contains a download to automatically create the test project for nunit with moq for you nunit with moq

783194
file-permissions	filesystems
the advantage of using the filesystems as the namespace for the end-points is that normal file-permissions and acls can be applied - if you can t open the end-point you can t connect

783198
double	int
then they can tag a bunch of resources as belonging to projects take over the world or fix my car. the tags are strongly typed so a tag may store single or multiple string s int s double s etc

783198
filtering	sorting
the problem is that resources need to behave both as tuples for tabular viewing sorting filtering and as tagname tagvalue maps

783211
difference	datediff
i have a report that calculates multiple date difference in business days not datediff for a variety of business reasons that are far too dull to get into

783218
silverlight	wpf
in wpf not sure about silverlight here a snippet of code to retrieve the template of aero you can try to copy paste and change what you want

783221
updating	updates
contrary to rob s fear the db updates manager and its user-interface come up quser-interfacete nicely this way and the process of updating our database is now completed before any of our services that depend on the database get started

783223
keyboard	mouse
try keynav for controlling the mouse pointer using your keyboard

783226
zend-framework	codeigniter
codeigniter is a very fast and light weight asp.net-mvc framework that would allow you to bootstrap pretty quickly but you may also want to look into zf zend-framework

783285
versioning	upgrade
also upgrade to versioning 1.6 which has better mergeinfo support it writes less of these properties

783311
value	field
character and date field require value to be surrounded with single quotes

783312

one more thing when using query parameters in oledb it s important to make sure you add them in order

783346
sqltransaction	rollback
think of this almost like a sqltransaction where you need to commit or rollback

783358
runas	cmd
at least xp has a runas cmd which you can try to use something like

783359
firefox	opera
i tested this in opera 10 ie 6 and firefox 3 with only minor problems

783361
json	xml
i know json and xml are going to be around for a while but my users aren t going to want to write or maintain json or xml documents

783388
jquery	dojo
you might want to use a framework that supports css selectors something like dojo or jquery

783393
versioning	migrate
what is the best way to migrate my databases tables functions triggers gist indexes data... from the based on older geos postgis versioning to the newer one

783396
contains	any
currently the findall predicate splits the terms on spaces then returns a match if any of the searchable properties contains any part of the terms

783406
hosts-file	hosts
on the other hand if you are looking to get requests from multiple domains like a.localhost b.localhost and c.localhost try editing your hosts to redirect domains to 127.0.0.1

783441
nhibernate	ado.net
you would just use whatever .net data access methods you feel is appropriate for your app ado.net nhibernate linq etc..

783442
i2c	spi
if your hardware has any other unused serial interface spi i2c .. using them would be easier

783458
dependency-injection	inject
we use structuremap for dependency-injection to inject our datafactory which essentially does the crud for our poco business objects

783458
entity-framework	nhibernate
is there any way to automate this process like fluent does for nhibernate but with the entity-framework

783465
authentication	login
once a login has been established often the credentials aren t needed any more as a session is then linked to the user and deemed to be authenticated and the existence of the session itself is proof of a successful authentication

783465
sniffing	traffic
however as previous posters have mentioned local network traffic can be available for sniffing

783473
configuration	environment
it seems eclipse doesn t know about my path environment variables even though i have gone into run configuration and selected path on the environment tab

783505
getter	setter
i set it up at debugging level in the assembly.cs file so that it default to logging all methods calls that aren t property getter or setter

783509
web-services	security
by default any application running on top of asp.net including asmx web-services will execute under the asp.net machine account aspnet security context which has restricted privileges on the host machine

783509
authentication	impersonation
this behavior can be altered by enabling impersonation which will cause the asp.net application to execute under the security context of the authentication user or a specific user account

783513
required	checked
it s useful at compilation time because it s required you the developer to promise the compiler that you re doing something valid which it can t checked

783526
vb.net	vb6
i m sure most of the time the reason companies go forward with vb.net is exactly as you mentioned - large amounts of vb6 in the organization both in terms of codebase and developers

783526
vb.net	vb6
keep in mind that asp websites and vb6 applications can be migrated to vb.net with little to no pain

783534
vb.net	vb6
i m unusual in that i come from a c c++ background know c# but actually prefer vb.net i severely dislike vb6 vbscript

783534
vb.net	vb6
i say all this because it s important to remember the vb6 is not vb.net

783534
vb.net	vb6
i really hated vb6 but i fell in love with vb.net almost instantly

783534
vb.net	vb6
however vb.net did inherit some things from vb6 and not just a syntax style

783535
vb.net	vb6
completely subjective opinion but i d say anyone who jumped on the vb.net bandwagon would have come from a background in vb6 classic asp

783555
startup	launch
for example i use the following command to launch ntlmaps on startup

783568
subtract	add
a have the interface called math that has add subtract divide and multiply and then i have a class called intmath that implements math that is optimized for integer math and i have another class called floatmath the implements math that is optimized for floating math and i have a generalmath that implements math that handles everything else

783579
postgresql	mysql
database likely mysql or postgresql - sql jdbc

783581
vb.net	vb6
also some companies who jumped .net 1.0 from vb6 thought that vb.net will be the major language which turned out to be a big mistake after couple of years

783588
bazaar	git
the entire open-source world except perhaps the eclipse community has moved on to modern source-control systems subversion git mercurial bazaar and so on

783588
cvs	git
edit eclipse has recently switched off all cvs repo access and has migrated to git

783590
activerecord	datamapper
i m a .net developer by day but have been working with ruby-on-rails and merb for the past year on my own side projects so when it comes to asp.net-mvc and orms i m more used to them and using activerecord and datamapper

783594
toolchain	gnu
as for the compiler executable you d have to use the gnu gcc toolchain

783594
shell	bash
one more thing try to pick a shell like bash and read up on it

783600
linux	unix
there are easy tools on linux that will translate to unix line endings from windows

783601
children	nodes
since we know the graph is a tree we know of the existance of leaf nodes nodes with one edge and no children

783603
stripes	jsf
web framework - wicket stripes jsf tapestry component vs request based frameworks

783603
jquery	dojo
javascript library - jquery yui dojo

783608
button	popup
i tried approaching this problem from a different perspective by assigning the targetcontrolid property of the modalpopupextender to a hidden button and then calling show on the modal popup if validation failed but this did not cancel the postback

783611
easymock	jmock
you haven t explicitly mentioned unit-testing but that should certainly be part of the mix - i don t have much experience outside junit as an actual testing framework but there s also easymock and jmock amongst others for mocking of dependencies

783614
constructor	object
however without knowing the need for a constructor it s probably worth pointing out that a constructor is not called when deserializing the object on client-side as the object is not constructed as such

783618
webserver	upload
i m assuming i don t want to upload them to a folder with my web application because then the webserver can serve them up directly

783662
32-bit	64bit
will java code built and compiled against a 32-bit jdk into 32-bit byte code work in a 64bit jvm

783662
32-bit	64bit
to give a little more detail i have code that was working in a solaris environment running a 32-bit jvm but now i m getting issues after upgrading the jdk and weblogic server to 64bit

783664
put	get
you could try to put your native dll somewhere in the above mentioned dirs and try if you get better results

783665
seam	jsf
if you are going the with a java back-end i would recommend hibernate for your jpa jsf with richfaces ajax skinning and facelets view rendering templating for your front-end and seam to put it all together

783667
diffmerge	winmerge
i did not test it with diffmerge but with winmerge it works just fine both from a dos session or a git shell

783677
32-bit	64bit
this allows 32-bit address data therefore using half as much bandwidth and therefore faster to use heap sizes of 35- or 36-bits on a 64bit platform

783678
credentials	account
no one else can open the keychain without your login credentials by default the login keychain has the same password as your account

783678
credentials	account
this technique doesn t make your account any more secure but protects the contents of the encrypted volume from techniques that bypass account credentials to get at the disk - such as removing the disk or booting in target mode and mounting it as an external drive on some other machine or booting single-user or what not

783682
freebsd	linux
i ve done windows linux freebsd cross-platform development with windows as my primary os.

783682
cvs	git
subversion git bazaar mercurial cvs

783696
any	bag
if you want to access the custom property bag of an spweb or create a sitecollection using a specific site templates and content database or any of the other million things that are not implemented in the web-services

783700
output	mode
use the 8 channel output device in 7.1 mode with a different headset in each port and you ve got it

783701
32-bit	64bit
i accidentally ran our largeish application on a 64bit vm rather than a 32-bit vm and didn t notice until some external libraries called by jni started failing

783701
32-bit	64bit
data serialization on a 32-bit platform was read in on the 64bit platform with no issues at all

783711
required	checked
however even if installing firebug does not appeal to you i d recommend checked out firebug lite which requireds no installation into the browser nor in fact does it even required firefox

783718
32-bit	64bit
using jni may restrict your ability to move from 32-bit to 64bit

783727
mp3	m3u
these track_links then have associated track_link_types mp3 m3u podcast whatever

783727
mp3	m3u
so when adding a release you can add the album tracks and each album track can have different links mp3 m3u podcast whatever

783744
handler	service
if you were to host this on a soap endpoint your client would deliver you a code and a message which iis or whatever you use to host your web service would interpret as a http message and call the correct http handler

783744
handler	service
the wcf soap handler would get the message which would really just contain another set of code and message with which the soap stack would call the correct service methods and pass the message to that one.

783745
chown	chmod
last time i ran into a similar problem i did chmod 777 or was it chown

783745
chown	sudo
i may need to write a scripting to locally sudo chown lampp lamppusers each time i use a different machine

783760
user-controls	itemtemplate
i have a user-controls in an itemtemplate for a gridviewrow

783778
cvs	git
there is a good deal of comparing git mercurial is considered to be ok and cvs svn perforce

783784
selected	listbox
also my error was specifically caused by the selected list item being an item that wasn t in the listbox the previous postback

783794
chown	chmod
i would advise just setting the whole directory to 777 with chmod chown changes ownership as the user and grouping each user is in will be different on each machine you can t really do better

783806
environment	building
as a part of the daily building we also deploy our app into a test environment

783808
credentials	account
the sense of this requirement is to avoid users from registering in the application paying for the membership and than giving the credentials of account to other people

783828
google-chrome	safari
if you re interested check out a script i wrote -- it s a cheap firebug replacement that doesn t interfere with any normal console like safari or google-chrome but does extend it with almost all the firebug methods

783835
action-filter	controller
create a custom action-filter and override the onresultexecuted methods to do your extra processing then decorate your controller with that attributes

783836
credentials	account
that would give you the option to run under any account in which you have credentials username password

783856
silverlight	wpf
you said both wpf and silverlight

783856
silverlight	wpf
there likely isn t one for wpf as you said there s already an activex control and it would be extremely difficult to do for silverlight as there are a number of security restrictions on the use of sockets

783858
naming-conventions	conventions
while individual teams are always going to come up with their own naming-conventionss like this the underscore.js conventions seems so prevalent that it made me curious about

783863
dependency-injection	inject
then inject this dependency at the run-time with one of the implementation using one of the available ioc container or dependency-injection farmeworks

783890
execute	prepare
name and prepare execute that

783903
any	set
make sure that you don t have any isapi filtering or asp.net http modules set up to rewrite the headers

783904
environment	restart
i noticed our tempdb was extremely large earlier today and restart sql that brought the tempdb down in size to a good size but it has been growing again ever since and constantly restart sql is not an option as this is a production environment

synchronous	.when
the reason this isn t working is because your oncompleted handler is being called .when the sendasync methods completes but that appears to be before the smtpclient has finished physically sending the email across the network this will only happen with network delivery though file deliveries are essentially synchronous with sendasync

784008
sql-server	oracle
top is supported by sql-server not by oracle

784010

784011
pointers	stack
chances are that you re corrupting your heap or stack somewhere along the way via a buffer overrun re-using an invalid pointers etc etc

784011
realloc	malloc
last but not least do a search through your code for everywhere that you use low-level c memory manipulation functions - malloc calloc realloc memcpy strcpy strncpy etc - and make absolutely sure that the buffer sizes are appropriate

784018
sql-server	oracle
it s missing many of the handy functions that you take for granted with sql-server or oracle and even other flavors of sybase you can t link servers and do distributed queries without 3rd party tools sybase management tools and ide s are limited and very poor again my opinion and it s just painful to work with

784073
ubuntu	debian
debian packages should work on ubuntu

784081
ubuntu	debian
if you want to make a gcc similar to the one shipped with ubuntu apt-get source gcc and look in debian rules for their configure flags they may be applied on multiple lines

784091
ubuntu	debian
if it is in a debian repository it should would under ubuntu no problem

784121
buffering	streaming
the .net console just streaming into the buffering which is probably not what you want

1 i have adjusted the margins zeroed the padding and changed the width of the background-image - all to no effect

784193
contains	elements
the correct approach is to define a grouping elements which is contains a choice between all the various options ints floats arrays and each one has cardinality 0

784231
button	popup
the idea is to have a button placed at the right hand edge of the windows taskbar much like the language bar that when clicked would popup the search interface

784233
constructor	object
constructor are for object setup

784237
dto	dao
this is really natural but i ve come to see it as just a bad approach to solving the dao dto problem

784237
contains	any
since they contains their own data at any point in your system where they interact say with the screen or with the db you need an adapter

784237
dto	dao

784320
silverlight	wpf
silverlight xaml wpf is pretty simple but it comes with a really big framework and a ton of things to learn because it s so flexible

784329
crossover	mutation
you could experiment with the mutation and crossover thanks nathan algorithms to see which do the best job

784329
contains	set
another option would be for your algorithm to build the smallest possible word from the input set and then add one letter at a time so that the new word is also is or contains a new word

784330
constructor	object
edit or to provide a constructor that explicitly asks the user to initialize the member variables before the object can be obstantiated

784352

784353
attributes	properties
set up a separate set of tests that use reflection to test that appropriate attributes with appropriate properties are getting set on your methods

784384
value	field
the field is inside a table and adding the margin-left -80 t the .customvalidator table style in the css file moves the call out to the left but no very far and the movement is the same no matter what you make the value

784391
onchange	onclick
edit i tried onclick and onchange

784405
attributes	properties
the value properties is the attributes that s supposed to exist on the element such as

python	php
i was looking around and couldn t find the python equivalent of browscap that i ve used in php to detect what browser a given user-agent string is

784441
value	field
using fillchar on the record variables after a value was assigned to the string field is not recommended

784472
silverlight	wpf
as a java c programmer probably the biggest challenge will be getting your head around and into the way silverlight and wpf work

784476
templating	mako
in addition to using the approach of trying to have a single front controllers go through all the widget needed and building them an alternative you might want to consider is making more powerful use of the templating in mako

each of these scripting contains a set of subscripting and individual records

784531
google-chrome	firefox
update this works on firefox google-chrome but not ie

784534
revision	svn
for example if the file is e-mailed to someone else or copied a cd or exported then it can t update its svn revision when it s opened

784534

ruby	php
1 show python and ruby s advantages over php

784584
python	ruby
2 show ruby s advantages over python

784584
python	ruby
python and ruby are easier to read and write

784595
hash	md5
md5 hash would be faster than comparison but slower than a normal crc-check

784617
keyboard	mouse
in fact i find myself rather unable to complete even single player games before dissecting their mechanics and gaming them in a specifically read-only not cheats per se mouse and keyboard input only fashion

784618
attributes	properties
in contract to the xmlserializationr which basically just serialization everything unless you explicitly tell it to ignore it the datacontractserializationr is opt-in - you have to explicitly tell it by means of the attributes which fields and or properties to serialization

784621
python	ruby
sure python and ruby are more object-oriented but that s not a requirement to be better it s only a convenience

784621
ruby	php
we re all different and i doubt any of the ruby python php contenders are any better than the other

784626
ruby	php
no ruby is not better than php or python

784626
python	ruby
ruby and python will serve you better in fact in python it can be done in just a few lines can t speak for ruby though

784626
ruby	php
on the other hand php is better suited than ruby for writing a one-off short backend for an email submission form

784626
python	ruby
python has a much larger user base than ruby and indeed is the primary language that redhat uses for developing system tools

784626
ruby	php
it just occurred to me that i failed to state the whole point you shouldn t be trying to convince other people that they should use ruby over python php

784626
ruby	php
instead you should be trying to determine whether you should use ruby over python php

784633
python	php
python has list comprehensions php is much better when embedding and generating html

784647
appfuse	spring
appfuse is a spring hibernate app designed to be used as skeleton for new projects

784657
packets	lan
i wrote some client software to send out a multicast over the lan with a client computer on the same switch as the cluster so that each node in the cluster would receive the packets and respond

784657
lan	wan
it works great except when i run the client software on a computer that has both lan and wan interfaces

784657
multicast	wan
if there is a wan interface the multicast doesn t work

784657
lan	wan
so obviously i figure the multicast is incorrectly going over the wan interface eth0 rather than the lan eth1. so i use the so_bindtodevice socket option to force the multicast socket to use eth1 and all is well

784657
lan	wan
and is there some way perhaps an ioctl call that i can have the application automatically determine if a particular interface is a lan or wan

784658
convention	standards
standards naming convention

784659
implements	extends
when objects extends a class or implements an interface on the other hand the properties methods are accessed via that interface superclass

784743
diffmerge	winmerge
i managed to defined external tools like notepad++ and winmerge or diffmerge

784743
svn2git	git-svn
i did run successfully scripting like svn2git because from msysgit1.6.2+ it does include the git-svn command

784748
sctp	tcp
on top of the raw socket sits a layer called sctp just like tcp which is indicating every now and then that it is missing some packets

784748
any	set
i would appreciate any pointers as to what option if any of ip layer should we be configuring or is there any specific socket option that we need to set

784767
xsd	xml
once the xsd is defined i want to validate the class serialized to xml against the xsd

784790
rollback	commit
make sure that you always commit or rollback and then always close your session

784797
xsd	xml
if you are validating the serialized xml against an xsd that means it has to conform to some structure but it can be very flexible

784797
xsd	xml
you can liquid xml studio to create xsd

784802
struct	unions
pay special attention to pointers struct unions bit fields typedefs and the c preprocessor

784803
linux	unix
even though the original problem was solved for the asker i ll point out that a common source of problems when running the same code on windows vs linux or unix is case-sensitivity issues

784803
linux	unix
windows ignores case while linux or unix is case-sensitive

784815
thickbox	jquery
people recommends me jquery thickbox and also this contact example

784818
substring	charindex
look at the builtin functions charindex patindex and substring

784818
substring	charindex
charindex finds the positioninging of a specified character patindex of a pattern substring returns a portion of a string by positioning

784818
case-statement	case-when
at least the calculated column info2 will involve a case-statement to handle the case-when there is only one parenthesized info in the source something along these lines

784824
msbuild	nant
using msbuild beats the purpose of using nant nant is something that replaces msbuild use the below to do a clean nant compilation of web application projects as in vs 2003 2005 2008

784859
any	set
the where-clause at the bottom is just to filtering out any columns that either contain no brackets or contain brackets in a weird order and it uses null in column2 when only one set of brackets are there

784880
authentication	login
why not just have a user name and password and either have your web browser remember the login or send an authentication cookie back that doesn t expire

784886
assign	add
if list contains just i pick that otherwise i create a new ultratree and add it to list and i assign to the tree that is created at design time

784896
drupal	django
if you re building your own site then you are just doing it for kicks otherwise you d be using wordpress drupal django etc. so why not do things differently

784916
.net	wcf
moreover you should to learn some related technology on .net platform like wcf linq sql-server 2008

784934
32-bit	64bit
unless you have native code machine code compiled for a specific arcitechture your code will run equally well in a 32-bit and 64bit jvm

784934
32-bit	64bit
note however that due to the larger adresses 32-bit is 4 bytes 64bit is 8 bytes a 64bit jvm will require more memory than a 32-bit jvm for the same task

784935
dialog	pop-up
jquery user-interface has a decent pop-up modal dialog api and i ve worked with the boxy plugins which is very easy to implement

784941
deep-copy	object
there are some reflection based methods you can use to deep-copy a custom object google for reflection deep-copy

784941
attributes	properties
this article for example clones all properties marked with a custom attributes deep-copy but you can easily change that behavior yourself

784941
deep-copy	object
also there is a similar thread on so how to deep-copy between object of different types in c#.net

784941
assign	add
in that case you should simply create a new node using a constructor assign the data from the source node and then add the new node to the tree

784951
fiddler	charles
if you use a transparency echoing proxy this can show you all http traffic charles and fiddler are two good example i recommend charles

784955
logging	trace
i just finished a logging framework that uses trace why nothing like this exists i don t know

784955
base-class	inherited
i made a convenience base-class that inherited from tracelistener

the attributes string of the properties looks like this

784992
attributes	properties
or is there a better way to check if this properties attributes contain the arrays type

784994
message	alert
also display a javascript alert box can be confusing to a user s mental workflow an inline message would be much more preferable

784995
joomla	drupal
i have heard of drupal joomla and plone - but what i am hoping for is something that is very simple to set up and use

785001
wordpress	blogs
try wordpress - it s not only suitable for blogs but also as a cms if you have very simple requirements

785007
put	get
you can put a long object in to get it work

785007
perl	tcl
swig is used with different types of languages including common scripting languages such as perl php python tcl and ruby

785007
ocaml	lua
the list of supported languages also includes non-scripting languages such as c# common lisp clisp allegro cl cffi uffi java lua modula-3 ocaml octave and r

785008
joomla	drupal
drupal and joomla are there

785009
hide	show
implement the forms as user-controls instead put them onto the same form and show and hide the controls as appropriate this can also be achieved by loading the forms stripping form borders and such and setting their parent to a panels or something similar

785010
asp.net-mvc	webforms
it s the whole core principal in asp.net-mvc that you seperate the different tiers of logic and that you re forced to do it unlike webforms that still allows you to do sql directly in your view if you link

785028
put	get
i think you are going to need to do some user validation and i would be tempted to put keys to the decryption in a separate database and provide some other mechanism to get that out which should require authentication

785059
getter	setter
and it creates setter and getter automatically

785060
ruby-on-rails	django
write the app in all three languages including any configuration for the server i m assuming you re writing a web app here using django ruby-on-rails php right

785060
python	ruby
for the record i ve tried all three and would agree that both ruby and python seem to result in cleaner code

785060
python	ruby
i d go for python over ruby though - there was something clunky about the syntax of ruby when i tried it that i just didn t experience with python

785072
sctp	tcp
if you include sctp in the application itself then that will more than double the number of messages being passed into an out of the kernel which will impact performance when compared with using the pre installed tcp

785072
sctp	tcp
i would seriously consider sticking with tcp unless you are sure sctp is needed or unless you control the hosts your app is deployed on

785073
getter	setter
in this case it creates tells the compiler how to create the getter and setter methods for the member variables

785085
while-loop	loops
your while-loops is an infinite loops and its creating new threads continuously

jpeg compression your snapshot and do the streaming with vlc

785113
compression	streaming
jpeg compression your snapshot and doing the streaming yourself

785115
versioning	upgrade

785119
value	field
onchange is when the value of the field changes

785134
nhibernate	ado.net
or use a logging framework like log4net with ado.net appender and do it completely separately out of nhibernate environment

785202
c++	lua
is there a way to determine how many parameters a lua function takes just before calling it from c c++ code

785202
c++	lua
it may seem a bit like i am going against the spirit of lua but i really want to bullet proof the interface that i have between lua and c++

785202
c++	lua
when a c++ function is called from lua code the interface verifies that lua has supplied the correct number of arguments and the type of each argument is correct

785202
c++	lua
when c++ calls a lua function it should at least check that the lua function doesn t declare more parameters than are necessary

785203
constructor	object
i m not sure about java these days it s been a while so i d suggest passing the object as a constructor parameter to a class derived from runnable

785205
portrait	screens
i d also like to see - not currently include in the betas - a decent camera api that allowed us to customize the appearance of the capture screens and as another poster said have it work properly in landscape and portrait mode

785209
binary	hex
either as binary perhaps hex or characters

785212
difference	count
well i know that the retain-keyword in the compiler directive would make a retain count +1 but actually i think that i missed the deep difference in assign and retain

785216
sql-server	oracle
odbc - only for relational databases sql-server oracle etc

785216
sql-server	oracle
oracle sql-server excel raw files etc

785222
display	width

785227
installation	uninstall
but you could use it to uninstall or launch an application or hide the installation process silent install

785229
webforms	asp.net
if i know my basics in .net c# and have some experience with asp.net and have good understanding of things like page lifecycle in webforms web parts master pages etc then am i ready for sharepoint

785240
versioning	upgrade
i know that some companies refuse to upgrade ie unless absolutely necessary but seriously i would no longer support ie6 since the current versioning is 8 and most people should have 7 by now

785262
python	ruby
i ve written buckets of both python and ruby by the way i find it much more readable especially when you re working on code that s not your own

785273

785282
google-chrome	firefox
to paste without formatting to a browser firefox google-chrome at least ctrl + â shift + v on windows linux see below for mac os x

785310
16-bit	8bit
the main reason is that reading the binary data into a vb6 bstr will convert the data from 8bit bytes to 16-bit characters using on the current code page

785310
binary	hex
it would help to see examples of data both in binary single and db string form in hex to verify that this is what s happening

785330
profiling	debugging
once up and running it can give you all sorts of debugging and profiling information and the output format of xdebug can be read by the amazing kcachegrind tool visualizing and reporting on the stack and graphing your application flow if you re a happy linux camper

785357
display	width
setting display block however will not achieve what you want since each element will fill the entire width

785371
codeigniter	cakephp
so far i ve checked out frameworks like codeigniter cakephp but their support for firebird is vague or little at most

785418
boost-regex	icu

785539
sql-server	oracle
realistically how likely are you to dump oracle for sql-server or vice-versa

785541
sql-server	oracle
we ve see an article that tries to copy the oracle way but what we re really looking for is some in-built sql-server support and was hoping for something like a not supported option for a sproc or a suspend transaction command. google searches have been a bit hopeless hence this post

785558
sequences	unique
a concept may be referred to with a very unique name or terminology in a particular business domain that would not sound right when used in a sequences out of that business domain

785576
entitymanager	entities

785578
triggers	insert
an insert update triggers that will remove leading and trailing spaces from the first and last name

785578
triggers	insert
i m not sure if udb9 has generated columns db2 z has but you can do this in the same insert update triggers

any	set
i ve set up no special debugging parameters or any other watches settings or breakpoints that would interrupt the application

785871

in order to run your web-services from jquery you should use either wcf or just usual web-services but you should add scriptmethods to your service s methods and scriptservice to your webservice description

785881
jquery	.post
i believe that they way you are using it will result in jquery attempting to .post to

785890
versioning	upgrade
if it wasn t fixed by versioning 4.2 you ll have to upgrade to get it

785894
nsinteger	int
i would suggest using nsinteger nsuinteger instead of int

785895
configuration	environment
if i am to have connectionstrings read from a configuration file in my application and i need to be able to change the connectionstrings as the application is moved from dev to uat to prod should i be using settings files at all as there the connection strings are compiled into the assembly which i will be moving from environment to environment making the initial connection strings obsolete

i have a summary report which has a link to its detail report drill through when i export the summary report to excel i would like to delete the row with link becasue it wont work from excel

785928
exception-handling	try-catch
you could get a threadabort exception-handling between taking the semaphor and getting into the try-catch block

785940
export	csv
if your going to export to csv you could set the dataelementoutput to none

785948
content-disposition	content-type
i have a servlet that sends a file by setting the http content-type to application zip the content-disposition to attachment and writing it on the response s outputstream

785948
google-chrome	firefox
however when deploying on a clustered jboss server ie hangs on 0 requesting file information for the whole transfer and then fails with an error message stating that the file wasn t available for download even stranger is the fact that with firefox and google-chrome the servlet behaves correctly same way as on localhost

785959
required	checked
in general recursion is easier to reason about since you can list the limited number of things you need to checked but it does initially required a leap of faith since your intuition will be wrong

785968
application-pool	was
the reason i couldn t find it was i already added permission for the application-pool user in my case i just went ahead and added aspnet network service iis anon user etc to have full permissions

785975
value	field
in some cases there are meaningful default value for many but not all field that i could use

785983
configuration	logging
i think that instead if it can t find custom configuration then it should revert to a sensible default configuration like logging my exception in the event log

785996
value	field
you would keep a hidden form field storing the currently selected value

786014
temporary	copy
you could use a temporary table with allow nulls on every column to store the form containing partial or no data and copy move the data to the final table when the user marks the form as completed

786021
double	int
while this works for other data types such as varchar int double etc it does not with boolean

786023
dialog	pop-up
you need to pop-up a feed dialog to allow this it s not too intrusive though - it works quite well

786033
python	ruby
you can plug a remote debugger into a running jvm and get all kinds of information about a running application that is simply impossible with python ruby etc

786033
jython	pypy
this is a developing area with other languages -- python has jython iron python even pypy and stackless

786033
rubinius	jruby
ruby has jruby rubinius and others -- but as good as these are they can t match the maturity found in the various jvm offerings

786050
hide	show
my workaround so far for what it s worth is hide the control for a couple seconds after the form loads then show it

786071
final	super
java is designed so that all methods are dynamically dispatched unless final or static or called to super and in your case

786092
any	set
itemrenderers are recycled so if you do any processing in set data you should always have matching if else statements

786115
png	ico
i use an the icon library from icon experience - your pay but all icon sizes 16x16 up to 256 x 256 are provided in ico and png formats

786119

how to use jquery to get the checked checkbox values and put it into a textarea immediately

786147
.when	ready
it doesn t just auto-apply it it only does it .when the dom is ready

786173
checkbox	textarea
if you want the checked checkbox values to be put into the textarea maybe with a nice comma-seperation on page load it would be as simple as

786177
hosts-file	hosts
best thing would be to add an entry to your hosts

786178
checkbox	textarea
this will get the value of the first checked checkbox on the page and insert that in the textarea with

786179
hosts-file	hosts
why not change your hosts to point lookup to their website to a webserver that you control

786228
forms-authentication	security
i am using the sqlmembership provider and forms-authentication to handle security for the site

786252

786286
google-chrome	firefox
tested it in google-chrome firefox ie6 ie7 and safari and it looks like it works

786292
implements	extends

786307
configuration	installation
also some basic things like defining the filesets that are to be copied to the target system and adding an installation step to replace certain strings in configuration files seemed somewhat easier in install4j

786330
aggregate-functions	sum
you cannot nest aggregate-functions - selected sum max x will always error

786332
thickbox	jquery
im using thickbox 3.1 with jquery 1.3.2 with the validation plugin and all works great when i run the pages individually but when i use thickbox the page popup as it should but the validation on the page now doesn t work inside the thickbox any help on this would be great

786346
centering	fixed
make sure the glusphere is facing the fixed point so that translating forwarding with respect to the sphere puts you closer to the centering of its orbited

786367
iteration	elements
it s the same basic pattern - separate the iteration over all user elementss from what to do with the elements

786373
attributes	properties
note i know that i could add my own string properties that do the formatting internally and add an attributes to my int properties but this feels like a second-rate solution

786380

the way the yt api works is that you load the flash player and .when it s ready it will send a callback to a global function called onyoutubeplayerready playerid

786402
solaris	linux
dlopen solaris linux and various bsd flavors

786402

oddly enough if i set cancel to true and allow a timer i have running to do the logout command then call another unload it works however in testing this configuration different code this prevents the user from logging out the first time

786458
rewrite	rule
so why not just write a rule on there to check if txtsessionid is set and then rewrite it to whatever you d like

786496
shopping-cart	cart
say you have a website shopping-cart which requires users to login before adding to the cart

786496
shopping-cart	cart
the user is not logged-in yet so they need to visit the login page user login and then being smart about the flow takes them to the shopping-cart view cart list

786496
authentication	login
that would seem to be a bit messy since it would need to access the users table for login authentication and access the products table for pulling the product details price into the cart

786508
cos	sin
p x cos theta px-ox - sin theta py-oy + ox

786508
cos	sin
p y sin theta px-ox + cos theta py-oy + oy

786509
any	set
again the gpl might be a good choice though in this case you ll need to make sure you set up copyright assignments from any other contributors that send changes back to you so that you can re-license their contributions

786509
required	checked
for instances you should checked which of your dependencies are required and which ones can be made optional

786519
value	field
the value of the description field is passed through _webform_filter_descriptions

786535
controller	routes
rboard s routes maps root to a controller named index.

786535
controller	routes
radiant s routes for the bulk of the app goes to one controller which then does some crazy magic

786535
controller	routes
track s routes go to a controller that is related to a resource this is an example closest to what i described above .

786541
hash	md5
version 5 and version 3 uuids use the sha1 and md5 hash functions respectively to combine a namespace with a piece of already unique data to generate a uuid

786544
put	get
this has been the case for a long time and i have just lived with it but i was wondering if anyone knew how to get cpan.pm to put all modules in the same directory

786547
fclose	fread
i could fclose and fopen the file fseek past the data already processed and continue the fread -ing from there but is all that necessary

786548
python	ruby
i don t know exactly what you do in ruby or python but it is similar

786552
versioning	upgrade
i can t work out how to upgrade to the latest versioning

786555
ostream	std
how can i create std ostream and std istream objects to point to a piece of memory i allocated and manage i don t want the stream to free my memory

786556
authentication	login
you ll have controllers that drive your flow - the controller method for cart add 207366 will check to see if the user is authentication and pass them to the controller for login if not

786556
contains	lookup
the controllers would call cart.additem but the business logic is contains inside the shopping-cart model - it might lookup the price of the item a preferred customer discount based on the user etc

786557
entity-framework	nhibernate
look into entity-framework nhibernate linq to sql etc

786557
filtering	sorting
that said for things like sorting and filtering a relational database is more efficient than c# will be

786559
contains	elements
however if you want a one dimensional arrays that contains all the elements in the rectangular arrays you can use something like this which is also o n

786560
void	main
i tried putting that at the bottom of the file before the money class declaration but the compiler says that a class named money already exists i know why it happens because groovy creates a class with the name of the file with an empty static void main to run this code

786566
message	alert
if i selected my new menu item my message box alert appears as expected

786582
webforms	asp.net
asp.net webforms based c# app

786586

the block content is dynamic and can contains any javascript code

786620
directory	folder
if i wanted to put another folder inside the flex directory and have the packages be com.mydomain.whatever

786631
javascript	dom
the javascript heap is not coupled to the dom - once scripts have executed and mutated the heap you can t unexecute them by removing their associated source code

786642
selected	button
my problem is that if i come in on the editing piece of the page selected a record then switch to the view with the tabcontainer the styling for the button does not show up for the tabcontainer just the header text

786652
virtual-machine	vmware
vmware note not confirmed for other virtualization applications if you give a virtual-machine multiple processors it will wait for both processors to become available and will reserve them even if it isn t using them

786661
implements	final
one final shot after viewing msdn was changing my handler to inherited from configurationsection rather than implements iconfigurationsectionhandler since it was technically deprecated in 2.0 hoping it was something regarding aspnet_regiis versioning

786667
buffering	streaming
the property in question is maxrequestlength which accorsing to msdn specifies the limit for the input streaming buffering threshold in kb

786679
ref	out
the first parameter parameter1 in the arrays should be by ref but i can t figure out how to pass it that way

786695
xapian	sphinx
i found that the best solution to the problem was to use lucene xapian ferret sphinx or whichever full-text indexer you prefer

786707
contains	elements
let s assume you are using an unordered list to contains the elements and you give it an id called nav

786712
code-coverage	gcov
the problem is that we re using the google toolbox for mac and the way that the tests seem to run doesn t actually generate code-coverage reports from gcov so the analysis i get is out of date unless i manually regenerate the coverage html after a build and go

786718
any	set
as to reading from a named pipe they can be treated like any other file with the caveat that they will block until the other side of the pipe is set up

786726
child-process	spawn
i m spawn a child-process that runs in a visible console windows it s a batch file that runs msbuild and i d like to have the output generated by the process display in the visible console windows as well as capture that output so i can process it in code

786757
associations	model
create an associations extension for any model that has_many videos or has_one video which allows us to overload the finder for videos in the associations

786800
websphere	ibm
there are a number of mature offerings about which i know next to nothing together with a new product from ibm itself websphere mq file transfer edition which is being actively developed and recently announced an updated version 7.0.1

786810
ssas	olap
i ve tried to encourage msft to write a linq to mdx provider but considering how few .net developers are actually trying to work with olap ssas outside of the ssrs space i don t think it will be high on anyone s priority list at the moment

786812
hash	md5
version 3 and version 5 uuids the least common use the md5 and sha1 hash functions respectively plus a namespace plus an already unique data value to produce a unique id

786814
entity-framework	ado.net
how to load varbinary max fields only when necessary with ado.net entity-framework

786840
subclassing	base-class
i d been lead to believe that the necessity for xml configuration and subclassing a particular base-class actionsupport has been deprecated

786840
getter	setter
is it necessary to define a public getter and setter for the data-members that you want to make available to the view message in the example above

786843
unicode	wstring
it s better to convert the utf-8 string to a unicode wstring with icu and then use the wstring variant of boost regex

786892
key-value	key
if app1 is the entry point for the user s then at logon app1 should create a key-value pair for that user that consists of the username and a generated key a guid for example

786894
value	field
the way you re doing it now just assigns a new value to the parameter not to the actual backing field

786901
getter	setter
i think the public getter and setter are needed

786909
perforce	git
as i ve mentioned in a previous question i m looking into migrating our source control from perforce to git

786924
configuration	logging
nor can i declaratively set this in a configuration because of the probability that a developer will not set this correctly and pollute the logging repositories

786951
unsigned	short
it fails to convert -1 to an unsigned short

786955
configuration	logging
use different logging configuration files for production and staging

786955
configuration	environment
1 keep in your app two different configuration files one for stage and one for production and have your application have some startup code that knows which configuration file to use based on the machine it is on or maybe some setting in the applications configuration file that sets an environment setting

786967
pixels	line
one class of hidden surface algorithms involves ray casting which is computing the intersection of the line from the camera through each pixels with objects which can have various representations including triangles algebraic surfaces nurbs etc.

786985
directory-structure	subdirectories
when we deploy the web project must we create the same directory-structure on a webserver webproject1 subdirectories even though we wonâ t put any aspx files into those directory

786987
ruby	php
with php running on a webserver i imagein it wouldn t be too hard to setup ruby to feed the php page the data required to generate and then ruby pick up the result

786998
itemtemplate	databound
when i add another listview or databound control to the listview s itemtemplate and set the datasource for that control in the codebehind the fields returned by the query seem to be unavailable to the nested listview

787022
configuration	logging
2 create a log4j or whatever logging framework configuration to configure logging

787022
configuration	environment
this keeps configuration for each environment very straightforward and to add a new environment is just adding a new file

787022
configuration	environment
this is more of the dry style of configuration assuming the configuration for each environment is pretty similar

787022
configuration	environment
3 create a start script that determines the environment probably based on the machine or some file on the machine and then loads the correct configuration

787040
wmv	asf
i guess silverlight would work best with microsoft technology so i want to use the asf format with wmv wma encoding

787040
stream	send
i guess that connecting lots of clients to the stream would be quite heavy on bandwidth so i should probably send the stream to a server and broadcast it from there

787041
json	xml
even though xml and json have different conceptual models hierarchic vs object struct

787047
javascript	dom
is there any way to retrieve a list of events of a dom in javascript

787048
contains	any
now suppose that inner loop contains a call to a function any function

787054
detect	move
i can implement code to detect that and move the labelatlas but is there a way to have cocos2d-x do it for me

787066
json	xml
jersey runs on amongst other things any servlet container can use best xml json etc parsers use pluggable validation bean validation api and so forth

787067
internet-explorer	firefox
is there an equivalent to internet-explorer s xdomainrequest in firefox or any of the other browsers

787073
publish-subscribe	message-queue
i think some kind of publish-subscribe message-queue would be up to the job but i don t want any massive extra complexity

787076
contains	lookup
is there any way to avoid doing two lookup in the dictionary -- the first time to see if contains an entry and the second time to update the value

787080
javascript	dom
how to find event listeners on a dom node when debugging or from the javascript code

787092
buffering	streaming
for other buffering streaming should first look if the stream offers a flush methods

787125
webrequest	webclient
i had to deal with this recently - another way to approach it is to use the fact that webclient is inheritable and change the underlying webrequest from there

787132
sbcl	ccl
my impression is that the fastest but most expensive route to doing application delivery across those three oses is to buy allegro but an alternative more work but cheaper would be to use ccl on os x corman on win32 and ecl or sbcl on linux

787132
glut	sdl
my impression is that the situation is constantly improving callback in cffi seem to work on most platforms now which is a big help in interfacing to most c toolkits but i ve been working more with gl glfw glut and sdl though not yet with lispbuilder mentioned by justinhj above which looks cool

787134
contains	set
the set first should contains the following elements

787142
checkbox	button
besides is clicking tools- internet options clicking the connections tab clicking the lan settings button checking unchecking the use proxy checkbox and clicking ok really that complicated

787142
click	mouse
i count five mouse click

787142
click	mouse
doing it from a new menu item on the tools menu would only save three click of the mouse

787142
click	mouse
edit sorry it takes six click not five only counted one for tools- internet options so a new item would save a whole 4 click of the left mouse button

787149
export	report
have a report generated from the db want to add an export button so they can get the same report in a excel readable sheet of some type

787165
repository	entity
if you create a repository class that encapsulates all of your persistence logic for a given entity such as personrepository but your repository class does not implement the unit of work pattern or the identity map pattern is it still considered a repository

787178
subtraction	addition
how about a simple math class with addition subtraction multiplication and such

787179
ftpwebrequest	ftp
i suggest you don t use ftpwebrequest for ftp access

787179
ftpwebrequest	ftp
ftpwebrequest is the most brain-dead ftp api i have every seen

787189
google-chrome	firefox
i ve heard that it has sqllite on board but what else makes it any different from google-chrome s application mode get the same functionality using firefox s prism plugin

787210
itemtemplate	itemscontrol
1 bind an itemscontrol to the collection and configure the itemtemplate to output the text preceded by a comma if it s not the last item in the collection

787212
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i have an app where my main view accepts both touchesbegan and touchesmoved and therefore takes in single finger touches and drags

787242
32-bit	64bit
since a double is 64bit and a float is only 32-bit see java s primitives documentation java gives you an error indicating that the float cannot fit inside the double

787251
web-platform-installer	iis-manager
if you don t see failed request tracing in the actions pane you ll need to add the feature to the server - either using the add role services wizard health and diagnostics tracing or through the web-platform-installer products server iis tracing and then close and re-open iis-manager

787255
python	ruby
languages such as ruby python and javascript are dynamically typed

787259
defined	declare
for example in c# you declare the type of a variables when you defined it like

787266
interpreter	runtime
a dynamic language is generally considered to be one that can dynamically interpreter generate code at runtime

787269
double	int
each value or variables has exactly one type double float int long etc...

787308
google-chrome	firefox
same managed programming interface but is implemented with the gecko engine from firefox and an alternate implementation with the webkit engine from google-chrome and safari

787323
groovy	scala
but some close approximations are in groovy clojure scala and the bean shell

787326
javascript	dom
the first book that gave me aha- this is amazing is dom scripting web design with javascript and the document object model

787330
aptana	pydev
so i downloaded the pydev extensions for aptana but it wants me to configure a python interpreter so i guess it actually doesn t have one

787348
substitution	replace
then do another substitution and replace the spaces with tabs each tab being 15 or something

787349
subclassing	base-class
one that i use regularly with great success is model where a many-to-many cross-reference relationship is accessed by a class that itself is a subclassing of the base-class in the many-to-many relationship

787368
any	set
in ib i set the size of the uiview to be 720x480 but it s not showing up any larger when i run

787397
any	set
note that this should also match any characters that are alphabetic not just the usual roman alphabet s set and therefore also matches accented characters etc

787400
touchesmoved	drawrect
touchx and touchy were instance-variables and they were getting reset in touchesmoved before each call to drawrect was complete

787400
touchesmoved	drawrect
therefore if i moved fast on the screens touchesmoved would get called then call drawrect then touchesmoved would get called again before drawrect had used touchx and touchy so the drawing would get out of sync with the boolean arrays backend

787400
touchesmoved	drawrect
to solve this i stopped using touchx and touchy in drawrect and started deriving the same point by using the dirty rect that was being passed in from touchesmoved

787449
error-code	hresult
the only other thing i can think of is to look into the hresult in the error-code property on the httpexception and see if there s something going on at the bit level where you can figure out the code and sub-code from that

787454
json	xml
of course you can always roll your own rpc using xml json binary - or use any of the other pre-canned comms stacks.

787489
procedure	records
at this time a stored procedure that deletes records is called

787489
procedure	records
this way when the stored procedure deletes 2 000 000+ records these donâ t replicate down to the subscribers

787497
udp	tcp
because it uses udp it won t unduly stress the network via tcp retries and the like snmp clients are or should be architected to handle dropped packets etc.

787733
iteration	elements
so basically in one iteration i am getting 3 elements

787743
selected	cell
i want to create a method for selected first cell in a current row so i wrote this

787743

787743
selected	cells
1 i selected some cells

787843
printf	scanf
the behaviour claimed by gcc in max lybbert s post is based on the tables om the c++ standard that map iostream behaviour onto printf scanf converters or at least that

787846
default	reset
i would not use a nan for this purpose - beyond the issue of just which nan to use and there are many it would be better to add a function-call api to reset to the default

787864
random-seed	generator
when you generator the hash together in the same statement in 2000 they end up with the same salt random-seed number at the beginning which makes them identical

787876
unpivot	pivot
using pivot and unpivot

787877

update i checked the google account authentication api and compared the request submitted by authlogic using ruby-openid-gem and openid-authentication-plugin with the example requests on the google account authentication api docs

787898
configuration	environment
i can t remember doing anything special to get this going although we may have had to manually set some environment variables in the teamcity configuration

787898
build-process	teamcity
when troubleshooting environment variables issues in teamcity i have found it useful to have part of the build-process run a dos set command env for linux and then look in the build logs to see what the actual environment is

787906
double	int
i have a second class typevalue and its defined as below which can hold one of int long and their unsigned variants float double std string

787906
double	int
operator double long int

787918
nested	assign
sometimes that means using variables if the usage scope is small or the type being assign to is unwieldy somekind of nested generic to repeat and adds clutter

787929
javascript	dom
the issue is javascript cannot read the dom of the xml from a client side xml xsl transform

788005
benchmarking	profiling
assuming i remember i ll be sure to post some profiling benchmarking on different time spaces radii configuration

788007
triggers	insert
create a triggers that fires instead of insert and if the value supplied is null set it to the current date

788007
triggers	insert
the triggers will supply the default on insert and on any update it should be guaranteed to have a value since the property changing methods won t allow it to be set to null

788007
triggers	insert
edit if you wanted to avoid the triggers and didn t mind the potential of a likely small difference between the actual time of insert and the column value you could implement the partial methods for created and set the backing field for the date directly

788008
mbunit	nunit
not nunit mbunit xunit.net etc

788008
rhino-mocks	typemock
rhino-mocks moq and typemock all depend on things that are not available in .net cf

you simply need to loop backwards over the string starting in the units column summing the single digits conversion times it s radix positioning multiplier

788044
firefox	safari
the user agent switching is not a mode all it does is makes safari report the ie firefox etc user agent -- so navigator.useragent will report the ua of a different browser

788047
digits	base
a hex number is just base 16 which means the digits from right-to-left have the value as

788062
digits	zero
an accumulator is set to zero at the beginning and multiplied by 16 before adding the equivalent value of each new digits to the loop

788062
integer	digits
if you know the digitss are in ascii then you can use expressions like and to convert the i-th digits to its integer value

788066
linux	unix
you can do that automatically by writing simple shell scripts for linux unix mac or batch files for windows xp and powershell for vista as john dunagan mentioned

788067
hosts-file	hosts
if you want to test it locally using the hostname and do not have access to dns you can add the appropriate entries to the hosts on your local machine c windows systemd 32 drivers etc hosts

788079
digits	base
in other words as you process each digits from left to right multiplying the previous total by the base effectively moving it left one positioning then add the new digits

788081
python	php
that said there s similar libraries for pretty much any language for python django php codeigniter and so on - use the language you re most familiar with or most interested in learning

788090
difference	count
also i don t know if you re count breaking on difference of 2 or more in your optimization but from mark s answer i already break on a difference of 2 or more and actually if the difference in the first letter it breaks after the first letter and even in spite of all those optimizations changing to using sets just blew them out of the water

788097
binary	hex
since four binary digits are identical to a single hex digit you can simply convert each hex digit to binary individually then string them together

788133
jquery	.post
.post render you can remove it with jquery

788137
jruby	mri
i have jruby and ruby mri install

jruby	mri
why are jruby and mri different in the way they treat gems

788220
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
for consistency with the enumerator linq operators throw an argumentnullexception not a nullreferenceexception

788233
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
argumentnullexception or nullreferenceexception from extension methods

788240
getter	setter
you should define a class state having two attributes code and name with getter and setter getcode and getname

788246
linux	bsd
sanos is mostly posix compliant so it is able to run most programs for bsd linux and other posix compliant oss

788246
linux	bsd
its security remains relatively untested compared to bsd linux however

788250
unmanaged	c++-cli
i m trying to figure out how to wrap a boost function member used as an event callback of an unmanaged class with a c++-cli class event

788261
perl	ruby
if a unix server os is assumed then java is a very productive choice well supported with lots of libraries but with a larger developer base at least in enterprisey environments and more management recognition than alternatives such as perl ruby or python

788265
python	perl
this is also true of c# .net but not true of other back-end languages such as perl or python

788290
javascript	dom
i m having a weird problem with some javascript dom code i ve ben playing with

finally we add to displaced r value and assign to r

788404
assign	add
displacement r four positioning add 0 nothing add result of logic operation s i 0xf and finally assign to r

788404
digits	zero
remember we shift 4 so we don t mesh digits bits because we are adding less significant bits with a gap of four zero

788409
silverlight	wpf
in wpf there is a visualtree property but no such property exists in silverlight

788411
launchd	daemons
i have a python daemons running as a part of my web app how can i quickly check using python if my daemons is running and if not launchd it

788460
primitive-types	reference-type
in java arrays of primitive-types are completely separate from arrays of reference-type

788461
lookup	any
i don t know any python but there should be a suitable data structure for the wordlist allowing for log-time lookup

788493
compact-framework	.net
for a installed client application then arguably java has the better portability - but with things like compact-framework micro framework silverlight etc .net is catching up

788493
silverlight	wpf
but since a lot of the wpf architectureis common with silverlight with moonlight as the mono twin for nix etc this allows the experience to be used on non-windows clients too

788498
defined	declare
one could defined multiple-instances of the declare class in a single statement

788517
postgresql	mysql
i know this is not what sqlite was designed for i am less interested in a postgresql mysql sql server based solution as i am trying to keep my app a light as possible with a minimal amount of dependencies

788523
base-class	inherited
so i thought use a profiling base-class and then inherited from that for the company account and individual account

788539
order	join
in order to achieve your desired result you need to do the predicate filterings and join in on single statement

788541
rewrite	rule
but you could use this abortion rule to quit the rewrite process if the request can be mapped to an existing file or directory

788543
interpreter	runtime

i tried some other variations but without definite rules about what the strings can contains i m going to have real problems matching any possible last item with a regular expression which makes this a nice lesson for me on their limitations

788645
rollback	commit
you should not be putting commit rollback logic in code like this

788646
any	set

788676
ruby	php
we help them package their server software which is typically based on php java or ruby together with a web server or application server apache tomcat the language runtime and a database typically postgres mysql into a self-contained easy to use installer

788693
contains	set
i was thinking would it be an option to create a class which just contains a set of variables which all classes could extend

788700
queue	fifo
rather than specifically coding in the two variables i implemented them inside of a fifo queue

788771
capacity	storage
each node also has a storage capacity for units allowing them to deal with variations in flow

788774
base-class	inherited
this doesn t appear to be possible as you ve seen dynamicmethods has no definegenericparameters methods and it inherited makegenericmethods from its methodsinfo base-class which just throws notsupportedexception

788805
thickbox	jquery
so copy pasting from thickbox s example with some jquery

788816
required	checked
the only thing that required ca access is to checked if the certificate is revoked

788818
capacity	storage
it might be possible that by specifying a number of days up front and utilizing storage capacity you can devise a strategy that gives you more throughput for that number of days although i suspect that someone smarter than myself could prove that even this is not possible

788822
host	root
when you receive a request for a secure transaction your browser checks the root of the certificate provided by the host you re connecting to with the public key to make sure it was really signed by the matching private key

788962
persistence	hibernate
the classic book java persistence with hibernate by bauer and king gives the following solution to the problem using hibernate extension

788973
pointers	stack
your code is obviously just a snippet so the pointers could be used and passed around elsewhere. generally it s much simpler to just construct them on stack so that destruction happens automatically

788974
http	ssl
i have an old site that now doesn t have an ssl and i want to block access to all http pages

788984
contains	set
my app generates a sql which basically gives a result set contains rows from all these tables

789118
swing	swt
a bit more specifically things like swing which has those jpanels jbuttons and so on you mentioned as ui components and swt are currently based on awt and work on top of it to render the ui and allow it to work as expected

789118
swing	awt
there s been a lot of reinventing the wheel to achieve swing awt kind of ui creation on the java s web side since it s a clever model like you seem to already know google web toolkit tries to do its part to make web seem more like a desktop application while in reality it merely automates the needed javascript ajax underneath to make the web page behave as if it was a desktop application

789124
instance-variables	nsobject
every object has at least one instance-variables inherited from nsobject called isa which is initialized to refer to the object s class

789134

it may be that asp.net doesn t fully support the onclick attribute for the listitem as opposed to say the selectedindexchanged attribute on the listbox dropdownlist etc controls

789262
ruby	php
netbeans is developed by sun and support not only java but also a few other languages php ruby python javascript

security - desktop applications run in a trusted environment where they are free to do anything where as web-applications run in a sand-boxed environment which make them inherently more secure for the client

789280
versioning	upgrade
and then again jumping major versioning numbers means increased revenue by way of user upgrade

789280
firefox	opera
there are cross-browser development issues between ie firefox opera etc but it s much easier to test and debugging than say running a complex application on a desktop system with varying graphics processors antivirus software or builds

789280
postback	ajax
responsiveness - web applications have slower responsiveness because of postback but ajax has made this a whole lot easier and more fun

789305
python	lua
learning windows api is definitelly good thing to do but i suggest using some of the scripting languages for that for faster experimenting lua with alien library python autoit etc..

789310
32-bit	64bit
when it s unlocked it works fine in both 32-bit and 64bit vista

789313
multiplication	algebra
the linear algebra comes in because the easy way to handle this computation is as a series of multiplication of 4 times

789314
perl	php
as far as using it from a bash script you should be able to use it in a perl one-liner see the -p and -e perl command-line options or in another language that supports perl-style regexes such as python php etc

789336
contains	set
you have no reason to set a fixed width on the div within the td by default div s are block elements which means they will fill the full width of there contains element

789336
margins	padding
either set padding on the td or margins on the div to achieve the same style

789356
centering	fixed
this would then give you two fixed columns on either side and a centering element which would take up any free spaces

789379
selected	listbox
gets or sets the currently selected item in the listbox

789379
selected	listbox
gets a collection containing the currently selected items in the listbox

789379
selected	listbox
for a multiple-selection listbox this property returns a collection containing all items that are selected in the listbox

789379
selected	listbox
for a single-selection listbox this property returns a collection containing a single element containing the only selected item in the listbox

789379
selected	listbox
the listbox class provides a number of ways to reference selected items

789379
selected	listbox
instead of using the selecteditems property to obtain the currently selected item in a single-selection listbox you can use the selecteditem property

789379
selected	listbox
if you want to obtain the index position of an item that is currently selected in the listbox instead of the item itself use the selectedindex property

789379
selected	listbox
in addition you can use the selectedindices property if you want to obtain the index positions of all selected items in a multiple-selection listbox

unsigned	short
unsigned int short unsigned int

789448
unsigned	short
unsigned int short unsigned int

789461
expression	evaluation
main characteristic of short circuit evaluation is that it stops evaluating the expression as soon as the result can be determined

789461
expression	evaluation
in languages with objects there can be situations where you can write boolean expression that can be evaluated only with short circuit evaluation

789461
variables	boolean
sql operates only on scalar variables no objects that cannot be uninitialized so there is no way to write boolean expression that cannot be evaluated

789461
expression	evaluation
that means that in sql you cannot write expression that is differently evaluated depending on using short circuit or full evaluation

789476
double	int
also while you re at it there is no need to convert to a string then to a double - you can convert directly from int - double and avoid the string conversions

789478

spring	guice
and yes you can use spring asp.net-mvc and guice for di together

789571
put	get
on top of that you get if you use their form tags you get nice behaviors when for example they put fred in your date field

789577
background-image	transparency
how it works is simple you have the small youtube image as transparency png or gif and then set the background-image as the larger image this will then give the effect of the smaller image being in the center with no extra markup

789590
instance-variables	subclass
i am trying to create a subclass of viewcontroller that include an arrays as an instance-variables which can then be referenced in the code that responds to button click from the view

if not it often has a copy constructor that copies in data from another object

789609
cakephp	symfony
php frameworks such as symfony cakephp and zend all have a series of utility classes tools and structured elements that let you avoid reinventing the wheel

789613
defined	declare
you could possibly declare a messagecontract and defined a header in there which your silverlight app could set to a known definedd value

789618
division	modulo
it s most likely that means integer division by modulo - the result is within 0..360 range

789630
order	add
potentially this could also mean easier hook handling if you add remove hooks often and out of order

789631
margins	padding
but one thing you should remember when floating elements is that they will only take up the spaces they require this include margins and padding unless you set a fixed width

789643
emacs	vim
for all purpose editors vim and emacs come to mind but i m afraid they just cannot compete against vs08 resharper when it comes to c# which i m using a lot on this moment

789643
emacs	vim
and like asked on the side how about refactoring in vim emacs

789655
treeset	treemap
a little look into treemap treeset and comparable would have probably pushed you through this problem

789681
.when	ready
.when you re ready for hibernate you can always write a new implementation and simply inject it into the place where your jdbc versioning used to be

789689
any	set
now if it s your program then you make the rules if you want to say that any given object will only be referenced by one variables ever and diligently enforce that in your code then just set a property on the object with the name of the variables

789689
constructor	object
given a reference to an object you can obtain a reference to the function that created it using the constructor property

789692
python	java
i would probably use setuptools to create an egg basically a java jar for python

selected	button
in the flash ide selected the textfield go to the properties panel and uncheck the button that has the characters ab in it

789722
udp	tcp
first you mean protocol in the sense of the available operations â a perfectly reasonable usage but confusing when you confound it with tcp vs udp that sort of thing as i did

789722
json	xml
you can have several different ways of formatting messages ie json xml or yaml say

789722
udp	tcp
named pipes but then my intuition says you also have the option of local and remote which means you also have the option of udp or tcp

789731
versioning	upgrade
our development process has us leaving dependencies external to the current build at the previous release versioning until a fix requires an upgrade

789744
uicontrol	uibutton

789930
order	add
then all you have to do is every time you read a string add a new node into the list in its order place

789931
bazaar	git
i ve heard good things about team foundation svn git bazaar and mercurial

789931
bazaar	cvs
i ve used cvs clearcase mercurial svn and a little bazaar

789936

789997
struct	unions
this tool will automatically convert the majority of c type definitions including struct enums unions and function pointers into their corresponding c# or vb.net types

790011
installation	building
it seems that there s also a way to set the debuglevel for a single handler by creating and building an opener with that but on my installation of python3 3.0b3 it s not actually implemented

790018
order	add
without knowing more i d guess all of these order items have name and price for example - and in future you might add more common stuff

790018
implements	abstract
vb.net can implements methods from an interface using a different name than the one specified in the interface but don t think the same goes for overriding abstract functionality

790026
silverlight	wpf
i would suggest silverlight or wpf for 2d

790034

not to troll too badly but most other databases postgresql firebird microsoft oracle db2 etc would handle the original query as an efficient semi-join

790035
oracle	mysql
as i believe oracle and sql server both do but mysql doesn t

790035
where-clause	sql
it s clearer than putting them in the where-clause as others have suggested and the above can do certain things in an ansi sql way with left outer joins that where conditions can t

790040
keydown	keyup
the trick is to stop the browser from execution the default behaviour on keydown and keyup

790042
external	root
prior to a build any layer other than the root one will do an update on the external folder s pulling the latest binaries in

790068
versioning	upgrade
they way i do it is to keep the dependencies at the last release versioning until a change actually requires an upgrade to the next snapshot

790070
slimdx	xna
if you don t want some of the overhead of xna i ve found slimdx to be a very nice little framework

790070
slimdx	xna
xna and slimdx give you access to shaders very fine grained control of alpha blending as well as the potential to easily extend portions into 3d later if needed

790073
jar	war
forcing maven to produce a war and a jar in the same module is possible but will cause you problems down the road

790078
linux	unix
but i don t think there s any equivalent for a generic unix linux system

790079
keydown	keyup
if memory serves when i implements this in webkit it was necessary to make the keycode be 229 on keydown for all keys typed in an ime for compat with ie -- but i cannot recall what the behaviour of keyup is

the comparison function isn t supposed to return a boolean type it s supposed to return a negative-number a positive number or zero which qsort uses to determine which argument is greater than the other

790134
filtering	grouping
it supports filtering mapping grouping etc

790146
arrays	loops
if you can guarrantee that is not a possible value ensuring that the arrays are sorted with a dummy infinite entry at the end and then manually coding the find so that the loops condition is a single test

790146
children	nodes
thus instead of accessing 4 times 1+1 times 2 5 1.2 cache lines per search the first 4 are in first cacheline the 5th in the second cacheline you will access 1 + 2 times 2 + 2 times 3 9 5 + 1 for the tree itself 2.8 cachelines per search the 1 being 1 nodes at the root 2 nodess being children of the root and the last 2 being grandchildren of the root plus the tree itself

790158

value	field
this way you can simulate a submission of the form by just creating an arrays with the form field value

790380
google-chrome	firefox
it is not a standard but it is supported at least on webkit safari google-chrome etc and gecko firefox

790394
hide	show
if you need some kind of hot state then you have to use small images which are absolutely positioning above the original image and show hide them using javascript

790403
dependency-injection	inject
that is easily solvable through dependency-injection where page or controller performs single data retrieval and then inject the data context object into every of the presenters views usually implementing some interface enabling that

790403
silverlight	wpf
in case of mv-vm pattern silverlight wpf same effect can be achieved through data bounding where the page would set its datacontext which would then be used from views itself

790408
order	add
in order to allow more kinds of characters you will need to add those to the pattern

790427
silverlight	wpf
now we all have strong gui frameworks like xaml for wpf silverlight apps

790435
linked-list	arrays
you qsort a linked-list by allocating an arrays of pointers one per list element

790455
python	php
i am not familiar with python but if it is like php this will have no advantage over method 2

790470
value	field
however it s very common for to be used to extract certain bits from a longer value where those bits were previously combined together with the | operator and where each bit field is independent of every other

790470
difference	zero
the fundamental difference with the generic or | operators that makes this reversible is that the original bits were all zero beforehand and the other bits in the word are left unchanged

790473
rar	zip
it s much better compressing than zip rar

790479
order	add
in order to show feedback to the user that the input is not acceptable you can use the beeponerror property or add a tooltip to show the error message

hash	tie
tie is a generic mechanism to hide an object class in a simple variable. tie hash is a convenient utility class to implement hash ties

790701
np-complete	np-hard
to be np-hard you have to prove a problem h is np-hard if and only if there is an np-complete problem l that is polynomials time turing-reducible to h ... in other words l can be solved in polynomials time by an oracle machine with an oracle for h.

790704
execution	exit
this will always happen no matter whether you exit the scope by throwing an exception-handling or by execution the odd return statement that your colleague sneakily added in the middle of your function or simply by reaching the end of the function

790724
any	set
without the sticky bit set any user with write and execute permissions for the directory can rename or delete contained files regardless of owner

790726
difference	factors
often you ll find that many of those deeply nested if s are either unnecessary or are repeated redundantly or are similar enough they can be reduced to one or a few functions if you factors out minor difference in otherwise repeated code

790726
required	checked
setting up and tearing down a cursor required some boilerplate and a loop with some error checked so his code always looked superficially complicated

790726
cursor	row
now as it happened this was in sybase t-sql which has a global for errors and a global for cursor status both of which he d check twice once when he got the first cursor row then once in a loop that iterated over all the other rows

790726
cursor	row
and he consistently confused the error variables error with the cursor state variables sqlstatus which is zero on success got a cursor row 1 on failure and 2 if there are no more rows in the cursor

790729
queue	fifo
this won t have queue fifo characteristics but will allow you multiple consumers in a very easy fashion

790743
uniform	points
you want to apply a function to each data points so the output data value have a uniform distribution

790744
dsa	rsa
a practical introduction to gnu privacy guard in windows recommends dsa and elgamal but i would like to know if rsa is good enough to use these days and if so what minimum key size should i use

790758
dsa	rsa
rsa dsa minimum today is 1024 bit actually so elleptical curves becoming more in use since they are faster and using shorter keys

790758
dsa	rsa
email clients using certificates nowadays - so it s separate thing x.509 but for using with rsa dsa most common option is sha-1 somewhat weak now

790767
selected	checkbox
if the problem is getting the id from the checkbox within a repeater then this article might help selected all checkbox in a gridview

790767
gridview	datalist
you want to access a control that is in a control that repeats layout gridview repeater datalist and the like using javascript

790767
rowdatabound	databound
the thing to remember is that you can access the generated clientid during the databound events rowdatabound itemdatabound which can then be used on the client side

790772
directory	folder
create a folder in the app views directory of your application called shared and store the partial there

790787
dsa	rsa
as for key size whether rsa or elgammel dsa i would recommend 2048 bit keys anyway now

790787
dsa	rsa
the difference is rsa is based on factorial math while elgammel dsa is based on logarithmic math neither can necessarily be considered better or worse to not though i that elliptic curve based stuff is closely related to the logarithms stuff

790795
deployment	install
i m trying to install my windows service app using visual-studio 2008 setup and deployment project

790798
value	field
be sure to set value for the field in onnewrecord

790810
methods	extend
i was wondering if it s going to confuse developers or make code better if we extend string class to have methods like this

790825
32-bit	64bit
if you ll be able to merge key i think you re using 32-bit while sqlite using 64bit so it s possible and fill data in sorted order i bet you will fill in your first gb with the same performance as second and both will be fast enough

790831
value	field
the error message tells you that that the empty string is not a valid value for an integer field - in this case the fields adr_id and evt_amtpersonssubs

790846
firefox	opera
firefox and opera work fine so im really not sure what i am doing wrong here

790850
triggers	insert
write a triggers on update that checks the current column against the new value being insert and rolls back the transaction if the values differ

790857
contains	any
the non-lgpl portion may not contains any part of the lgpl code except for very simple header-files

790857
lgpl	gpl
it must be clearly pointed out which part of the code is lgpl covered including its original copyright notice and the text of the lgpl including the gpl on which it is based

790857
lgpl	gpl
if the combined software display copyright notices during the course of running then the copyright notice for the lgpl covered portion must also appear here along with a link to the lgpl and gpl

790857
lgpl	gpl
those were just some restrictions but the lgpl also offers you a number of freedoms that other licenses like gpl don t

790857
copy-protection	drm
unlike gpl versioning 3 which prohibits using the code if you are implementing copy-protection or drm software you can use lgpl versioning 3 licensed code in an application which include copy-protection or drm

790857
lgpl	gpl
presumably that means that you won t actually be distributing this gpl data with it just the lgpl library that uses it

790867
arguments	default
when you open them the path to the html file is passes as an arguments to the default browser which interpreter and display the file

790880
attributes	properties
if you added the isreference properties to the datacontract attributes of the towel class like this

790894
authentication	login
once you architect your app in that way it becomes simple to add some code to the predispatch method of your restricted controllers to do authentication and redirect to a login page if it is not found or is invalid

790914
firefox	gecko
have look at the mono.webbrowser control - it embeds either gecko as used by firefox or webkit as used by safari into winforms without using activex

790915
textmate	emacs
i m talking about a more thorough sdk experience than just editing files with textmate emacs and copying them over to the device

790920
double-quotes	single-quotes
double-quotes are parsing whereas single-quotes are literals

790920
double-quotes	single-quotes
you can use variables inline with double-quotes but not with single-quotes

790924
double-quotes	single-quotes
inside double-quotes you can include variabless but inside single-quotes the variables name will be literal

790953
linked-list	tree
then ask them to do something slightly more difficult like traversing a tree data structure or reversing a linked-list

790969
shell	bash
on a posix operating system linux or os x you can write the following into your bash shell

790971
environment	building
cons does not pass the user s environment to the child processes that it forks to building the software

790979
order	join
you need to investigate union - create two queries that output the same number of and equivalent columns join the results using union then order by date and limit results to the top 5

790997
any	set
the other is to enforce a consistent set of columns you need to represent any object which can possibly be null -- usually stuff like type title body date img_id or something of the sort -- and use a union as suggested by the other poster

791001
core-animation	core-graphics
tweetie could be very probably is using apis from the non-cocoa frameworks such as core foundation core services core-graphics and core-animation

791005
python	c++
if you don t want these in-place solutions then your python code can be directly translated to c++ with a bit of extra code to deal with the fact that index out of bounds is bad news in c++

791021
postgresql	mysql
several have been built on top of open-source technologies like mysql and postgresql but none are available for free

791021
greenplum	vertica
if you are in the buying mood check out these companies greenplum asterdata netezza vertica

791024
directory	folder
look into the repository directory and you ll find a hooks folder with a ton of sample scripting

791060
children	nodes
if a right nodes has no children then you process and delete it

791060
children	nodes
for some algorithms not for this problem tail recursion would allow you to use recursion and have o 1 space but since any particular nodes may have several children and hence there is work to do after the recursive call o 1 space tail recursion is not possible

791062
children	nodes
if you don t care about the order in which you traverse the tree you could assign an integral mapping to the nodes where the root is 1 the children of the root are 2 and 3 the children of those are 4 5 6 7 etc

791062
children	nodes
if you have nodes n you can find the children at 2n and 2n+1

791086
ruby	php
since i didn t want anyone else to go through the headaches that i had when configuring their mac development environment i ve written a 7 step guide to installing ruby on rails mysql apache with php and phpmyadmin on osx leopard

791090
value	field
of course you only need to have c# enums if your code does something specific depending on the value of the type field

791093
python	ruby
no python internals take great care to make built-in types not mutable -- very different design choices from ruby s

791093
python	java
it s not possible to make object monkeypatchable without deeply messing with the c-coded internals and recompiling the python runtime to make a very different version this is for the classic cpython but i believe exactly the same principle holds for other good implementations such as jython and ironpython just s c java and s c c# respectively

791096
default-value	default
the usage of the default keyword in generic code to return the default-value for a type

791119
children	nodes
as you visit a nodes you point its left-child pointer to its parent its right-child pointer to the last time you took a right turn on your path which is to be found in the parent s right-child pointer at this moment and store its real children either in the now-redundant parent s right-child pointer or in your traversal state resp

791135
standard-library	iostream
the standard-library does this for some of the iostream classes in the standard header

791148
textbox	button
the difference is not big i mean a textbox doesn t turn into a button

791168
command-line	cmd
as far as i recall adding -- as an option on the cmd-line will cause the rm cmd to consider all the remaining arguments literally so the cmd

791172
selected	listbox
i want to use validationrules to verify that a few listbox controls have at least one item selected

791183
python	c++
and python is slower above hundred times than c++ in execution time 100 1

791184
put	get
this will work even if you are not root since it only fetch the source code to the app-name and put it in the current directory which is easier than having to track down the source and there is a better chance to get it work since you download the version that should work on your system

791187
attributes	properties
so must be there s some attributes that needs to be set on the idvalue properties that lets linq do its thing

791201
sql-server	oracle
if you already are polished in oracle rdbms i dare say you could churn out a site a lot faster than learning sql-server

791201
oracle	mysql
i have developed applications on asp.net using various databases including access mysql oracle sybase and sql server

791205
compatibility	platform
while mono has quite a lot of momentum it doesn t have the same degree of compatibility with .net as java does on the various platform it supports

791221
entity-relationship	diagram
just wondentity-relationshiping whats the diffentity-relationshipence between entity-relationship diagram 1 and entity-relationship diagram 2

791227
shell	bash
how can you make the newest bash active such that i get it for my login shell

791244
shell	bash
run the following code for instance to change your shell to the newest bash installed by macports

791289
any	set
is there any reason do not use fusebox.mode development-full-load set in fusebox.xml

791290
isinstance	getattr
you can do introspection in elixir as you would anywhere in python -- get all names of attributess of class foo with dir foo extraction an attributes given its name with getattr foo thename check the type of the attributes with type theattr or isinstance etc

791290
isinstance	getattr
module inspect in the python standard-library may be a friendlier way to do introspection but dir getattr isinstance c are perfectly acceptable in many cases

791294
visualvm	btrace
visualvm with btrace or the built in trace claims to help with tracing but i haven t been able to find any tool that shows timing on methods calls

791294
average	min
i found one of the answers i wanted in the qeurystatistics which reports for each compiled query the cache hits and misses the number of times the query has run how many rows were returned and the average max and min execution times

791298
value	field
you want to test for null in the field value

791311
any	set
i have set the exchange server settings to convert any mail to plain text

791346
base-class	subclass
abstract will specify a methods which is not implemented in an abstract base-class and that must be implemented in a concrete subclass

791354
compatibility	platform
for compatibility with older versioning of the java platform it is permitted but discouraged as a matter of style to redundantly specify the abstract modifier for methods declared in interfaces.

791359
ruby-on-rails	cakephp
just as a background info i have knowledge of php have even used cakephp to create a whole app rather easily and ruby-on-rails

791360
positioning	slider
yes the only way to make elements slider off the page is using fixed and or absolute positioning outside of simply making the elements larger than the page

791380
webforms	asp.net
it ignores many of the sophisticated functionality available in asp.net webforms and is often compared to classic asp

791380
webforms	asp.net
as a .net beginner with abundant experience in other programming languages i would recommend that you continue your studies of asp.net using webforms

791381
webforms	asp.net
asp .net webforms what is usually called asp.net is clearly different but if you are learning for the sake of finding jobs it s what will pay for a long time there are lots and lots of sites both internal and public-facing built on asp .net webforms

791382
webforms	asp.net
i would choose asp.net mvc over asp.net webforms for one reason testing

791382
asp.net-mvc	webforms
testing asp.net-mvc is orders of magitude easier than webforms due to the ability to mock or replace parts of the core api

791395
swing	swt
swt is an alternate toolkit for java that has slightly less cross-platform compatibility than swing but is still popular nonetheless

791413
put	get
this dereferences one time too many - myballs is an arrays of pointers or put another way a pointer to the first element of an arrays of pointers - just lose the asterisk in front of myballs and now you ll get the pointer from which you can access the struct or alternatively turn the - into a .

791423
configuration	logging
it allows for much more fine grain control over exceptions through policies wrapping policies propagation policies replacement policies logging policies etc. you can use it to standardize the way you code an exception block and use configuration to handle precisely what happens with a particular type of exception

791446
implements	abstract
all the functions are automatically abstract since they need to be implements

791455
order	add
in order for the data provider to appear as a provider in application drop-downs i have to add the provider in the machine.config s section

791478
value	field
the user will start to fill it by adding value to one or more field but on my case he can create a navigation to another page before we posting-back the current page and thats ofcourse couses the controls to loose its value

791483
erlang	scala
possibly consider something like scala or erlang which are setup to handle this type of long lived messaging better

791486
versioning	upgrade
but the versioning of rubygems and ruby-on-rails shipped with leopard are now outdated though so you ll need to upgrade these before you go too far

791486
versioning	upgrade
to upgrade your private copy of ruby-on-rails whenever a new versioning comes along in future it s just this again

791495
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade the rtm versioning of visual-studio 2008 with sp1 the entitydatasource control doesn t appear in the data grouping of the web project toolbox by default

791537
complement	negation
this operation is a complement not a negation

791537
complement	negation
the algorithm for negation is complement increment

791541
device-driver	hardware
certain hardware level accesses are only possible practical via assembly when writing device-driver

791544
value	field
i want a function code which will return the value that the user submitted for the field whose name id is passed on to it

791544
selected	textbox
it shouldn t matter whether the field is a textbox textarea radio or selected

791566
value	field
this will give you the value on of the field with name a_21 so matter what the type of field

791572
duplicates	contains
in an effort to avoid duplicates markup i ve created a master page that contains the formview and placed a contentplaceholder inside the formview

791572
databound	formview
with an existing record the formview sees through to the databound controls field1 etc and populates them with the correct data

791572
updating	updates
but when inserting or updating it doesn t see them and they re not include in the insert or updates

791572
databound	formview
is there a way to provoke the formview on the master page to see through to the databound controls inside the contentplaceholder

791581
entity-framework	ado.net
the function in the model is never created and i am unable to execute this stored procedure using the ado.net entity-framework

791581
any	set
i ve set the return type for the import function to none seeing this stored procedure does not need to return any recordsets or values

791583
hide	show
i tried to show an error message using the jquery effect fadeto and tried to hide the message by append a button and using fadeout but doesn t seem to work

791589
arrays	loops
loops through the file once and put each name with 5 years into some arrays

791589
arrays	loops
loops through your arrays of names and write it to the streamwriter then flush and close

791600
ildasm	cil
for cil msil i can write the code in a text-editor and compile decompile with ilasm ildasm

791618
pylons	django
could any one suggest good python-related podcasts out there it could be anything about python or its eco-system like django pylons etc

791640
serialization	marshalling
the terms usually used are serialization and deserialization or sometimes marshalling and demarshalling

791645
font-size	display
i ve tried setting the style with myuitextfield.setstyle font-size 20 before and or after the call to addchild neither of which made an impact on the display as per what i noted above

791645
order	add
in order to add it to the next row i need to be able to calculate the width of the text

791647
unsigned	integer
255 is being processed as an integer literal and causes the entire expression to be int based rather than unsigned char based

791651
unmanaged	c++-cli
simply write the tests in c++-cli then you can test both managed and unmanaged code in a single framework

791694
libcurl	openssl
i m posting data to a http server using libcurl compiled with openssl using visual-studio 2008 in windows and it all works fine with curlopt_ssl_verifypeer set to 0

791718
json	xml
just connect send your query and it will return xml or json in some cases

791726
licensing	lgpl
from using rxtx in the past my understanding is that if you are using the gnu.io interfaces directly then the standard lgpl licensing terms will apply

791727
firefox	opera
explorer mozilla firefox opera and

791742
asp.net-mvc	webforms
don t use the asp silverlight runat server control it s a webforms control and doesn t really belong in the asp.net-mvc world

791743
drawimage	draw
i ve noticed that if i free that memory block after creating the image it wouldn t be draw calling drawimage won t produce anything

791748
web-deployment	web
and since web-deployment projects wdp tool is only used for manipulation the output created by aspnet_compiler.exe i donâ t understand how vs 2008 also has an option for using wdp with web application projects

791753
insertion-sort	quicksort
techniques like merge sort quicksort insertion-sort and other comparison sorts can handle different data types and efficiency with a lower limit of o nlog n

791764
contains	any
meaning the arrays that rtblog.lines was originally referencing the arrays initially referenced by lines before the resize and lastly any strings not contains in lines after the resize all get garbage collected

791789
document	element
you could add this restriction or instead of a subquery based on the document you can make the subquery based on the question element itself

791792
contains	elements
this should work because xml contains the question elements

791797
json	xml
most alternatives json yaml ini files are easier to parse than xml

791797
json	xml
yet some people will say that xml has some advantage over json or python

791799
json	xml
or if you need to map pojos to and from xml or json packages like xstream or jaxb automatically generate the mapping logic

791799
persistence	hibernate
to avoid tedious jdbc programming try a persistence manager like ibatis or hibernate

791799
templating	markup
templating systems like freemarker and velocity make it much easier to generate markup

791820
www-mechanize	lwp
you should use such modules as lwp and http-request common or www-mechanize

791826
compareto	equals
if people subclassing your given class are allowed to add state members then you already have enough of a headache with functions like equals and compareto that clone is jut one more case where you need to require special handling

791829
apache	vhosts
so my vote is to skip a night of drinking a month and learn ubuntu servers setup dns vhosts apache etc capistrano deployment svn and mongrel nginx passenger while you learn ruby-on-rails

791830
textarea	textbox
i need a textbox or some type of multi-line label control which will automatically adjust the font-size to make it as large as possible and yet have the entire message fit inside the bounds of the textarea

791833
parentheses	operators
although it would be possible to get all the operators precedence correct with enough parentheses in the arrays element references as originally written the result will be essentially unreadable by humans

791836
processor	cpu
the internals of processor inside a single family have changed a lot over the years so that eu reference would need to be clarified with the exact cpu model

791836
any	set
as an analogy to your m68k experience the instruction set for 68000 010 020 030 040 and 060 are mostly the same but their internals are really different so any reference to an internal name needs to come with their part number

791837
groovy	java
groovy appears to be the best choice from the java interoperability standpoint

791837
scala	java
and odersky s experience writing javac means scala s raw performance is not far from java s which is impressive

791837
groovy	java
update 4 26 11 take a look at groovy++ a statically typed extension of groovy which has performance equivalent to java

791839
webserver	security
in general running as cgi has lower performance but better for security - you have no access to webserver internals as with mod_perl and mod_php so using vulnerabilities is harder

791853
integer	digits
also be aware that single-digits integers in your lexer will not be matched as integer they will come out as digits

791858
selected	checkbox
from xcode you can right-click the project and select add - existing files... when you have selected all your files click add then select the checkbox at the top copy files...

791864
updating	updates
and you can publish deploy them using click once which allows easy updating of the clients when you make changes updates

791865
asihttprequest	cfnetwork
this doesn t answer your question directly but you might consider looking into ben copsey s asihttprequest library which wraps around cfnetwork classes and include asynchronous threaded request code that takes a lot of work out of doing this properly

791878
while-loop	loops
that means it can be larger than the library would normally handle but for that to work your processing loops must fetch a row from the api on each cycle -- this means a while-loops calling mysql_fetch_assoc each time

791888
associations	model
in order to model this in db you need to introduce an associations table let s say paymenthistory

791897
jar	war
i have a j2ee app deployed as an ear file which in turn contains a jar file for the business layer code including some ejbs and a war file for the web layer code

791897
jar	war
the ear file is deployed to jboss 3.2.5 which unpacks the ear and war files but not the jar file this is not the problem it s just fyi

791908
temporary	copy
my current solution is to copy the file to the server s temporary directory then use the absolute path of the copy

791909
triggers	insert
what i m suppose to do is use a triggers to update the quantity sold in the inventory table when an order is placed in the concessions_sold table an insert is used

791925
python	java
any language would work for me since this is not part of the final product but i prefer one of these languages python java c# or matlab

791927
perl	awk
this could even be implemented with an awk or perl program like

791940
constructor	object
how do i design a factory class webgettaskfactory that creates new object webgettask when the new object require a dependency httpservice on their constructor without simply injecting and passing the dependency httpservice

791942
gethashcode	equals
this seems to allow its correct use in dictionary and collection classes that rely on the equals and gethashcode methods for determining if the value already exists

791943
constructor	private
sometimes the best strategy is to completely disallow automatic allocation by making the constructor private and using a factory method to create new instance

791945
temporary	copy
either you don t store pointers in the vector and use a instead or you explicitly allocate a new copy of the temporary object when you add it

791958
constructor	object
okay there s nothing specifically wrong under the lod about passing an implementation object a plugin in the constructor

791958
implements	abstract
call it taskfactory â your intuition was leading you right there â with a ctor that takes an ioservice which i ve just invented as being the abstract interface implements by httpservice

791964
put	get
i don t think i would put either in production unless it was as a stopgap to get something critical out of the door in a major hurry or as a proof of concept or prototype

791975
constructor	object
there are two ways of di the first one is a constructor one which is usefull when only one or two object are injected and a setter one actually as many setters as needed

791980
temporary	copy
you should copy the contents to a temporary file potentially with a cache because trying to get to internal files of the application container is a dependency you want to avoid

791981
constructor	object
i saw an example of this once where a student filled a vector with pointers to value object in a very long constructor

791981
constructor	object
the vector was a member field in the object so it still existed after the constructor ended

791981
constructor	object
because the constructor was so long the value object that the vector pointed to were not overwritten until halfway through a different function

791992
constructor	object
if you re attempting to use the stl list and encountering an error it might be the case that the object you re trying to place inside does not implement a copy constructor

792017
shell	bash
i have terminal.app set to accept utf-8 and in bash i can type unicode characters copy and paste them but if i start the python shell i can t and if i try to decode unicode i get errors

792028
subtraction	addition
modern computers since circa 1970 use a representation of integer data called two s-complement in which addition and subtraction work exactly the same on both signed and unsigned numbers

792028
unsigned	zero
unsigned shifts in zero

792030
git-repo	repo
every git-repo contains the entire revision history so cloning the repo gives you access to the latest commit plus everything that came before including the tag you re looking for

792032
internationalization	localization
that combined with decent message catalog support makes internationalization and localization pretty easy except for right-to-left languages

792076
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
you ll need a crossdomain.xml or clientaccesspolicy.xml in-place on the remote servers to allow silverlight to communication with them

792091
click	mouse
for example i d like to have details that are hidden until i click on an expander in the node or double click the node or hover with the mouse

792092
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i ve updates the color changing methods so that the background-color can be animated when called from touchesbegan but not implicitly animated when called from touchesmoved

792118
attributes	properties
by my understanding this will change the compiled assembly controlled by attributes and is typically used to add tracing to all methods properties

792125
triggers	insert
remove the if inserting it s unnecessary since your triggers is limited to after insert

792138
document	element
have you tried creating a scripting element setting the src attributes and adding it to the document body

792146
value	field
your best bet is the javascript approach look into form field focus value and see if you can make it drop focus

792160
put	get
i ve put an instance of the client proxy for the wcf service into a property on the app class so i can get it from anywhere in the app

792190
put	get
just to get my program compiling i just want to put placeholders for now

792194
google-chrome	firefox
the following effectively resolved the disabled buttons not showing up as grayed out in firefox and google-chrome

792195
toolchain	gnu
on linux with the gnu toolchain i know how to control exported symbols from a shared library with a version scripting gcc -wl --version-scripting symbols.map but i would like to list exported symbols on the command-line instead

792199
arguments	default
note that if your dirpath arguments has several leading directory only the last one will be include by default

792207
any	set
set any other properties in this wizard

792211
bison	yacc
lex and yacc flex and bison

792212
postgresql	mysql
i m running mysql and postgresql on a netbook

792214
contains	any
calling an asynchrounous web methods because it contains i o operations will not necessarily provide you with any benefit unless you have significant processing to complete while you wait for the results

792215
bison	yacc
it is not clear that there is a c++ target but the chances are high that the c target can easily be used with c++. i m still old school and tend to use yacc or bison but that s because i m familiar with it rather than because it is still the best though it is still good

792218
wamp	php
you could try wamp server that includes apache mysql and php all in one package

792219
required	checked
i guess i need to use a property called tortoisesvn logminsize but i don t get how to add that property globally for all repositories so that anyone on the team is required to input x chars when checked in any code for any project

792225
malloc	free
so while it may tell you something about theoretical limits it says very little about the performance of real garbage collectors versus real implementations of malloc and free

792225
malloc	free
a study that i like better took real programs and compared explicit malloc and free with hans boehm s conservative garbage collector

792225
malloc	free
- in real programs originally written to use malloc and free garbage-collected versions run at about the same speed but require twice as much memory

792233
benchmarking	profiling
if you are really worried use a profiling or write a benchmarking

792244
google-chrome	firefox
this effectively resolved the disabled buttons not showing up as grayed out in firefox and google-chrome

792245
click	mouse
but the problem is when i double click on the items in the list it runs through the code to add a component to the jframe but it just never shows up is this because i am using a mouse event to build it after run time or something

792250
value	field
your fckeditor instance will behave just like another form field and you can treat it as such when you get value from it on the server side

792273
shell	bash
if you are writing a shell script of some sort bash batch you can invoke the convert command which is part of that package. otherwise all of the functionality of imagemagick is available through libraries c perl etc which you can try linking in with your program

792274
bazaar	git
it is often the case that scientific programming requires input output of gigantic files and that kills performances very quickly on every dvcs i know of bazaar hg git

792277
linux	unix
this is probably easiest to do in a unix linux environment but it s doable on win32 with the same tools

792281
version-control	bazaar
i m using bazaar for version-control which i m very happy with

792282
groovy	java
obviously groovy is slower than straight java

792283
reflection	runtime
put simply reflection is when you find out about details of an assembly at runtime

792303
sql-server	mysql
i want to avoid a dependency on an rdbms ie sql-server mysql as i would be using it on many different computers and do not want installation hassles

792319
bazaar	git
bazaar is such a fast moving target and presumably so is git that any claims about performance are likely to be out of date by the time you read them

792336
text-rendering	gdi
better at x ofcourse ms improved on a bunch of other aspects like rendering fewer updates that gdi scaling resolution independence transparency layouts non-absolute text-rendering animation video support an improved event model et

792349
web-deployment	web
it s useful to keep in mind that web application projects and web-deployment projects were the only way to create web projects until .net 2.0 and visual-studio 2005

792370
instances	private
no private fields can be accessed even from other instances within a methods of the same class

792370
getter	setter
even if the getter or setter just wraps a private field it is good style to have these setter and getters as opposed to allowing direct field access

792383
private-members	object
in java and c# btw code within a class has access to the private-members of any object of the same class

792419
contains	elements
in the event that two are the same length you can extend this further to produce a list contains the elements that are all the same length

792423
google-chrome	safari
oh and don t forget your safari google-chrome and ff2 testing

792440
virtual-machine	vmware
on vmware you can choose between bridged and nat networking for a virtual-machine

792444
xsd	xml
i am open to changing the format itself slightly to give different xml if that will make a simpler clearer xsd

792455
uitableview	uiview
you could create a custom uiview and set it as the first section header of your uitableview

792470
contains	sorted
you would like a vector that contains the same objects as the second vector but sorted in the order described in the first vector

792475
multi-user	account
i m working on a multi-user multi-account app where 1 account can have n users

792476
subtract	add
to get the next integer you add the next fp number to your running total round the running total then subtract the integer running total from the rounded running total -

792494
output	cat
as you re explaining it the command cat named.local | grep zone gives you an output a little like this

792512
any	set
does any one has idea about what i am doing wrong here or is there any attributes that has to be set for grouping also as in the case of users

792520
directory	folder
removed .svn lock files from each of the directory leading to the images folder

792520
directory	folder
moved the images directory to home folder and committed deleted images

792522
temporary	copy
my best guess at doing it exclusively with php is to store files above the web root then copy them to a web accessible folder temporary but this seems highly inefficient and i couldn t think up any way to remove them after the download has finished

792525
getter	setter
add your indexed getter and setter too of course

792537
output	mode
in this mode you can check user s auth before and if it s ok output file contents to user otherwise send him to login page

792540
quirks-mode	doctype
for the doctype the primary purpose is to get the browser out of quirks-mode

792557
json	xml
i m reading a http post and the body of the http request can be either json or xml

792566
json	xml
as far as parsing goes i d recommend to parse both xml and json to some arbitrary internal representation ir so that your code higher up the stack will not be concerned with such details

792569
any	set
you should not use readfile oder any forwarding filepointer because you have to set the headers yourself and the don t support http range

792572
dictionary	map
this could be a model object or it could just be a bag of values dictionary map hashtable

792621
push	pull
eventually i realized it would make much more sense to have a separate repository a bare clone that doesn t have any files in it then have computer b push to it and computer a pull from it

792632
implements	extends
hadoop mapper interface extends jobconfigurable and closeable but i see a big difference because it s a framework that uses user code implements those interfaces versus a service that could have multiple implementations

792638
queue	fifo
rather than letting those methodss directly change state i put their parameters by converting them to a command object in a fifo queue erlang s mailbox and a react methods which processes that queue

792644
httplistener	http
http perhaps pox over http using httplistener at the .net server

792644
.net	wcf
soap perhaps using wcf via servicehost at the .net end

792651
msbuild	nant
there are third party equivalents to msbuild like nant that can do the same thing

792661
xsd	xml
the xml schema is written in relax ng since it seemed like a neater and more modern than xsd and dtd loose assumption

792662
udp	tcp
http commonly used tcp udp

792662
json	xml
xml json or binary encoded messages

792665
instances	private
so private means private to the outer class not private to the same class within the same instances

792665
value	field
hand on heart 99 of the time getters just return a field value

792665
value	field
there is relatively little value in making a field private if you are going to add a getter and setter

792673
.when	ready
.when i perform the following updates statement on the above view it is ready within one second

792712
scala	java
you might also want to look into scala s actors you could see them as a kind of java library see for instance the busy java developer s guide to scala dive deeper into scala concurrency

792714
value	field
the reason why these are preferred over public field is that they allow you to have only a getter making the property read only do additional bookkeeping like calculating derived field and validation of set values throwing a propertyvetoexception when the value is not acceptable

792714
getter	setter
many people misunderstand the concept and believe that encapsulation just means writing setter and getter for private properties instead of making them public - and then rightfully consider that idiotic

792720
python	java
a database is to store data not a general purpose programming language like java python or c

792727
exception-handling	try-catch
for the following initialization the try-catch in the body of main will not catch the exception-handling thrown by the constructor and so your program will simply die immediately and you probably won t even be able to use a debugger to find the cause

792737
space	input
first trim the user input and remove anything strange punctuation quotes basically everything w except white space of course

792764
virtualbox	vmware
run vmware virtualbox

792770
automapper	bltoolkit
try automapper or custom mapping in bltoolkit

792782
variables	boolean
to save space the boolean are packed together this way a boolean variables only takes up 1 bit

792782
variables	boolean
you can think of it as doing something like an arrays indexing operation with a byte 8 bits becoming like an arrays of 8 boolean variables so maybe that s your answer use an arrays of boolean

792784
defined	declare
in part 2 the two are not equivalent - the first declare an anonymous enumerated type and defined enum1 to be of that type

792786
licensing	lgpl
plus the lgpl licensing which allows anybody to write opensource and closed source commercial apps without paying any fees - the commercial support licenses are optionally

792793
delphi	c++
very easy to make an interface generate code for .net delphi php c++ whatever also supports soap but we use the binary format for speed

792805
selected	textbox
i.e i have a textbox used to search on username and i would like to selected all users with the username like textbox value

792810
xml-serialization	xml
i don t know if it is possible in your case situation but have you already though on using the xml-serialization classes and deserialize the xml by the xmlserializer classes directly into instances of your custom class instead of doing it all manually

792813
traffic	wan
the wan traffic is killing your app and it sounds like you have major refactoring to do

792815
bitwise-operators	operators
be aware that both the bitwise-operators and the shift operators tend to promote everything to int which may unexpectedly require casting

792852
moss	wss
the wss moss log file reader from starznet adds a link in central administration

792854
contains	set
i suggest you create a dataobject to contains the data from db and set all relevant data on each object and then databind the repeater on the list

792889
carbon	cocoa
also as a side note it is generally advisable to use cocoa instead of carbon for most applications

792950
python	c++
see how do i use python libraries in c++

792959
python	tcl
all of tcl tk tkinter and python with pthreads support

792968
mime	rfc
the relevant rfc for the html forms versioning of the multipart mime format is rfc 1867

792980
xsd	xml
you could just create a typed dataset from the xsd and then fill one of those objects with the xml

792989
literals	hardcode
i m writing a utility program to make a few pages multi-language i.e add asp literals for hardcode text etc i think regex is sufficient for this purpose but if there are better tools please let me know web stuff isn t my area...

792999
authentication	login
when visiting the server with a browser the browser prompts the user with an authentication login windows

793015
font-size	width
in my application the label has a width of 100 height of 500 and font-size of 400

793046
deployment	install
at the moment my programs are run by a testsuite with a pythonpath definition that i perform by hand before the deployment iow i don t perform the install but i don t think i am doing it right

793046
contains	set
in other words the only way i have to test the program without deploying is to execute the program with pythonpath set to the dir contains the deps and the library that program uses installed by the make scripting which as i said downloads compiles and installs everything in a temporary directory

793049
javascript	dom
if you just need to play around with the actual elements on the constructed page then you can use javascript to modify the dom

793074
htmlpurifier	xss
i use htmlpurifier to clen the possibly xss injection in html data and of course i use the parametrized queryes

793084
deployment	install
but yes ideally you should automatically do a full install deployment of your program before running the tests

793096
postgresql	mysql
since it sounds like you are going for the classic lamp setup you may as well install postgresql or mysql

793100
exception-handling	try-catch
currently i can t see any single point where i could wrap a try-catch around and which would catch all exception-handling that could occur

793114
loading	gif
i would like to use a gif which display loading while the javascript function loads and hide it when the function is fully loaded

793123
artifactory	nexus
we used to use artifactory but ended up switching to nexus a while back

793146
vhdl	rtl
i recommend the chu pong p. rtl hardware design using vhdl

793170
command-line	cmd
it doesn t look very pretty but i found it helpful as i wanted my app to be run from the cmd-line with feedback in there and then for certain cmd options i would display the wpf windows

793174
order	join
i would now like to blindly join the two table together as follows based on their order not on a matching columns i can also guarantee both tables have the same number of rows

793177
ethernet	packets
even if you could upgrade to gigabit ethernet the protocols still demands that your client idles a few milliseconds between two consecutive network packets so other hosts get a chance to talk too

793177
.when	ready
.when the results are ready for display the clients get only the results little data

793182
value	field
or insert the value into a temp table with an extra identity-column and join the 2 temp tables on the identity field

793192
python	perl
if you re going to develop foss apps for wide distribution then linux ansi c perl python apache mysql lamp stack is the way to go

793201
loading	gif
when you start loading the javascript code display the gif

793204
double	int
if you look in the documentation for string format specifiers you can find out exactly what characters to use for each type of replacement int double object etc

793219
order	join
if your tables aren t two large you could create two temp tables in memory and selected your content into them in a specific order and then join them on the row number

793221
order	add
any order you get is arbitrary unless you add an order by clause

793225
deployment	install
if your deployment is brittle maybe write a test which checks that the install archive is complete rather than trying to install you re not testing the system s install you re testing your package

793227
ubuntu	linux
elfedit would have probably been a nice tool but i have not found a version for linux in particular ubuntu

793230
attributes	properties
for a list of all attributes that can be used by objective-c properties take a look at the documentation

793243
convention	standards
ignore it and keep your own naming convention or follow up the microsoft standards

793244
authentication	login
hmm sounds like you want something like oauth for the authentication and openid support to allow people to easily login

793261
javascript	dom
when rendering the page after submit create a piece of javascript on the fly which switches the tab on dom ready

793267
organization	naming
rather have a sane naming convention and be consistent with your organization

793267
variables	boolean
don t overuse php s dynamic typing by setting the variables to a string in one place and a boolean somewhere else then expecting the boolean tests to make sense

793271
stream	send
when i click connect the program send the word get over the stream to which i have to response with a list of allready connect ip-adress and then a newline contains only a

793274
msbuild	nant
nant is designed to work in the windows .net environment so it can already do msbuild and nunit tasks

793291
struts-1.x	struts
i would like to know the difference between struts-1.x and struts 2.x

793292
webforms	asp.net
i reckon it s better than asp.net ajax for webforms

793302
subtraction	addition
you can also carry out operations such as addition and subtraction to calculate time between two timespans or to calculate a new time based on a time and duration

793311
active-directory	adfs
windows 2003 r2 introduced a product called active-directory federation services adfs out of the box that fits your description

793311
active-directory	adfs
adfs integrates with azman for role based authentication and can authentication against active-directory adls etc.

793320
stateless	stateful
also they are stateful struts 1 actions were stateless

793325
shell	bash
at this site you can download bourne again shell bash

793342
any	set
in the asp.net world i ve tended to use the built-in browsercaps feature to write out a set of classes onto the body tag that enable you to target any combination of browser and platform

793342
subclassing	inherited
we create a subclassing of system.web.ui.masterpage and make sure all of our master pages inherited from our specialised masterpage so that every page gets these classes added on for free

793346
union-all	union
try using union-all instead of union - otherwise mysql will try to remove any duplicate rows presumably minus the table indecies as it s looking at the result set

793354
msbuild	nant
i wouldn t use python though tools like nant or msbuild do the job

793359
rhino-mocks	mstest
i love watching hanselman s videos on using rhino-mocks and mstest on an asp.net-mvc application just to see it in action

793359
development-environment	enterprise
my development-environment is enterprise level applications in-house for a large corporation

793368
constructor	object
the eclientsocket constructor requires an object of type anywrapper to be passed and anywrapper is an interface not a concrete class

793377
data-members	private
but the variables or data-members are normally private and used by the public methods

793379
constructor	object
the operator constructs an object with the default constructor then let s you assign stuff to it using it s assignment operator

793385
arrays	map
it s true that for types with trivial destructors like raw pointers in your case there s no need to know the actual number of elements in the arrays and so the compiler might decide to map new and delete onto new and delete to reduce the overhead

793447
webforms	asp.net
yes it is definitely worth taking a look at but only if you want to work with asp.net and don t like the leaky webforms abstraction

793469
copy-constructor	constructor
i wrote a small test program with a sample class containing also self-defined constructor destructor copy-constructor and assignment operator

793469
constructor	object
i was surprised when i realized that the copy constructor was not called at all even though i implemented functions with return values of my class and lines like object o1

793472
binary-tree	nodes
i have a class representing a hash nodes the hashmap implementation uses a binary-tree

793484
environment	building
see msbuilding reserved properties and how to use environment variables in a building since these are kinda properties too

793497
return-type	arguments
doesn t create any objects rather it defines a function prototype with function name o1 void arguments and return-type as object

793523
entity-framework	ado.net
edit 3 others would also suggest things such as the ado.net entity-framework

793547
inherited	subclass
this means that your subclass would inherited the static variables from the parent and thus the instance as well

793548
value	field
then when a foo object is instantiated use a factory methods to look at the value of the instance s type field and plugins the correct type subclass as described in the paragraph above

793559
selected	checkbox
i want to use jquery draggable droppable to let the user select a grouping of objects each one has a checkbox in the corner and then drag all the selected objects as a grouping.

793560
increment	reset
they didn t reset the versioning number when switching from vb6 they just kept increment

793561
subclassing	base-class
this way my application code can use the base-class methods so it doesn t have to know anything about the subclassing at compile time

793561
subclassing	base-class
should i throw an exception-handling in the base-class versioning of objectinfo and find so that if the subclassing aren t implements properly i get a run-time error

793573
implements	abstract
if you require that a methods be implements by derived classes why not make it abstract instead of virtual

793580
document	element
now querying this document works just fine if i remove the xmlns -attribute from the root element

793587
implements	abstract
you should declare your base-class and the methods to be implements by derived classes as abstract

793626
value	field
using solrj in other words i want to retrieve docs which field matches with a set of value

793631
contains	lookup
you should use msdn to lookup the name of the assembly that contains the classes you need to use in this case it s going to be

793637
richfaces	icefaces
i think it makes no sense to mix icefaces with richfaces

793654
order	join
finding incomplete order - how to benefit from replacing left join s with not exists

793659
constructor	object
thus it eliminates both the return by value of the class object and the need to invoke the class copy constructor

793677
ref	out
this deconstructs the expression tree to resolve somemethod and the value of each arguments performs the rpc call updates any ref out argumentss and returns the result from the remote call

793744
contains	sorted
it leaves the list contains the same items at least and as it moves smaller values down the list i think that it should actually become more sorted for each search.

793747
subtract	add
just look at the first or last element and add or subtract 1

793755
httpresponse	httprequest
i m new at using the the libraries webclient httpresponse and httprequest in c# so bare over with me if my question is confusing to read

793759
perl	awk
i have access to the command line on this machine and it has python perl and the default text processing progams installed awk etc

793763
dependency-injection	singleton
instead of using a singleton that can be accessed statically consider using dependency-injection or inversion of control

793821
promise	future
the limitation on generic pointer types ought to be removed in the future but i can t make promise when

793821
arrays	map
i would prefer to implement the hash map buckets as one of double-hashing per-bucket dynamic arrayss or linked lists of cells from a contiguous arrays whichever came out best from tests using representative data

793857
tiff	png
it is capable of reading writing png s and at least capable of reading tiff writing should be supported too

793879
exception-handling	error-handling
you could just remove the exception and provide the error-handling yourself but i would really not recommend that because it is some kind of reinventing the wheel - recreating the exception-handling system

793883
selected	button
a gridview that is binded with some data and it has a selected column that has a button

793885
python	ruby
i have now however decided that even though my current project is in python i will also be learning ruby and ruby on rails

793897
keyvaluepair	key
i m actually able to solve my particular problem by getting the key and checking the default of guid but i m curious if there s a good way of doing this with the keyvaluepair

793921
ssl-certificate	ssl
you need to buy an ssl-certificate and configure iis to use that certificate and only serve the pages over an ssl conenction

793925
arrays	map
but to localize an arrays of variable names is not so simple--the loop constructs map for etc all create a small scope around the expression they operate on which terminates localization

793928
directory	folder
i m assuming you re referring to the web-inf directory in the root of the web application folder structure

793930
licensing	lgpl
simply because the new lgpl licensing removes the final impediment

793935
key-value	key
the function is meant to add the key-value pair on to the end of the list and if the key is already present in the list with an associated value delete the old value

793943
keydown	keyup
you can do a simple test to see if any keydown keyup events are triggers when you press the button

793950
linked-list	nodes
given a reference to a nodes in a single linked-list which is not the last nodes

793950
linked-list	nodes
since it is a single linked-list you must loop through every nodes in the list until you reach the nodes which should be delete because you have to modify the next-pointer in the nodes before the deleted

793964
ruby-on-rails	django
i am particularly interested in popular frameworks like ruby-on-rails and django

793964
ruby-on-rails	django
i understand that django and ruby-on-rails have been designed keeping security aspects in mind the most common form attacks like xss injections etc

793966
boolean	int
you could create an ivalueconverter which converts an int to a boolean based on the cutoff

793968
directory	folder
if you are absolutely sure the content is in the right folder then it s probably the server that doesn t let anything to be served from the bin directory for obvious security reasons

793992
http-get	get
this allows your gwt widgets to load and not require a second http-get to get the data they use

793995
postgresql	mysql
they are equivalent for all 4 major database systems oracle sql server mysql postgresql

793995
order	join
using join syntax to be more exact using straight_join instead of join will help to enforce the join order you need in mysql

793996
direct2d	directx
direct2d is built on directx 10.1 so will not work on xp since directx 10 is vista+ only

793996
direct2d	directx
direct2d and directwrite technical previews are both currently available in the march 2009 directx sdk

793999
user-interface	look-and-feel
i ve kind of settled on using mappoint 2009 but the map style really clashes with my overall user-interface look-and-feel

794014
linked-list	nodes
deleting a middle nodes from a single linked-list when pointer to the previous nodes is not available

794028
javascript	dom
give them a specific id and target this id using javascript acting on the dom

794035
value	field
are there any shortcuts in ruby-on-rails activerecord that enables you to search by value of a field

794035
value	field
does this also apply to field that may have many different value such as a state column

794036
vba	vb6
apparently this used to be a way in vb6 and vba to short circuit and execute the first true case

794037
versioning	upgrade
if this still yields the same result you should probably upgrade your versioning

794041
contains	any
nsarray is immutable so it will not take a pointer to any object and presumably already contains the correct objects when handed to you

794064
triggers	insert
i have declared a triggers that get fired after insert update in this triggers i m using a while and a cursor to loop on the inserted table s rows

794064
triggers	insert
i want the triggers to rise an error and do not insert any of the rows that fired the triggers not even those that already satisfaied my condition

794072
value	field
however if you need to get the value of a field by name you should be using reflection

794081
youtube	flickr
we intend people should be able to leverage their content on other sites flickr youtube when building their profiling on our site

794104
unsigned	zero
edit- a positive number written in two s-complement notation is the same as the number written in unsigned notation although the most significant bit must be zero

794127
json	xml
preferably a rest style api with data in a reasonable serialization like xml or json

794132
python	java
it has been said appropriately that python is not java and you don t need a specialized class for everything just because you need it by language architecture

794138
ref	out
as adam points out your code doesn t required this to be ref

794140
value	field
the distinction seems to be in objects with no single identifiable field and value objects tend to not actually belong the entity

794143
private-key	rsa
perhaps public private-key encryption - maybe rsa or similar

794152
tuples	any
if however you have any interest in making this portable general return a tuples

794167
expression	evaluation
you could certainly do this sort of thing on your own by writing a reflection-wielding parsing but you could also use spring s expression evaluation language which is very nearly what you want documentation

794170
csv	xml
in a text csv xml file

794176
return-value	arguments
he means you cannot decide by looking at x y z whether it is an expression or a declaration. in the first case it means call function y with arguments z then invoke operator int int with x and the return-value of the function call and finally discard the result. in the second case it means y is a pointers to a struct x initialized to point to the same garbage time-bomb address as does z.

794178
value	field
how do i get the choices field value and not the key from the form

794186
datagridview	listview
if this is for a winforms app have a look at the listview control or a datagridview

794204
where-clause	sql
i ve got a complex sql where-clause that just got more complex because of a requirements change

794207
httplistener	http
digging inside http api shows that this is a limitation of httplistener itself

794207
buffering	streaming
update you can t http streaming anything if you don t have a flush option or ability to define buffering size

794243
google-chrome	firefox
firefox opera safari and google-chrome all work without problems

794246
subtraction	complement
negative numbers are stored in 2 s complement form because 2â s complement is good for subtraction

794319
ssas	olap
errors in the olap storage engine an error occurred while processing the scraped auction partition of the scraped auction measure grouping for the ebay scraper cube from the ssas database

794327
order	add
in order to flip the sign of a number you always calculate the two s complement of that number flip all bits then add 1

794346
constructor	object
if you begin reading and writing to the object you passed into the constructor you have a problem

794349
installation	packaging
the rubygems feature set is a little larger than just packaging in involves package distribution and installation

794355
javascript	dom
ps i do have an understanding on how javascript works and changes the dom etc

794379
executable	jar
jars are packaged executable libraries that you generally have to explicitly declare a dependency upon in a java program s execution at invocation time by declaring the jar as a dependency when you invoke the java interpreter

794403
order	add
it could be doing the temp table renaming if you are trying to add a column to the beginning of the table as this is easier than altering the order

794407
updating	updates
the problem i have is that word automatically comes up with windows allowing updating of these properties for example effective date that is not validated and i don t want it to show when the user is uploading changes i fill in some of these fields on the updates methods in the eventreceiver class

794414
hide	show
an alternative would be to show the dialog hide it immediately show a topmost progress form instead and then hide that but i think showing a single dialog is more seamless an experience for the user

794421
perl	ruby
the analigy that comes to mind for me is that gem s are to ruby what cpan is to perl

794430
asp.net-mvc	webforms
i work for a marketing agency and i m half way through producing my first site using asp.net-mvc rather than webforms with a url rewriting module and it s so much easier and better and nicer and exactly what i want

794434
unsigned-integer	int
the binary number could be an unsigned-int two s complement int an ieee floating point number a string of characters or something else entirely

794434
unsigned	integer
so yes positive integers in two s complement notation are represented the same way they are with unsigned integers assuming it is a valid integer for the number of bits being used

794443
contains	elements
i assume that you have a schema that permits an item elements to contains a content elements and that the content elements can only contains text or cdata or similar

794464
duplicates	elements
remove any duplicates elements

794467
visualsvn-server	sharpsvn
has any one tried to access visualsvn-server repositories through asp.net using sharpsvn api

794499
google-chrome	firefox
resizing the input doesn t work in safari or google-chrome just firefox and opera

794500
base-class	inherited
what base-class should i inherited from

794511
solaris	linux
it worked fine on linux and solaris and it s not terribly complicated to implement

794513
google-chrome	safari
have you checked the page referenced to see if safari google-chrome webkit have different values for the enter key

794514
constructor	object
whenever a temporary class object is copied using a copy constructor and this object and the copy have the same cv-unqualified type an implementation is permitted to treat the original and the copy as two different ways of referring to the same object and not perform a copy at all even if the class copy constructor or destructor have side effects

794514
constructor	object
for a function with a class return type if the expression in the return statement is the name of a local object and the cv-unqualified type of the local object is the same as the function return type an implementation is permitted to omit creating the temporary object to hold the function return value even if the class copy constructor or destructor has side effects

794575
value	field
is the value in another field on the

794583
selected	textbox
i understand that with javascript you can selected the contents of a textbox with the following code in jquery

794583
selected	textbox
i have the focus event of a series of textbox set to selected the contents within them

794583
selected	textbox
there are times now that i want to focus a particular textbox without selected it

794584
firefox	safari
it works in safari but not in firefox 3.08 3.1 beta3

794587
sql-server	oracle
i can use hibernate with my application and when i finally decide to get rid of the legacy database and change to the latest oracle or sql-server i can do so with minimal headache

794590
perl	php
use a language like perl php or whatever to generate your .h file

794596
hash	tie
in perl the easiest way to do this is to tie a hash to a dbm file see man perltie

794601
tree	trie
i m currently implementing a radix tree patricia trie whatever you want to call it

794610
command-line	cmd
i think it would be better to run the cron cmd with an additional option at the command-line that you wouldn t run manually

794629
sql-server	oracle
switching from one dbms to another ala oracle to sql-server is one thing that using an orm would certainly make much easier

794656
parentheses	let
most advice on how to accomplish this is to use the design view or the query wizard and let access figure out where to put the parentheses that are not required in standard sql

794657
conditional	operators
some of your javascript skills will translate to other languages conditional and control-flow operators for example

794657
javascript	dom
your html dom and css experience will help some but only in the sense of understanding what the javascript is trying to do

794673
children	nodes
at the i nodes there are two children one for m and one for n

794678
webforms	asp.net
also any old asp.net controls only work if you use the webforms view engine i think i want to use another one but that s not the point

794679
base-class	inherited
i would have thought the inherited class should call the base-class s count function

794682
inline-assembly	assembly
to get this data from c c++ code you ll need to use inline-assembly compiler intrinsics or call an external assembly function to perform the cpuid instruction

794708
instances	private
you are adding your items to a private list instances _list.insert _list.add rather than the base list me.insert me.add

794708
icollection	ienumerable
as adam robinson points out you could consider implementing some or all of ienumerable t icollection t icollection ienumerable if you want users of your class to be able to for example iterate over items in the queue

794708
icollection	ienumerable
the standard queue class queue t implements ienumerable t icollection and ienumerable implementing at least these would be good for consistency

794710
authentication	login
well on a iis web site with integrated windows authentication and no anonymous access i can retrieve the login username of the user something like like domain user.

794716
icollection	ienumerable
a better idea would be for you to inherited from object and have priority-queue of t implement icollection and ienumerable of t explicitly

794720
switching	router
i m not sure what your topography looks like but for a small medium setup i would switching from a cisco or equivalent device and investigate running a linux box as a router

794726
reference-type	generics
there is a very slight execution-time penalty for generics methods and types - it will be jitted once for different each value type t type argument don t forget a value type could implement ifileinfo and once for all reference-type once it s been jitted or one reference-type it won t need to be jitted again

794739
order	add
i d like to create a wcf service that returns the objects to my clients but i cannot update the class library in order to add the datacontract and data-members attributes

794745
http	ssl
adding a ssl certificate http to tomcat6 should not cause these problems

794745
http	ssl
you enabled ssl http

794770
triggers	insert
the triggers code would handle insert the appropriate id

794794
common-lisp	scheme
other than that lisp is a family of diverse dialects with diverse implementations scheme common-lisp emacs lisp visual lisp clojure logo ... and several others

794794
autocad	cad
cad autocad cocreate and several others

794801
put	get
right now i would have to say the put methods is better since it works and i could not get the webservice to work

794809
entity-framework	ado.net
basically if you make sure your ms-dtc is running and working properly you should have no problems with using 2 ado.net connections - whether they are entity-framework connections or any other type

794813
selected	listbox
i have a listbox that you can selected users in

794823
perl	ruby
whether that s perl or python or ruby or whatever i choose perl but that s not always for everyone it s just something that will allow you to bypass the shell for quoting

794823
stderr	stdout
the hard part here is doing the pipe - but a bit of io pipe fork and reopening stdout and stderr and it s not bad

794824
order	add
in order to do this with pure css html you will need to add a tag to either the image s a href link

794829
web-config	app-config
copy your connection strings in the web-config project to app-config in your nunit test project

794848
order	add
i strongly recommend named paramters as you can later add features by passing get params without having to worry about the order

794849
any	set
to avoid page has expired warnings set session.cache_limiter to private and make sure that any form using the post methods submits to an intermediate processing page that redirects the user to a different url

794853
multiplication	division
2.0 with fast - o n log n - multiplication division algorithms

794853
multiplication	addition
addition multiplication comparing

794855
environment	building
the temp value is the value of the temp environment variables for the user that the building agent process is running as

794855
environment	building
you could change the temp location for the building user - however that might not be what you want as that is a setting you will have to do to the building users environment not just localized to the building agent process

794856
strict	let
first let me bring share my strict understanding of a memory leak

794857
hide	show
i can manually show and hide the tooltip just fine

794865
recording	playing
just using delete table is taking forever and eats up drive spaces i believe because of the transactional log. right now i m using a while-loop to delete recording x at a time while playing around with x to determine what s actually fastest

794898
selected	listbox
maybe move your combobox to the right of the user listbox as your order of actions will be selected user -- selected grouping

794902
binary	hex
say i have 8b1f 0008 0231 49f6 0300 f1f3 75f4 0c72 f775 0850 7676 720c 560d 75f0 02e5 ce00 0861 1302 0000 0000 how can i easily get a binary file from that without copying+pasting into a hex editor

794920
swing	gwt
i encounter this design issue often in gui projects swing gwt

794957
firefox	gecko
from playing with firebug in firefox 3.0 it looks like it is 20 in gecko

794961
sortedset	sortedmap
i want to make a class usable in sortedset | sortedmap

794967
comparator	sortedset
this is why all sortedmap sortedset implementation that i know of allow you to pass in a comparator at creation

794977
perl	ruby
it needs to be a friendly format for traveling between the c# java and ruby perl python worlds

794977
json	xml
a guid field and a json yaml xml packet field

794984
compareto	equals
effective-java recommends that if you don t implement compareto consistent with equals you should clearly indicate so

794998
compareto	equals
if you want to have compareto inconsistent with equals it is recommended that you instead use an explicit comparator by providing a class that implements comparator

794998
compareto	equals
whether or not equals and hashcode are consistent with compareto is a different matter

795004
easymock	mockito
i used the mockito mock framework for the example and typed it quickly but easymock or your preferred mock framework should do it as well

795014
perl	c++
designed as an efficient portable version-tolerant general purpose binary format it gives you c++ java and python in the google library and c# perl ruby and others in the community ports

795027
binary	hex
in response to this question asking about hex to raw binary conversion a comment suggested that it could be solved in 5-10 lines of c or any other language.

795027
binary	hex
nb this doesn t mean hex to ascii binary - specifically the output should be a raw octet stream corresponding to the input ascii hex

795027
space	input
also the input parsing should skip ignore white space

795027
python	ruby
the program must compile or run without any special options passed to the compiler or interpreter so gcc myprog.c or python myprog.py or ruby myprog.rb are ok while ruby -rscanf myprog.rb is not allowed

795027
integer	digits
the program should read integer bytes represented by pairs of adjacent hexadecimal digits upper lower or mixed case optionally separated by whitespace and write the corresponding bytes to output

795033
base-class	subclass
if your reall really need to have multiple-inheritance two base-classes so that you can get the functionality from both you could have your base-class the one you definately need be a subclass of stream itself

795040
globalization	localization
check out wpf globalization and localization overview

795047
derived-class	base-class
if you would like to protect the callers of the base-class from receiving potentially unanticipated exception-handling-handling thrown by classes derived from your base-class consider using the templates pattern to catch any errors thrown by the derived-class and convert them to an exception-handling that you define on the base-class

795056
binary	hex
48 55 to get a hex string changed into raw binary

795064
struct	unions
i m curious does anyone have an opinion why they used structural equivalence for arrays and pointers but they used declaration equivalence for struct and unions

795064
struct	unions
what is the benefit of doing declaration equivalence with struct unions and structural equivalence for everything else

795076
http	ssl
i am pasting the working code to log in to a ssl powered https site using http client 3.1

795090
export	report
basically i m looking for the dataset that is being used by the report and hand-dragging each field onto the canvas or even export the file doesn t quite get me where i want

795124
32-bit	64bit
you could for example have a struct with an int 32-bit and a double 64bit

795141
value	field
parameters are value that go in to the query field are what it returns

795146
value	field
in a passport there is a field first name and that field has a value john

795146
value	field
and passport is a set of pairs field field value such that

795146
value	field
passport has a value for field first name

795146
value	field
passport has a value john for field first name

795153
order	add
you may also have to add a listener for key press events on your page in order to capture the user pressing the enter key and then recording this information

795161
google-chrome	firefox
the code below works fine in firefox google-chrome opera etc

795164
click	mouse
you d have to implement javascript to listen for -- and log to the server-side -- key presses and mouse click and then analyze that data to find what you re looking for

795171
key-value	key
it takes the new key-value pair and puts that at the front of the given assoc list with that key filtering out

795218
attributes	properties
the events gives you a wrapper kind of the wrapper with properties and attributes so you can ensure encapsulation over the delegate methods

795222
constructor	private
the other alternative would be to take it in the constructor and then keep it as a private read-only field

795233
protected	public
you can create simple workflow that move new document from public document library to protected one

795237
rollback	commit
end transaction commit rollback

795238
apache	vhosts
outside of that it s just a matter of setting up 2 vhosts in your apache or whichever server you use configuration one for the ssl site and one for the non-ssl site

795241
python	java
can anyone point to serious comparison of python runtime footprint versus java

795250
proxy-server	squid
i have recently been tasked with installing and configuring squid proxy-server for filtering and monitoring our internal wireless network

795278
contains	set
indexdata contains a set of lines

795289
conditional	operators
this is commonly referred to as the conditional operators and when used like this

795291
arrays	map
here s a 9 line c version with no odd formatting well i ll grant you that the tohex arrays would be better split into 16 lines so you can see which character codes map to which values... and only 2 shortcuts that i wouldn t deploy in anything other than a one-off script

795291
void	main
the two things i don t like about it is that i don t have a close fd in there and main shouldn t be void and should return an int

795291
space	input
also the input parsing should skip ignore white space

795294
stderr	stdout
i am trying to redirect both stdout stderr of a unix command and append to a log file in a korn shell

795296
conditional	operators
it s the conditional operators

795303
conditional	operators
it is called the conditional operators

795307
contentcontrol	itemscontrol
consider subclassing at the level of contentcontrol itemscontrol and headereditemscontrol .

795311
conditional	operators
the question mark is the conditional operators

795312
directory	folder
some plugins from the plugins directory some folder from the features directory

795324
triggers	insert
since you ve indicated you are using a broken orm tool one that will not allow you to query for update i d suggest that you move your insert into the log table into a triggers on the delete operation so you will avoid the duplicate entry

795326
32-bit	64bit
i m on vista 64bit and i need to have vmware workstation run as a 32-bit process for reasons outside of the scope of this problem

795326
32-bit	64bit
right now when i run vmware it starts it as a 64bit process and i have no idea how to make it run as a 32-bit process instead

795338
emacs	vim
on a related theme - you might want to consider using emacs or vim as your editor but that s more of a personal preference thing

795342
dependency-injection	inject
if you re doing the dependency-injection manually by all means inject a factory object

795345
autotest	testunit
update|resolved apparently the discover.rb file in seed-fu was making autotest think it was testing for rspec not testunit

795360
javascript	dom
the reason firebug isn t telling you the location is because it s not in any javascript but is rather in a one-liner in the dom

795386
background-color	transparency
you can also specify background-color here so you don t need to use transparency

795390
constructor	object
you would then create one of these object and pass it to the constructor for safteyinspector

795393
32-bit	64bit
first your original question how do you run a 32-bit vmware host on 64bit windows

795393
32-bit	64bit
edit going to the vix sdk download page shows vix api for windows 32-bit and 64bit

795397
order	add
i guess what i was looking for was how to write a function or something taking a list and an item and returning a list under the same name so the function could be called more than once without changing the name every time as if it was actually a program which would add actual orders to an order list and the user wouldn t have to think of a new name for the list each time but rather append an item to the same list

795400
drools	rule
personally i would opt for one of the open source rule engines someone has already mentioned drools if you have your heart set on a rule engine

795402
constructor	object
then in theory all the singletons would automagically be added to the collection since when they are instantiated the base pclass constructor is called and adds the new object to the collection .

795418
contains	elements
this tells us that ol contains the elements cashondelivery and then the result of the expression ol

795438
python	ruby
ruby 1.9 makes a few breaking changes but not like python 3

795462
contains	lookup
my question is about saving yourself the trouble of hitting your own datastore everytime you want to do a lookup on some data contains within the hl7

795462
lookup	any
any idea on how to create a cache of data in mirth so that you can access the lookup from any channel source destination transformer or filtering

795471
environment	building
so far the most sophisticated solution i have is to guarantee the results of some helper methods through assertion testing in the building environment and writing a bunch of traditional user test cases which i d prefer to avoid

795480
cassini	iis
another option for you is to simply skip cassini and debug under iis

795480
hosts-file	hosts
this is done by adding a line in the hosts located at

795480
order	add
open the file with notepad you need to run as administrator in order to be able to save if you re using windows-vista and have user account control turned on... and add your host

795518
show	next
anything you show me that i m doing wrong i will always remember and do it correctly next time

795545
punctuation	words
if the character is a non-words character punctuation spaces possibly more add the current words to the words list in the forwarding index and clear the current words

795552
python	lua
somesort lua python ruby.

795555
local-variables	function-call
a closure is in a basic sense a function-call that retains the local-variables information from the scope it was created

795563
numeric	digits
s9 15 means a 15 digits numeric signed field s for sign 9 is numeric 15 is length

795563
numeric	digits
9 3 is a three digits numeric

795563
value	field
each nybble half-byte of the field is a decimal value in binary so

795567
versioning	upgrade
if you ve got multiple versioning of the class stored in the database it might be pretty tricky to deserialize and upgrade them all to a consistent serialization format in a single pass

795567
boolean	int
just be careful as you add new fields to the class that they make sense with their default values boolean are false objects are null int are zero etc

795572
contains	any
it s also worth noting that this won t handle types contains in any assemblies which are loaded dynamically unless you make another call to initialise but based on your question auto instantiated on program start that doesn t sound like an issue for you

795592
entity-framework	nhibernate
there are many products of this type you can use built-in .net frameworks such as the entity-framework open-source ones such as nhibernate or commercial products such as lightspeed llblgen entityspaces or openaccess disclosure i work for a company that makes a commercial orm

795625
show	next
eg if im display contents of page2 how could i tell php i am at list 1 so that next list show page3

795703
click	mouse
you shouldn t use sendmessage to simulate mouse click and key presses

795708
hosts-file	hosts
open the hosts located at c windows system32 drivers etc in notepad run as admin if you re on vista and add the following line

795708
hosts-file	hosts
if you have more than one hosts header on your website in iis you need to have each one represented in the hostss-file

795714
contains	elements
i usually define a list named ...list where each elements is contains within ...list_elements

795731
rhino-mocks	moq
using a class factory and or tools like moq rhino-mocks etc how could the above example be implemented

795732
versioning	migrate
recently we migrate from sql-server 2005 to sql-server 2008 and i m now using the 2008 versioning of mgmt studio

795734
any	set
if you just want to have the label be as large as it needs to be to contain the label you can set it to larger than it needs to be in any circumstance and align it as necessary

795735
emacs	vim
evil recent vim emulator for emacs

795740
windows-xp	windows
anthony - the windowss-xp task bar covers up some of the browser windows

795754
ruby-on-rails	camping
the only significant difference that i m aware of is that camping is based around the mvc pattern like ruby-on-rails and is coupled to activerecord

795769
32-bit	64bit
i was running vmware on 64bit vista but i could only get vmware to load 32-bit oss

795779
dfa	nfa
that s exponential spaces in the worst case though every state in the dfa maps to a subset of the powerset of the nfa states

795779
dfa	nfa
now instead of constructing the equivalent dfa you simulate the nfa

795793
arrays	loops
personally i just throw the whole loops into a somewhat reusable method function called ispropertyalwaystrue property arrays and have it return a false directly if it finds that it finds a case where it s not true

795805
tuples	any
the return value can be used exactly as a tuples and has the same speed and memory properties so you don t lose any genericity

795839
arguments	default

797950
driver	kernel
global variables in a kernel mode driver are allocated from nonpagedpool

797982
double	int

integer	digits
i know c++ have functions that return largest or smallest integer that is greater or lower than a like ceil or floor.is there a function that implement digits limitation of floating-point variables

798047
hash	md5
by the way a hash like md5 is trying to do pretty much the opposite thing that a metric does so it s hardly surprising that this wouldn t work for you

798054
malloc	free
unless you have a really good reason to do so do not do it as you are very likely to use free on a new-allocated buffer or delete and a malloc allocated one

798061
any	set
if the datagridview is set up to allow multi-select then you d obviously want to deselect any existing selection

798070
decimal-point	digits
where the parameter to setprecision is the maximum number of digits to show after the decimal-point

798090
stream	send
note that when you send a double or float to a stream like this it will automatically round for you which can trip you up sometimes if you aren t aware of this

798093
directory	folder
uac pops up because you are installing to a folder the user doesn t have permission to like program files maybe try installing to a directory off the users home drive

798125

798148
hardware	monitor
you can also try scalability where you would add hardware incrementally and monitor the behaviour of the application

798151
linux	osx
if you are accustomed to using visual-studio you can still develop in visual-studio and copy your binaries to linux osx or whatever

798154
unsigned	integer

any	bag
if you have a class with 1000 variables where any given instance only uses a fraction of those variables you d be much better served by using a property bag of some sort

798180
coding-style	readability
i don t personally know of a good coding-style for indenting sql - how should nested queries where clauses left joins etc by represented to maximise readability

798186
principles	srp
i would recommend to read more about single responsibility principles srp

798197

hosts-file	hosts
hosts open with notepad

798252
antivirus	security
it may also be happening because of antivirus or internet security software that is installed

798264
hosts-file	hosts
you can remove the ipv6 mapping for localhost in the hosts

798307
put	get
if you put elmah on your asp.net website it will automatically log and handle all the exception-handling that get thrown by your app as you are testing it

798319
log4net	nlog
ideally you should use a logging library such as nlog or log4net to log any unhandled exception-handling and exception-handling in general by logging them in your code when they occur

798319
configuration	logging
with nlog you can leave the logging in your production code and enable disable log output through the use of a logging configuration file

32-bit	64bit
can a 64bit citrix server running a 32-bit app through wow64 handle just as many instances users as the 32-bit citrix server equivalent

798359
32-bit	64bit
or are there some strange memory considerations with a 64bit server running a 32-bit app

798403
stdin	pipe
rm does not accept a list of files to delete on the stdin which is what you are doing by passing it through the pipe

798413

in short how can i pipe a variable from a python script to a perl script and store the result in python

798418
google-chrome	firefox
i have placed a findfile.manifest file under home akshay .mozilla firefox xxxx.dev google-chrome

798428
gethashcode	equals
inherited is the way to go and each class should override the equals and gethashcode where needed

798446
base-class	inherited
however i suppose that for this checkduration to work both t and u should either implement some well-defined interface or inherited from one base-class or otherwise you ll be doing lots of reflection which kinda defeats the purpose of using generics

798456
python	java
you re not going to be able to do it with python c# or java

798459
autotools	automake
generally autotools see autotools book gnu autoconf automake libtool are quite common

798477
enumerator	any
i guess i am wondering why you need an enumerator from your web service to be available in your javascript if you never pass that enumerator to the service or receive it from the service in any way

798493
execute	declare
code in an anonymous delegate or any delegate for that matter execute in the context in which it was declare

export	report
i am encountering some formatting issues when export the report into excel

798555
conditional	operators
some also call it the conditional operators

798556
conditional	operators
it s called the conditional operators

798556
conditional	operators
but theoretically there could be another ternary operators whereas there can only be one conditional operators

798556
conditional	operators
â 15.25 conditional operators

798556
conditional	operators
the conditional operators

798569
conditional	operators
is typically called the ternary conditional operators often referred to as simply ternary operators

798569
conditional	operators
ternary conditional operators

798573
conditional	operators
it is called the conditional operators and it is a type of ternary operation

798574
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu and probably all other children have mono in the repository

798574
ubuntu	debian
however i would suggest version 2 which requires using the sid repository in debian don t know about ubuntu

798576
conditional	operators
according to the sun java specification it s called the conditional operators

798576
conditional	operators
the conditional operators

798576
conditional	operators
the conditional operators is syntactically right-associative it grouping right-to-left so that a

798576
conditional	operators
the conditional operators has three operand expression

798578
conditional	operators
it s the conditional operators and it s more than just a concise way of writing if-statement

798579
listbox	textbox
i have a textbox and listbox

798579
listbox	textbox
user can search listbox elements from textbox

798583
conditional	operators
being the pedant that i am i d like to make it clear that the name of the operators is the conditional operators or conditional operators

798583
conditional	operators
however the spec is pretty clear that its name is the conditional operators or conditional operators

798583
conditional	operators
i think it s clearer to call it by that name as it indicates the behaviour of the operators to some extent evaluating a conditional rather than just how many operands it has

798590
versioning	upgrade
as long as you go with major upgrade from versioning to versioning that works just fine - you can uninstaller the old versioning and then re-install the new one - no major problems here

798596
reflection	runtime
at runtime you can use reflection to get the value of the property

798604
selected	button
when the user selected her choices and post s using the submit button i would like for our application to store her selections in the model and then render a page with the id of the model so that the user can get back to the page she created at any point with a simple get request

798619
easymock	mockito
first i needed to realize that i cannot mock webservicetemplate with mockito since it is a concrete class you need to use easymock if this is essential

798628
keyvaluepair	key
- for each entry as keyvaluepair of string car in mycol if you want to enumerate all objects and their key

798629
unsafe	out
i got around that issue by sending a link to a web page which then did the redirect to the custom url protocols presumably the issue with sending the direct link was that gmail and possibly other providers were seeing my protocols as unsafe and therefore stripping it out of the email

798634
startup	launch
you define the product or application to launch on startup and there are options for splash screens and branding

798655
external	embed
how do i embed an external executable inside my c# windows forms application

798655
external	embed
edit i need to embed it because it s an external free console application made in c++ from which i read the output value to use in my program

798673
z-index	overlap
and b and c are styled such that they overlap z-index will determine which one ends up on top

798673
z-index	overlap
however if c and d overlap d will always be on top no matter what c s z-index is because elements that are closer to the root dom node will always appear above elements that are nested deeper in

798713
contains	elements
i think you will need a queue with elements contains the request and offering a response

798717
derived-class	base-class
my current workaround is to just put all of the public members in the base-class however this is starting to look ugly as i add more derived-classes that need members available to the derived-class only

798718
export	report
so let s pretend that you like me have to deal with several databases not to big 100 gb each and you have many clients with many different needs that make you develop many custom solutions like producing custom report or export

798749
benchmarking	profiling
all the benchmarking and profiling is now in ruby-on-rails which is awesome

798763
contains	elements
here the names of the wanted elements and their wanted order are provided in the string parameter which contains a space-separated list of all wanted names

798763
contains	elements
do note that the wanted elements will be produced in any desired order because we are using the xpath 2.0 sequence type vs the union in the xslt 1.0 solution which by definition contains items in any desired specified order

798765
postback	ajax
the main idea of the ajax framework is to eliminate full-page postback

798765
postback	ajax
but if you looking for an alternative to page postback then i would recommend jquery but from the question it seems as if you re new to ajax so assuming you know javascript hopefully you know that first to understand how jquery works

798767
textbox	button
i specify a page to test and the value to insert into a textbox and then click the corresponding button

798783
triggers	insert
so even if there was a valid connection these lines would not triggers the insert of a new record

798793
having	select
the error i was getting occurs for a beta build so this probably shouldn t be a persistent solution but if anyone else is having trouble with trying to use the latest beta of xcode+iphone0s3 installation you will find that you can only target the 3.0 os after you select it in the overview dropdown

798795
binaries	install
will i have to provide the binaries to be install at my customer s google app account

798803
binary	hex
i don t recall seeing this methods before but mikko rantanen pointed this equation out in a comment on the question code golf - hex to raw binary conversion

798805
conditional	operators
if like me you re fond of initializing variables where they are defined the conditional ternary operators for it is both permits you to do that in cases where there is conditionality about its value

798816
any	set
another option would be to set a sort of fluctuation threshold where you don t do any recalculation until the speed changes by more than that threshold

798825
append	input
ios ate is used to open the file for append and ios in is used to open the file for reading input

798827
value	field
is there any way to limit this global field s visibility scope to only the methods or to make it local but keep it s value between calls

798831
reflection	runtime
if you re interested in speed at runtime rather than development have a look at jon skeet s making reflection fly and exploring delegates blog post

798840
jquery	dojo
duplicate which javascript framework jquery vs dojo vs â

798862
put	get
edit how are you going to get the http server to decide whether it is ok to accept a particular put request

798863
value	field
it is generally a good idea to specify the value of unused field as follows

798863
value	field
when you do so all you have to do for backward compatibility is to define value 0 of the field to mean the old behavior prior to the introduction of the new feature

798874
private-members	object
accessing private user-interface members is not different from accessing other private-members to .net object

798876
stderr	stdout
on further testing it looks like the jvm is putting the message i want to stdout or stderr

798876
stderr	stdout
i believe i would need to capture stdout and stderr to get the error i m looking for unless of course there is a simpler way

798888
any	set
are there any set of reasons like maybe long javascript file which cause this problem

798904
jquery	dojo
that said jquery appears to have the most momentum at the moment and other frameworks like dojo are working on putting more jquery-like functionality into their product so i would recommend learning that

798911
logout	login
i want to determine when the login page loads whether the request has come via the logout page

798911
logout	login
currently i have a workaround in place whereby i append a querystring variables to the request from the logout page that instructs the login page not to perform an implicit login and instead prompt the user for credentials

798921
contains	set
you may think of a variables as contains an element that is a member of a set of numbers

798925
put	get
so i guess the question is where do i put those parameters so i can get at them with javascript in a nice cross browser way

798925
google-chrome	firefox
the only interesting thing with this is the difference between click events in ie and in firefox google-chrome and safari

798925
checkbox	button
ie allows anything to have a click where as the others limit click to input elements of type button checkbox radio reset or submit

798925
contains	elements
i kind of wanted to use event-bubbling to attach the click events to an elements that contains a grouping of checkbox

798935
webserver	host
for some reason it is looking at a host called webserver but that isn t what it needs to look for for the wsdl

798947
message	alert
if you make changes then click copy the alert message display the correct number of characters

798960
hypertable	hbase
keep in mind tools like hbase and hypertable are key-value stores so don t do ad-hoc queries and joins without the help of a mapreduce cascading app to perform the joins out of band which is a very useful pattern

798963
conditional	operators
you might be interested in a proposal for some new operatorss that are similar to the conditional operators

798972
moving-average	average
note that this is a complicated average so the methods of discarding older values moving-average might improve it even further

798973
order	add
currently when you add fees or discounts to an order it s as simple as

798973
base-class	inherited
i like it it makes sense and a base-class that order inherited from iterates through the items in the list calculates appropriate taxes and allows for other order-type documents of which there are 2 to inherit from the base-class that calculates all of this without re-implimenting anything

798975
solaris	aix
get the following all available for windows linux aix solaris etc .

798975
groovy	java
groovy for i kinda hate java s

799002
scriptaculous	jquery
was one consideration for us but essentially we ve played with mootools prototype scriptaculous and jquery and have found jquery to be the easiest for us all to understand support

799006
publishing	release
none of these security checks are reliant on company a publishing the public key anywhere else but in the original release of the assembly

799017
rich-internet-application	ria
it all depends on your definition of what a ria rich-internet-application really is

799022
value	field
my idea was to create a class based on the dynamic form add properties to the class based on the forms field set those properties based on the value input for those field then return the class in the web service

799024
boolean	int
the basic types like int boolean char and pointer are safe to read at any time

799039
silverlight	wpf
silverlight and wpf are quite similar and you should be able to achieve an extremely high degree of code re-use between the two

799040
order	add
let s say you add a fee to any order which has 20 items or more just a random example run with me on this one

799040
order	add
now when you add the 20th item you may want to add that fee to the order but there s a problem

799043
persistence	hibernate
for this i have decided to use jpa with hibernate as the persistence provider and will be developing on apache derby for development and testing purposes

799043
getter	setter
then i use the entity classes from database to generate the xxx entity class which contains all the necessary annotations and getter and setter methods

799050
value	field
if the current value the previous value increment the index and append the index to the field value

799050
value	field
if the current value the previous value reset the index to 0 and keep the field value as is

799051
contains	elements
it s some sort of anonymous function attached to an html elements which has the this pointer bound to that form elements and also has a parameter named event which will contains data about the submit event

799051
google-chrome	firefox
further more you could try to stop it somehow but it appears that firefox 3 ie 8 google-chrome 2 and opera 9 are executing the html attribute handler in the first place and then the one attached i didn t tested with jquery though but with addeventlistener and attachevent

799057
http	ssl
in any case the idea is to provide an ssl tunnel over port 443 that our c#.net remoting packets they re http packets at the moment may pass through

799075
silverlight	wpf
take a look to the source of silverlight toolkit it might work in wpf

799078
udp	tcp
this is because udp is a datagram protocol vs tcp s stream protocol

799079
dependency-injection	singleton
if you want to avoid the singleton and for testing purposes i would suggest you do then it may be worth looking into dependency-injection though that really is a whole other issue

799083
attributes	properties
nhibernate validator to my knowledge only provides the ability to specify a text message the name of the class and - in the case of properties level validation attributes - the name of the violated properties

799083
communication	messages
if your attributes hasselfvalidationattributes implements iruleargs pointing to an ivalidator or iinitializablevalidator it has no way to communication back anything else but a simple string messages and the name of the class which would probably be too little information if your demand is to validate real business rules

799084
required	checked
last i checked opengl required textures files to be square and of a power of two 128 x 128 256 x 256 512 x 512

799085

click	mouse
optionally override wndproc to filtering mouse click on readonly cells

799121
key-value	key
specifies that if an attempt is made to update a key-value in a row where the key-value is referenced by foreign keys in existing rows in other tables all of the foreign key-values are also updated to the new value specified for the key

799142
udp	tcp
udp is ideal for things like broadcasting and streaming audio or video a dropped packet is never a problem in those situations. so if you need to ensure your data gets to the other side stick with tcp

799142
udp	tcp
udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster

799158
rollback	commit
also do i need to explicitly put in rollback logic or will the transaction automatically roll back if an error occurs because it never reaches the commit command

799169
contains	any
also is there any chance the object contains _serialport has been dereferenced and garbage collected

799171
internet-explorer	firefox
this works in internet-explorer ie5.5 ie6 ie7 firefox opera and now safari netscape 8 and mozilla

799176
protected	public
public protected methods names properties class names and so on are subject to best practice guidelines

799177
contains	set
set to a directory that contains the xalan.jar

799183
rollback	commit
do i need to explicitly put in rollback logic or will the transaction automatically roll back if an error occurs because it never reaches the commit command

799187
bazaar	git
i have had a really quick look at git mercurial and bazaar

799187
windows-server	windows
are there windows-server processes for any dvcs systems and has anyone managed to set one up in a windows land

799212
contains	set
by definition a set contains only unique values

799233
udp	tcp
tcp is that tcp is good when data delivery is better late than never udp is good when data delivery is better never than late

799233
udp	tcp
also note that udp can be multicast while tcp can t

799238
filehandle	pipe
the perlipc documentation explains the various ways that you can interact with other processes from perl and perlfunc s open documentation explains the pipe filehandle

average	minimum
the first time that a page is crawled the web-crawler uses the date and time that the page is crawled and an average of the specified minimum and maximum recrawl intervals to set a recrawl date

799296
document	element
when a field is sortable the searcher creates an arrays with one element for each document in the index

799296
value	field
one more caveat a sortable field must have no more than one value stored in each field

799323
dictionary	map
you can use a dictionary to map exceptions against functions to call

799324
order	add
you will want to add your additional custom routes above the default route and use a narrow to broad order when adding the routes so that narrow matches first

799328
default-value	default
default is a keyword which explicitly specifies the default-value for a column

799329
attributes	properties
i think the source of confusion is the distinction between a node s attributes and the corresponding properties

799364
show	next
show create-table will show you the internal auto_increment value that would be assign to the next inserted row

799375
coalesce	nvl
i ve also tried some equivalent ones recognized in other databases nvl ifnull and coalesce but sqlite doesn t seem to recognize any of them

799375
value	field
unfortunately the database doesn t have default value for all field

799379
icmp	udp
a third advantage of using connected udp sockets is it allows you to receive icmp error messages back to your application such as routing or host unknown due to a crash

for local testing modify configuration environment development.rb

799388
repository	entity
after reviewing the edit to the question the answer sortof is it depends. you can make arguments for both sides--and indeed linq to sql and the entity-framework are both a combination of both reflective inspector using generics and strongly-typed entity classes and other repository classes

799389

your best bet is to get a weekly code review meeting going where you put your code that follows the standards up on the screen and get your colleagues critiques

799392
implements	abstract
create an abstract orderitem class that implements public properties for every data element that you want to bind to in the grid and for every data element that you want to sort the items on

799392

write implementations of those single-valued field that need to extract value from this list

799392

you can try to test the response time and timeout rates if one site is responding slowly or getting you timeout errors you should increase your re-hit interval even though it might not be your crawler causing the slowness or timeouts

799412
installation	environment
copying software certificate files works fine in a test environment but it s a pretty poor security practice for a working product installation

799465
export	csv
i want to export some sql-server 2005 data to csv format comma-separated with quotes

799465
value	field
i ve looked at bcp but i can t figure out how to put the quotes around the fields except concatenation them to the field value which is ugly

799483
export	csv
there you will see options to export to different kinds of formats including csv excel etc

799493
pixels	line
this is a little more tricky than it sounds because you need the mental discipline to think of raster coordinates not as the pixels to be labeled but as the invisible line between them

799493
pixels	line
wherever an edge crosses a raster line toggle all the pixels from there to some arbitrarily chosen x coordinate such as the left edge of the screen

799494

i have never used json and want to find more about it as people keep referring to it as a better version of xml for sending data from client to server

799500
decimal-point	digits
this field has 15 actually 16 digits before the decimal-point and 3 after

799515
json	xml
keep in mind that json and xml are different things as explained in some or the articles linked in that site

799515

but if it s just for sending data usually json is more compact than xml

799518
primitive	boolean
you have objects and arrays and a few primitive datatypes strings numbers boolean and null

799522
external	root
another problem with svn external is that when you do an svn log at the root level you don t see any changes from svn external

799528
genshi	mako
i d suggest using a templates to generate the output you can start with the buildin string.templates or try something fancier for example mako or cheetah genshi jinja kid etc

799528
pylons	django

data-structures	map
this will create two data-structures and put them in a map where the key string is whatever name i gave it in this case sidekick and awesomedude

799558
data-structures	map
i m trying to find the best way to solve this so that i can have my data-structures reference objects that haven t yet been added to the map

799558
data-structures	map
the two easiest solutions that i can think of are a add the ability to forward declare data-structures or b have the parsing read through the file twice once to populate the map with pointers to empty data-structures and a second time to go through and fill them in

799586
substitution	replace
but first i d use multiline strings to replace all those f.write s and string substitution instead of adding strings

799615
moss	wss
remember that even though moss is install on the server it might very well be that only wss features are activated for the sites site collections your code has to work on

799632
webforms	asp.net
i barely got into asp.net webforms when mvc came out and now i m ready to try it out

799637
jquery	.post
for the things you want you can check out jquery s docs for .post for example or ajax load functions

799678
user-controls	ascx
you are probably using a masterpage or user-controls ascx and this is the reason the for client ids change

799678
findcontrol	asp.net
have a look at asp.net 2.0 masterpages and findcontrol

799688

communication	messages
it s capable of being used for both determining whether other instances is already running and communication sending messages

799800
getjson	post
because i failed to post my entire code you guys didn t know that after the within the change event i was doing a getjson so my this i guess was referencing the xhr

static code analysis tools like splint or gimpel pc-lint may help here -- you can even make these moderately preventative by wiring them into your automatic continuous-integration style build-server

799856
javascript	dom
the dom tends to avoid using dashed names as they are not valid javascript identifiers

799859
metaclass	subclass
it d certainly be possible to subclass django s modelbase metaclass and add the functionality you need

799868
javadoc	doxygen
if you use something like doxygen or javadoc you can have whatever output makes sense a pdf book or a hyperlinked searchable website.

799882
capitalize	uppercase
also note that using the set sommand to put the variables in the environment will work as well but nmake automatically capitalize environment variables names even for weird ones like windir which is lowercase in the system for some reason and is case-sensitive so to use the environment variables you must use the variables in uppercase

799902
.doc	xls
and gain from their interfaces if your file types are not supported most comment .document formats are supported directly or but their producer .doc .docx xls pdf etc

799925
json	xml

children	nodes
loading all the data to populate the treeview is very slow so i want to load just the top-level nodes and then fill in the children as the user expands nodes

799949
children	nodes
the problem is if a nodes doesn t have any children it doesn t display the + sign next to the nodes which means it can t be expanded which means i can t

799949
children	nodes
i ve tried an approach where i add a dummy nodes to each nodes and then on expanding check if the dummy nodes is present and remove it then load the children but for various reasons that aren t worth getting into here that solution is not viable in my situation

edit- i m not sure exactly how deterministic my game is so i m not sure the entire game can be pieced together exactly by recording only keystrokes and mouse click

799999
nsmutableurlrequest	nsurlrequest
verify that you actually have a nsmutableurlrequest and not a nsurlrequest at this point

799999
