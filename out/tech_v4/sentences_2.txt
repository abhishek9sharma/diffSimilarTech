installshield	nsis
pattern0	
on windows i prefer nsis from nullsoft only because it s less objectionable than installshield or installanywhere

82634
groovy	java
pattern4	
grails works because we can mix and match groovy with the existing java solutions

84239
distance	polygons
pattern4	
for each vertex in the red polygon compute the distance to each vertex in the blue polygons and find the closest hint compare distance 2 so you don t need the sqrt

84504
javascript	dom
pattern5	
as well an element you give a specific id to can be manipulated via javascript and dom commands - getelementbyid for example

85267
python	perl
pattern4	
i d recommend python or perl

85414
virtualbox	vmware
pattern2	
i ve been using vmware for a while and am very happy with it but i would like to compare it with virtualbox

86325
stderr	stdout
pattern5	
note the abort message will be written to stderr as opposed to puts which will write to stdout

86977
unmanaged	c++-cli
pattern5	
i ve read in nish sivakumar s book c++-cli in action among other places that you should use the __clrcall decorator on function calls to avoid double-thunking in cases where you know that the methods will never be called from unmanaged code

87006
accurev	svn
pattern4	
i ve used svn cvs clearcase base ucm ccc harvest but none of them can beat accurev s strengths

89167
moss	wss
pattern10	
moss is probably less popular because its not free and having used it for a year i don t see as much value in it as wss

90112
webforms	asp.net
pattern5	
initially there was some buzz that url routing is totally decoupled from asp.net mvc and it could be used for webforms

90477
quicksort	mergesort
pattern10	
as many people have noted the average case performance for quicksort is faster than mergesort

90947
expression-blend	wpf
pattern4	
this also means support for wpf with a xaml designer although most people still prefer expression-blend for wpf interfaces

91406
triggers	insert
pattern6	
create a cache table update it on insert using a triggers it s the fastest solution but could be problematic if you have lots of updates to the main table

91888
ref	out
pattern1	
specifically it can be used for variables names that clash with reserved keyword you can t use params but you can use params instead same with out ref any other keyword in the language specifications

92868
json	xml
pattern3	
the back-end doesn t matter much but i do recommend using json as your protocol of choice over xml

95046
joomla	drupal
pattern4	
bottom line joomla tends to look pretty from an administration perspective but drupal tends to outperform joomla and be a more easily customizable system to achieve many of the things you really want out of a cms

95121
64bit	x86
pattern7	
x86 is considerably slower a few clocks plus a clock or so per function argument while 64bit is much less because most function arguments are passed in registers instead of on the stack

97359
python	java
pattern4	
if i had to parse some file i d choose python over java in a blink

99254
webforms	asp.net
pattern8	
imo asp.net mvc is much more dry than webforms

99771
exception-handling	error-handling
pattern10	
exception-handling allows more easilly to separate error-handling of normal behaviour

100698
vbscript	vb.net
pattern7	
if your old site is vbscript it s probably easier to go with vb.net

100978
spring	guice
pattern7	
as for spring i would seriously check if guice is a viable alternative and then try to show how spring guice makes development better and easier

101239
row	col
pattern7	
at best reads as the integer loop counter for the row is less than the max imum number of col umn s

101381
binary	hex
pattern7	
that s one reason why going from hex to binary is much easier than from decimal to binary

101923
oracle	mysql
pattern4	
for a small database i d seriously recommend oracle xe well before mysql

102398
key-value	key
pattern7	
whose key-value is smaller than any other key in the priority-queue

102924
actionscript	mxml
pattern10	
...except that the code generated by the mxml to actionscript conversion is longer as it has to be more general

103591
cursor	row
pattern0	
doing some tests if you connect to a database even with a slow dynamic language like perl and perform some row by row operation on a dataset the speed will still be much greater than a cursor in the database

103711
unsigned-integer	int
pattern6	
given an unsigned int 0 is 0 or 360 degrees and the max 32-bit unsigned-integer 0xffffffff is the biggest value just below 360 degrees

105010
oracle	mysql
pattern10	
a novice but competent dba should be able to secure mysql much more easily than oracle just because oracle is inherently more complex

105287
mstest	nunit
pattern7	
although several codeigniter tools such as teamcodeigniterty have better support for nunit probably would change as mstest becomes more popular

105339
double	int
pattern10	
for floats and double it s more difficult as with plain int as these may or not may be in the host machines byte-order

106826
json	xml
pattern10	
in my opinion json is more human readable than xml and json.net gives the option to write nicely formatted json

107227
bubble-sort	quicksort
pattern0	
when sorting 10 things quicksort is 3 times faster than bubble-sort

107691
perl	awk
pattern5	
most awk one liners can be achieved with perl one liners - if you choose to get into a perl one liner mindset

108949
http	ssl
pattern5	
and because it also detects ssl you wont have to worry about weather your resources will be sent over http or https if you ever add ssl support to your server

110385
any	set
pattern5	
i have a grouping of checkbox that i only want to allow a set amount to be checked at any one time

110453
parallels	vmware
pattern2	
i strongly recommend vmware over parallels as vmware supports 2 virtual cpu s i think it s up to 4 virtual cpu s in v2

112832
cakephp	symfony
pattern1	
on the other hand there are many php frameworks out there such as cakephp symfony and codeigniter that take a load it as you need it approach

113908
display	height
pattern5	
if you call getimage too early your component will not have been display yet and will still have a 0 width and height

115620
google-chrome	firefox
pattern0	
until people have more experience with google-chrome i would think firefox is a better choice

115838
png	gif
pattern7	
as a general rule png is never worse and often better than gif because of superior compression

116010
deployment	install
pattern10	
2 on projects where svn is not install my deployment script is more complex it creates the version.php file locally zips the code uploads and extracts it

116063
mathml	tex
pattern5	
tex can be converted to mathml for browsers which support it thus

116326
opensolaris	solaris
pattern1	
i think it is hard to quantify software compatibility but i d say code written for solaris is quite forward compatible with opensolaris kernel

116767
pbkdf2	hash
pattern7	
a key-stretching algorithm like pbkdf2 applies a quicker hash like sha512 thousands of times typically causing the hash generation to take 1 5 of a second or so

117091
groovy	java
pattern6	
groovy is the best java alternative i ve seen that includes features of dynamic languages including closures run-time class extension etc

118703
javascript	dom
pattern0	
better solution is to construct actual html of future control and then assign it like innerhtml to some placeholder - it allows browser to render it itself which is much faster than any javascript dom manipulations

118740
coding-style	indentation
pattern5	
it seems to have learnt my coding-style or have the options in it for all coding-styles and it picks up what you re using and automatically indentation everything correctly

119414
unit-testing	assertions
pattern8	
my experience is that assertions even if complex and time-consuming traversing the whole free list to check invariants are much less work and are more reliable than unit-testing esp

119751
surf	sift
pattern6	
when using feature descriptors like sift surf - is approximate nearest neighbour the fastest methods to do matching between images
